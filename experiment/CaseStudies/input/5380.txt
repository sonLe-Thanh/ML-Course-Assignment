     The impact of the Imperial College Chemistry Department led research on       solvent effects on east Asian lacquer has been significant and far       reaching.
Impact on the V&amp;A     It allowed accurate risk-benefit analysis that underpinned the use of       solvents for cleaning, removal of degraded Western varnish and       consolidation of the light-damaged surface of Mazarin Chest [A].
Treatments based on this research stabilised this object for an estimated       50-100 years and allowed it to travel to exhibitions in Japan and the USA       in 2008-9, with combined attendances of more than 200,000 (Kyoto National       Museum &gt;67,000; Suntory Museum of Art, Tokyo &gt;36,000; J. Paul Getty       Museum &gt;100,000) [B].
The promotional material for the Getty Museum       visit, 3/3/09-24/5/09, described the conservation treatment as having been       "Backed by thorough scientific and art historical research" [C, p4       of exhibition brochure].
In October 2009 the Chest was returned to       permanent display in the V&amp;A's Toshiba Gallery of Japanese Art to       coincide with the staging of the international conference, `Crossing       Borders: The Conservation, Science and Material Culture of East Asian       Lacquer' [2].
There were around 3,000,000 visitors to the V&amp;A in South       Kensington in both 2012/13 and 2011/12 (the V&amp;A does not count visitor       numbers to individual permanent galleries).
The V&amp;A is home to one of the most significant collections of       Japanese lacquer in any Western collection.
It is also home to smaller       collections of Chinese, Korean, Burmese and Thai lacquer.
The knowledge       and experience gained though the collaboration with Prof Welton and the       Imperial Chemistry Department have been applied to all subsequent       conservation treatments of East Asian lacquer at the V&amp;A [D].
The       beneficiaries of this impact were the V&amp;A and its audiences (UK and       international) through improved preservation and presentation of East       Asian lacquer objects that form part of the UK national art collection.
Impact on the British Museum     The research on the solvent effects on East Asian lacquer has also had an       impact on the conservation department at the British Museum.
The British       Museum has 3,245 objects in its collection that are catalogued as       containing a variety of lacquer, many of which had been waxed or recoated       prior to their donation.
The museum testifies that (i) the "research         undertaken at Imperial College in collaboration with the V&amp;A,         published in East Asian Lacquer: Material Culture, Science and         Conservation in 2011, has been crucially important in outlining the         possible effects of a variety of solvents on these coatings and on the         lacquer", (ii) it has "proved to be an excellent reference point"       and (iii) is always recommended as required reading before students       approach the cleaning of a lacquer object [F].
In conjunction with the       museum's own increased awareness of the material history of their       collections, "the work undertaken at Imperial College in collaboration         with the V&amp;A has changed the way [they] clean East Asian lacquer"       [F].
Impact on UK and international curation and conservation of East Asian         lacquer     Imperial College Chemistry Department undertook a survey of conservators,       curators and scientists in May-June 2013 to assess the impact of Carolyn       McSharry and Prof Welton's research into the solvent effects on East Asian       lacquer [E].
The survey was posted on 11 May 2013 on the Conservation         Distlist, which includes conservators from several specialities,       scientists, curators, archivists, librarians and academics from a number       of disciplines; the survey was also posted on the more specialised Lacquer         Distlist.
Reach of solvent research impact: There were more than 100       respondents of whom 80% identified themselves as curators or conservators       working with East Asian lacquer.
Respondents worked in 17 countries,       though the UK and US predominated.
50% were based in public institutions,       25% in universities and 25% in private practice.
They represented a very       experienced field of experts, with 79% having at least 5 years, and 63%       with more than 10 years of experience in their discipline (i.e.
curation,       conservation, science or teaching) [E].
Significance of solvent research impact:     72% of respondents overall were aware of the Imperial Chemistry       Department's collaborative research on the solvent effects on lacquer.
Within this group:            93% of respondents rated solvent effects on lacquer research as very         important or important to them (68% very important; 25% important).
92% indicated that the research on solvent effects had changed their         understanding of lacquer a lot (47%) or some (45%).
None said their         understanding had not changed at all.
75% said that it had changed their practice a lot (13%) or some (62%)       74% said they use or refer to this research a lot (32%) or some (42%)         when teaching or mentoring       80% recommend the 2011 paper [3] to others (39% a lot; 41% some).
Of the 50% of respondents who worked in public institutions/museums,         100% of the UK respondents and 89% of the international respondents         rated the solvent research as very important or important.
Impact on UK         and international public institutions was substantial for a change in         knowledge (92%); 50% used the research for teaching and mentoring and         88% recommended the research to others.
This impact was reflected in the         conservation of objects held in public institutions &#8212; 89% of UK         institutional respondents involved in the treatment of lacquer objects         said all of their conservation treatments had been influenced by the         solvent effects research, the remaining 11% said up to 2/3 of their         treatments had been influenced.
29% of international institutional         respondents reported that all of their treatments had been influenced         and 41% said that up to 1/3 of their treatments had been influenced.
Respondents were invited to comment on the solvent effects on lacquer       research.
The following is a sample of the comments received:     (i) `The results were eye-opening.
Extremely important research which         will change the way we approach degraded lacquer treatments' and `It         has done so much to influence our thinking about the treatment of         lacquer.
It brought together the different approaches in a discussion         which we can all benefit from' (National Maritime Museum).
(ii) `This is very important and curators need to understand this         process and effect as well' (British Museum).
(iii) `Should be required reading'     Comments such as (i), (ii), and (iii) touch on the legacy impact of the       research.
Although experienced specialist lacquer conservators may have       understood many of the findings already (reflected in the 25% who said       their practice had not changed very much), they had gained this knowledge       through (unpublished) trial and error tests.
As many solvents cause       permanent damage to lacquer, the publication of the article [3] allows all       conservators, regardless of their relative experience, the opportunity to       make informed judgements without the necessity of damaging valuable       objects in the process of gaining empirical knowledge.
Respondents were also invited to comment on the Mazarin Chest project       more generally and the following is a sample of the comments received:     (i) `The project has been very influential in our lacquer research at         the Getty.
The Crossing Borders symposium was exceptional in its breadth         and quality of presentations.
The book is an excellent summary of the         symposium, standing as an important resource for those not fortunate         enough to attend, and is a ready reference for us in our work.
I commend         all of you for having the courage to inquire about the impact that the         project has had on the field, because few institutions dare to take that         type of risk.
In conclusion, I consider the Mazarin chest project to be         a smashing success that sets the bar for other collaborative projects         very high indeed.
I applaud all who have been involved!'
and `I         believe the Mazarin chest conservation project is one of the best and         most influential project in the lacquer conservation field' (Getty         Museum, USA)     (ii) `As noted previously, the project gave validity (in my eyes) to         the use of urushi-based treatments where appropriate (and with         appropriate training) &#8212; no other major museum has published urushi-based         treatments (or possibly undertaken them) so this was a significant         moment in the history of lacquer conservation in the West' (National       Gallery of Victoria, Australia).
(iii) `Japanese conservators have been using methods without thinking         very much.
Mazarin Chest project made us to re-think about these         good-old methods are suitable or not for particular purposes' (Kogei       Sozai Kenkyujo, Japan)     Many of the survey comments also referred very positively to the effort       made by the Imperial/V&amp;A team to publicise and disseminate the       research, including the widely heralded dual language English/Japanese       website for the project [A, B].
