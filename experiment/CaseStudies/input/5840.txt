     As part of the TNMUNDI project, the team organised two cultural events on       `Music and Migration' in Rabat (10-14 November 2008) and Southampton       (12-17 October 2009).
[1] The events involved a range of participants and       audiences, including representatives of cultural institutions (the       Moroccan Ministry of Culture, the Institut Fran&#231;ais-Morocco and the       British Council-Morocco); the music industry (Casablanca-based recording       studio manager and festival organisers); the media (Hit Radio in Rabat,       Chief Editor of Songlines magazine in the UK); infant and primary       schoolchildren (at the Southampton event); and the general public (in       Morocco and the UK).
Their aim was to increase understanding of the       processes of transnational networking amongst migrants, and demonstrate in       practice some of the more positive possibilities of transnational       migration.
At both events, a musicians' residency lasting three days brought       together migrant musicians who had participated in the project's empirical       research, and who also performed in public concerts.
Conferences       consisting of academic papers and round table discussions were open to the       general public.
The event in Rabat comprised 6 artists of Moroccan       background resident in Europe and Morocco, and the final event in       Southampton brought together 15 artists, 7 of Malagasy, and 8 of Algerian       and Moroccan origin.
Kiwan was the principal organiser of the       Rabat event and co-organiser of the Southampton event.
In both Rabat and       Southampton, specially devised concerts were curated by Zafimahaleo       Rasolofondraosolo (known as Dama), a leading musician, politician and       cultural activist from Madagascar who also served as one of the TNMUNDI       project consultants.
The concert in Rabat attracted an audience of       approximately 80-100.
At the Southampton event, two public concerts by       Malagasy and North African musicians each attracted an audience of       approximately 200.
The first was a lunchtime concert featuring the       Madagascar All Stars.
It was followed by a masterclass with the musicians       open to university music students.
The second was an evening concert       showcasing work from the three-day residency between the North African and       Malagasy musicians.
A number of the musicians also took part in workshops       in three infant and junior schools in Southampton and Portsmouth which       involved approximately 90 school children in years 3 and 5.
The TNMUNDI project impacted on civil society because it       influenced the form and content of associations between migrant musicians.
In doing so, it presented an alternative view of migration to the wider,       non-academic public.
It also contributed to continuing personal and       professional development of the artists involved in the residencies.
For       example, the Rabat event created a link between Dama, the London-based       musician Farid Nainia from the Moroccan group Momo, and the Paris-based       group Binobin, which subsequently was reconfirmed in their collaborating       in the final event in Southampton; and the event in Southampton itself       sparked off a new connection between London-based oud player Yazid Fentazi       from Algeria and R&#233;gis Gizavo from Madagascar.
Similarly, since the       Southampton event took place, the Malagasy musicians have gone onto play       again at the Turner Sims Concert Hall and at the Songlines Encounter       Festival.
[2] Furthermore, the Rabat event contributed to the professional       development of one of the musicians involved (Badre Belhachemi) in that it       allowed him to further develop the cultural enterprise, ABSAWT, of       which he is a founding member.
ABSAWT's aim is to promote Moroccan       musicians across Africa, Europe and Canada and the Rabat `Music and       Migration' event which took place as part of the TNMUNDI project is listed       as one of their main public activities on the ABSAWT website.
[3] In       addition, the partnership between the researchers and the Turner Sims       Concert Hall continued and led to a further EU funding bid in 2013       involving Kiwan, Meinhof and the Turner Sims Concert Hall.
Quantitative       indicators of impact are the funding for our cultural events.
The Rabat       event was funded by the British Council, the Institut Fran&#231;ais, the Conseil         de la Communaut&#233; marocaine &#224; l'&#233;tranger and the Fondation Hassan II,       Rabat.
After the Rabat event, the director of the Institut Fran&#231;ais noted       that `In Rabat, the organisation was very professional [...] I attended a       good concert (essentially thanks to the work done by the musicians and       thanks to you'.
[4] For the final event in Southampton, the Arts Council       England provided a grant for the two public concerts at the Turner Sims       Concert Hall.
The TNMUNDI project impacted on cultural life by generating new       ways of thinking that influenced the creative practice of the artists       involved; by creating, inspiring and supporting new forms of musical       expression from them; and by presenting their cultural heritage to       different audiences.
Evidence for this is provided by testimonials from       the musicians and cultural sector professionals involved in both events.
With regards to the Rabat event, one of the Paris-based Moroccan musicians       said: `As artists, we have a tendency to function by instinct and         passion.
Encounters of this type allow us to see things with more         distance and objectivity.
This allows us to move forward in our work         thanks to the experiences of others.'
[5] The co-founder of one of       Africa's largest urban music festivals, Le Boulevard des jeunes         musiciens in Casablanca, observed of the Rabat event that: `It's         very rewarding to stimulate the interest of researchers and academics.
I         realise that our adventure with the Boulevard has become a real societal         phenomenon.
It's also an opportunity to learn about other experiences,         which is very enriching for us.'
[5] Finally, the curator of the       Rabat concert commented that: `The arts are an excellent vector of         communication which go beyond chauvinism and create bonds between people.'
[5] The TNMUNDI's impact on cultural life is further demonstrated by the       following comments from the Turner Sims Concert Hall manager in       Southampton: `The week's activities had an energy and enthusiasm unlike         almost anything else that we present here.
There was a genuine feeling         among the musicians that they wanted to create something different and         meaningful rather than a repeat of what they might have done elsewhere         and this came across on all the occasions I met them.'
[6]     The TNMUNDI project impacted on public discourse by presenting a       very different picture of `the migrant' to researchers, arts and cultural       professionals, public policy representatives and the general public.
The       vast majority of research on migration is socio-economic in character.
Very often, migrants are portrayed by the media and governments as a       source of economic, cultural and social problems for the receiving       society, with migrants often being depicted as victims or fraudulent       (whether they be political exiles, students, economic or postcolonial       migrants).
By focusing on artists in general and musicians in particular,       TNMUNDI demonstrated how migrants have a positive influence on the quality       of life of individuals and communities locally, nationally and       internationally.
Evidence for this impact is demonstrated in the comments       of the Head of Southampton Music Services regarding the Madagascar All       Stars lunchtime concert, held at the Turner Sims Concert Hall: `I         thought the Allstars demonstrated beautifully how music works across         cultures and generations, presenting an ethos of inclusivity and         belonging.'
[6] The impact on public discourse can also be       demonstrated in the following commentary from the moderator of a public       round-table discussion organised as part of the Southampton event,       entitled `Moving music, roots and routes: the artists' view'.
The       moderator, (Co-editor of the Rough Guide to World Music and       Editor-in-Chief of Songlines Magazine, a major UK world music       publication), said: `I've seen a lot of performers from Madagascar, but         I've enjoyed none as much as the Madagascar Allstars who basically came         together thanks to this project.
Great artists, from inside and outside         the country, making totally compelling music together.
The collaboration         with the Moroccans was put together in a few days and had more rough         edges &#8212; which everybody admitted and that was the point.
What was         interesting was the areas in which they met &#8212; often conceptual rather         than musical &#8212; the experience of being an &#233;migr&#233; and of missing your         homeland.
In the Round Table both Moroccan and Malagasy artists spoke of         how they became more Moroccan or Malagasy as a result of being outside         the country.
One of the most moving songs in the concert was when this         was expressed musically in a haunting Moroccan song of nostalgia.
Having         been at the collaborative concert and chairing the discussion I could         see how beneficial the shared experience was for the musicians, but also         for us as the audience of a one-off concert.'
[6] Further confirming       its impact on public discourse, the Southampton event was listed as part       of Southampton city's Black History Month in October 2009.
The aims of       Black History Month are `to promote knowledge of black history and       experience, to disseminate information on positive black contributions, to       heighten confidence and awareness of black people in their cultural       heritage'.
The TNMUNDI Music and Migration Conference was listed in the       Black History Month Guide as an event which contributed to these aims.
[7]     The TNMUNDI project impacted on education by informing and       influencing the education of university students from Morocco, Europe and       North America who participated in the Rabat concert and conference.
The       project also had an educational impact on primary school-age pupils in       Southampton, as the following testimonial regarding a workshop held with       Kiwan and three Moroccan musicians (14/10/2009) demonstrates: `The         children particularly enjoyed handling the instruments as some were         familiar and others totally new to us.
[...] The multi cultural aspect         was an eye opener for our children who have little opportunity to meet         enthusiastic people/musicians from different countries and cultures.'
[6] The workshops fed into the primary pupils' music curriculum and Ludlow       Junior school in particular have continued to build on their international       links following the workshop.
The TNMUNDI project impacted on policymaking at European level.
Kiwan and her colleagues were invited in 2007 by the Directorate General       for Internal Policies of the Union to report on Cultural Diasporas to the       European Parliament.
They produced a 70-page policy document which       discusses and analyses aspects of the TNMUNDI project findings.
[8] Drawing       on her TNMUNDI research on North African cultural diasporas, Kiwan was a       contributing author to this policy report, which was subsequently read by       European Members of Parliament.
