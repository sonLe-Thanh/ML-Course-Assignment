     The research described in section two has had considerable economic and       commercial impact.
A       few examples of the impact that are not affected by confidential       commercial considerations are       described below.
A new business sector       In 1993, Gardner designed, developed and built the first commercial       electronic nose for [text       removed for publication]     [text removed for publication]     These instruments have meant improved quality assurance of food and       beverage; polymers,       plastics, and food packaging; pharmaceutical; tobacco;       chemicals/petrochemicals; as well as in       personal care; health; and environment industries.
Warwick and Alpha MOS developed customised electronic noses that could       overcome challenges       in the identification of complex odours in the absence of a standard       reference or product [11].
The       sensors have been used mainly in the food and drinks industry to identify       taints and malodours (in       coffees, teas, fish, meat, beers, colas and cheeses).
Hundreds of       companies are using Alpha MOS       electronic noses today across the world to design new products, test them       and also monitor       manufacturing processes.
The instruments have enable companies to save       millions of pounds       through reduced using of human panels and reduce product recalls due to       malodours or taints.
Establishment of CCS       Cambridge CMOS Sensors (CCS) &#8212; a spin-off company founded in 2008 by       Gardner with Udrea       and Milne from Cambridge [12] [text removed for publication]     [text removed for publication]     [text removed for publication]     [text removed for publication]     [text removed for publication]     [text removed for publication]     Another demonstration of investment is that CCS is a collaborative       partner [text       removed for publication] in the &#8364;10m EU project Smart Silicon-on-Insulator       Sensing       Systems Operating at High Temperature SOI-HITS, where the goal is to       develop sensors designed       to work in harsh (i.e.
high-temperature, high humidity) environments.
These devices could then be       used in domestic boilers for combustion control (reduced carbon       consumption) as well as inside       engine exhausts.
Awards:       In October 2011, CCS was shortlisted and given a "Highly Commended" award       for the category       Start Up of the Year at the British Engineering Excellence Awards in       recognition of its       achievements [15].
In March 2013, CCS was elected CleanTech Company of the Year at the       Business Weekly Award       2012 event, in recognition of its contribution to a range of sensor       application areas [16].
Gardner was elected Fellow of The Royal Academy of Engineering in       recognition of his       achievements in gas sensors [17] and has served as Vice-President and then       President of the       International Society for Olfaction and Chemical Sensing (ISOCS) [18].
He       is still a director of the       society and a member of its Executive Committee.
