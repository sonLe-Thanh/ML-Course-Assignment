     Developing new concepts in the field of APCVD for application in the         environmental, construction, healthcare and biotechnology sectors,         including:      	         Low E window coatings and Solar Control coatings for energy           efficiency;         "Self" Clean photo-catalytic coating;         Anti-reflection coatings;         TCOs and Interface Layers for photovoltaic thin film cells;         Bacteriocidal coatings for infection transfer suppression.
The EU funded collaborative project (N2P Nano to Production) has a         range of European industrial and academic partners and involved (in the         Biocidal surfaces part of the project) the UK Health Protection Agency         and the University of Salford.
The project is focused on flame assisted         CVD and thermal CVD &#8212; both atmospheric pressure based, passive (dark)         and active (photo-) biocidal properties, including visible wavelength         light enhancement.
Salford and CVD Technologies are collaborating in         developing these systems in applications in hospital and healthcare         settings and incorporating the technology into a patent application.
A primary focus of our work is in the field of thin-film Photovoltaics         (i.e.
the modules which generate electricity from the sun).
APCVD is         widely used for Low E windows (which reduce heat losses through the         glazing).
A second significant area (and more recent) is in "self &#8212;         clean" windows.
These windows are photo-catalytically active and destroy         organics under sunlight via photo-oxidation.
Both applications are         exploited by CVD Technologies Ltd. A recent focus of our research work         has been in exploring lower temperature routes to APCVD using AP plasma         activation (e.g.
coating steels or even plastics).
Commercialising the technology via a spin out company of the         University; CVD           Technologies Ltd.,         which offers an innovative, integrated and client focused approach to         exploiting the technology for its wide application:            Impact results directly from the supporting structure offering full         research and development and a complete vertically-integrated service,         directly from theory through product and process feasibility,         prototyping and design and commissioning of the full production process.
Clients benefit from direct access to research in APCVD, meeting their         requirements from concept to application.
A portfolio of translational         knowledge has been developed through close understanding of client needs         and alignment of product development, which in turn, informs future         research across many application areas.
The supporting structure facilitates companies with product ideas         which may benefit from APCVD technology including feasibility evaluation         and the capacity to accelerate the process and improve quality and value         in the development of products and processes, enabling clients to         exploit APCVD technology within their own markets.
The successful         business strategy of CVD Technologies supports design, cost and supply         of Industrial scale APCVD equipment, or to license the technology for         exploitation.
With a leading international reputation and the development of         strategic industrial partnerships to promote APCVD in a range of         markets, clients access bespoke technology solutions.
CVD Technologies         has secured a share of number of major turnkey APCVD coating line orders         in China to the value of over $10million.
Over 90% of contracts derive from outside the UK with the signing of         several strategic licensing agreements allowing major international         companies such as Stewart Engineering of USA, Akzo-Nobel, and Sisecam of         Turkey to utilise tailored APCVD technology.
CVD Technologies Ltd. employs industrially experienced staff who         provide the `scale up' expertise to link the University research work         with a route to exploitation through the development of a range of         Industrial R&amp;D, prototype and full scale production equipment and         system designs and offers a technology licensing model supported by         equipment design and supply.
The first license was signed with Akzo-Nobel (later Nuon) to develop           an in-line reel-to-reel APCVD system.
A key milestone was the signing of a licence to jointly develop a           Float Glass coating system with Stewart Engineers Inc (USA), launched           in 2008.
A major engineering exercise (being 4 metres wide and           required to operate at up to 700C and run 24 hrs a day, the system           cost (turnkey) is between $7and 20 million (depending on required           capabilities).
CVD Technologies Ltd. is a partner in the turnkey           system project.
The first system was installed in China in 2009/10 and           generated approaching $1million income for CVD Technologies Ltd. with           a margin of around 50%.
CVD Technologies Ltd. has since worked on three further Float lines           in China with Stewart Engineers and are currently working on two in           Turkey and a sixth in Russia                      In parallel with this work, the company has developed processes for         use in the Photovoltaic industry and has signed licences in this area.
A         recent initiative has been the development of an instrument to allow for         in-line monitoring of APCVD coatings as they are manufactured.
