     The research has had impact on public policy design and implementation,       and on civil society       initiatives that challenged and proposed alternatives to neoliberal WSS       policies in Latin America       and Europe.
In terms of reach, it contributed to government efforts across       different national       contexts to raise awareness and promote a better understanding of complex       policy decisions       among implementers and citizen movements.
In terms of significance, it has       raised the quality of       public debate among public sector workers' unions and civil society groups       about the implications       of neoliberal WSS policies and the existence of viable alternatives based       on public-sector       ownership and management of these services.
It supported the elaboration       of strategies,       campaigns and other actions to oppose neoliberal WSS policies, to       republicise privatized WSS,       and to strengthen public-sector management and provision of these       services.
(1) Implementing the National           Basic Sanitation Law in Brazil       This law is a significant achievement of the Lula da Silva government; it       gave back to the public       sector the leading role in financing and organizing essential water and       sanitation services.
The       research contributed directly to the government's work in the       implementation process.
The National Secretariat         of Environmental Sanitation (SNSA) in the Ministry of the Cities,       one of the key actors       behind the law and its implementation, invited Castro to contribute in       supporting the understanding,       take up, and implementation of the law across the country.
In 2009, they       published Perspectives,       a three-volume study that became the prime source of information and support       for policy makers,       experts, practitioners, and other relevant actors implementing the law.
Castro's input was praised       by the SNSA as a `brilliant contribution that this researcher adds to         the contemporary debate over         water and sanitation policy in Brazil' (IMP1).
SNSA's       Director of Institutional Articulation, who is in       charge of the process, stated that:     `Castro's contribution has been fundamental in supporting our task of         clarifying and deepening the         understanding of the principles and guidelines of our public policy,         [...] has been a great support         for us in public debates on these matters, and has contributed to the         defense of our vision of         essential public services.
[...] [The research] has contributed to the         incorporation of international         experiences of water and sanitation policies in the Brazilian debate.
This has been a major         contribution in support of our task of raising awareness among decision         makers, professionals,         elected politicians, public managers, social organizations, among other         actors, about the principles,         objectives and scope of the national policy for the water and sanitation         sector' (IMP2).

(2) Shaping the National           Plan for Basic Sanitation (PLANSAB) in Brazil       The Law required the development of PLANSAB, the main instrument for WSS       policy in Brazil.
PLANSAB was launched in 2011, was subject to public consultation, was       approved by the National       Council of the Cities in June 2013, and is currently awaiting the       signature of President Dilma       Rousseff.
The SNSA invited Castro to make a key contribution to a       seven-volume Overview       (Panorama) of PLANSAB, prepared to support the public consultation.
His chapter is cited by the       editor and most co-authors, who also cite 15 additional publications by       Castro (IMP4).
The author       of Chapter 3 of the study dealing with the `fundamental principles [...]       to understand the future of       basic sanitation in Brazil' recognizes Castro's contribution as one of       their main sources (IMP4).
The SNSA officer in charge of PLANSAB stated:     `[the study] has been used during the process of public consultation         over the Plan's contents,         which involves discussion and approval of the Plan by different         platforms of social participation and         government entities at all levels in the whole country.
The publication         has been a key instrument in         this process, providing conceptual clarification, becoming a reference,         and helping to raise the         quality of the public debate about both the new Law and the Plan.
Prof.         Castro's research has         been one of the central references in the process' (IMP2).

(3) Training, raising awareness, and enhancing public debate in Brazil       The research has contributed to the training of public servants and       members of civil society       organizations, and thus to the enhancement of understanding and public       debate about privatisation       and re-publicisation.
The research introduced an international dimension       into national debates in       Brazil on essential public services, bringing lessons of policy failure       and success that were       unknown to the participants.
This included lessons about the negative       impact of privatization (such       as increasing tariffs with little or no improvement in service quality or       extension of coverage, lack of       compliance with contractual arrangements, heavy costs involving the       cancellation of privatization       contracts) and evidence that in most European countries and the US most       WSS are successfully       run by public, not private companies.
The Director of International       Affairs of the National Association of Municipal Water         and Sanitation Services (ASSEMAE) in Brazil noted how Castro's       research `has been a key and invaluable reference for our activities.
[...] I promoted the regular         participation of Prof. Castro in ASSEMAE's activities, particularly in         the annual assemblies that are         attended by thousands of municipal public managers from around the         country and also from         neighbouring countries [...] to develop the capacities of municipal         public workers through training         activities and informed debate' (IMP5).
ASSEMAE represents       the public water utilities of around       2,000 municipalities in Brazil, where training and debates tend to focus       mostly on technical       management aspects.
The research has made a major contribution to       achieving a more complex       understanding of the relationship between technical and socio-political       aspects of utility       management.
Training activities were organized at the local level by       ASSEMAE's members.
For       example, training organized by the Secretariat of Sanitation of the       Municipality of Recife was       central to raising awareness among public managers and workers about the       implications of       privatization and commodification for the democratic management of WSS in       Recife, and this       included Castro's brokering work enabling Recife to learn from the       Parisian experience of re-       municipalisation (IMP6).
ASSEMAE has re-launched an       anti-privatization campaign in their 2013 Assembly Statement         (Carta de Vit&#243;ria), and Castro's         research findings were given prominence in an         event to support the initiative (IMP7, IMP2, IMP3).
(4) Impacts on civil society organizations internationally in Latin         America and beyond       The research has contributed to campaigns against privatization and for       the re-publicisation of       WSS utilities, and informed initiatives to democratize public WSS, across       Latin America.
It helped       to enhance understanding of neoliberal WSS policies and their alternatives       by providing evidence-based       arguments to defend public provision.
For example, the research informed       the development       of policy guidelines and proposals for Public-Public Partnerships as an       alternative to privatization       and public-private partnerships by the UN Secretary General's Advisory       Board on Water &amp;       Sanitation (UNSGAB), which stated: `from my position as member of the         United Nations Secretary-General's         Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (UNSGAB), I have also counted on         Prof.         Castro's research, notably the work done in his research network         WATERLAT (www.waterlat.org),         to support our work in defense of public operators of water and         sanitation services at the global         level' (IMP5).
The underpinning research informed the       development of policy documentation for       political campaigns by the Inter-American         Network for the Defence of Water and Life (VIDA Network) (IMP8); and Uruguay's         public sector workers union (OSE) (FFOSE) (IMP8).
In Mexico, El       Salvador, Nicaragua and Argentina, the research provided inputs for       training workshops and public       debates organized by institutions including the Heinrich B&#246;ll Foundation       offices for Mexico, Central       America and the Caribbean, and for the Southern Cone, aimed at enhancing       the capacities of       members of NGOs, workers' unions, and other civil society groups for       successful campaigning       (IMP9).
