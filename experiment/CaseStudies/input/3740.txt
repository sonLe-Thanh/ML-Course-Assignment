     The research on collaborative communication between people with dementia       and interaction partners, which led to the development of CIRCA, has       impacted on: i) practitioners and professionals in health care         services, who provide an enhanced quality of service as a result of       CIRCA and specialist training courses designed by the researchers; and ii)         individuals with dementia, who have enhanced quality of life and       well-being, with concomitant benefits for families.
i) Impact on practitioners and professionals in health care services       Astell and Ellis' research has had a positive impact on practitioners and       professional practice through: a) instillation of CIRCA into a broad         range of care home settings, b) the development and delivery of         staff training programmes, c) dissemination of the research to         professionals and practitioners, and d) broader dissemination of         the research to the general public.
a) Instillation of CIRCA into care home settings       CIRCA was initially commercialised in October 2009 through a non-exclusive       licensing agreement between the Universities of St Andrews and Dundee with       Dementia Life, a newly formed company that sold CIRCA to the care       home market.
The licensing agreement was terminated in December 2010 and       the research team established a new company, CIRCA Connect (http://www.circaconnect.co.uk).
In total, CIRCA units have been installed into 46 care home and         dementia care organisations around the UK; more specifically, the       system has been adopted by 12 NHS/Council-run residential care homes         or care centres (e.g., Argyl and Bute Council, Camden Council,       Gloustershire NHS Foundation Trust, South London and Maudsley NHS       Foundation Trust), 25 private residential care homes (e.g.,       Sanctuary Care) and 9 charity/not-for-profit day-care centres or         residential homes (e.g., Age Concern, Alzheimer's Scotland)       (Supporting evidence, S1).
In March 2013, the researchers signed a       marketing agreement with Paul James Contracts Ltd to supply CIRCA       direct to care homes.
b) Staff training programme In May 2012, Astell and       Ellis launched a skills-based staff training programme, Dementia GOLD,       which they designed for professional caregivers of people with dementia.
The training programme is based on their research findings and extensive       hands-on experience of communicating with dementia sufferers.
The training       programme has already been adopted both in the UK (six trainees, Partridge       House Care Home, Anchor Trust, Brighton, 2012; S6) and in mainland       Europe (nineteen trainees, Compassion Alzheimer, Bulgaria, a       non-governmental support organisation, 2012; S2).
The CEO of the       organisation in Bulgaria has stated that:     `The training has helped the most in creating relationships based on         caregivers' tolerance which has ... influenced the wellbeing of people         with dementia', and the training `has also helped the         relationships among caregivers to become stronger, caregivers became         more sensitive not only towards their clients but towards each other.'
(S2) 	   	   	  	       c) Caregiver education Since 2008, Astell and Ellis       have given numerous invited talks on their research at practitioner       conferences and have spoken at events for family carers and medics, e.g.,       Intensive Interaction Annual Conference, Leeds (2010); Scottish         Caring and Dementia Congress, Edinburgh (2011); Dementia         Services Information and Development Centre, St James's Hospital,       Dublin (2011) (S7).
Since 2012, CIRCA has been on display in the         Design and Technology Suite at the Dementia Services Development         Centre in Stirling, as an example of technology that can improve the       lives of people with dementia, and this Centre receives an average of 200       visitors per month (S3).
Astell and Ellis have also written       articles for publications aimed at practitioners (e.g., S8).
d) Broader dissemination Further evidence of impact       can be seen in the media coverage that the research has attracted both at       home and abroad as an aid for families and dementia care providers.
The       research has been disseminated by news and technology broadcasters (e.g.,       BBC, S9), and the researchers have given public talks and engaged       in public debates, e.g., Alzheimer's Public Debate, Ninewells       Hospital, Dundee, 2011 (S4).
ii) Impact on quality of life and well-being of people with dementia       The impact of CIRCA on the quality of life and well-being of people with       dementia and their families is summed up in the following quote from the       Unit Manager of a residential care home, which states that CIRCA has:     `helped to restore a sense of dignity and respect to some of our         frailest people.
They are able to interact more confidently with their         loved ones and staff as past experiences and memories are un-locked.
It         is heartening to observe what appears to be an improvement in         self-confidence after sessions with the system' (S5),     and `the ability to converse with other residents and their families         is improved after using CIRCA', and that CIRCA is a `useful tool         which can help open up conversations and enable [people with dementia]         to interact with their loved ones much more freely.
This contributes to         making visits a much more positive and fulfilling experience for all.'
(S5)     For both people with dementia and their caregivers, the benefits of       enhanced training are nicely summed up as follows: `To see residents         using it suddenly come alive, and find their own words to express         themselves and share memories, is such a reward, for both the carers who         want to make conversation and help [people with dementia] to have a         better life, and of course their relatives - as they can see them come         back to being more like their old selves.'
