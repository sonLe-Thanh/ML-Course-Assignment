     Pathways to Impact     The pathway to impact began with Thomas' PhD on innovation in regulated       water utility sectors       (1998-2002) and a subsequent book (2005) that enabled him to win       competitive UKWIR funding       (2006) to research barriers to innovation across the whole UK water       sector.
This 2006 research for       UKWIR provided a novel evidence base about UK water sector innovation       characteristics and       capacity [5.1,5.4].
It was soon read and cited by high-level water       stakeholders (2006-2007: Ofwat;       House of Lords science and technology committee; Lord Sainsbury/HM       Treasury; Defra/DTI       Environmental Innovations Advisory Group; Commission on         Environmental Markets and Economic         Performance) [5.2,5.3] adding to Defra/HM Treasury pressures for the       upcoming independent       Cave Review of the water sector, scheduled to address only `competition',       to be expanded to       include also `innovation'.
UK Impact 2008-2009     Thomas gave evidence to the Cave Review (2008-2009).
Professor Cave and       his team examined       the 2006 research findings `in detail', appreciating this novel evidence       base in an area where little       other research was available [5.4]: "I can say that we examined Dr         Thomas' research in detail and         found it useful to inform some of our Review's recommendations to         Government"     During 2007-2009 the All Party Parliamentary Water Group invited Thomas       to present his       research evidence and to discuss policy reform (e.g.
Inquiry into the         Future of the UK Water         Sector, April 2008).
In 2009 the Prime Minister's highest       independent strategic advisory body on       cross-departmental science and technology (Council for Science and       Technology) invited Thomas       to discuss his research evidence (see Improving Innovation in the         Water Industry) [5.5].
Thomas       also presented at over 10 high-level UK industry panels and policy events.
UK Impact 2010-2012     In 2010 the Coalition pledged to consider the Cave Review findings, and       as part of the 2011 Gray       Review of Ofwat [5.6] concluded water sector regulation had to account for       its effect on water       sector innovation, thus aligning with Thomas' research findings.
A new       Water White Paper was       published in 2011 [5.7] with sections on innovation within its 20-year       forward strategy that echoed       Thomas' research insights (e.g.
`key role' for water companies and the       `lack of co-ordination' in the       sector that called for a united vision, p.93) and the subsequent 2012       Draft Water Bill's mentioned       innovation [5.8] (e.g.
the need for `market reform and regulatory       mechanisms in driving       improvement and innovation in the industry', p.5).
Thomas understood Ofwat should play a key role in implementing policy       reform, having identified       their practices as a key influence on water sector innovation in his 2006       research.
This would       include not only design of incentives but also how to accommodate 15-25       year timescales for       successful innovations, uncovered by his 2006 research, within Ofwat's       five-year regulatory cycles.
Ofwat's Director of Strategy, in charge of Ofwat's response to the Gray       Review, indeed sought out       Thomas' research insights to help with this process, after he heard Thomas       discuss innovation       aspects of the Water White Paper on a 2012 All Party Parliamentary Water       Group panel [5.10]: "It         is fair to say the research of Dr Thomas helped us to formulate ideas         about the pros and cons of         different innovation incentive practices and options, so helped our         on-going policy and strategy         development."
Thomas was invited to meet personally with both the Director of Strategy       and Head of Policy       Development, and to join Ofwat's Future Regulation Advisory Panel, to       advise on the reform       process [5.9].
He was further invited to smaller Panel roundtables       specifically on innovation, his       research insights on innovation in the water sector were taken by the       Director of Strategy to       several key meetings of the Ofwat Board, and he debated policy for       innovation with Ofwat's Chief       Executive on national BBC Radio 4 (Ofwat conceded `the real challenge' was       for the water sector       `to become more innovative in terms of how it delivers for its       customers', Radio 4, You &amp; Yours, 7       June 2012).
Generally a more pro-innovation stance in the UK water sector emerged       during this impact period       as the impact of Thomas' evidence base diffused into various policy and       industry developments.
A       high-level Water Sector Innovation Leadership Group and Water UK       Innovation Forum were       formed.
The Technology Strategy Board funded a &#163;3.5 million water       innovation platform in 2012;       with the editors of international trade journal Utility Week       approaching Thomas to write an article in       response to it.
UKWIR was able to use the evidence base provided by the       2006 research to gain       water industry subscriber support for key follow-on projects (A Road         Map of Strategic R&amp;D Needs         to 2030 [2007], UK Water Innovation: Which Way Forward in         Europe?
[2010], Research and         Innovation in the UK Water Industry [2011] and Research and         Innovation Mapping Study for the         UK Water Research and Innovation Framework [2011]).
Thomas continued       to inform reform       processes through invited attendance at events (e.g.
national water policy       conferences Future       Water 2012 and 2013; WRc Open Innovation Day 2012) and via his dedicated       water blog       (waterstink.com) read by various key UK water stakeholders.
European Impact     Thomas' 2006 research also had impact at European level.
The former UKWIR       Director presented       it to the newly formed, high-level European Innovation Partnership on       water in 2012.
This DG       Environment sponsored group of key EU water stakeholders, chaired by       Environmental       Commissioner Janez Poto&#269;nik, used the research to inform their strategic       thinking about the       European water sector and innovation [5.1].
Thomas was then invited in May       2013 to an expert       panel in Brussels to discuss with representatives of the Partnership how       to revise regulatory impact       assessment methodology to incentivise better water innovation.
In his role       as European Water       supply and Sanitation Technology Platform President (until 2012) the UKWIR       Director also       presented the research to the EC WssTP (2004-) to ensure it would address       the barriers to       innovation identified by Thomas' research [5.1]: "I can say that it         definitely played a part in the         group's strategic thinking and that part of the remit of the WssTP that         I chaired was to de-risk water         sector innovation so as to overcome some of the key barriers identified         in your Barriers to         Innovation research."
