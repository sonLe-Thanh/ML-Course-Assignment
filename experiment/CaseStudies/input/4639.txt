     Research conducted at Bristol between 1994 and 2013 has led to commercial       impact through industry investment in new areas of research and       development as well as investment in clinical trials.
AstraZeneca and Cancer Research UK takes MCT1 inhibitor to clinical         trial     The global biopharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, originally discovered       MCT inhibitors in a research programme targeted at developing novel       immunosuppressive agents.
However, the "extensive and seminal work"       conducted at Bristol, which increased AstraZeneca's understanding of the       pharmacology of these agents had a "major impact on their drug         development programme focussed on potent and novel MCT1 inhibitors"       [a].
The research in Bristol has helped AstraZeneca realise their       potential as chemotherapeutic agents and this has led to a major drug       discovery programme to develop the field, assisted by "our ongoing         collaborations in understanding the pharmacology of these novel         inhibitors" [a].
In 2010, Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca reached       an agreement to take the compound AZD3965, which targets MCT1, into       clinical trial [b].
Recruitment for Phase I trials began in February 2013       [c].
AstraZeneca also filed an international patent in 2010 for the novel       method of cancer treatment that inhibits lactate transport by MCTs [d].
Research on MCT4 leads to investment in a new drug discovery programme     In addition, Halestrap's work showing MCT4 is up-regulated in response to       hypoxia through transcriptional regulation by HIF-1&#945; [2] has had "particular         significance for cancer chemotherapy" [e].
It has led AstraZeneca to       "initiate a new drug discovery programme directed towards identifying         MCT4 specific inhibitors and to extend our collaboration with [Professor         Halestrap] to understand this anticancer treatment paradigm" [a].
Though AstraZeneca's specific investment into this research area is       commercially sensitive information, their overall investment into research       and development is over US$ 4 billion annually and they have around 15,700       people employed in this sector across 14 centres in 8 countries [a].
In       2012, sales in oncology drugs were valued at US$3,489 million [f, pg 50].
Their investment in the new MCT4 inhibitor drug discovery programme is       based on their assessment that "these inhibitors have the potential to         provide a potent therapeutic strategy against aggressive cancers"       [a].
Others in pharmaceutical industry invest in MCT inhibitors     At this point in time, it is not possible to evidence the investment by       other pharmaceutical companies in this area of research as it has not yet       been released into the public domain.
However, in 2012, Pfizer Worldwide       Research and Development gave an oral presentation stating that Pfizer is       exploring MCT-1 and MCT-4 as "therapeutic strategies against malignant         tumours" [g].
As well, the National Institutes of Health - the       national medical research agency in the U.S. - awarded US$ 3.85 million to       Scripps Research Institute Scientists to develop a "new generation of         broad spectrum anti-cancer therapeutics", which target MCT1 and MCT4       [h].
