     Within the UK Physics community Donald has a unique breadth of expertise       in biological physics, which made her a natural choice to be the inaugural       chair of the IOP's Biological Physics Group.
This group was set up when       the IOP felt, in the wake of the EPSRC International Review of Physics       (2005) and the Wakeham Review (in 2008), that it was desirable that the       growing UK community in this field was appropriately reflected within the       Institute's groups.
For the same reason &#8212; and also as a natural       consequence of these two reports &#8212; when the IOP raised money from its       resources (around &#163;70k has so far been injected into the project) to       initiate the preparation of teaching material to broaden the undergraduate       curriculum in the UK, they invited Donald to take the lead in oversight of       the project as Project Director.
This is part of their desire to see       biological physics fully recognized within the undergraduate provision of       Physics Departments as part of teaching best practice.
The aim of the project is to produce material to facilitate the       introduction of the topic of Biological Physics into the undergraduate       curriculum, particularly for those departments which lack specific       expertise in the field on their staff.
Starting in 2009, when the IOP       first approached Donald to put together a team of writers to create a body       of work, Donald and Cicuta have been involved in the production of       material.
All the material now on the website has been checked and       overseen by Donald.
There is now a significant body of new material which       has been uploaded onto the IOP's dedicated site.
All of the material       currently available is free to anyone who registers, from anywhere in the       world (1).
To date, the site has been visited more than 25,000 times, with       more than 8000 unique visitors and an average of 1100 page visits per       month.
The logic for producing this material was based on the comments in the       Wakeham Review which stated:     - `it is essential that students continue to be exposed to areas of         the subject which are particularly applicable in the 21st       century such as biophysics/medicine....     - physics students in many departments get regrettably little         exposure, if any, to modern soft matter physics and biophysics.'
The IOP took the lead in trying to change this situation by committing       &#163;70k to this project, having established &#8212; through a questionnaire sent to       all heads of physics departments in the UK &#8212; that there was an unmet need       that academics felt could be addressed by the preparation of suitable       material.
Responses to the question as to whether departments thought such       material would be useful included (15 Physics Departments responded) 1) `We         would welcome suggestions for how biological physics could be used to         enrich the physics syllabus.
There are many biological examples that         could be used to teach core physics while introducing the idea that         physicists can contribute to the life sciences.'
2) `Any         assistance in the development of material would be appreciated.'
3)       `Yes, we could well be interested &#8212; we would certainly be more         interested in teaching such a course if the IOP could make course         materials available to us, as we do not have substantial staff expertise         in this area'.
These responses indicated a clear enthusiasm for the       project to go ahead.
Donald was involved in the project from the outset,       assisted by a project management team who collectively made decisions on       the topics to be covered and the authors to be invited to write each       contribution.
Plans were sufficiently far advanced that in May 2011 a launch meeting       was held, although at that time few lectures were actually available       online (the IOP and IOPP &#8212; the Publishing arm of the IOP- have taken       charge of all preparation of material to make web-ready).
The launch was       attended by around 40 people (including heads of departments) from       different departments within the UK.
Donald described both the project and       the launch on her blog and has subsequently promoted the projects through       articles in the Guardian and on the IOP's own website.
The online lectures- written by about half a dozen carefully chosen       individuals from within the UK &#8212; have been viewed over 13,700 times.
With       her expertise in polysaccharides, Donald contributed the lecture on       polysaccharides which has received 2399 individual page visits, as well as       the introduction and overview; Cicuta wrote 6 lectures on thermodynamics       and lipids which have in total received 4877 individual page visits.
The       lectures, comprising PowerPoint presentations, text, references and model       questions with solutions, are designed to be used in a variety of ways as       part of the philosophy of making the material as useful as possible to       departments: some simply want examples that can be added in to existing       lecture courses to make it easier to incorporate some basic material into       their curriculum, others want to introduce whole modules.
Which route each       department takes depends on their course structure and the expertise they       have on their teaching staff.
The aim is to make sure that all UK       departments introduce some material into their teaching, although       currently the IOP have ruled out making any of the material a formal       requirement of departmental accreditation, because that would take a long       time to put into practice.
Within 6 months of launch there were an average number of over 1000 hits       per month, with North America having the largest traffic, followed by       Northern Europe (including the UK) and Southern Asia.
Thus, although the       project was designed with UK academia in mind, it is clearly reaching far       beyond this initial target audience.
Already it is clear that more departments are introducing this topic into       their courses, either simply prompted by the very clear message the IOP is       giving out, or actually using the material being produced.
For instance,       in both Durham and Bristol new courses in biophysics/biological physics       are being constructed which are accessing the concepts and material on the       website.
In Manchester, where there is a course in the 1st year       but it precedes student exposure to thermodynamics, the course lecturer       said `During the last semester I directed the students in our first         year course on biological physics to look at the IOP web site during the         first lecture.
Most of the lecture material is probably too hard for our         first year (they do not cover the 2nd law of thermodynamics until second         year), but they will profit from some of the videos and it is good to         establish in their minds that biological physics is 'real physics' at an         early stage.'
The comment from Bristol was 'First of all, what         an incredible resource!
I feel like I've only just skimmed the surface         of it, as every time I look at the notes, I find something else that is         useful!....As this is my first time developing a lecture course from         scratch, I was pretty overwhelmed.
What the biological physics pages         have done is given me confidence that a) I'm teaching the right things         (as most of the syllabus I came up with on my own is covered by these         lectures) and b) I have the foundations of a series of lectures that I         can personalise with examples of my own... thank you (and to all         involved) for doing these!
It's taken a huge amount of stress away from         me and has actually turned a job I was dreading into a slightly more         manageable task!
Other universities have reported using the site       `for inspiration' as to what to include, and as a source of figures to       insert into their lectures.
To date 5 universities have confirmed they are       utilising the material in some form or other (Nottingham, Durham, Surrey,       Manchester and Bristol) and Hull has indicated they will as soon as an       appropriate course is rewritten.
