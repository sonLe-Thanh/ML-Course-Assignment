     The underpinning research elucidated physical mechanisms by which       viscosity radically alters the       flagellar waveform, internal energy transport requirements, and resulting       cell trajectory.
This means       that experimental work in the highly active field of sperm chemotaxis       (chemical guidance to the       egg) and also metabolic studies can only be interpreted accurately if       physiological viscosity fluids       are used.
The research also provided mathematically-based computer codes       with which flow fields       and cell trajectories resulting from observed cell shapes, waveforms and       surface interactions can       be computed and visualised, the results of which have challenged       intuitions regarding the fluid       mechanics of motility based on inaccurate analogies in macroscale flow.
Taken together, these       findings have had a distinct and material impact on practices in clinical       science.
This impact has       occurred in a short time-frame, following the first publications of the       research in 2009 (relative to       typical lab-to-bedside timescales of the order of 10-20 years).
In more       detail:     4.1 Clinical perspectives and training     Despite the relatively short time-frame since 2009, the work is impacting       the medical science       perspectives of world-leading laboratories by changing the focus of their       work.
Prof. David       Clapham, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Harvard University, a       pre-eminent figure in       biomedicine, states: `Spermatozoa are short-lived mechanically driven         cells and their biology is         dominated by low Reynolds number fluid mechanics.
Biologists without the         training of Dr. Smith         naturally have poor insight and understanding of mechanical forces on         the microscopic scale...
Without such collaborations across fields of expertise, the field will         stall, and worse, go in the         wrong direction due to misinterpretation of data... [Kirkman-Brown and         Smith] have made         remarkable inroads in areas of sperm research.
I refer to your work         often to understand the         problems we are approaching in sperm biology.
In particular, [Smith]         helped us a great deal in         understanding microscopic mechanics for our 2013 paper in Current         Biology (Miki K and Clapham         DE.
2013.
Rheotaxis Guides Mammalian Sperm)...' [S8] The latter       study exemplifies fluid dynamics       of cell motility, a new addition to a group specialising in cell       electrophysiology.
The influence on clinicians' perspectives is also evidenced from a paper       by the clinical group led by       Prof. Chris Barratt (Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee) which       give the following       corroboration `...experiments modelling and examining sperm behaviour         in these physiologically         relevant environments are essential for obtaining an accurate analysis,         as recently demonstrated         by Smith and colleagues' &#8212; Barratt, Kay &amp; Oxenham, J.
Biol.,       8:63, 2009.
The clinical science journal Molecular Human Reproduction, a       publication which generally focuses       on biochemical and molecular processes, summarised the concepts described       above, with a       mathematical modelling image from Smith and Kirkman-Brown being chosen to       illustrate the       journal front cover in a special issue on sperm motility published in       August 2011.
Members of the ChRS team have disseminated these findings at meetings for       clinical scientists       internationally, including the following invited oral presentations,       growing from more specialist       meetings in 2009 to major international conferences in 2011 and 2013.
2009: International Symposium of Advanced Research Progress in         Reproductive Medicine,         Changzhou Women and Children's Health Hospital, China [S1], Maternal         Communication         with Gametes and Embryo COST Meeting, Alghero, Sardinia, Italy (convened         by Dr Alireza         Fazeli, a leading figure in British Andrology) [S10].
2011: Gordon Research Conference on Fertilization and Activation of         Development, NH,         USA (an internationally-leading meeting for specialists in the field)         [S2], 1st International         CAESAR Conference on Sperm Signaling and Motility, Bonn, Germany         (including leaders         such as Profs.
U.B.
Kaupp, D. Clapham and M. Eisenbach).
2013: Society for Reproduction and Fertility Annual Conference,         Cambridge, UK, Society         for the Study of Reproduction Annual Meeting, Montreal, Canada.
The work has further impacted the training of clinical and research       scientists through Dr Kirkman-Brown's       teaching, for example at Frontiers in Reproduction, the       internationally-renowned six week       residential course at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole,       Massachusetts.
Each year this       course trains 20 future leaders in reproduction; without the underpinning       research, this strand of       thinking would not have been part of the curriculum.
Kirkman-Brown continues to bring the awareness of these ideas to his work       as British Andrology       Society Secretary, and UK host for the Basic Semen Analysis course       affiliated to the European       Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.
Finally, studies at BWH are underway applying the model to test motility       drugs.
A manuscript on the       energetic effects of the drug 4-aminopyridine is in preparation.
The       mathematical approach       developed allows calculation of energy expenditure and transport in the       flagellum, quantifying how       the metabolism of the cell is modified under drug stimulation.
4.2 Grant funding for the ChRS clinical research laboratory at       Birmingham Women's Hospital     The research has brought two major grants to the ChRS labs at Birmingham       Women's Hospital       (MRC &#163;379K and STFC &#163;176K), allowing the laboratory to be equipped with       imaging equipment       for sperm motility research, including a high speed camera and an optical       splitting device       (designed by Dr Kirkman-Brown in collaboration with SME CAIRN Research       Ltd; for the work see       4.4 ).
The underpinning research motivated a sub-project as part of a much       larger successful bid       `Experimental Medicine Network of Excellence' to Advantage West Midlands       (the former regional       development agency).
The Reproductive Medicine project brings       approximately &#163;278K of       infrastructure to ChRS.
The new equipment (`BAMBI') allows high-throughput       screening of       samples, tracking and imaging of live cells, and precise spatial and       temporal control of photo-releasable       hormones and pharmacological agents [S9].
Combined with the fluid dynamic knowledge of the effect of viscosity on       motility and chemical       dispersion, these capabilities mean that Birmingham Women's Hospital now       has a system       unrivalled in the UK through which motility dysfunction and new therapies       can be investigated.
BAMBI is currently being used to trial a new potential motility drug       `Omega'.
4.3 Public awareness and behaviour     Findings have fed into ChRS TV work, including an episode of the 2008 BBC       TV Series Don't Die         Young on the Male Reproductive Organs [S4], designed to raise       awareness of the challenge faced       by sperm, and consequent need for men to be aware of the effect of poor       lifestyle and prevalence       of subfertility.
These ideas also contributed to an       internationally-screened 2009 TV programme The         Great Sperm Race (Channel 4 and Discovery Channel) [S3].
Finally,       work from refs.
R4, R5 have       received press attention internationally [for example, S5].
Dr Smith has       drawn on this research in       public engagement activities he has led including a `Meet the Scientist'       presentation at Birmingham       thinktank (February 2010) and talks for local school children       interested in STEM subjects, including       the 2010 British Science Festival.
4.4 Commercial impact     The imaging device, referred to in 4.2, and designed by Dr Kirkman-Brown       in conjunction with       CAIRN Research Ltd, is now marketed by the company as the Optosplit III       Image Splitter, a 3-way       image splitter as a device for dividing an image into either one, two or       three separate, spatially       equivalent components which can be displayed side by side on a single       camera chip.
This device       has generated around &#163;50K of sales for CAIRN, in addition to prompting       further independent       developments by the company, including a 4-way image splitter.
