     The realisation that this was a significant platform technology with       applications in multiple domains led to the formation of the spin-out       company Oxford RF Sensors in September 2004.
Oxford RF Sensors was renamed       Salunda in 2013 to reflect a new business strategy in oilfield       applications.
During the assessment period, January 2008 to July 2013,       Salunda employed an average of 14 people.
The company's business model, to exploit this invention in novel sensing       devices, has been underpinned by an exclusive licence to the patents.
Salunda summarise the contribution from the research in this way:     "The research conducted by Prof Gregg and his collaborators at the         Department of Physics has become the core technology at Salunda, without         which the company would not have been formed and none of these projects         would have been possible."
[A]     Approximately 90% of Salunda's revenues during the assessment period came       from the development of bespoke sensors for clients in the road transport,       aerospace and oil and gas industries.
A further &#163;336k revenue came from       sales of two fully-manufactured products that Salunda (as Oxford RF       Sensors) had developed and commercialised.
The impact of these devices       spans two main areas, reflecting their ability to detect either position       or &#8212; if measuring at a pre-determined position &#8212; composition, both through       changes in susceptibility within a given volume around the device.
Salunda       explain, "the ability to provide non-contact sensors that can work in         extremely harsh environments has been a major competitive advantage and         this core technology arose directly from Prof Gregg's contribution"       [A].
Position and speed sensors     An aftermarket speed sensor for turbine blades in automotive turbo       chargers was developed and manufactured for the market-leading supplier       [text removed for publication].
This allows the rotational speed of       turbine blades to be measured, without having to attach any physical       target to a blade, so that performance can be more accurately monitored.
In turn, this allows the speed to be controlled to stay within design       limits, preventing damage or reduction in performance.
This device was       launched in 2007 as the Turbocharger Speed Sensor TS-180.
The primary       market for these devices has been motorsport, particularly rally car       racing, and several hundred are now in use by racing teams.
In a major project, worth &#163;2.35m in revenue to Salunda between 2008 and       July 2013 [A], sensors were developed for a major aircraft engine       manufacturer [text removed for publication].
These sensors measured tip       clearance and speed in the intense environment of commercial jet engines       that operate at temperatures in excess of 1000&#176;C. Another R&amp;D project       developed position sensing of piston and spool in rock drills, for a       leading supplier of construction equipment [text removed for       publication].
Analysis of fuel content and level     Salunda developed a hand-held sampling device that uses the sensor       technology to measure the biofuel content and contamination of biodiesel,       in collaboration with [text removed for publication], a top-tier supplier       of parts to the automotive industry.
It measured composition against the       EN590 standard for automotive diesel fuel in Europe, which permits up to       7% biodiesel.
The product was marketed from 2010 as the Delphi YTD533       Diesel Analyser Kit and was nominated for the 2011 Equip Auto Innovation       Awards [B].
Over 550 of these products have been sold since their launch       [A], for uses including the following:            To address a critical issue in the haulage industry, where fuels may         come from a variety of different sources and significantly affect engine         performance and maintenance.
The ability to sample fuel content         immediately using unskilled labour removes the need for laboratory based         sample analysis.
Control of this issue also leads to considerably         improved air quality and the reduction of harmful emissions.
To give easier diagnostics of problems with diesel engines by enabling         checks of diesel composition.
Since only a small sample volume (46ml) is         required, measurements can be taken from different parts of the fuel         system to identify where any contamination occurs.
For example, a case         study in an industry publication (sponsored in part by the supplier)         quoted one garage owner investigating warranty claims:          "Using the fuel analyser, we were able to quickly and easily identify         the fuel in the system did not meet EN590 and consequently was the         likely cause of defect.
Not only did it save our company lost earnings         in un-claimable labour hours, but reaffirmed the quality of our repair         and reputation."
[C]     A number of commercial garages and workshops advertise this facility to       their customers, including a depot in Bristol who describe that "unlike         most other fuel testing services, this is fast and efficient enough to         determine warranty stipulations" [D] and another in Nottingham who       identify an advantage in getting "immediate and accurate results         without the need to send samples to a specialist laboratory for         analysis, saving both time and money" [E].
Revenue to Salunda also arose through development projects for other       clients [A], including            Condition monitoring of the AdBlue diesel additive in trucks for a         manufacturer of car and truck components [text removed for         publication]       Measurement of dissolved or entrained gas content and hydraulic fluid         levels in landing gear for an aircraft manufacturer [text removed for         publication]       Measurement of aviation fuel levels and detection and quantification         of water in fuel, for a `Tier One' supplier to the aviation and         automotive industries [text removed for publication]          Investment attracted     In July 2013, Salunda raised substantial further investment to develop       sensors for oilfield applications, having already established       collaborations with leading suppliers of oilfield services and       technologies (such as) [text removed for publication].
