     Pioneering research led by Asenov and the Device Modelling Group has had       major impacts on the global semiconductor industry by (i) developing       understanding and awareness of the challenge of statistical variability;       and (ii) providing economic impacts through the development of a novel       software toolchain commercialised through spin-out company Gold Standard       Simulations.
Developing understanding and awareness of the challenge of statistical         variability       When Asenov first discussed the issue of statistical variability with the       global semiconductor industry in the late 1990s, it was generally believed       that transistors were sufficiently large that this would not affect       performance.
However, the drive for miniaturisation of semiconductor       devices has revealed that statistical variability is absolutely critical       to the performance of silicon chips.
Asenov was the first to       systematically explore the problem of statistical variability and the       ramifications for the world's electronics industry.
His findings and       opinions expressed through invited talks at international conferences (66       appearances since 2008), training courses run in Silicon Valley, key       professional journals and the media have shaped understanding and       awareness and have influenced practices in the $300 billion per year       semiconductor industry.
Providing economic impacts through the development of a novel software         toolchain       Asenov's Device Modelling Group developed one of the first integrated       simulators of variability for Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor       (CMOS) devices and processes, building a unique variability simulation       software toolchain.
From 2007-12 Asenov's EPSRC funded research was       closely aligned to industry demands (collaborators included key figures in       the semiconductor industry, such as STMicroelectronics, Infineon and NXP).
Working with Synopsis Inc he developed interfaces for the Glasgow       simulation tools.
Asenov and Millar joined Gold Standard Simulations (GSS) as CEO       and COO when it was spun out of the University of Glasgow in 2010 with       support from Scottish Enterprise and EPSRC.
The EU Electronic Numerical       Integrator And Computer (ENIAC) project `Modelling and Design of Reliable       process variation-aware nanoelectronic devices, circuits and systems'       (2009-12) was the catalyst for the formation GSS as a vehicle to       commercially deliver simulation tools to ENIAC partners.
GSS is the first       and only company to provide a fully integrated service and toolchain       allowing device/circuit co-design and assessment of contemporary and       future CMOS technology options.
GSS employs 8 people and in 2012-13       secured $1m in revenue.
GSS have licenced their tools to major foundries       and have evaluation licences in place with others.
In 2010 IBM engaged with GSS to investigate the `shape' of the next       FinFET (14nm) generation CMOS technology.
A Senior Researcher at IBM       stated:     "GSS and University researchers developed a range of memory device         scenarios, promptly rejecting low yield designs, and avoiding the time         and expense of trying numerous memory topologies in hardware.
This         project saved at least one year in the memory development process, which         is quite a significant part of the 3-5 year technology development         cycle.
The results of the pathfinding work that IBM has done with GSS         will naturally be shared with and directly benefit IBM's technology         platform partners like Samsung and Global Foundries.
Globally investment         in semiconductor R&amp;D is reducing so it is important that Prof.         Asenov continues to blaze a trail to allow the few companies moving         forward to the next semiconductor node to be able to continue their         efforts.
The biggest indicator of the benefits of the GSS expertise and         tools is that IBM is undertaking an assessment of the tools with a view         to licensing the GSS technology."
The GSS expertise and toolset is allowing integrated device       manufacturers, foundries and fabless design companies across Europe, the       Far East and the USA to gain significant competitive advantage over their       competitors by reducing time to market, avoiding overdesign, increasing       yield and de-risking the expensive chip design process.
GSS tools provide       designers with the benefit of `seeing into the future' to determine which       circuits will work optimally in new devices, thus eliminating the expense       of fabricating in silicon at the design stage.
Time savings equate to       significant cost saving given that recent estimates state that the next       generation of semiconductors will cost $10-20bn to create.
GSS have also supported the development of Yorkshire based start-up       SureCore Ltd, providing crucial knowledge and training on statistical       variability.
SureCore successfully combined their own circuit and system       design knowledge with the device modelling expertise of GSS.
SureCore's       partnership with GSS has enabled the company to develop variability       tolerant SRAM, resulting in leading edge memory solutions that consume       less than half the power of comparable memories &#8212; key to reducing battery       requirements for mobile devices.
GSS have strengthened SureCore's       credibility within the market and enabled them to substantially develop       their business.
In 2013 a University of York spin-out, Ngenics, also       licenced the GSS tools to strengthen their business.
