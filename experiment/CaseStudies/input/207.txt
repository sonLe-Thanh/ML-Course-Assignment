Health inequity impacts through partnerships with Government         &amp; Regulatory Bodies     "My Department has responsibility for energy efficiency in the home,         the DHHSP has responsibility for health-related issues &#8212; a significant         report was carried out by Dr Liddell into the matter."
(Minister       Margaret Ritchie, DSDNI, 2008)       http://www.theyworkforyou.com/ni/?id=2008-11-10.8.31&amp;s=Liddell+fuel+poverty+Ritchie#g8.35     "I have found the evidence presented by Professor Liddell in this area         very compelling."
(Minister Nelson McCausland, DSDNI 2009).
http://www.dsdni.gov.uk/index/publications/ministers_speeches/ministers-speech-nea-conference.htm     Commissioned by Department for Social Development (DSDNI) to make         recommendations for strategy.
Key recommendations subsequently       adopted into NI's Fuel Poverty Strategy 2011:            A stronger focus on the wellbeing benefits associated with         tackling fuel poverty       A title for the Strategy which emphasises health (Warmer Healthier           Homes);        Tackling but also preventing fuel poverty       Targeting those most in need first:          "Professor Liddell has been working with the Department intensively to         bring in a sound evidence-based approach, and this says that we need to         identify those in greatest levels of fuel poverty...We have to deal with         those who have the greatest problems, and her work is focused on that."
(Minister Nelson McCausland, DSDNI in Hansard 2013)       http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/Documents/Official-Reports/Plenary/2013-14/Monday9SeptemberREVISED.pdf     Commissioned by DSDNI Committee to assist in the development of a new         Ministerial Cross-Sectoral Advisory Group on Fuel Poverty.
Launched       at Stormont in autumn 2011, Liddell was the sole Keynote speaker (see       Appendix 2).
Coupled with previously mentioned support from Minister       Ritchie (SDLP party), and Minister McCausland (DUP party), this additional       support from the DSD Committee which is led by Alex Maskey (Sinn F&#233;in)       means that the research has garnered evidence-based cross-party support in       Northern Ireland's Legislative Assembly.
Core expert on Excess Winter Deaths for NICE       http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13899/64780/64780.pdf     Commissioned by Public Health Agency NI to write their Cold           Weather Good Practice Guide       http://www.publichealth.hscni.net/sites/default/files/Guide%207%20Combating%20Cold_0.pdf     Liddell's cost-benefit analysis cited 228 times (e.g.
Chief       Medical Officer (England), the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Assembly,       and NICE).
Number of families assisted by DSDNI has increased by 50% since Save         The Children report (NIHE, 2001 to 2011 House Condition Surveys).
Number of "false positives" in Warm Homes installations reduced by         three quarters http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/tackling-fuel-poverty-in-ni-liddell-lagdon.pdf       "The university evaluation of the pilot estimates that one in two of         households contacted proved to be eligible for assistance from the warm         homes scheme.
A lot of the work was done in cooperation with Professor         Liddell, and it directed us to area-based work, which seems to be much         more productive in comparison with how things were being done.
From the         initial positive results, we have moved to phase 2, which is to test         that energy-efficiency measures can be delivered.
(Minister Nelson       McCausland, DSDNI, in Hansard, 2013)       http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/Documents/Official-Reports/Plenary/2013-14/Tuesday22October%20REVISED.pdf     Developed NI's Code of Practice for Smart Meter Installers,       and the training package associated with it.
Commissioned by the Utility Regulator to lead the region's first smart         meter trial.
"The findings of her research were significantly important, especially         when considering future interventions and care for those living in fuel         poverty.
She collaborated with suppliers, meter manufacturers and my         team to ensure everything was compliant."
(Tom Doran, Learning and Development Manager, Northern Ireland       Electricity)     4.2.
Support for local businesses     Capacity-building sub-contracts for local energy agencies       (&#163;60,000) have been generated in the past 2 years (see Figure 1 for       sub-contractor list).
Through partnership with DSDNI and 16 Councils, local plumbers, heating       engineers and boiler installers have worked in 1,500 homes of people         in extreme fuel poverty, installing efficiency measures to the value of         &#163;400,000 in the first Phase of the project's rollout.
"The findings of the various projects she has worked on fed directly         into the Division business plan and the 2011 Fuel Poverty Strategy".
(Eilish O'Neill, Housing Development Manager, DSDNI)     4.3.
Partnerships with NGO's, charities and advisory groups     Bryson Energy (Northern Ireland's largest social enterprise) and         Liddell currently work on 5 projects, commissioned by the Oak Foundation         through a &#163;1M grant:       "Professor Liddell has greatly assisted Bryson Energy...she has trained         our staff in professional report-writing and research.
As well as         building confidence amongst staff, the training has resulted in         significant successes in tender applications.
She has also assisted us         in the development of materials for use by the general public around         areas such as brokering, health and retrofit."
(Nigel Brady, Director Bryson Energy)     Three projects completed in collaboration with National Energy Action         NI, the region's largest fuel poverty charity:       "Her experience of real world issues brings a sense of reality to her         content, and her contribution is also inspirational leading to debate,         participant engagement, and change."
(Paul Wallace, Development Manager, NEA NI)     Served on the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group NI since 2008       "I was pleased that the Department provided funding for the research         carried out through Professor Christine Liddell.
I strongly recommend         that readers refer to the summary document of this work.
I have no doubt         that its content will be exercising the collective minds of the FPAG as         we approach another winter."
(Chair, Northern Ireland Fuel Poverty Advisory Group, in FPAG Annual       Report, 2011).
Reviewing the overall impact of her work in         2013, the former Chief Executive of the Office for the Regulation of       Electricity and Gas in Northern Ireland, Douglas McIldoon, commented:       "Christine has been a much availed of resource to the entire fuel         poverty community &#8212; from non-governmental organisations to Ministers and         their advisers.
She is much more than a rigorously objective academic         researcher &#8212; though she is that as well.
She has a real world engagement         with her subject matter.
Her work is practical and focussed on finding         and testing solutions to problems.
Christine clearly believes sound         policies are more likely to follow if evidence produced by research is         widely disseminated, thoroughly understood, and properly debated at         every level and by all stakeholders.
Northern Ireland is fortunate in         having an academic researcher who combines the highest standard of         research and analysis with a strong commitment to the public good".
