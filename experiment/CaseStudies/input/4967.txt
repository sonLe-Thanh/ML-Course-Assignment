     Roughly half the human population is infected with human cytomegalovirus       (HCMV).
In general, HCMV is kept in check by healthy immune systems, but       is the major viral cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities       such as hearing loss, visual problems and other neural impairments.
HCMV       is also the most significant complication in solid organ transplantation       (affecting 15-60% of patients) and a major complication of bone marrow       transplantation (20-35% of patients), leading to life-threatening disease       due to immune system impairment.
HCMV also presents a significant risk to       patients with HIV/AIDS.
The care costs associated with these high-risk       groups in the USA alone have been estimated at over $4 billion per year.
Improved screening and management of HCMV       HCMV has poorly defined clinical symptoms, so diagnosis of congenital HCMV       or HCMV-related neurological, eye or respiratory illness (and monitoring       of immunosuppressed patients) is accomplished by laboratory testing.
Antibody-based qualitative tests struggle to distinguish between active       disease and latent infection.
However, quantitative techniques, based on       polymerase chain reaction (PCR), amplify viral DNA markers in a specific       manner and in proportion to the amount of HCMV present.
The amount of HCMV       correlates with the appearance of disease, and the quantity of virus in       blood or urine (the `viral load') provides a reliable way to identify HCMV       infection.
Quantitative PCR-based tests can help clinicians decide when to       initiate treatment and how to manage HCMV with antivirals, the benefits of       which must be balanced against their toxicity.
Prior to research at the University of Glasgow, HCMV quantitative-PCR       assays developed in individual laboratories used different reference       standards (controls to check diagnostic assay performance), which often       included only parts of the viral genome or clinically irrelevant       laboratory strains.
This lack of consistency meant that there was no       consensus agreement that could establish the viral load in the blood to       indicate when to start, stop or modify treatment.
The International       Herpesvirus Management Forum recognised this in 2004, advising in a       statement that:     `an international quantitation standard distributed by an external         quality control organisation is required to compare studies using         different PCR-based systems and to facilitate patient management at         multiple care centres.
'a     Merlin as a reference standard       WHO International Standards are the highest order of reference for       biological substances.
They facilitate the calibration of secondary       references used in routine laboratory assays and provide a uniform measure       for comparison between laboratories, regardless of instrumentation or       reaction conditions.
The development of the 1st WHO International Standard       for HCMV was initiated in June 2008, at a meeting of the Standardisation       of Genomic Amplification Techniques Clinical Diagnostics group at the       National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NISBC), UK.
The       participants agreed that an international standard for HCMV would come       from a well-characterised `laboratory-cultured strain similar to         circulating clinical isolates, and containing all potential PCR gene         targets.
'b The work of the Glasgow groups, together with       Cardiff collaborators, to sequence and characterise Merlin, had       established Merlin as the prototype HCMV virus, so the participants       decided that `the candidate standard would comprise a whole virus         preparation of the prototype clinical HCMV strain Merlin.
'c       The whole virus was chosen to standardise the complete assay process       (extraction of viral DNA and subsequent amplification).
This recommendation was adopted into the WHO biological standardisation       programme by the WHO Expert Committee.
The Merlin strain was chosen       because it was `well characterised and more likely to represent a         clinical virus than other laboratory-adapted strains'.c       The standard was tested in a collaborative study coordinated by NISBC,       involving clinical and commercial laboratories in 14 countries that agreed       that the international standard represented a much needed advance.
WHO       approved Merlin as the 1st WHO International Standard for CMV       in November 2010.
The standard is held in the NIBSC as the nominated WHO       reference laboratory and distributed under the designation `09/162'.d       Between January 2011 and July 2013, NIBSC shipped 409 vials of the       standard to 274 laboratories in 43 countries.e     Commercial and clinical impact       The International Standard is now used for calibration in commercial       quantitative-PCR assays by leading international biotechnology companies,       including Altona Diagnostics GmbH (Germany)f, Abbott Molecular       Inc. (USA)g, Argene/bioM&#233;rieux SA (France)h and       Roche Diagnostics Ltd. (Switzerland).i In July 2012, the Roche       diagnostic assay was the first DNA test approved by the US Food &amp; Drug       Administration for monitoring patients undergoing CMV antiviral therapy,       and was `based on information that included an assessment of the test's         accuracy in measuring viral load and its ability to accurately measure         variations in the amount of [human] CMV virus'.j This was       an important step forward to standardize treatment of HCMV disease, and       facilitated by the WHO International Standard.
A calibrated assay produced       by Abbott Molecular Inc. was also approved for evaluation of the first       HCMV vaccine trial to reach phase III, undertaken by Astellas Pharma Inc.k     Clinical laboratories can adopt standardised commercial tests or       recalibrate their own to the WHO International Standard.
The West of       Scotland Specialist Virus Centre, which was also one of the UK centres       involved in the WHO/NISBC validation study, uses its own International       Standard- recalibrated test and performs 5,000 assays per year.
The       majority of these tests are to monitor patients who are at high-risk of       HCMV infection or undergoing anti-viral treatment, and occasionally for       diagnostic purposes, to identify underlying cause for neurological, eye or       respiratory illness.l     The report of the international multicentre performance analysis of HCMV       tests stated that implementation of an international standard, together       with the availability of such standards in commercial tests, will improve       the reporting of meaningful clinical data on HCMV.
This includes       monitoring of viral load, and establishing the cut-off values that       represent different disease stages in different patient groups.
Thus, by       providing a means to enable validated and consistent PCR tests for HCMV,       research at the University of Glasgow has facilitated the crucial first       step towards improved `management guidelines that should significantly         clarify decision making for clinicians and improve infection outcomes in         at-risk patients.
