     Narrative     Considerations of impact were from the beginning central to both parts of       the research.
"Imagining       Belfast" (2005-8) was developed as part of the ESRC funded programme on       Identities and Social       Action.
One of the aims of the programme was to "address the links       between identity processes and three particular areas of practical       concern: (i) community cohesion,       (ii) political participation and (iii) social exclusion".
In line with       this priority it was from the start       envisaged that "Imagining Belfast", through the collaboration with Dr       Bryan, would have a       contemporary as well as a historical dimension, and that the results would       feed into Dr Bryan's       ongoing work as an adviser to public bodies in Northern Ireland on policy       relating to parades,       emblems and other identity practices.
The successful completion of this       project led Belfast City       Council, in partnership with Liverpool University Press, to commission a       book that would provide a       historical context for the forthcoming anniversary celebrations.
The       agreed specifications for the       volume were that it should bring together the results of the most recent       academic research on       every aspect of the town's history, but in a form that would be accessible       to a broad non-specialist       readership.
The project thus proceeded as an exercise in public history,       and involved close       collaboration with the city council's Heritage Office.
Impact 1.
Policy making     The findings outlined above relating to the status of definitions of       public space and of the civic       sphere as historically contingent, rather than as given absolutes, have       formed the basis for a series       of interventions that have had a direct impact on the formulation of       policy at municipal and       government level.
Belfast City Council, the Community Relations Council and the         "Imagining Belfast" project         team arranged a one day seminar (29 January 2008) entitled Developing           Shared Spaces in           Belfast intended to involve all the major policy stake holders in         the area.
The seminar was         attended by senior civil servants, council and agency chief executives         and senior police         officers, as well as local NGOs and property developers.
Following on from this seminar Dr Bryan worked with Caroline Wilson,         Conflict         Transformation Project Manager in Belfast City Council, on an `agenda         for action' deriving         from the seminar proceedings and from a series of reports undertaken for         the council by         consultants.
Bryan has been a member of the Community Relations Council Roundtable         Marking         Anniversaries panel to offer advice on how the decade of anniversaries         might be         approached.
Since 2007 Connolly and Bryan have been members of a working party         established by the         Heritage section of the City Council to consider policy in this area.
Impact 2.
Civil Society     The research outlined above has been completed at the commencement of a       decade that will be       dominated by the issue of commemoration.
A succession of forthcoming       anniversaries &#8212; the       campaign against Home Rule, the 1916 rising, the Irish War of       Independence, the establishment of       Northern Ireland as a devolved political unit, the creation of an       independent Irish state &#8212; present       major challenges in a society deeply divided along religious and political       lines.
The council's       adoption of Belfast 400 as a major part of its plans for the       commemoration of the charter       anniversary thus puts the research at the centre of the development of a       strategy for dealing with       these issues of commemoration and reconciliation.
The city's Culture and       Heritage Officer has       written to confirm the Council's view that the book `can change how people       connect to and       understand Belfast, repositioning relationships into the future ... We       believe it has the potential to       be transformative in how people relate to the city.
It is also reassuring       to feel that the relationship is       an ongoing one, and reflects a genuine commitment to partnership on both       sides.'
Impact 3.
Public Discourse     Belfast 400 is an attempt to communicate to a broad audience a       comprehensive overview of the       most recent research on the development of the town and city.
The public       history function is       acknowledged in the sponsorship of the volume by the City Council and       Queen's University, each       of which contributed &#163;15,000 towards the cost of producing a well-designed       book at a price       accessible to a mass readership.
In addition to dissemination through       sales of the volume (1,983 to       1 May 2013) this impact has been achieved through the participation of       Connolly and other       contributors in a range of public events built around the anniversary       commemorations:            Public launch of the volume, Belfast City Hall, 24 January 2013       Belfast 400 Forum in collaboration with Ulster Society for Irish         Historical Studies,         Waterfront Hall, Belfast, 16 March 2013       Public lecture and exhibition, Belfast 400 Easter Festival, Belfast         City Hall, 30 March - 2         April 2013.
Total attendance at the festival was over 16,500.
The core content has also been made available in a form suitable for use       in schools through       publication of four colour posters based on the book in the Belfast         Telegraph on 22-25 April 2013.
