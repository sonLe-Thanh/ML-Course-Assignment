     In the period from 2008-2013, the REAL research programme has had a       variety of important impacts.
Most significantly, thousands of children       have benefitted from the research, raising their literacy engagement as a       result of better-informed parental support and enhanced practitioner       involvement.
The critical pathway towards this major impact involves       influencing the work of children's charities in terms of providing       a robust evidence base to inform their activities; practitioners       in terms of new skills and knowledge in working with parents on literacy;       and parents in terms of increased confidence and enhanced       knowledge about how to help their children.
Influencing Children's Charities     After successfully demonstrating the value and feasibility of REAL       methods, particularly through the results of the RCT [R3] Nutbrown was       able to disseminate the research findings to a range of influential       charitable organisations in the UK, broadening the reach of the impact       beyond those families involved in the underpinning research.
Methods and       outcomes were disseminated through professional and academic conferences,       journal articles, involvement in advisory boards and a book (R3).
This led       to an ongoing relationship with PEEP that reached children in some 150,000       families (S7).
This established a way of working with children's charities       that has informed more recent work with NCB and Booktrust.
These       organisations have been instrumental in facilitating the roll-out of REAL       methods across the UK and internationally.
For instance, The National Children's Bureau (NCB) instigated and       ran a major early literacy project entitled `Making it REAL' (Big Lottery       Fund, 2009 - 2012), drawing heavily upon the methods and conceptual       framework developed by Hannon and Nutbrown.
This project involved 60       practitioners and 680 children (around 500 families).
The NCB also drew       heavily upon the REAL research programme [S1] in successfully applying for       a Department for Education National Prospectus Grant (2013-2015)       which has funded a national roll out of free training on REAL project       methods in different locations around the country.
Through this project, a       total of 3,800 practitioners will be trained, 256 of whom will deliver       small scale projects using REAL Project methods with families in their       Local Authorities.
The NCB have also developed eight specific projects       with local authorities in which "1024 children and families will take         part directly in home visits and literacy events, and a further 1024 in         additional literacy activities.
All 70 training offers in year 1 have         been booked by local authorities, a sign of the relevance and enthusiasm         generated for this approach to early literacy and work with parents."
Furthermore, the NCB describe the research undertaken by Hannon and       Nutbrown, and in particular the evidence provided by the RCT [R3] as being       pivotal in them securing funding for their work in practice development.
[S1]     In the case of Booktrust staff have attended various courses,       conferences and seminars (run by Nutbrown) on REAL project methods.
Booktrust's       recent award winning project Bookstart Corner (2011-2013)       includes REAL project methods to support children's centres across England       to help families with children aged 12-30 months that need the most       support to enjoy reading together; some 2,000 children's centres have       registered.
Booktrust online materials and a project manual cite       and draw on REAL web-based materials and feature REAL Project methods and       ORIM as a key element of the programme (S3).
As a further indicator of the       influence of the REAL programme of research, Nutbrown has recently (June       2013) been commissioned by Booktrust to evaluate a new family       literacy initiative (2013-14).
Enhancing Knowledge and Skills of Practitioners     Since 2008, the ORIM framework and REAL methods have been disseminated to       practitioners through their adoption by the organisations described above,       2 training conferences and 3 residential workshops run by Nutbrown, and       online resources (www.real-online.group.shef.ac.uk).
These       events have directly reached over 350 practitioners, while the REAL       website has generated nearly 3,000 unique visitors between 01.09.2011 and       18.06.2013 from United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Germany, Canada,       Ireland, India, China, Philippines.
The impact of this provision has       snowballed, as demonstrated in the example below.
Through an ESRC Follow-On Fund project `A Framework for Early Literacy         Work with Families' (2011-12), 20 practitioners worked with Nutbrown       to further develop REAL Project Methods, through a number of residential       workshops.
They then shared these methods with around 300 other       practitioners who used them to develop family literacy events and projects       with some 6,000 families.
One practitioner typically commented: "...         doing this project has given me the confidence to think: `I can do that'         [train others to use the framework and do home visiting]...
I wouldn't         have had the confidence to think that I could pass on that experience         before."
Interviews with 20 practitioners involved in the ESRC       project indicated that they felt better equipped to work with families as       a result of using REAL project methods.
They have changed what they do,       for example, one teacher explained: `We are using it in school with         parents and the ones we do are playing and learning together.
...
It is         useful framework for explain to parents what it is they are bringing         when they are helping their children".
They use the ORIM framework       as the basis of much of their work, for example, in one private nursery       the practitioner said: `...we're running workshops now in the evenings,         and also I think that it's just generally developed relationships with         the parents.'
These practitioners have been working with Nutbrown to       write a series of 8, one page articles on using REAL project methods for Teach         Nursery, a magazine with a circulation of 18,000 monthly.
Kirklees Council have worked closely with Nutbrown to use the ORIM       framework (2012-13) in one of the most deprived wards in the UK.
Their       Early Learning Consultant has stated "the power of the REAL approach         and ORIM model comes from its flexibility; the principles can be used in         creative ways and adapted to the needs of local communities and schools.
Throughout all of our work Professor Nutbrown acted as the leader (the         clarity and depth of her thinking is inspirational), supporter (being         interested in new developments and relishing the `evidence' from the         ground) and inquisitor (encouraging us to be analytical in our approach         and use the ORIM framework as an evaluation tool)."
They have       incorporated the ORIM framework into their core training for early years       staff, and are "noticing real change in practitioner and teacher         attitudes".
[S4].
Overseas, there are other initiatives that have       explicitly used the ORIM framework, usually in conjunction with other REAL       Project methods: Canada (PRINTS in Newfoundland; National Family Literacy       Centre, Edmonton; Family Learning Centre, Calgary); Portugal (A PAR);       Ireland (Clare Family Learning Project).
Increasing Confidence and Enhancing Knowledge of Parents     One of the core findings of the original research was the importance of       parental input in children's early literacy development.
As a result of       the influence on practitioners described above, well over 150,000 families       (S1, S3, S7) have been reached by the ORIM framework within the UK, who       use it in their own homes.
Through the National Children's Bureau's, Making         It REAL project (2009-12), &#8212; a national roll-out of REAL methods and       concepts, impacting on over 300 families &#8212; significant benefits can be       evidenced.
Parents' confidence and knowledge in how to help their children       learn, and in engagement with centres has been enhanced.
All report now       doing more with their children, and awareness that everyday activities       offer opportunities to learn (123 families remained active throughout).
This compares favourably to other family learning approaches (e.g.
family       literacy courses requiring regular attendance combined with adult literacy       tuition).
59% of parents now attend events regularly at the centres, and       75% are confident in talking to teachers and practitioners (compared to       15% and 37% before the project began).
163 parents and prime carers       (including 34 fathers) took part regularly in home visits, and many more       attended events.
Additional benefits have included links for families to       other local services.
Places have, for example, been taken up on the       Government's two-year-old pilot of free places and parents have enrolled       on English language classes, and at local libraries, thereby having an       impact on the participants within the projects as well as a result of       subsequent development.
Testimonials from REAL projects in Oldham also provide evidence for this       claim, with parents recognising that "scribble is the beginning of         writing, and they talk about it" and are "happy to just talk         about books, knowing it is not necessary to be able to read the words to         enjoy books together".
[S2]     In Kirklees, the effect on parental engagement has been profound: "In         a school with 120 children in the Reception Classes, the Headteacher,         before the ORIM event for parents, asked me `what planet do you think         you are on?'
when I suggested that she should aim for 100% parental         attendance.
She was elated when, after running the Chatter Day on ORIM         principles, 96% of the parents attended and fed back that they wanted         more events like this so that they could understand (recognise) what         their children's learning looked like."
[S4].
Increasing Literacy Levels in Children     Ultimately, the impacts evidenced above have laid the foundations for the       most fundamental &#8212; and most significant &#8212; impact of the REAL research:       improving literacy development in young children.
The evidence for this       claim can be found in evaluations of many of the REAL follow-up projects       described above.
For example, through the NCB led Making it REAL Project       (2009-2012) involving 680 children, several major benefits can be       evidenced.
At the beginning of the project 39% of children were judged to       have low or extremely low levels of involvement (e.g.
showing interest,       concentration).
The difference here is impressive with 97% observed at the       end of their time on the project showing moderate, high, or extremely high       levels of involvement before even entering primary school.
The end of year       report for the third year of the Making it REAL project identified the       following impacts on children:                                &#160;Percentage               of children who:            &#160;Beginning of               Year           &#160;End of Year                              &#160;Name a favourite book           &#160;24           &#160;91                             &#160;Read books often (most days)           &#160;13           &#160;73                             &#160;Make meaningful marks often           &#160;&#160; 8           &#160;55                             &#160;Notice and talk about print around them often           &#160;&#160; 0           &#160;29                             &#160;Sing songs and rhymes often           &#160;10           &#160;62                          In the work conducted with Oldham Council, involving training for       practitioners provided directly by Nutbrown and also by the NCB drawing on       the underpinning research, the programme worked "so well for the         identified children (twelve of the lowest achieving children were         identified in eight schools) that the Head has funded the project for         all the Nursery children" [S2].
In summary, the ORIM framework has reached, or been used directly, by       more than 5,000 practitioners and 150,000 families, and has consistently       been shown to have a positive impact on early years literacy.
As the ESRC       Impact Prize citation notes, the research has `influenced local policy         and national practice in parents' role in literacy.
This has made a         difference to parents, by increasing their confidence and knowledge         about how to help their children; practitioners, in aiding new skills in         working with parents on literacy; and the children themselves.
