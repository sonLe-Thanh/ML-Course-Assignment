     Arab dramatists have been translating and adapting Shakespeare's plays       for over a century, but Holderness's role in developing Arab Shakespeare       as a new area of Shakespeare studies brought this to wider attention       amongst both scholars and theatre audiences.
Others learned of this       cultural linkage of English and Arabic writing, with its opportunities for       dialogue across ethnic, political and religious barriers, via the mass       media.
Holderness and Sulayman Al-Bassam embarked on a scholar-dramatist       collaboration (incorporating the latter's doctoral studies, due to       complete 2014, under Holderness's supervision) that has influenced theatre       companies, actors and audiences across several continents.
A specialist in       Shakespeare's history plays, Holderness offered specific advice on       Al-Bassam's adaptation of Richard III (initially titled Baghdad         Richard), helping the dramatist move it from an agitprop work       focused explicitly on Saddam Hussein towards one with broader political       and cultural horizons.
This enabled the medium of the Shakespearean       historical drama to represent a contemporary region in a form intelligible       to both Eastern and Western audiences.
Commissioned by the RSC and premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre,       Stratford in 2007, Richard III: An Arab Tragedy subsequently       toured during 2008-9 in Washington DC, Abu Dhabi, New York, Kuwait,       Damascus, Paris and Amsterdam.
Attracting favourable comment from the       start, the Financial Times said of the Stratford production       (2007): `Few works catch the various currents within Arabism and Islam';       while the New York Times (2009) judged it `a big-picture,       energetic satire' that depicted a world which was `a runaway hybrid of       ancient Arab tradition and 21st-century technology'.
The Washington         Post (2009), struck by its `intense portrait of how power can be       seized by means of terror and control of the media', considered the play       an `estimable example of artistic cross-fertilization'.
During this world tour, Holderness presented the research underpinning it       at conferences for academics and theatre professionals, including at       Shakespeare's Globe and the British Shakespeare Association's Fourth       Annual Conference (both 2009).
In Paris, the script's French translation       was published in programme form and contextualised with a critical essay       by Holderness.
This fertile interplay of research and practice was       repeated for Speaker's Progress, Al-Bassam's adaptation of Twelfth         Night.
Staged in 2011 and 2012 in New York, Boston, Kuwait, Beirut,       Tunisia, Cairo and Amsterdam, Al-Bassam publicly acknowledged during its       Boston run that the work was informed by Holderness's 2007 study of the       Doha Players theatre suicide bombing.
Two events accompanying the six-night Boston production, staged in the       600-seat Paramount Center main theatre, further exemplify how academic       research can influence creative work, provide a context for its reception,       and attract audiences.
A discussion with Al-Bassam, Holderness and       Professor Margaret Litvin was held on 12 October 2011 with an audience of       around 50 Boston University students studying English and Arabic, who       subsequently attended the play; the following evening's theatre audience       also enjoyed a post-show conversation with the speakers.
A video of the       discussion was posted on the university's website and referenced by other       sites, while prominent press outlets &#8212; such as the New York Times,         Boston Globe, Bay State Banner, PBS Newshour and L'Orient le       jour.com &#8212; covered the production itself.
Reviewers applauded Al-Bassam's       adaptation of Shakespeare to represent the contemporary East-West       relationship, thereby facilitating common understanding and reciprocal       recognition.
The New York Times found it `an elegantly staged       satire', while two separate Boston Globe reviewers thought it `a       sharp theatrical metaphor for social and political transformation', and       that it suggested `not just that Shakespeare is the universal playwright .
.
.
but also that art's power to subvert tyranny transcends eras and       cultures'.
The Kuwaiti press also deemed the play a characteristic voice       of the Arab Spring: `A groundbreaking exploration of the transformative       events unfolding in today's Arab world', as `Al-Bassam puts contemporary       Arab reality into the dock of the accused and makes a compelling and       brilliant case against it' (Al Watan Daily Newsaper and Al         Jareeda Newspaper, 2011).
Typically, the performances outlined above enjoyed four- or five-night       runs in venues of between 250 and 2,400 seats, testifying to significant       audience engagement.
Beyond the theatrical productions, interest is       growing in Arab Shakespeare as a genre.
Articles on the subject written or       informed by Holderness have appeared in the Shakespeare's Globe Friends'       newsletter Around the Globe (2011) and Gulf Air's in-flight       magazine Gulf Life (2012) (estimated readership: 600,000).
The       Arab Shakespeare trilogy (Al-Hamlet Summit, Richard III, Speaker's         Progress), with an introduction by Holderness and preface by       Al-Bassam, is under contract with Methuen Drama (scheduled for 2014       publication).
In 2012 and 2013, full videos of the Arab Shakespeare trilogy, and       contextualising materials, became freely available on MIT's Global         Shakespeares Video and Performance Archive website.
By respectively       securing and offering reproduction rights, Holderness and Al-Bassam have       paved the way for a wider range of Arab Shakespeare work to be       incorporated into this online archive, and their as-yet unique pages offer       a model for future site development.
Visitor interest in the Arab       Shakespeare pages is worldwide, with the majority of traffic coming from       the US and UK.
To the end of July 2013, just over 1,400 page views were       recorded, with around half of the viewers being return visitors.
