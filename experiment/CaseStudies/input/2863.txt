     Our research has directly influenced policy and practice by (a)       identifying the need for fire-severity assessment to prevent post-fire       hydrological damage, and (b) providing a methodology for soil-wettability       assessment in relation to fire severity, which land managers use to       determine post-fire mitigation needs.
Impact in the USA: The value of our research is recognised by US       land-management authorities, who are global leaders in the implementation       of post-fire evaluation and rehabilitation protocols.
Around 3 million       hectares of land burns annually in the USA.
Most of these fires affect       federal land, which is subject to formal burned-area emergency assessments       led by the US Forest Service (USFS)1 to determine if critical         `values' (i.e.
life, property, infrastructures) are at imminent         post-fire risk.
Proven rehabilitation methods (e.g.
erosion barriers,         mulch or wetting agent applications that reduce runoff and erosion) are         then applied to manage unacceptable risks to life and infrastructures.
The federal budget for this is not capped (e.g.
&gt;$60 million spent in         2012).
The direct link we established between the degree of soil water         repellency and burn severity [R1] has prompted material changes in USFS         post-fire assessment policy and procedure.
"The work by Doerr et         al.
(2006) allows managers to make inferences about post-fire soil water         repellency and infiltration from burn severity designations.
Thus,         larger areas of burned landscape can now be assessed more accurately for         their post-fire hydrologic condition and predicted hydrologic response,         and management decisions concerning treatments, access, or water         impoundments made" [C1].
Our research outcomes were first integrated       into USFS post-fire research and management practice via USFS publications       in 2008 and 2010 [C2-C4].
A formal revision of the US Forest Service       Manual [C5], which is their primary manual on land management policy and       procedure, was made in 2011.
Our work, cited in the aforementioned USFS       publications [C2-4], directly led to the revision of Section 2520 of [C5]:       Watershed Protection and Section 2523: Burned-Area Emergency Assessment,       which address post-fire site-specific assessment.
Since the revisions, it       is mandatory for Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams to assess       soil water repellency in relation to burn severity specifically because of       its proven role in promoting extreme runoff and erosion events.
The       assessment follows our methodology [R1, R2].
Approximately 300 active USFS BAER specialists, who are typically divided       into teams of 12 core and 80 standby members, carry out post-fire       assessment and apply these new procedures.
They assess every fire &gt;100       hectares affecting federal land.
Assessments are often also carried out on       private land in collaboration with relevant commercial or private       landowners.
If a fire is small with minimal risk, 1 or 2 days are       sufficient to complete the assessment, but large fires may require 7 to 10       days.
The additional water-repellency assessment procedures developed at       Swansea represent c. 25% of the post-fire assessment effort.
They       have been applied following all major US 2012 and 2013 wildfires &#8212; in       2012, for example, 109 fires covering ~1.3 million hectares in total were       assessed using the new procedures [C1].
The resulting post-fire       rehabilitation treatment costs were c. $80 million, compared with       estimated damage costs of $1,298 million had the assessments and       treatments not been applied.
Risk categories used in the post-fire       assessment (and number of fires relevant to one or more risk category)       were: Life (59), Property (83), Water Quality (35), Threaten and Endanger       Species (20), and Soil Productivity (93) [C1].
Impact elsewhere: The revised USFS assessment procedures have been       adopted in many other parts of the world, including Australia, Canada,       Portugal, Spain, and Greece.
For example, in Australia with its fire-prone       Eucalypt forests, the 2003 Canberra wildfires caused water contamination       resulting in the shutdown of water supply from one of the main catchments.
This event contributed to Australian water-supply managers in forested       regions (e.g.
Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra; combined population: 9 million)       adopting US response-guideline procedures [C6].
Following catastrophic       fires near Melbourne in 2009 that killed 173 people, USFS personnel       assisted with post-fire assessment, implementing the revised post-fire       assessment guidelines and also trained 50 Australian forestry staff [C1].
Subsequently, Australian Burned Area Assessment Teams (BAATs) applied       these in the January 2013 fires in New South Wales [C6].
The impact of our research is also traceable through Australian policy       changes following a key scientific summary document [C7], published by the       eWater Cooperative Research centre (Australia's leading water-resource       advisory group).
This has led to demonstrable changes to the Sydney       Catchment Authority policy regarding assessment and management high-risk       areas following fire [C8], based on the 2010 Audit of the Sydney Drinking       Water Catchment [C9].
The current and unseasonally early fires near Sydney       (as of 24 Oct. 2013) have also affected Sydney's water supply catchment       area and are likely to require post-fire assessments once extinguished.
