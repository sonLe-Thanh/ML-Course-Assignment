     &#160;In terms of the range of the impact, as has been noted       above, dispute resolution is of major importance in underpinning civil       society and as a business.
The rules relating to funding and costs of       litigation are important for access to justice, reduction in insurance       premiums (particularly in personal injury cases), and for the health of a       very large service industry.
Over 1.5 million civil (non-family) cases       were started in 2011 (Ministry of Justice, Judicial and Court         statistics 2011 (published 2012)), and in 2012 the Law Society       reported that there were 128,778 practising solicitors in 10,102 firms.
All of these firms, and their clients, both UK based and international,       will be affected by changes in the ways in which cases are financed and       costs regulated.
Five specific examples of the impact of the research       listed in 3 above are set out below.
i.
2009: Advice was given to Jackson LJ in a confidential meeting in       relation to his Review of Civil Litigation Costs, and Peysner also spoke       at meetings he attended.
As indicated above, the Review proposed that       fixed fees, cost budgeting and a form of contingency fees should be       introduced (damage based agreements); the latter to replace recoverable       conditional fees which defendant insurers had to pay with the objective of       reducing motor and house insurance premiums.
These are all policy       objectives that arise from Professor Peysner's research and his       conclusions on policy reforms required.
These proposals have been       implemented in 2013 through the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of       Offenders Act 2012 (sections 44 to 47) and changes in rules of court.
ii.
2010/2013: Involvement in Jackson 'Review of Civil Litigation Costs'       (above) led to an invitation to speak at the Holyrood Policy Conference,       Edinburgh, offering an English perspective on the Report of the         Scottish Civil Courts Review ('The Gill Review').
Peysner debated       the issues with another speaker, Sheriff Taylor, a member of the Gill       Review.
This led to Peysner's approach on referral fees being taken up by       the following government review: 'Review of Expenses and Funding of Civil       Litigation in Scotland' (Taylor Review) (11/9/2013) - eg Ch 10, para 48:       In 2008, John Peysner, Professor of Law at the University         of Lincoln, predicted the impact of a prohibition of referral fees once         alternative business structures had been permitted in England and Wales&#8230;         'Referral fees between lawyers and brokers or insurers will be replaced         by transfer pricing within vertically integrated organisations.
If these         arrangements are outside regulation but the remaining firms surviving         outside the corporate umbrella remain subject to the full rigor of         discipline, it is difficult to see how this can be sustained'.
In June         2012, the SRA [Solicitors Regulation Authority] addressed the         concern that businesses may become alternative business structures in         order to circumvent the ban.
So long as the formal requirements for         authorisation are met, the SRA could see no grounds on which to prevent         such arrangements, even where they are made explicitly to circumvent the         ban.
It could be said that Peysner's comment was prescient.
iii.
2008: Representative Actions and Restorative Justice (2008)       - this report was commissioned by the Department of Business Enterprise       and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and its successor department, the Department       for Business, Innovation and Skills, adopted the proposal put forward by       Peysner and Nurse in the BERR report for pilot enforcement trials, which       were then carried out.
It also adopted and announced the Consumer Advocate       (the Consumer Ombudsman proposal), and advertised the post as Chair of       Consumer Focus with the education role first and the Ombudsman powers to       follow.
The Law Commission's Consultation Paper on Consumer Redress for       Misrepresentation and Aggressive Practices (LCCP 199/SLCDP 149) makes       reference (page 47) to the BERR report in relation to compensation orders,       and (at page 51) in relation to the civil sanctions pilot.
iv.
A report for the European Commission to which Peysner contributed, Making         antitrust damages actions more effective in the EU: welfare impact and         potential scenarios, (2007, available at       ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/actionsdamages/files_white_paper/impact_study.pdf)       was drawn on by the 2008 European Commission White Paper on Damages       Actions for Breach of the EC antitrust rule - see the impact statement       attached to the White Paper: Impact Assessment Report SEC(2008) 405,       2.4.2008.      v. In 2012 Peysner was invited to speak on developments in Third Party       Funding to The Geneva Association (the leading organisation of global       insurers/re-insurers) International Liability Regimes Conference in Paris.
This led to an interview with The Economist (On-Line) (www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21575805-fat-returns-those-who-help-companies-take-legal-action-second-hand-suits)       in which Peysner's opinion that the research does not support fears that       such funding would encourage 'junk lawsuits' was quoted.
