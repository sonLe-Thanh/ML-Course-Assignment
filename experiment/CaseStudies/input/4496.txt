     Significant industrial research funding has demonstrated the impact of       our findings and expertise to a wide international community.
The EU       Framework 6 funded project PathogenCombat (2005- 2010) aimed `to         make food safer and strengthen consumer trust by monitoring and         preventing future pathogens throughout the food chain'.
The overall       objective was to provide new essential information and methods to the food       industry and public authorities on how to reduce the prevalence of       emerging food borne pathogens.
Partners encompassed 16 European states and       Australia, including 24 Universities, three industrial partners and 17       small and medium-sized enterprises, with a total budget of &#8364;14.3m.
MMU's       focus was on the prevention of cross contamination by hygienic design.
PathogenCombat created significant resources for engagement and research       impact amongst an (predominantly) European) audience of Food-related       SME's.
The website (www.pathogencombat.com)       received approximately 120,000 hits per month whilst the project was live       (until 2010).
Newsflashes regularly featuring findings from MMU's research       were sent to subscribers and an MMU authored (Verran) brochure [A]       on the "cleanability of open food contact surfaces" was circulated to 6000       European food SMEs leading to considerable uptake (150 SMEs) of a       PathogenCombat web support system that enabled SMEs to self-assess food       hygiene and safety procedures.
Verran also contributed to various       international stories around the project including articles in The       Parliamentary Magazine (2009) http://bit.ly/1cg8ojx       and International Innovation Magazine http://bit.ly/1c2bOYK     Confirming MMU's "key" role in the PathogenCombat project is a statement       (on file) from the director of the project who attests "Professor         Verran was a key person.
Improvement of hygienic design was seen as one         of the most important activities in PathogenCombat based on the fact         that for about 30% of outbreaks of food borne disease, cross         contamination has been reported as a main contributing factor...it was a         major reason for inviting Professor Verran to become a partner.
The         outcome (of her activity) was the development of effective hygiene         control methods.
Professor Verran was heavily involved in preparing         brochures specifically addressing industry, SMEs and food inspecting         agencies.
The brochures have been distributed widely and at present the         information has been taken into use by leading players in global food         chains."
[B]     Other evidence of the impact of MMU research in PathogenCombat derives       from additional international projects initiated between the MMU research       team and individual SME Partners resulting directly from the findings.
Between 2009 and 2012, Verran collaborated with the University of       Copenhagen on a 4-year Danish Research Council for Technology and       Production project focused on transforming the use of antimicrobial       metal-coated surfaces in the meat production industry.
The project       resulted in "significant new knowledge" and "without the         contribution of the MMU group could not have been fulfilled         satisfactorily" [C].
Research into antimicrobial       photo-catalytic coatings has also been taken forward in a Technology       Strategy Board (TSB) funded project with partners in the brewing industry       in Finland involving field-testing of novel coated surfaces to reduce       contamination [D].
Our work has consistently reported on the       benefits of using stainless steel over other more active surfaces such as       copper.
We have developed surfaces that are photocatalytic and       antimicrobial in the light; and others that are also antimicrobial in the       dark, by combining transition metals with photocatalytic titanium dioxide.
Our reputation in this field is significant as we are able to combine       expertise in microbiology with expertise in surface engineering and       physical/chemical characterisation of surfaces and apply this expertise to       various industries.
For example, in 2012 the International Stainless Steel       Association identified Verran and her work as key part of helping them to       make a case for the hygienic properties of stainless steel in medical       applications.
This type of enquiry evidences the impact of our research on       international interest in surface characterisation and interaction with       microorganisms, and the consequences of these interactions in terms of       health and hygiene [E].
The evaluation of antimicrobial surfaces provides challenges in terms of       appropriate testing methods.
Our expertise is now valued in terms of input       into the development of British and international testing standards         and guidelines.
Verran is the author of a chapter on "Testing       surface cleanability in food processing" which appears in the "Handbook Of       Hygiene Control In The Food Industry."
Originally published in 2005, this       practical handbook is still considered as the standard reference on         high hygiene standards within the food industry [F] and       according to the Society for General Microbiology is "an invaluable         tool for any microbiologist working in the food industry".
Professor       Kelly is a member of the British Standards Committee; RPI/013: Advanced       Technical Ceramics, which focuses on standardisation of photocatalytic       testing techniques.
Verran was invited to comment on draft standards       involving microorganisms, including collaboration with the International       Biodeterioration Research Group (IBRG) where tests are being developed by       industry towards European Standards [G].
The current Biocide       Product Directive also requires demonstration of effectiveness at       point-of-use, again necessitating development of valid test protocols.
MMU hosts a bi-annual international workshop for industrial partners       focused on Photocatalytic and Superhydrophilic Surfaces (September 2011       and December 2013) attracting over 50 delegates from 10 countries [H].
