     There have been several important development stages undertaken by the       Imperial College group, all with strong industrial interaction and product       feed through, that has led to the commercial and academic success of the       all-fibre integrated supercontinuum source.
Before our seminal publication       in 2004 there were no commercial supercontinuum sources with visible       radiation capability, although our infra-red system of 1997, which was       commercialized by IPF Technology, did have the capability but required       external frequency doubling and this was not available as a commercial       add-on.
The high power supercontinuum source has had significant impact on       various fields from time resolved spectroscopy, imaging and remote sensing       and most certainly has been a commercial success.
The major beneficiaries       have been manufacturers of the fibre based product: high power,       supercontinuum fiber lasers are now sold by commercial laser companies       such as Fianium (UK), NKT Photonics (Denmark) and Toptica (Germany and       USA).
Devices have been available from 2006, but visible spectral coverage       was limited.
Our research publications showing how short wavelength       spectral extent of the supercontinuum was linked to long wavelength loss,       e.g.
[6], and our demonstrations illustrating mitigation of this effect       and allowing short wavelength extension to the blue have led to commercial       devices operating throughout the complete visible spectrum with high       spectral power density.
Impact has been made on the commercial devices       which are now truly "white light", in fact covering practically the       complete window of transmission of optical fibre.
Minimizing the IR loss       allowed manufacturers to introduce simpler fibre structures and improve       the performance and specification of commercial products.
The best example of a commercial Yb fibre MOPFA-powered, fully integrated       supercontinuum source incorporating photonic crystal fibre is exemplified       by the Fianium product line [A].
The Whitelase supercontinuum sources       provide "a spectrum from below 390nm to beyond 2400nm, enabling         applications such as fluorescence imaging, broadband spectroscopy,         optical coherence tomography (OCT), and time-correlated single-photon         counting" [B].
In a letter Fianium states the important contribution       of J.R. Taylor's group, and in particular publication [4], to the "development         of commercial supercontinuum fiber lasers".
It confirms that "the         current installed base of supercontinuum fiber lasers is approximately         1000 units worldwide and this follows directly from pioneering research         conducted by Professor J.R. Taylor's group.
With our current devices         being priced at between &#163;12,000 and &#163;80,000, this number of sales         represents a significant impact on the commercial development of the         market" [C].
In 2012 Fianium, which has headquarters in Southampton       and offices in the US, Europe and Asia, won the Queen's Award for       Enterprise in the Innovation Award category for the development of the       Whitelase Supercontinuum Fibre laser [D].
The Danish company NKT Photonics offers a range of commercial       supercontinuum lasers under the SuperK brand.
Their SuperK Extreme       supercontinuum lasers "represent the next generation of supercontinuum         lasers that are truly turn key with industry leading brightness covering         the entire 400-2400nm wavelength range" [E] and "with more than         8W of total power and 2W of visible power, the SuperK EXTREME lasers are         the brightest supercontinuum lasers on the market" [F].
The SuperK       Extreme laser "covers a broad range of applications such as         Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM), Optical Coherence Tomography         (OCT), Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC), F&#246;rster Resonance         Energy Transfer (FRET), Flow cytometry, DNA sequencing, White Light         Inteferometry (WLI), Test and Measurement and many others" [E].
In a       letter NKT Photonics confirms the key role the Imperial group played in       the research and development of fiber based supercontinuum sources, in       particular paper [4].
It also confirms the effect of this on the products       it offers: "this basic configuration of the all-fibre integrated         scheme, pumped by a MOPA...provided as inspiration for commercial high         power supercontinuum sources, several types and models which [the]         company produces" [G].
Users of the SuperK product include Leica       Microsystems, Germany, the RECENDT Research Centre for Non Destructive       Testing GmbH, Austria, and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany       [H].
Important to the further simplification and power scaling was the       realization by us that continuous wave fibre lasers could be employed for       supercontinuum generation as opposed to the general consensus that       efficient nonlinear optics required high peak powers.
This was achieved       through a complete understanding of the non-linear processes controlling       supercontinuum generation, in particular modulational instability that       initiates it and the process of soliton-dispersive wave interaction that       mediates long and short wavelength extension.
The potential for       commercialization was acknowledged through the award of a Royal Society       Brian Mercer Feasibility Award in 2008 [I].
Through this we have looked at       the complete simplification of the supercontinuum source, minimizing the       number of components in order to produce a very commercially competitive       device.
IPG Photonics have "indicated [their] willingness to support         the commercialization of this in collaboration with Prof Taylor's group"       [J].
The Feasibility Award has now ended and the potential       commercialization of the technology is on-going.
Following the commercial success of high power supercontinuum sources,       J.R. Taylor from the Imperial College group, in collaboration with       Professor J.M.
Dudley at the University of Franche-Comte, was commissioned       to prepare a commercially successful research text "Supercontinuum       Generation in Optical Fibers", Cambridge University Press, ISBN       978-0-521-51480-4 (2010).
In the first year since publication this text       book has sold 460 copies.
Additionally, during the period of this impact assessment, our pioneering       work in developing the systems and clarifying the underlying science and       technological challenges has been recognized in the field through 21       invited talks (solely on high power supercontinuum generation) at the       major international conferences incorporating Industrial Trade Shows where       commercial supercontinuum sources were exhibited.
For example at       Biophotonics '11 (Sweden), International Conference on Laser Optics 2010       (Russia), The Latin American Optics &amp; Photonics Conference (Brazil),       International Conference on Materials &amp; Advanced Technologies       (Singapore), Asia Optical Fiber Communications &amp; Optoelectronics       Exposition and Conference (China).
Fianium confirm that the "many         international conference presentations delivered by Professor J.R.         Taylor and members of his group have helped stimulate significant         world-wide interest and demand for commercial supercontiuum products"       [C].
The beneficiaries of our research span all fields as a direct result of       the diverse applications of the high power supercontinuum source.
These       devices have been directly cascaded into research and imaging diagnostics,       with primary application in health care as well as in the biomedical       research base.
According to Antonoly Grudinin, CEO of Fianium Ltd, "Ultrafast         fiber lasers in general and super-continuum sources in particular have         good prospects to become a key technology in biomedical applications"       [K].
