     The initial conference communications and press releases following the       formal publication of the research in 2012 has generated huge interest in       the popular press and most notably been reported on the front page of the       Daily Telegraph (Source 1), Daily Mail, featured on Breakfast TV and BBC       Radio 2 and 4, Dr Oz Show (Source 9).
In addition, the information from       the relevant research outputs has been directly disseminated to:            Previous and present National Director of Science at English Institute         of Sport (EIS);       Previous and present National Lead Performance Nutritionist at EIS;       GB Cycling physiologist, Regional Lead Physiologist and Lead         Practitioner for recovery at the EIS;       Performance nutritionists from GB Sailing, GB Modern Pentathlon, and         GB Triathlon at EIS;       GB Cycling and Team SKY professional Road Racing Team.
As a result, these sports have used these products and have found a       positive benefit in recovering from strenuous exercise and injury.
Of       particular note:            GB cycling routinely use tart Montmorency cherry juice as part of         their recovery strategy on a daily basis during high training loads and         competition;        GB sailing, GB Triathlon and the GB Modern Pentathlon team use it when         travelling time zones and in heavy competition;       Used as an adjunct treatment of injured Olympic athletes in the         rehabilitation;       The EIS have now included cherry juice as an evidenced based         intervention in their resource guide for GB athletes.
The use of this intervention has been directly driven by the research at       Northumbria and has been an integral part of the operations that has       resulted in recent Olympic and international sporting success.
Testimonial       evidence from GB cycling confirms this: "...we are utilising the         findings of your research and applying cherry juice as an intervention         to improve recovery and ultimately athlete performance here at GB         Cycling and Team SKY..." (Source 3).
Furthermore, many other sports       with high volume competition schedules have learned of the potential       benefits through dissemination of the research by the University and       popular press and ~50% of Premiership Football Clubs and ~80% of       Premiership Rugby Union teams now routinely use it and report a positive       effect on the recovery (Source 4).
Also, numerous professional teams in       the USA routinely use cherry juice to enhance recovery and performance       that is based on evidence from our research.
These include NFL &#8212; New York       Giants, Seattle Seahawks; NBA &#8212; Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers; NHL &#8212; New       York Rangers, Chicago Blackhawks; MLB &#8212; NY Mets, Seattle Mariners (source       Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma, NY, USA)       (Source 10).
A more recent application of the cherry juice in the management of       disordered sleep has also been extremely successful (Pigeon et al., 2009;       Howatson et al., 2012).
In addition to using this intervention to assist       recovery, athletes have also implemented it as an adjunct treatment in       managing disturbed sleep from heavy training, return from injury,       improving general sleep quality and when travelling time zones &#8212;       statements in testimonials from National Lead Performance Nutritionists       include: "... spontaneous self reports, from an athlete using cherry         juice daily after the IRU physio, training and strength sessions,         highlighted the impact on reduced DOMS, better sleep patterns and a         greater sense (feeling) of tolerance towards the following training         sessions over a two week time frame.
This athlete believed this was a         contributor to his return to play, Olympic selection at trials and         participation in the London Olympic Games."

Interest in this functional food, globally, has grown enormously to the       point where sales have increased by two-fold for tart Montmorency cherry       juice concentrate (CherryActive) in the week of the research being       released.
CherryActive, with over 1,000 retailers, is now the largest       supplier of Montmorency cherry concentrate and capsules in the UK.
The       Managing Director has said the research has directly contributed to an       increase in sales (approximately 12 per cent increase from 2010 to 2011)       which was unexpected during a time of austerity and when the price of       cherries had increased enormously due to crop failures influenced by       inclement weather.
This has resulted in a more sustainable future for the       business.
Many of thousands of people routinely use tart cherry concentrate to       manage joint pain, improve exercise recovery and sleep quality and also to       increase antioxidant intake; while it is not possible to completely       attribute our research with all these users, UK distributors have       attributed the increase in sales to the publication of the research and       the substantial expansion of their market (source from CherryActive).
A       recent example of where the research has impacted on the wider community       is provided by Mark Allison who raised over &#163;100,000 for charity by       running across America in 100 days: he said tart cherry juice was       essential in aiding his recovery from day to day and he will routinely use       it to facilitate recovery from training and events for the future (Source       8)     The results from the research have also had a meaningful impact on the       wider community, where the application has been realised for numerous       people with disordered sleep, are time zone travellers or shift workers.
There was an increase (~two-fold worldwide) in the sales of Montmorency       cherry juice (Source 7) following the publication (Howatson et al., 2012)       of the research.
The research was also recently featured on a Channel 4       series Food Hospital (December, 2011; Source 5) where a simplified on-line       public trial was conducted over a two-week period to examine the efficacy       of cherries in aiding sleep       (http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-food-hospital/).
Finally, a recent medical TV programme in the United States (The Dr Oz       Show, 30 October 2012) (Source 9) also highlighted the research conducted       at Northumbria and how the findings are being implemented by practitioners       and impacting on patients globally (http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/tart-cherry-all-natural-sleep-aid-pt-1       and http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/tart-cherry-all-natural-sleep-aid-pt-2)       &#8212; Source 10).
