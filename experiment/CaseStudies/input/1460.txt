     (1) The independent Insight Report (R. A Harris, Contexts of use of         Learning Design Support         Tools, December 2011, available at       https://sites.google.com/a/lkl.ac.uk/ldse/) asked the       Association for Learning Technologies community of education practitioners       what key contributions       the LDSE project had made, as part of an on-line survey.
Respondents       suggested it had increased       awareness of learning design support tools and pedagogy, enabled the move       from research to       practice in the use of learning design tools, and advanced the       visualisation of learning designs.
The following are excerpts from some of the responses:     "Drawing together some of the best research of the [past] decade into         a usable tool."
"The key point is it attempts to link to pedagogy and facilitate this         process for users.
What's         important is that users can engage with the tool without having a good         working knowledge of their         pedagogy.
In this context, the tool could be used to raise awareness of         pedagogical theory."
"Move away from a template-based, gap-filling approach.
The perception         is that such approaches         trivialise the serious matter of pedagogical design."
"We now have a demonstrable framework to use when discussing these         issues in other         institutions."
"It has allowed for another (considerable) advance in the visualisation         of designs."
"The tool is user-friendly and not intimidating.
[...] I do think it         encourages new staff to think about         good learning design, and encourages them to collaborate and learn from         others, and in this         respect, the LDSE tool could be an effective training tool."
(2) Since early 2012, FE personnel have used the web version of the       Learning Designer &#8212; the       Pedagogical Patterns Collector (PPC) &#8212; through an       LSIS-funded project.
From early 2013, the       Jisc Advance Projects have been using the PPC for developing, testing and       sharing their learning       designs &#8212; initially involving 6 FE colleges, but with the aim of scaling       out to all FE colleges       ultimately, through the Jisc Regional Support Centres and their links with       key stakeholders in the       FE and Skills sector (such as NIACE, AoC, AELP, 157 Group and the       Excellence Gateway).
(3) The PPC was used in a BEd course on e-learning at the Faculty of       Education of Hong Kong       University in 2012 and 2013.
In collaboration with Hong Kong University,       and funded by ASTRI       (Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute), the PPC is       being redeveloped       as a learning design front-end to a Learning Management System that will       be deployed to support       pedagogically focused e-learning implementation in schools in Hong Kong       and China.
(4) The Learning Designer has been adopted for training computer science       graduates on an MSc       in Educational Technology at the School of Pedagogical &amp; Technological       Education (ASPETE)       Greece, as part of a project funded by the Greek Ministry of Education;       and at the University of       Macerata's Faculty of Education in 2012 in a module for trainee teachers       to demonstrate the       iterative creation of learning designs and lesson plans (see      http://buildingcommunityknowledge.
wordpress.com/community-of-users/).
It was used in a collaborative Open       University/IoE MOOC       module "Learning Design for the 21st Century" in Spring 2013       with attendance from over 400       people from across the UK HE, FE and community and skills sectors (see  http://www.lkl.ac.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=559&amp;Itemid=110).
(5) HEIF-funded research with the Camden Partnership for Educational       Excellence is further developing       the PPC tool.
The PPC allows teachers to share and adapt each other's       learning designs, and the Swiss       Cottage Special School are using it with their partner schools in order to       communicate their ideas relating       to teaching practice.
(6) Since 2010 the MiGen system has been used at eight schools in the       U.K., Israel and Italy.
Data       has been gathered from more than 300 hours of interaction by 11 to       14-year-olds at four of these       schools.
Analysis of the data shows that MiGen helps students become aware       of a pattern,       construct it, and use it as a basis for deriving algebraic rules about its       properties.
Students       interacting with eXpresser over several lessons are able to achieve the       learning objectives and to       apply their knowledge to other algebraic generalisation tasks.
Usage of       the TA tools shows that       they assist teachers in providing additional support to students.
(7) The MiGen system has been used since 2010 on various Initial Teacher       Training programmes       at the IoE, such as the Mathematics PGCE and Teach First, as a case study       in the use of ICT in       mathematics education.
When these trainee teachers return to their       classrooms, many of them       report that using MiGen has changed their way of thinking as to their       teaching of algebra and, more       generally, on the use of ICT in the classroom.
(8) The UK partner of the Cornerstone project (SRI International and IoE)       funded by the Li Ka Shing       Foundation has obtained funding of $1,000,000 to develop a suite of four       modules aiming to integrate       technology into the teaching of maths in around 100 schools in the U.K.,       and one of these modules is       being developed according to the research outcomes of the MiGen project in       respect of supporting       students' construction and collaboration.
(9) Access to the PPC has been provided to teachers through the Pedagoo       teachers' community website       since March 2013        (http://www.pedagoo.org/2013/03/building-teaching-knowledge-pedagogical-patterns/).
The       MiGen team has disseminated materials and findings to teachers and PGCE       students       through the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics       (NCETM) in professional       development events such as the `Teacher as Researcher' conference in       October 2010, the `Digital       Technologies' conference in February 2013, and contributions in the NCETM       forum  (https://www.ncetm.org.uk/search?q=migen&amp;area=5).
(10) The LDSE and MiGen projects have contributed to the impact arising       from the ESRC/EPSRC TEL       programme as a whole, particularly as relating to its Personalisation and       Productivity themes.
An Impact       Report from the programme was presented on 13th June 2012 in       the House of Lords (System Upgrade:         Realising the Vision for UK Education, available at       http://www.tel.ac.uk/).
A Public Event was held in       November 2012 at the Royal Society, hosted by the Minister of State for       Universities and Science and       attended by policy makers, educators and vendors, where the outcomes of       the TEL projects were       showcased and debated.
These outcomes have been discussed regularly since       2011 with the       Departments of BIS and Education by Professor Noss (Director of the TEL       programme as well as lead PI       of the MiGen project) and have informed ministerial announcements on the       role of TEL in transforming       the school curriculum.
