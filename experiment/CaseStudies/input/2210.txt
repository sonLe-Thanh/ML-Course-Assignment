     Research at Newcastle University led to the invention of EKG, creating a       worldwide market for its use in designing a new range of `active'       geosynthetics.
As testified by the Geotechnical Director of Tony Gee and       Partners (E1): "Before the Newcastle University initiative         there was no commercially available means of carrying out         electro-osmosis."
The impact of EKG has brought about significant       changes in civil engineering industrial practice, evidenced by revisions       to UK standards [BS8006] and international guidelines.
These changes have       enabled a range of international companies in the civil engineering sector       to gain a competitive edge in the market.
There is rapidly growing impact       in the mining, water and geoenvironmental engineering sectors.
1.
Changing civil engineering practice and catalysing new companies     Electrokinetic Limited (EKL, www.electrokinetic.co.uk) was spun out of       Newcastle University to pioneer the commercial application of EKG products       and processes.
EKL has attracted three rounds of private and venture       capital funding totalling &#163;510k as well as grant income from DTI (now TSB       [G3]) and a Smart Award.
It is the owner of an extensive family of       patents relating to EKG materials, applications and methods.
EKL have won       commercial contracts utilizing these products totalling &#163;694k in the last       three years.
The success of these contracts has brought about a major       change in civil engineering industrial practice.
The major impacts to date have been on the civil engineering companies       which have developed new practices for the design and installation of EKG       slope repair of geotechnical transport infrastructure (Amey, Volkers,       Balfour Beatty, Mott MacDonald, Birse Rail, Tony Gee and Partners,       Luddon), and in the supply chain for material and equipment for these       installations (Geotechnical Engineering Ltd., Electroinstall, Samuel       James, TTI Ametek Ltd., Thandar, Leeds Transformers, Fuseland Ltd.,       Interserve).
New machinery has been developed by Geotechnical Engineering Ltd. to       enable the installation of EKG in slopes; an entirely new company, Electro       Install Limited (www.electroinstall.com),       was set up in 2013 to capitalise on the new market in EKG-slope       remediation which has been established by Newcastle.
Furthermore, the       transport infrastructure owners and operators (Highways Agency; Network       Rail) which have adopted the new technology over more traditional       approaches now recognise the significance of EKG for cost and       environmental impact reduction in their businesses, as evidenced by the       receipt of the Highways Agency (HA) supplier recognition award in 2012 [E3]       (highlighting the important contributions made by suppliers to the HA       strategic road network).
Amey is a market leading infrastructure services provider who worked with       Newcastle University and EKL on the use of the electrokinetic remediation       technique.
The Technical Director of the Amey geotechnical group commented       on the work [E4]: "The Electrokinetic remediation technique has         been demonstrated in a pilot project for Network Rail (NR) and at         commercial scale on two highways projects for the Highways Agency (HA)         completed in 2011 and 2012 , including the Amey led Area 9 M5 J7 scheme         (approximate value &#163;975,000) which recently won several industry awards         (2013).
Amey's Geotechnical team and EKL have collaborated on joint         marketing, promotional and project development activities and signed a         Confidentiality Agreement in February 2013.
Amey and EKL have promoted         the technique as a treatment option to the HA, NR, Sheffield PFI and         South Lanarkshire Council (SLC).
SLC have commissioned Amey in May 2013         to engage EKL as a sub-consultant for the design and supervision of         electrokinetic remediation on the A72 Mauldslie slope remediation         project (approximate value &#163;350,000)."
Amey conclude by stating the commercial impact of the EKL technology "...is         an improved market position in the UK for slope remediation and an         enhanced reputation for innovation, which adds value to our bids for         major infrastructure service contracts.
It also provides business         development opportunities for new infrastructure (including waste)         customers in the UK and overseas."
2.
Revising civil engineering standards and international guidelines     The new range of EKG products has been recognized by British Standards       which led to the revision of BS 8006 (2010) covering the construction of       reinforced soil structures, specifically accepting electrokinetic       improvement of fill materials.
The former Chairman of the British       Standards Committee B526/04 Reinforced Soils supports this evidence by       commenting [E5]: "The revised Code of Practice BS8006-1:2010         allows the use of new products such as EKGs in the construction of         reinforced soil structures used in many infrastructure projects such as:         roads, railways, airports, industrial developments and waste disposal         sites".
This revision to the Code has enabled more wide-spread       (worldwide) adoption of the technique.
The International Geosynthetics       Society accepted EKG as a new form of geosynthetic material in 2009 and       has developed a new EKG symbol for use in contact documents and drawings [E6].

Reducing cost and environmental impact of major infrastructure         assets     In relation to the electrokinetic remediation work, Amey highlight the       major advantages as [E4]:            Cost Effective (typically 20 - 30% cost saving);       No line possession or traffic management required during treatment;       Low staffing levels means low H&amp;S risk;       Reduced carbon emissions (typically 40% less than other methods);       Reduced environmental impact and no waste to landfill.
This was further endorsed by the receipt of a Green Apple award [E7]       for Environmental Sustainability.
Furthermore, the Newcastle development       of EKG has made it possible to meet a major objective of the revised BS       8006 by enabling the greater use of previously unacceptable waste       materials into soil reinforcement [E5], thus increasing the       environmental benefits of EKG.

Licencing for manufacture of products for the civil engineering and         waste treatment industries     Currently there are 43 material suppliers associated with the supply and       manufacture of EKG materials, including overseas manufacturers Afitex       (France), Arctitex (Sweden), Clear Edge (Sweden), GKD (Germany) and       Technitex Sachsen (Germany).
The CEO and owner of Arctitex describes a       product that has been developed specifically for manufacture of EKG       materials [E8]: 	  "A machine for production of electrodes for         dewatering of embankments and insitu-treatment.
Stand by capacity of 80         000 - 320 000 linear meter of electrodes depending on daytime or work in         shift.
This capacity would render an annual turnover of 470 000 &#8364;".
GKD have manufactured an EK belt press for waste treatment applications       and Arctitex have manufactured a "lining material for dewatering bags       (waste treatment) with a market potential of 280 000 linear meters of         bag material rendering a 5 320 000 &#8364; potential annual turnover"     5.
Extending applications and growing impact in the waste water and         mining sectors     Successful full-scale trials of EKG-enhanced belt press have been       conducted for two major international mining companies with the aim of       drastically reducing waste volumes, increasing safety of waste disposal       facilities and reducing water usage by recycling from waste back into       processing.
Referring to this technology, the managing director of GKD       (UK) Ltd. [E9] states that: "EKB has proven a successful         technology" and "contributed dramatically to their environmental         management of mining waste water".
Amey support this impact by stating: "Another different market area         for Electrokinetic also exists that has not been as well developed as         slope remediation, namely dewatering of wastes such as tailings and         slurries.
The opportunity for electrokinetic dewatering of slurry         lagoons, mine tailings and similar wastes is potentially huge."
