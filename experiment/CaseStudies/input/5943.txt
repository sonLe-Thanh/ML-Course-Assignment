     Webster's research in the field of biomedicine has been impactful both in       terms of shaping practice and influencing policy in relation to       biobanking, stem cell research and regenerative medicine by ensuring that       a `sociological voice' has been heard.
Examples of his impact in these       fields include the following:     4:1 Changing donation procedures to the UK Biobank.
Following on from recommendations in the report by Webster, Public         attitudes to third party access and benefit sharing (2008),       the UK Ethics and Governance Council (EGC) and UK Biobank introduced       significant changes to their practices.
As a result of Webster's findings       on public concerns (see 2:1 above) the UK Biobank has since produced       regular biannual reports to the EGC describing their data management       practices and their security systems.
UK Biobank also acted on Webster's       recommendation to give more information about its security measures.
It       did so by requiring since 2008 that the EGC employ information security       systems in order to enhance its ability to advise on and monitor this       area.
In addition, UK Biobank changed its recruitment information for       potential donors to help reassure participants about the scale, form and       robustness of the security of personal biodata.
Furthermore, as a result       of Webster's findings about anxieties among donors that they may be       re-contacted by the bank some time after donation, the EGC recommended       that UK Biobank investigate this in a systematic survey of participants       once 500,000 participants had been recruited.
Webster's research has       therefore underpinned significant changes in practice that have been of       value to both the bank and to donors and potential donors in terms of       managing expectations and concerns.
4:2 Influencing regulatory decisions made by the UK Stem Cell         Bank Steering Committee (UKSCBSC).
Since 2008 Webster has been on       the government's UKSCBSC, responsible for agreeing the deposit of and       access to banked cell lines by researchers.
Underpinned by his research       (see 2.3 above) Webster has made a significant contribution to Committee's       decisions on, for example, regulation and intellectual property rights       involving UK and international cases.
For example, in February 2011, he       was one of three members of the UKSCBSC responsible for meeting with       representatives of the Bio-Industry Association's Cell Therapy and       RegenMed Advisory Committee who were pressing for a change in the       intellectual property rights of firms.
Webster and colleagues advised       against these demands for change because of concerns that this would       restrict public access to stem cell lines for research purposes and reduce       scope for innovation, a position adopted by the UKSCBSC.
4:3 Contributing to regulatory practices associated with         clinical trial design and adoption.
As a result of his directorship       of the ESRC Stem Cell Initiative research programme, and his own related       research into regulatory issues associated with clinical trials (see 2:2       above), Webster was invited in 2012 to join a Ministerial Industry       Strategy Group (MISG) established by Sir Alasdair Breckenridge (Chair of       the Government's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).
Webster led the Socio-Economic and Policy Perspective strand at the MISG       workshop which examined the regulatory framework of the stem cell therapy       field.
He also co-authored the MISG report, Regenerative Medicine         Regulatory Workshop (2012).
This report contributed to the UK       Regenerative Medicine Community's evidence to the House of Lords, Science       and Technology Committee's Regenerative Medicine inquiry (July       2013), which drew on Webster's work on the adoption of stem cell therapies       through `institutional readiness' and the need to rethink the       epistemological assumptions of trialling (p. 1).
This finding informed the       Group's recommendation that the full potential of the NHS to support       regenerative medicine needed to be released, for example, through the NHS       National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) being more receptive to       non-conventional forms of data and evidence.
This is important in this       context because processes of standardisation using conventional clinical       trials do not apply for research dealing with live tissue.
This was       reflected in the House of Lords' report in the recommendation that the       NIHR should create a regenerative medicine stream of its clinical research       network to address `the specific needs of regenerative medicine clinical       trial design' (paragraph 89).
4:4 Informing the UK government's investment strategy in         regenerative medicine.
Data and findings from the REMEDiE project       (see 2.3 above) mapped the current activity in the field across Europe to       identify the scope for the commercial development of regenerative       medicine.
The sociological research has illuminated the strategic       challenges and choices that commercial companies face in relation to       regulation when making decisions about future investments.
This work has       been directly drawn upon by the House of Lords' Regenerative Medicine       inquiry (July 2013) and the Department for Business, Innovation and       Science's (BIS) report Taking Stock of Regenerative Medicine in the         United Kingdom (July, 2011).
In particular the project       underpinned the report's development of an integrated `national strategy       focussing on improving the delivery, infrastructure, regulation and uptake       of cell therapy and regenerative medicine' (p. 45).
This is being advanced       through the government's investment strategy by the Technology Strategy       Board's (TSB) Cell Therapy Catapult (www.catapult.org.uk),       established in 2012 to bring together businesses, scientists and engineers       to transform ideas into products and services to generate economic growth.
The REMEDiE report (http://www.york.ac.uk/satsu/remedie/reports/)       has also been utilised in the subsequent development of regenerative       medicine strategy in the UK.
Based on his research expertise, Webster was       invited to become a member of the Research Councils UK's (RCUK) Key       Opinion Leaders group during 2011, with a Senior Scientific Officer at the       MRC commenting that the REMEDiE report provided `an excellent         foundation for many of the issues we need to consider under the Forward         Look exercise'.
This group met at a workshop to identify the future       priorities for regenerative medicine research and development, taking into       account current activities, opportunities, and scientific, clinical and       commercial relevance.
This exercise led to the RCUK/TSB's A Strategy for UK Regenerative         Medicine 2012.
Webster drafted the specific social science       components that problematize conventional trial design (see 2:2 above) and       regulatory pathways that are now in the document (p. 17).
Commenting on       Webster's contribution to the strategic plan for regenerative medicine, a       Senior Scientific Officer of the ESRC has said: "This [social science         input into the Strategy for UK Regenerative Medicine] was always going         to be tough, because social science was seen as a `small player' in a         field of voluble and powerful big clinical and biological players.
However, Andrew managed to get key aspects of social science included in         the policy document.
This was facilitated by his ability to provide         inputs in a way that policy makers can actually use...
I then asked him         to take forward one of the outputs of the strategy, a workshop in an         area of social science interest, thus his contribution spanned right         though from drafting the strategy through to practical implementation of         aspects of it."
In 2013 Webster's work in this field was sufficiently well recognised for       him to be invited to organise a House of Commons Workshop on regenerative       medicine for the All-Party Parliamentary Group of MPs for Social Science       and Policy in order to a) demonstrate how social science can engage with       complex bioscience issues and b) to inform MPs of future challenges,       especially in regard to clinical trials evidence, design and patients'       long-term safety.
In summary, Webster's long standing engagement in a range of policy fora       has ensured that those involved in the regulation of, and investment in,       new biotechnologies take into account the wider socio-political processes       which shape their emergence and are sensitive to the implications of their       use in practice.
