     Through its findings, the research has:     A.
Put the needs of the Chinese community back on the Government's         agenda: The CIBF was established in 1996 as a response to the Home       Office Select Affairs 1985 Committee Report "The Chinese in Britain".
However, during the 2000s, much public and third sector attention switched       from race/ethnicity to faith-based organisations, leaving CIBF in a       relatively marginalized position.
This was not helped by the Chinese       community's reputation and willingness to project itself as a `model'       migrant community that was not in need of support.
The project and the       subsequent report enabled CIBF to re-establish a relationship with       governmental institutions, in particular the Department for Communities       and Local Government (DCLG), the former Minister for Social Cohesion,       Shahid Malik MP, as well as the former Big Society advisor, Lord Nat Wei.
As a consequence of the report launching 2009 &#8212; which Shahid Malik       attended &#8212; CIBF was asked to present results from the research to senior       DCLG policy officials at a workshop.
Also as a result of the report,       Communities Minister Andrew Stunell convened a roundtable meeting in       November 2010 for members of the Chinese community, enabling them to       explore matters of concern with DCLG.
Finally, despite changes in       government, CIBF has managed to maintain a relationship with the DCLG,       which would not have been possible without the report [A].
The research       and publications have given CIBF an empirical basis for approaching       policy-makers, thus helping it fulfil its mission to strategically       identify and respond to the needs of the Chinese community, to promote       these interests to government, and to encourage the community's active       civic participation in British society.

Strengthened the hand of the local government to gain more         resources: The report was distributed to over 200 Local Authorities       and Westminster City Council used it to improve the collection of census       data in 2011 [B].
It did this by sharing the findings with the Office for       National Statistics (ONS) and pushing for more resources to increase       engagement with the Chinese Community and to better tackle cultural and       linguistic issues.
As a result, ONS committed additional resources to       train interviewers, and provide community support and comprehensive       training on cultural sensitivity.
One new census officer was given a       specific remit for the Chinese community for the 2011 census.
The report       has strengthened Westminster City Council's ongoing efforts to highlight       the specific challenges of this particularly diverse London borough and       has enhanced its commitment to pioneering innovative approaches to       understanding the needs of Westminster's population.
C. Focused the need for Third Sector organisations within the Chinese         community to provide better support for new migrants: By       highlighting differences between the needs of new and older migrants, and       by demonstrating that many third sector organisations effectively exclude       the former, the report has accentuated the need for Chinese community       organisations to cater for these newcomers.
It also legitimated the       proposal that CIBF lead the formation of a new group of Chinese       third-sector providers, supported by DCLG, although this was delayed by       the change in government.
The report has been cited and used widely:            A number of other Chinese organisations cite the report as evidence of         the changing needs of the Chinese community in Britain and of the new         challenges confronted by the Chinese community, third sector providers         and political representatives [D].
The Chinese Information and Advice Centre (CIAC) has used the report         to legitimate its existence, challenge assumptions about its clients and         advocate for its service users [C].
Migrants Rights Network [E] cites the report to illustrate the         significant problems faced by many new Chinese migrants to the UK in         accessing public services and earning decent wages.
This is exacerbated         by restrictive immigration policies towards migrant workers, students         and undocumented migrants.
As a result of the report, CIBF has been invited to become advisory         members of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Ethnicity and Poverty         Programme [A], and has consequently changed the group's perspective on         the issues facing Chinese community.
The report has been cited in their         publications [F].
D. Raised the profile of issues facing the Chinese community in         London: Extensive media coverage on the launch of the report, in       China [H] and in Chinese language media in Europe [I,J,K,L], has drawn       attention to the needs of Chinese migrants in the UK and raised the       profile of CIBF.
The report earned the prestigious Market Research       Society's first Virginia Valentine Award for Cultural Insight in 2011.
Judges commended the report for overcoming "...the huge linguistic and       cultural barriers and the problems of accurately identifying communities       and sub-communities.
This study...challenged the received wisdom regarding       the Chinese community in the UK, with the result being a new "official"       understanding of the Chinese community and a seat at the top table of       strategy making for the CIBF" [G].
