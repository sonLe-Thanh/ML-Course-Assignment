     The research has impacted upon the policies of the Council of Europe,       helping to shape its       regional programme and regulatory frameworks, and also on the associated       Balkan states       providing structure, guidance and advice to aid the rehabilitation of       their cultural heritage.

Impact on the research sponsor itself, the Council of Europe,       through its expert group, the       Legislative Support Task Force (CAL) (Source 1).
This work (References         1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) has       made fundamental contributions to the direction of the European Regional       Programme for Cultural       and Natural Heritage in South East Europe (Source 2) through       influencing its Reference       Framework.
(Sources 3 and 4).
In view of this, the Council of       Europe has commended the work       for addressing:     "related problems of administrative organisation and...heritage         funding where this is linked to legal         and administrative protection mechanisms, as well as dissemination of         good practice, as illustrated       in the Reference Framework" (Sources 3 &amp; 4)     The Reference Framework, in turn identifies the three books derived from       the international studies       (References 1-3), the research book on Funding the Architectural       Heritage (Reference 4) and       related guidance, the revision of which was co-ordinated by Pickard (Reference         6), and       encourages states to refer to these `in the process of drafting new laws       and policies' (Source 5).

The work (in particular References 1, 2 and 3) has       impacted on the legal and regulatory       frameworks of the countries in question.
Real change has been effected       through enhancing       heritage conservation, improved cultural understanding and knowledge of       integrated conservation       mechanisms and rehabilitation processes.
This has been recognised by       Council of Europe itself in       regarding the three international studies (References 1-3) as       having provided:     "...multilateral assistance for the benefit of the region" and that:         "Legal Assistance requests are         being formulated by different countries/regions on the basis of the         results..." (Sources 3, 4 and 6)     The work (principally References 2, 3 and 4) has provided an       important basis for legal and       institutional capacity building and rehabilitation projects relating to       Heritage in South East Europe       and has provided countries with a better basis for applications to the       European Union to secure       funding for rehabilitation projects.
(Sources 1, 6, 7 and 8).
Robert Palmer, Director of Culture and       Cultural and Natural Heritage in the Council of Europe until 2012, has       stated that the three       European Heritage Series publications (References 1-3) constituted:     "...an important working basis for on-going and future projects in         South-East Europe as well as in         other priority regions of intervention for the Council of Europe".
(Source         9).
Further actions have been taken by Pickard through the CAL to influence       heritage legal reform.
He       assisted in the drafting of legislation which culminated in a new Cultural       Heritage Law (Law no.
02/L-88) being approved by the Assembly of Kosovo and the subsequent       approval of seven       associated Ministerial regulations in 2008.

Subsequent actions have taken place through the Ljubljana       Process (launched 2008; extended       2011) (Source 7), funded jointly by the Council of Europe/EU, to       highlight the role of heritage in       implementation of national development strategies and encourage the       development and funding of       rehabilitation projects.
A process commenced in 2012 to establish Heritage       Assessment Reports       for each country to identify issues, obstacles and challenges to be       addressed in order to       consolidate the methodology and improve institutional capacity through       Action Plans.
These were       developed by Pickard through a questionnaire with information gathered       from inter-ministerial       working groups specifically established, and confirmed through six       follow-up workshops (led by       Pickard between 2012-13).
From Autumn 2013-14 monitoring action commenced       regarding the       implementation of identified priority actions, through a pool of experts       (Pickard responsible for       Bosnia and Herzegovina and FYR Macedonia).
`Funding the Architectural Heritage' (Reference 4) provided       evidence that the measures identified       in Council of Europe Recommendation R (91) 6, and adopted by the Committee       of Ministers on 11       April 1991, did indeed: "support the funding of the conservation of the         architectural heritage" as       they were intended to.
This delivered authoritative information on funding mechanisms/management       systems that       assisted the development of good practice and informed the updated       guidance produced by the       CAL expert group on legal and administration reform (Reference 6,         Source 1) and in the UK,       where the paper `Funding sources and strategies: Europe and beyond' was       presented at a       conference organised by the Institute of Historic Building Conservation,       the UK Association of       Preservation Trusts and Glasgow City Heritage Trust (Glasgow, 18 - 20 Nov.       2010) and published       in Context (the Journal of the Institute of Historic Building       Conservation), No.
118, March 2011 at       pp.
12-15 (ISSN 0958-2746).
The book led to other internationally-invited       work and further       publications, including the discussion of funding mechanisms in relation       to the European       Commission's Euromed Heritage 4 Programme that supported reform       initiatives in non-European       Mediterranean countries.
