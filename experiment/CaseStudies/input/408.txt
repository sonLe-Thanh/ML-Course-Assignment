     Context: Whizzkids United (http://www.whizzkidsunited.org/)       is the youth outreach programme of the UK charity Africaid.
Using football       as a metaphor for life, its six week course On the Ball (OtB)       harnesses explicit analogy (e.g.
strategy, focus, hard work, teamwork,       self-determination) to teach life skills and HIV prevention to teenagers.
OtB graduates are encouraged to attend the WU Health Academy (HA) in the       Edendale district of Pietermariztburg, KwaZulu-Natal, a clinic and drop-in       centre offering testing, counselling and treatment for HIV/AIDS.
Over 5.6m       people in South Africa have HIV/AIDS, with the highest prevalence recorded       in KwaZulu-Natal (39.5% of the adult population, according to UNAIDS in       2009).
Most teenagers with HIV in the target group were born with it.
Due       to taboos that prevent open discussion, children are deprived of clear       information about both risks and prevention, even though they are sexually       active from a young age.
The OtB programme is highly successful (25,000 graduates), but the WU       founder Marcus McGilvray contacted the Cardiff team in Autumn 2011 for       assistance with communicating the health messages.
Only 14% of Edendale       OtB graduates had gone on to visit the HA, located some 5km from their       schools and villages.
At the HA, teenagers can access the full range of       information and support they need.
An estimated 70% of children taking an       HIV test at the HA were first reached through the OtB scheme.
The Cardiff       researchers began, at his request, by examining the football-coaching       materials to suggest improvements, particularly in communicating the       importance of attending the HA.
El Refaie's research on metaphor was       central to this evaluation.
As part of their scoping study, the Cardiff       team asked the OtB coaches for their views on the teaching materials, and       it became clear that the images (photographs) were not well-targeted to       the teenagers.
This raised the question of how comics (El Refaie's       research specialism) might be used instead.
Process: El Refaie proposed to McGilvray that the teenagers       might draw their own illustrations for OtB.
To assess the feasibility of       the idea, a comics drawing competition was organised, judged by GP Dr Ian       Williams, whose website (http://graphicmedicine.org)       promotes the use of comics for healthcare professionals, patients and       carers.
The idea of developing comics drawing as an activity in its own       right was partly inspired by written comments on some of the comics in the       competition, welcoming this alternative to football.
Comics drawing was       developed as an alternative mainstream educational approach for WU, with       dedicated workshops teaching participants to create original stories in       the comics format.
The first aim was to empower the young people to use       this creative narrative medium to express their feelings and concerns.
The       second aim was to produce comics for distribution, reflecting the       teenagers' own perspectives on HIV/AIDS and thus appealing to other local       youngsters, as well as providing a way to promote the services of the HA.
El Refaie created the materials with reference to Sarangi's research into       HIV education.
Stephen Silverwood of `Upside Comics', a charity that runs       comics drawing classes in UK schools and social clubs, assisted with       teaching ideas; Steve Marchant, a comics artist and educator who runs       comics drawing workshops with groups of underprivileged children and       adults and authored the `The Cartoonist's Workshop', inked and coloured       the comic strips produced by the teenagers.
Stages:     1.
Feb-Jul 2012: Bespoke research (see above), including an analysis of         the comics drawn by OtB participants for a competition (105 entries, two         prizes awarded).
At a consultation meeting with McGilvray, it was agreed         to develop the materials in a manner that did not rely on the teachers         having previous experience of comics drawing.
2.
Aug-Nov 2012: El Refaie constructed the Workshop 1 content, focusing         on the core themes that her research showed best enabled teenagers to         understand visual forms of storytelling and use them effectively to         express their own thoughts and experiences, including different ways of         depicting character traits and emotions.
Workshop 1 consists of basic         drawing skills classes (3 x 60-90 minute sessions).
From Nov 2012 it was         delivered both at the HA (&gt;100 teenagers) and in local schools         (&gt;75) by Mar 2013.
3.
Nov-Dec 2012: El Refaie assembled a library of c.30 graphic novels for         the HA, to raise the teenagers' awareness of different styles and         narrative techniques.
She developed materials for Workshop 2, an         intensive two-day comics drawing course for selected graduates of the         introductory workshops, focussed on visual metaphor and comics story         structure.
The Powerpoint slides for both Workshops were colour-printed         and laminated for use in venues without computers/electricity.
`I love         drawing comics' T-shirts with the Cardiff University and WU logos were         designed, printed and donated by the Unit for Workshop 2 participants.
4.
Jan-Apr 2013: Workshop 1 artwork and feedback from participants and         the local trainers was received and analysed.
On 23-24th Feb,         McGilvray and 9 colleagues including counsellors ran Workshop 2 for the         first time, with 29 15-20 yr olds (HIV+ &#9792;9/&#9794;7; HIV- &#9792;7/&#9794;6),         travelling up to 40km each day (3 buses) to attend.
A full report of the         weekend was written by a researcher at WU.5-1 The input         included a `tree of life' metaphor to help the teenagers develop a         visual image of their identity in the context of family and friends,         culminating in discussing the power of a `forest' of such trees.5-1         In line with El Refaie's research the workshop helped the participants         use metaphor to talk about HIV.
Evidence of the success of this         includes: "HIV is like an octopus" (&#9794;); "I think the virus is the         soldiers that killed the soldiers of the body" (&#9794;); "It's like a         snake, maybe cobra if I may say because it's a dangerous animal" (&#9794;).5-1         Within four teams, role play was used to construct story episodes for         six-frame comics.
The artwork was scanned in Cardiff, and selected         originals were sent to Steve Marchant for collation into a colourful         booklet of the comics stories which can be viewed and downloaded at http://bit.ly/19HSuyD.
Between its         launch on 05/06/13 and 31/07/13, visitors from at least 26 countries had         viewed the booklet, including 111 in the UK and 65 in the US.5-8         The booklet was distributed in the UK at the `Making Sense of HIV'         conference, Cumberland Lodge, 12-14.06.13 and in KwaZulu-Natal through         the OtB program and the WU Health Academy.
Evidence of impact: Workshop 1s were initially held at the       Health Academy (HA), but they were so popular that schools asked to run       them in their Life Orientations classes,5-3 increasing       the reach by 75%.5-4 The commitment to Workshop       2 attendance surprised McGilvray.
There was a full turn out, and "All the       kids were there at 8 am on the dot both mornings, which is not usual, in a       place that works on `African time'.
We'd expected not being ready to start       until 9.30.
"5-5     Impact of Workshop 2 on the teenagers: Two of the teams       were composed only of HIV+ participants.
McGilvray said, "One of the most       amazing things ... was when they opened up and realised they all had the       same problem.
There was a surge of emotion and relief when they found out       they were all HIV positive".5-5 They spoke of how they       feared disclosing their status, in case the others found out and       ostracised them.5-1,5-5 Both HIV+ teams developed this theme in       their comics (while the HIV-negative teams focussed on the importance of       being tested).
Impact of workshop on Health Academy staff: The staff had       not anticipated the power of the experience, nor the extent to which they       would for the first time gain access to such deep levels of disclosure:       "when the children come to the clinic we focus on the services...but for       this weekend we try to sit down with them and they were expressing       themselves.
How do they feel about them-selves.
Now we can understand each       other.
How this person feels.
"5-1 Staff learnt that the most       significant concern for HIV+ teenagers is isolation and fear of rejection,       and not knowing who they can trust.5-2 This extends to fear of       breaking up the family by implicating their parents as HIV+ and worry       about siblings' status.5-5 Directly resulting from Workshop 2,       the HA will develop new programmes that create opportunities for HIV+       teenagers to talk to each other and work together.5-5 Staff       also came to understand better why teenagers sometimes fail to take their       antiretroviral (ARV) medication: not only does it stigmatise them, but       many, taking it from childhood, had never been told what it was for (and       did not know they were HIV+).5-5     Impact on individuals: Comments from participants recorded       during the workshop (translated from Zulu) 5-1 exemplify their       first disclosures of intensely private information: "I don't know how I       got HIV and I never did find out.
I do find it hard to let other people       know my status.
I feel bad when other people talk about HIV/AIDS."
(&#9794;).
"I was so scared.
I was not drinking my medicine.
So, I was so angry, why       me!
Only me!
Why was HIV in my body?"
(&#9792;).
"When I found out I was HIV       positive, I didn't want to tell my parents and my friends, because I was       afraid.
I felt that if they knew my HIV status they would chase me away"       (&#9792;).
"It's very challenging to see your friends coming from hospital,       they have a negative status, and you are the only one who is positive."
(&#9794;).
They also commented on the impact of the workshop: "I used to be       confused.
But now I'm not confused because there are other people who have       the same problem" (&#9794;).
"I feel happy... because they shared my problem"       (&#9792;).
One 19-yr-old who impressed staff as a listener and supporter in       his (HIV+) group has been offered a part-time job at the HA (with       training) to set up a youth-led support group.
This could not have       happened without the workshop.5-5,5-6,5-7     Nature of the impact: The workshops have made an impact on       the health and quality of life of teenagers with, or at grave risk       of, HIV.5-5,5-7 The activities have affected their attitude,         awareness and behaviour, and make a major contribution to WU's work       in creating new opportunities for empowerment and a positive       future.5-5 The main claim made here is for significance,       in creating life-changing experiences, new peer support networks,       reduction of isolation, improved use of medication for the participants,       and, for one participant, a career opportunity.
Also significant is the       new information for staff, that has enhanced the HA's services for the       entire community.
5-1,5-5 Reach is inevitably more       modest, because of the need for qualified counsellors to work with small       groups and individuals and the associated high costs, which require       fund-raising.5-7 Nevertheless, Workshop 1 was delivered to 175       teenagers between Nov 2012 and Mar 2013, and funding for the next round of       Workshop 2 was secured in Sep 2013.
Although limited, the reach is       effective: "I would confidently say that as a result of Comic Strip more       youth have accessed HIV testing and counselling.
"(McGilvray)5-4       Additional reach occurred when, in Mar 2013, McGilvray ran       Workshops 1 &amp; 2 at the WU Health Academy in the Sahel region of North       Ghana, with 20 participants aged 12-14.5-3,5-5 The materials       remain at the clinic, so repeat workshops can run.
