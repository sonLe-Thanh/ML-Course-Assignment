     (a) Impact on veterinary practitioners     This research has changed the way that veterinary practitioners across       the world have recognised       and treated CP in dogs over the past 5-10 years, improving the quality of       life of affected dogs.
Testimonials from veterinary surgeons in the UK, France and the USA (Refs       6 a, b and c in section       5) all corroborate the fact that this research has fundamentally changed       their recognition and       treatment of CP in dogs.
Prior to our clinical study, detailed in section       2, CP was not recognised by       practising veterinary surgeons as a common cause of chronic relapsing       gastrointestinal disease,       pain, EPI and DM.
Watson's work has changed veterinary treatment of       affected dogs &#8212; particularly       the recognition of pain and consequent analgesia, changing to low fat       diets and giving enzyme       supplementation to dogs with EPI.
This has profoundly improved their       quality of life and in some       cases has led to the avoidance of euthanasia on humane grounds.
The       managing director of       Davies Veterinary Specialists, one of the largest veterinary referral       centres in Europe, himself a       specialist in small animal medicine, has provided a testimonial and noted       in November 2012 that: `I         can honestly say your work has changed how I think about the role of         chronic pancreatic disease in         older dogs and how I practice'.
This can be entirely attributed to       the work of Watson and       colleagues.
There were no previous publications on CP in dogs apart from       single case reports.
The       only other group working on canine CP in the world published their first       paper on the disease in       dogs in the Veterinary Journal in 2013.
This supported the findings of       Watson and colleagues and       did not add anything new to impact disease treatment.
The results of the research have been disseminated by the authors,       through many lectures to       practising veterinary surgeons in the UK, USA and Europe, including annual       lectures for two of the       main continuing professional development providers in the UK (Improve CPD       and the British Small       Animal Veterinary Association (BSAVA)); invited lectures for: BSAVA       Congress Birmingham 2010;       BVA Congress London 2011; European College of Veterinary Internal Medicine       Congress Ghent       2011; an abstract at the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine       congress in New       Orleans in 2012 and lectures sponsored by major dog food companies: Royal       Canin, in France and       Brazil in 2010 and Eukanuba in Norway in September 2013.
Over the impact       period, Watson has       made major contributions to small-animal medicine textbooks used by       veterinary surgeons in first-opinion       practice, updating the sections on pancreatitis since 2008 to stress breed       relationships and       the importance of CP as a cause of EPI in dogs.
Watson contributed the       entire section on liver and       pancreas disease in Nelson and Couto's Small Animal Internal Medicine (4th       edition, 2008), a       leading textbook on Small Animal Medicine for veterinary students and       practising veterinary       surgeons.
Watson also contributed sections on pancreatitis in the BSAVA       Manual of Clinical       Pathology (2nd edition; 2005) and the BSAVA Manual of Canine       and Feline Rehabilitation,       Supportive and Palliative Care (1st Edition 2010).
An invited       review in a popular USA Open Access,       practitioner-focussed review journal has widened impact to veterinary       practitioners in the USA       (Watson PJ.
Topical Review: Chronic pancreatitis in dogs.
Topics in         Companion Animal Medicine       27: 133-139).
(b) Impact on owners and breeders of affected dogs     This work has had far-reaching impact on owners and breeders of affected       dogs, particularly in       high-risk breeds (English Cocker Spaniel and CKCS).
The results of the       research have been       disseminated by Watson, talking at breed society meetings and via internet       sites.
In October 2011,       Dr Watson engaged with English Cocker Spaniel health co-ordinators at a       large breed seminar to       promote the research.
The Cocker Spaniel Breed Council now lists Chronic       Pancreatitis in the       `Health schemes and Research' section of their website (listed in section       5:5) directly as a result of       this research and are asking for breeders to contact us if their dog       suffers from CP.
A Cocker       Spaniel breeder has raised funds specifically for the research by       producing a leaflet and selling       home-made brooches (`Norbert's Ribbon'), demonstrating their commitment to       helping.
CKCS breeders are increasingly recognizing CP in their dogs, allowing       more effective treatment by       their veterinary surgeons.
References to CP appear on a number of CKCS       health websites,       referencing our work, and increasing awareness of the disease in the       breed.
For example, the       website `Cavalier Matters' has been written by breeders, demonstrating       their engagement with the       problem and their wish to advertise it further amongst breeders and owners       (see link in section       5:5).
The breeder who runs this web-site has also given a testimonial       (section 5:6e) saying: `We         hope that Penny's research will one day elucidate the cause of this         horrible disease in the         breed....Meanwhile, just recognizing the disease goes a long way towards         allowing treatment to         improve the quality of life of these lovely little dogs and we can thank         Penny for allowing this to         happen'.
This breeder is helping Watson's research by developing a       health questionnaire to be       filled in by owners when they donate bodies of dead CKCSs for PM.
We are       coordinating this       tissue collection scheme with other researchers investigating spinal cord       and heart disease       elsewhere in the UK (see website referenced in section 5:5).
Increased awareness in owners that their animals may suffer from CP has       increased the likelihood       that they will present to their veterinary surgeon when necessary.
This is       evidenced by the breeder       testimonials and the large number of emails and phone calls for advice now       received by Watson       from veterinary surgeons in practice.
Impact on owners in the USA is       evidenced by Watson's       contribution to an American website for owners of dogs with EPI which has       resulted in many emails       from owners in the USA and UK.
The owner forum demonstrates the reach of       the impact and this       is referenced in bullet 4, section 5.
(c) Impact on Industry: marketing of diets and nutraceuticals     The results of this research have changed the way that nutraceutical and       veterinary nutrition       companies market their products.
VetPlus, a global leader in veterinary       nutraceuticals and a major       supplier of pancreatic enzyme supplements used to treat dogs with EPI in       the UK, re-wrote their       brochure to include end-stage CP as an important cause of EPI in addition       to pancreatic acinar       atrophy, as a direct result of Watson's work (section 5:1).
They have       produced a newsletter based       on Watson's work to use in marketing their product to increase awareness       amongst veterinary       surgeons that EPI can occur as an end stage of CP and thus in older dogs       of breeds other than       German Shepherds (section 5:1).
Eukanuba (Proctor &amp; Gamble Pet Care),       a major veterinary       clinical diet manufacturer, has noted that Dr Watson's work has had a       significant impact on the way       they market their low fat diets.
The Communications Manager for this       company, based in Geneva,       stated in October 2013: `This work has definitely led to more emphasis         in the marketing our         intestinal diet for chronic pancreatitis.
This diet, at only 10% fat,         has been formulated to meet the         recommendation of containing low fat.
I have also used the data, both         published and personal         communication shared by Dr Watson at a number of European congresses and         seminars, to help         promote the usage of this diet with general practitioners for the         optimal management of         pancreatitis.
Additionally, the prevalence of chronic pancreatitis in         the canine population, as         elucidated by Dr Watson's work, provides a strong impetus for our         company to continue         communicating to the veterinary profession about this important         disease....'.
(Ref 5.7c).
This       company subsequently ran a lecture tour of day meetings in September 2013       in Norway for       Veterinary Surgeons with Dr Watson as the keynote lecturer entitled:       `Chronic pancreatitis in the       dog: the rediscovery of a forgotten disease'.
The communications manager       stated: `We had a         tremendous response from the veterinarians and the tour attracted a         large number of delegates to         each talk.
The information shared by Dr Watson was of great clinical use         to those attending and         has been very influential in promoting the use of a low fat diet as part         of the management protocol.'
