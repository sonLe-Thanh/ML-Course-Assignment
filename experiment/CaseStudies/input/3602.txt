     The research has led to changes in government policy regarding adoption,       and achieved direct impacts on the provision of services and practice for       disabled children and their families.
As a direct result of the team's adoption activity day evaluations, the       Department for Education (DfE) announced in December 2012 that these       activity days would become part of the government's adoption reform agenda       and be rolled out across England and Wales [A].
By June 2013, a       total of 170 children had attended adoption days, and 29 children have       been placed &#8212; highlighting the life-changing significance of these events       for these children and their adoptive families.
The DfE also used finding from another MMU project, Does Every Child         Matter, post-Blair?
as part of an on-line training package for       teachers of pupils with profound and multiple learning disabilities.
[B]       The package was made available online in 2012 (The DfE has been unable to       confirm download figures).
As part of the same research project, the MMU team were invited by the       Derbyshire Parent Forum to evaluate short break provision for disabled       children in Derbyshire and present their findings at the Parent Forum       conference in 2011.
Derbyshire County Council acknowledged the importance       of these findings and re-commissioned short breaks as a result, despite       funding constraints.
[C]     Another part of the same project involved evaluating the performance Something         in the Air?
for the Oily Cart Theatre Company &#8212; a play using       multi-sensory approaches to engage even children whose disabilities       normally prevent such engagement.
Oily Cart used the MMU evaluation to       secure a Children In Need grant of over &#163;53,000 early in 2013 to enable       them to deliver further such work to 800 disabled children per year over       three years.
[D] The evaluation also helped Oily Cart secure       funding from other charities and the Arts Council of England.
The College of Social Work, a professional body that exists to ensure the       highest possible standards in social work, quoted the post Blair       findings on disabled children and identity in its 2013 Curriculum         Guide: Disability, which provides guidance on the content of social       work degree programmes.
[E]     As a result of the post-Blair project, Goodley and Runswick-Cole       were invited to speak at the first Office for Disability Issues Evidence       Gathering Day in 2011, attended by around 100 delegates from different       government departments.
Goodley and Runswick-Cole's work [3.5] was       also used by the Leeds Educational Psychology Team (part of Leeds City       Council) in 2012 [F], as part of their work supporting the       professional development of practitioners.
The Autism Education Trust cited the research in their pamphlet, So         what exactly is autism?
in 2012.
[G]     The team published their post-Blair findings in a range of       practitioner magazines and journals, including Nursery World (2009);         SEN magazine (2010); and Community Care magazine (2010)).
As       a result, Runswick-Cole was invited to write a regular column on inclusion       for Nursery World [H], which attracts 103,000 on-line       subscribers.
Runswick-Cole and Goodley jointly authored an article for       Learning Disability Today magazine (2011) with a 15-year-old who had been       involved in the post Blair project.
The Resilience research for Scope has, in the words of the       charity, "become a core part of Scope's new strategy and it has also         helped inform our plans around service transformation."
(February       2013).
[I] The toolkit developed as part of the project was used       by disabled young people to develop a "Guide to Life" (April 2013) [J].
Early in 2013, the MMU team completed a feasibility study to explore how       the paper-based tool kit can be made available on an accessible digital       platform.
To raise awareness and understanding of disability issues and the       research findings amongst the general public, the team launched a YouTube       channel in 2008, which by the end of July 2013 had received over 7,252       views.
The research team have also discussed their findings in the local and       national media (Goodley, Meet the Prof, BBC Radio Manchester       October 2008; Runswick-Cole, Today, BBC Radio 4; Radio 5 live         Victoria Derbyshire (including discussion with listeners); BBC         Radio Scotland Drivetime and The Times newspaper (all 26th       October, 2012).
The team actively engaged with the users of their research through 4       stakeholder workshops for a total of 30 social workers, carers, adoptive       parents and others between 2009 and 2012.
Participant feedback was       collected on film after one adoption workshop in 2012, with one social       worker participant speaking for many when she said that it helped her       decide to be part of adoption activity days in the future.
