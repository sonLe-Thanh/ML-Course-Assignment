     The concepts, overall CAE approach and supporting analytical models have       been taken up in the nuclear, financial, aviation and medical sectors.
While simple in concept, the CAE approach requires a shift from a       prescriptive box-ticking to a clear statement of the top-level assurance       claims or goals which are progressively broken down into sub-claims with       each supported by convincing evidence.
CSR has a long-established collaboration with Adelard LLP, a company       specialising in system and safety assurance with two staff jointly       employed by Adelard and City.
The concepts and models developed by CSR       have had direct impact through Adelard LLP's application to assurance       cases for a variety of real systems, supported via Adelard's tool, ASCE,       for the development and management of assurance cases and safety cases       (www.adelard.com/asce/choosing-asce/index.html).
This tool has been       licensed to many industry users to produce their own assurance cases       (around two thousand user licences have been issued).
The following quote from Adelard summarises the impact of the CAE       approach on the nuclear industry:     "CAE is core to the Generic Design Assessment of nuclear plant design         for new build in the UK.
The approach was considered so successful that         it is stated as one of the major risk reduction factors for new build in         the UK by EDF and Areva and it is being considered by other countries         (e.g., Sweden) for their own nuclear new build.
CAE is also common         practice in the nuclear industry in the UK for existing plant, and all         their safety justifications follow this approach (although not all cases         use graphical representations).
Recently, there has been a push by other         nuclear regulators to adopt CAE, and we see it being used and defended         as a project risk mitigation in some of the largest software safety         projects in the nuclear industry, including Sweden, Finland and China."
&#8212; Sofia Guerra (Partner Adelard LLP)     In response to increasing and unacceptable fatalities and incidents       (several hundred per year) related to infusion pumps, used to deliver       fluids for nutrition or medication in healthcare, in 2010 the US Food and       Drugs Administration (FDA) called explicitly for a new approach and the       use of assurance cases and CAE by manufacturers to support the safe use of       these vital medical devices11 CSR staff are currently working       with the FDA on developing templates for use on medical devices with       formal research collaboration in the process of approval.
Following the application of the CAE and dependability case approach       between 2004 and 2006 to a UK electronic funds transfer system (BACS)       (classified by the Government as part of the UK critical infrastructure),       two further electronic fund transfer systems were assessed using the CAE       approach in 2009 and 2011: the Department of Work and Pensions Emergency       Payment System and an immediate payment system (IPS) for medium size       countries.
This involved both reasoning relating to the overall risks from       deploying the system and use of some of the underlying models on       conservative worst case bounds developed by CSR.
These systems were all       deployed successfully under tight project timescale constraints.
In addition, CAE has been used:            To structure the safety assurance evidence produced for the rail         interlocking and signalling system to be installed on part of the West         Coast Main Line (2005).
This case was accepted and the rail interlocking         and signalling system has been operated successfully since that time.
In the security assessment of large critical UK information         infrastructures in 2009, funded by the Communications-Electronics         Security Group, the branch of the Government Communications Headquarters         (GCHQ) which works to secure the communications and information systems         of the government and critical parts of British national infrastructure.
The basic concepts have been standardised within the International       Organization for Standardization (ISO/IEC 15026-2, 2011)9 and       work continues within the Object Management Group (OMG), the       not-for-profit computer industry standards consortium; and the Open Group,       a global consortium which leads the development of open IT standards and       certifications, which has harmonised the structures used in CAE and Goal       Structuring Notation (GSN), an additional approach developed by the       University of York.
CSR staff have also disseminated goal-based justification principles into       industry standards in current use:            A UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) Standard for software-based system         safety (Defence Standard 00-56)8, incorporating the safety         assurance concepts from the earlier Defence Standard 00-55, co-authored         by Robin Bloomfield.
This addresses requirements for the management of         safety in MoD projects to be used by Defence Contractors.
While a new         version of Defence Standard 00-56 is due for an update in 2013/14, the         same approach to safety is expected to be retained.
The Civil Aviation Authority Regulatory Objectives for Software Safety         Assurance in Air Traffic Services (ATS) Equipment defines the assurances         to be provided for an ATS system to enter service (in relation to         people, procedures and equipment) including the behaviour of software.
The document makes explicit use of CAE standards in the assessment of         software for Air Traffic Management computer systems (CAA CAP670 SW01)7         via Bishop and Bloomfield.
The FDA guidance applying to infusion pumps as previously mentioned12         which is now used internationally by manufacturers wishing to sell         infusion pumps in the USA.
Often cases require evidence that the reliability of software is       adequate.
CSR has been heavily involved in the development of such models.
One can make conservative estimates at an early stage (i.e., prior to       development)2 and can derive estimates based on tests applied       to the developed system.1,6 These methods have been       successfully applied in these assurance cases (including the nationally       important BACS fund transfer system mentioned earlier).
The work undertaken by CSR has led to the adoption of the team's       assurance approach, in the form of updated regulations and procedures, as       standard practice in several important industry sectors, leading to       significant and wide-ranging impact on practice and consequent safety and       security of systems.
This has benefited both the industries concerned and       the public who use or are affected by their services.
