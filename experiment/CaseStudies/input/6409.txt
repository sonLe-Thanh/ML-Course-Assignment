     The balls used in elite professional football have been required to       satisfy performance standards       laid down by the FIFA Quality Concept since 1995.
Therefore, in order for       football brands and       manufacturers to improve the commercial success of their products, they       must enhance areas       other than performance, since this is constrained.
Until 2002, the       potential for brands to       fundamentally improve the consumer appeal of footballs was inherently       limited by the       manufacturing process.
The research carried out at Loughborough has       realised a greater       understanding of the relationship between ball design and performance,       which has allowed adidas       to overcome these restrictions.
Given the restrictions on changing ball performance, the research was       instead used to identify and       inform those aspects of design and construction where modifications could       enhance the aesthetic       and tactile beauty of the ball for commercial advantage without       compromising performance.
The impact of the research carried out at Loughborough has been to ensure       that the new       manufacturing method achieved the following:            Ensured that the inner carcass of the ball provided the appropriate         uniform structural rigidity         removing the need for outer panels to provide this function.
Removed constraints of outer panel shapes such that they could be         designed around the         desired graphical imagery.
This means that patterns are now able to         extend across panel         edges, where previously the imperfect alignment of conventional flat         panel assembly led to         misalignment that undermined the quality of appearance.
Allowed outer panels to be manufactured from new materials that can be         assembled without         unevenly straining during inflation, meaning the ball is more spherical         and has improved tactile         feel.
Maintained ball flight performance through the conception and         implementation of aero-grooves,         where increased outer panels sizes introduced for commercial advantage         had potential to         detrimentally affect ball aerodynamics          These advantages have been realised sequentially by adidas in major       tournament footballs.
The       Teamgeist ball used in the 2006 World Cup was the first to include       the new carcass and curved       panels whilst satisfying all FIFA Quality standards to the highest       certifiable level.
It was       commercially successful, returning sales of 15 million units compared to 2       million sold in 2002       [5.1].
In 2008, the research reported in Cotton's PhD thesis (2008) led directly       to the inclusion of a       surface texture on the Europass ball used in the UEFA Euro 2008       tournament.
For the 2010 Jabulani ball, Loughborough research [3.3,3.4,3.5]       led directly to the inclusion of       aero-grooves on the surface that were designed to maintain flight       stability; they are protected by a       patent [3.6] on which Dr Harland is named as co-author.
In       addition to the tournaments mentioned,       derivatives of these balls have also been used for Olympics, Champions       League and various       national leagues around the world.
The success of this approach has led to ball patterns influencing design       themes across clothing,       stadia and media throughout each tournament.
Therefore the consequential       impact of this research       is likely to be greater than that claimed, but is difficult to       substantiate.
Sales figures of major tournament footballs are highly sensitive and not       made public due to the       nature of the sponsorship agreements between brands and tournament       organisers, with adidas       reported to be paying $351 million to FIFA for the 2010 and 2014 World Cup       tournaments alone.
As a result sales figures are collated from media reports and press       releases but indicate that       during the period of Loughborough's research, sales of the adidas match       balls and their replicas       have increased tenfold &#8212; from two million in 2002 to an estimated 20       million in 2010 [5.1,5.2].
The       2010 World Cup made a significant contribution to adidas revenues, with       the relevant financial       quarter in 2010 generating $3.47B, more than $0.58B higher than the $2.89B       generated in the       equivalent quarter in 2009 [5.3].
These gains have been supported       by the raised awareness of       engineering innovation achieved via media coverage of the tournament &#8212;       more than 2.2 billion       people watched more than 20 continuous minutes of TV coverage during the       2010 tournament       [5.4] &#8212; and specific coverage of the research.
Dr Harland completed       more than 60 interviews with       international broadcasters, including ESPN, BBC and CNN, resulting in       coverage totalling more       than &#163;1M in AVE (Advertising Value Equivalent).
This engagement extended       across hard to reach       demographics, such as the ~5 million young people who consciously chose to       engage with       technical films and information on the adidas Facebook site [5.5].
In summary, the research cited in this case study has resulted in a step       change in the commercial       success of a significant product in a global sport leading to huge       economic benefits for a       multinational company.
