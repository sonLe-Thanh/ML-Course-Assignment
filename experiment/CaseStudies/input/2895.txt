     Pathways to Impact: As noted, the underpinning research itself       had a direct impact in the       participating community, with Moston Vale transformed into a country park       (with &#163;1.7m funding       from Newlands programme) based on the plan developed with residents.
Following the primary       research, more organisations requested workshops with the toolkit,       providing the impetus to set up       a social business to extend the impact of the research.
Three grants from       the UoM Sustainable       Consumption Institute (2008-2010, &#163;316,451), looking to embed       sustainability skills and knowledge       in the workplace, enabled further refinement through engaging with 250       Tesco staff.
The Head of       Pay and Rewards at Tesco commented: "This is the sort of tool that         Tesco employees really like to         use &#8212; hands on, visual and it lets everyone shape the outcomes"       [1][2].
Scope: The impacts from Ketso's use in environmental planning have       been followed with impacts       around community planning, enterprise, health and wellbeing, social       inclusion and pedagogy, with       &gt;100 case studies documented [1].
In an anonymous survey of customers       (2012), 88% of users       cited substantive benefits, with Ketso seen as more inclusive than       traditional methods.
Comments       included: "It helped create a warm collaborative atmosphere, excellent         debate, clear priorities and         an excellent record of the process and results; and "It's more         inclusive and helps people to         communicate, take in one another's ideas, see connections".
The form       of the kit was important:       "More engaging &#8212; easy to distinguish between different ideas/themes         with the different leaves";       indeed, if not for Ketso 62% said they would use flip charts and post-it       notes, and 38% would use       traditional meetings and workshops, or dialogue techniques such as world       caf&#233;.
Comments on the       value of the toolkit for facilitators included: "It combines the         principles behind parallel thinking (six         hats), appreciative enquiry, etc.
in one simple, accessible and low-tech         process"; and "Ketso is         unique, it's easy to explain how it works and what people have to do"       [3].
Similarly, a recent public       sector and NGO workshop produced a "shared agreement that Ketso is         unique in its ability to not         only surface new thoughts but also to provide a credible and traceable         evidence base for         recommendations that emerge from consultation" [5]; and the Social       Marketing Officer from South       Lanarkshire Community Links stated that: "Using the Ketso toolkit         gives those using it a `voice' and         the leaves acts like giving each participant a `microphone' to use as a         platform for discussion" [1].
Range: Ketso is used in 27 countries, including: Peru, Cameroon,       Russia, Australia, USA and       Germany [1].
Over 300 customers use 530 kits, in high-profile       organisations such as Merseycare       NHS and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA).Equality       Network In total, &gt;8,000       people have used Ketso, including 3325 participants in 125 events run by       the Ketso team.
Over 65       universities use Ketso in research, staff development and teaching, with       Dr. Tippett awarded a       2011 AESOP Teaching Excellence Prize in part due to the innovation of       Ketso in teaching [4].
Ketso has changed professional practice, with independent survey       respondents confirming this:       "We have used it to change the way we run certain meetings" and         "Outside partners have         described our meetings as fun and highly productive."
Changes cited       as a result of using Ketso       include: "Effectively re-balanced workload between team members;         resulted in problem areas         rising to the surface"; "An ineffective Student Council has transformed         itself and is now very active         and engaged!
"; "It helped to invigorate and re-develop a scrutiny         liaison committee that serves a         number of councils"; "Generated a new policy around PhD examination.
Altered policy and practice         on plagiarism for PGT"; and "Process review and enhancement of         university administrative         processes" [3].
In all cases users indicated Ketso was chosen       because it enables groups to work       together to achieve better shared outcomes, and in less time than       traditional approaches.
For       instance, a National School of Government event (Civil Service Live) in       2011 involved two hundred       civil servants in discussions on the future of learning in the public       sector.
The subsequent report       referenced the key role of Ketso, highlighting its basis in research [4].
A networking event in Scotland with 11 customers identified 50 outcomes       or benefits from using       Ketso, including improved: research, training, procedures and guidelines,       service design and       understanding between teams of roles, remits and resources.
A specific       example was: "Defined         divisional aim; objectives identified to action for upcoming year (it'         is a good way to identify that all         staff are reaching for the same outcome)" [1].
The Head of Refugee       Integration, Scottish Refugee       Council commented, "Asset based planning has been discussed for many         years, and this is one of         the few times that I have actually seen it work in practice.
I feel         strongly that our sector, and others,         often focus on vulnerability to the neglect of recognising resilience:         this tool provides a safeguard         against this trap.
[For example] the RiSC thematic working groups, where         unexpected         opportunities and goals were identified...
I believe if that we had not         used Ketso as a participation         and engagement tool these may not have been identified or been so         prominent.
I have seen how         the kit can help generate innovation, moving people from a position of         cynicism to one of fresh         thinking and energy... You have a way to manage the dominant voices that         is powerful and         unusual in my experience of participatory processes" [5].
A key       issue discussed was how Ketso       and its spreadsheet allows you to see issues emerging in the data that       would not otherwise be       visible, enabling identification of patterns, "surprising themes from         the synthesis of participants'         ideas that may run counter to the dominant power structures and         perceived wisdom" [5].
The       physicality of Ketso gives everyone a voice, allowing blending of       technical and lay information       through co-production, which generates innovation and knowledge that       `sticks'.
Planning: Ketso is featured as a method in the latest edition of       the `Community Planning       Handbook', and was the key engagement tool in Renfrewshire Council's       Community Planning       Conference in 2011, in which 458 community members developed over 2000       ideas for the future       plan.
A Council Policy Officer confirms this: "The majority of         participants agreed that this workshop         format gave everyone a voice and took the pressure off facilitators."
98% of participants responded       positively to the question: `Do you agree that the workshop allowed       participants to work together,       share ideas and be creative?'
(n=293), with comments such as: "I found         this year's workshops to         be a much better concept, much more involvement from whole group"       [6].
An action plan       developed from the outputs was a driver for a `Community Plan Review', and       Renfrewshire has       since used Ketso with 323 senior managers in their 2012 Managers'       Seminars, and other       workshops seeking to implement ideas from the 2011 Conference.
In 2012       there were 15 requests       from other services and partners to use the Ketso kits owned by the Chief       Executive's Service, with       the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) inviting Renfrewshire       to discuss Ketso in       community planning with 68 public sector delegates [6].
When asked to whom       they would       recommend Ketso, one survey customer commented "the whole of Scotland,         because it works and         it's brilliant" [3].
Ketso was also used in RTPI NW CPD with 30       planners, subsequently being       awarded a commendation in 2013 from the RTPI NW for its "contribution         towards positive         community engagement" [6].
Vulnerable Communities: The Scottish Government, Scottish Refugee       Council and COSLA used       Ketso as the key engagement tool for the `Refugees in Scotland's       Communities' project (2012-13)       that brought together groups of experts to consider refugee integration       [7].
The Scottish       Government's `Equality and Diversity' and `National Records' teams       requested training in 2013 to       develop the use of Ketso for internal and external engagement.
Similarly,       Glasgow Refugee,       Asylum and Migration Network (GRAMNet) have used Ketso extensively in       research and       engagement across Scotland, as well as in Russia, Jordan and Gaza.
GRAMNet's co-director       comments: "Most research methods make vulnerable people feel like they         are in a deportation         interview, but with Ketso people feel they can genuinely explore ideas         together" [7], with the annual       report noting that, "the research and conception behind Ketso has         enabled GRAMNet to devise         innovative partnerships and projects and harness the creative capacity         of its members", leading to       &#163;5 million of successful funding bids [7].
Ketso has been widely used in       health and social care;       such as in 13 NHS Trusts, including Merseyside.
Environmental Management: Countryscape has used Ketso to engage       with stakeholders, from       landscape character assessments to developing a climate change strategy       for Manchester [8].
Their Creative Director comments: "I would estimate that we have run         workshops with over 1000         participants with Ketso.
We have found that Ketso is a fantastic tool         that has greatly improved how         we manage workshops, consultations and community planning events... most         importantly it         produces results that are clear and can be acted upon" [8].
Using       Ketso led to Johannesburg's       Environmental Management Department being awarded a `Clean and Green       Campaign' award for       the best community development programme in the Gauteng province [1].
Ketso was also seen as       central to the success of Wandle River Trust's catchment planning       workshops [8].
Social Business: Ketso was developed as a case study in social       enterprise [9] and includes open-       source resources to support customers and invite further innovation.
Nine       training videos have       made the rationale behind Ketso more widely available, and four external       organisations have made       videos about Ketso.
Together, these videos have been downloaded 7,990       times since 2010       (www.youtube.com/ketsoltd).
The Ketso website has had 18,677 unique viewers and 27,550 visits       (11/2010 - 9/2013, Google Analytics) with the Ketso Twitter account       attracting 297 followers       (@KetsoLtd, 3/2013-7/2013).
Ketso was also showcased at an `Enterprise       Educators UK Best       Practice' event (2010), and following Ketso's role in ESRC/EPSRC       enterprise training, it was used       with 100 delegates at the International Enterprise Educators' Conference       (2011) [1].
As a business,       Ketso generates revenue and creates employment, locally and       internationally (in manufacturing,       office-work and training).
Turnover for the last four years was &#163;175,000,       with components sourced       from ethical suppliers in India and Bangladesh.
Assembly is undertaken at       Paperworks, a sheltered       workshop in Leeds, where Ketso has also been used in skills development       for employees with       learning disabilities.
A Paperworks trainee commented: "We used Ketso         to do a trainee lesson, it         was fantastic, I did not even lose concentration" [1].
The Managing       Director of Motif (a fair-trade       Ketso supplier) confirms: "We have also used Ketso with partners in         Bangladesh, for example with         OASIS, an organisation based in Dhaka, which works on issues of human         trafficking.
They were         very impressed at how the kit helped them find direction using         everyone's ideas more readily than         previous methods they had used" [9].
