     Background: In 2009, Jacoby was invited to IWMN to give a talk to       large group of educators and museum professionals, all involved in       developing curricula in the area of conflict studies.
His presentation &#8212;       `The Problem with Peace' &#8212; problematised `how to' questions of conflict       resolution, which had traditionally presumed that lowering the intensity       of violence would serve as an end in itself.
The feedback was excellent,       and Jacoby was asked to co-curate the two audio-visual displays that would       make up the core of the BTT initiative [1].
By drawing on his research       findings, and working collaboratively with both museum staff and       professional film makers, he guided BTT &#8212; launched on the `International       Day of Peace' (21st September 2011) as part of the London       Games' `Olympic Truce' programme &#8212; towards a greater emphasis upon the       ethical and political challenges of disarmament, demobilisation,       re-integration and peace-building.
Pathways to Impact: Working with the HCRI, ten key individuals       with experience of living and working in conflict-affected countries were       interviewed at length.
These included former prisoners such as Seanna       Walsh (IRA) and Jackie McDonald (UDA), both now involved in Northern Irish       peace initiatives; former UoM MA student Courtny Edwards, who had worked       for a health NGO in a displaced persons' camps during the Sierra Leonean       civil war; and Professor Tony Redmond (HCRI co-founder), who led aid teams       in Kosovo following NATO attacks in 1999 [1].
Alongside IWMN, Jacoby       selected and awarded a &#163;55,000 contract to a specialist production company       (The Soup Collective) to develop audio-visual display material to       accompany the interviews; their director commenting that Jacoby's "expertise         and judgement were essential to the direction of the final films...
Both         our company and the Museum benefitted greatly from this collaboration         and established a co-production model that was an improvement on the         past and an example for the future" [2].
Throughout, Jacoby       maintained responsibility for academic content and developing learning       objectives, and was lead press contact for media enquiries throughout the       IWML run.
The Exhibitions: With more than 1.3 million visitors a year across       its two main sites (London and Manchester), the IWM is well placed to       extend academic research to a broader audience.
The BTT project is one of       the largest and most prestigious ever undertaken at the IWM, and was       unusual as it ran in both London and Manchester venues, "recognising         the very different environments and identities of the two sites", as       well as initiating supplementary events at other IWM locations [1].
It was       funded from the organisation as a whole, with matched funding secured from       the DCMS.
The overall budget (for the period 2009-13) was around &#163;500,000       [1].
Accompanying the exhibition were a series of four continuing       professional development (CPD) events (October 2010 - September 2012)       reviewing and discussing the issues that BTT raises.
IWML: The BTT interactive multimedia display was exhibited at the       IWML in the prestigious B11 gallery (May 24th until September       23rd 2012) and "the touchscreen installation is now a         permanent feature of the museum's research/resource area on the ground         floor" [1].
In including this project in the Olympic Truce       Programme, and awarding it the Inspire kitemark, Lord Coe (Chair of       LOGOC), noted that "projects like Build the Truce use the power of the         Games to inspire change."
[4].
During the May launch of the IWML       exhibition the Head of Conflict Department at the Foreign and Commonwealth       Office, and author of the Government's `Building Stability Overseas       Strategy' stated that BTT "gave the public exactly the right message         regarding the complexities of post-conflict situations" [1]; later       noting that he: "felt the project was successful in capturing the         complexity of peace as not as simply the absence of war...
It also         underlined the need for international interventions to fully consider         the needs of local people...
It certainly succeeded in raising awareness         of the difficulties encountered during periods of truce and gave the         public exactly the right message regarding the complexities of post         conflict situations" He also affirmed that BTT "made a useful         contribution to HMG's broader work on the Olympic Truce in 2012",       with the project also featuring prominently on the FCO's `Olympic Truce'       web-feed [5].
Visitor numbers during the Olympic period were estimated to       be around 250,000, with around 30% (75,000) visiting B11.
The exhibition       was covered by the national press, with an article in the Daily Mirror       noting that: "With images from Iraq, El Salvador, Sierra Leone, Kosovo         Northern Ireland and others, [BTT] uses touch-screens to explain         how a truce can have far-reaching effects.
The soundtrack, made up of         eyewitness interviews, offers a compelling insight from a huge variety         of people from soldiers to medics and civilians" [6].
Supporting events were held, including a discussion session facilitated       by the London Boroughs Faith Network in June 2012, involving both Conrad       Bailey and Lord Michael Bates, who undertook a 3000 mile `Walk for Truce',       from Olympia to London, and an array of British Council backed classroom       activities for 11-16 year olds [7].
Lastly, as part of IWML's 2012       `International Day of Peace' programme (22nd September 2012),       Jacoby chaired a BTT workshop entitled `Starting in Neutral: What does       Neutrality Mean or Matter in 21st Century Humanitarian Conflict Response?'
This public event, reviewing BTT as a whole and considering `lessons       learnt', was held in IWML's largest auditorium, and included contributions       from: the Executive Director of Conciliation Resources who commended BTT       as "an effective way of reaching out to members of the British public - particularly those outside the peacebuilders' specialist-loop...         introduce[ing] some complexity into the discussion" [8]; the       Director of Programmes at International Alert; the Head of the M&#233;decins         Sans Fronti&#232;res Programmes Unit; and the UK spokesperson from the       International Committee of the Red Cross, who welcomed further       collaboration with Jacoby and remarked that he was "impressed by how         `Build the Truce' problematised conflict resolution, particularly via         the innovative use of audio-visual displays...
The project was clearly         effective, particularly in the manner through which research findings         were crafted to reach audiences who would not necessarily have fully         considered these issues beforehand... [BTT &amp; BPS] offer a         useful model for the presentation and discussion of difficult themes,         presenting... public engagement, through the formation of relationships         between public institutions, NGOs and academic institutions" [9].
IWMN: The BPS is a major selling point for IWMN, shown hourly in       the main exhibition space designed by renowned architect Daniel Libeskind,       presenting "the personal stories of those caught up in conflict,         narrating the experiences of ordinary people in extraordinary         situations."
As the IWMN's Director continues "`...Build the         Truce' is a significant and exciting addition to our repertoire.
The         partnership project has been a great success, fitting well with the         purpose and strategies ambitions of IWMN to look at how war and conflict         shapes lives" [3].
BTT has provided `unique pieces' enriching the       IWM archives, and it is estimated that a majority of visitors will view at       least one example of the BPS during their visit (69% of visitors saw a BPS       in 2010).
Footfall estimates predict that around 40,000 people visited       IWMN during the initial exhibition period (July &#8212; October 2012), where the       film was supplemented with two workstations in the `Your History' area on       the ground floor, with touchscreens showing interview clips, alongside       arranged tours [3].
The numbers of visitors seeing the film remains considerable.
Since 15th       July 2012, it has been granted a prime slot (initially 2pm daily; now       weekends and bank holidays) in the BPS permanent programme (n.b.
annual visits to IWMN are in excess of 350,000)[3].
To supplement the BPS,       Jacoby worked with Radiowaves, a market leader in educational social       media; through the network generated, he and museum staff have distributed       a range of resources drawn from the core research to schools and colleges       throughout the country, including supplementary video materials &#8212; with       requests for copies made by museums in Canada and schools in Italy &#8212; and       bookable school sessions [1].
The Radiowaves collaboration has involved a       number of focus groups, the recruiting of further delegates (mainly       schoolteachers) to IWMN events and additional (broadcast) interviews with       academics, peace activists and journalists.
Selected weekends have also       been used by IWMN staff to facilitate activities for young children based       around the idea of "call[ing] a truce, whatever your         differences".
Young visitors to the museum were invited to watch the       BPS, and then hear `a slimy story of slugs, snails and truce time         tales' finding out `what united the slugs and snails in this         funny and inspiring tale of truce', and subsequently making a unique       artwork based on their view of the stories presented.
IWMN noted that       event feedback was positive, confirming also that: "Project         activities... were developed, piloted, delivered, evaluated and absorbed         into permanent programmes" over the four years of the programme       [1][3].
In 2014 BTT will also make up a key part the `Aftermaths of War'       programme at the John Rylands Library, Deansgate.
Evaluation &amp; Legacy: Jacoby was able to secure UoM funding in       order to thoroughly evaluate the impact of the displays, as well as gauge       visitor perceptions more generally.
Interviews were conducted with 263       individuals at both sites, and it was revealed that 73% of those       interviewed had watched the whole film, with 64% per cent of viewers       reporting that the film had changed their perception of truces, and 65%       stating that the issue was more complicated than they had previously       imagined.
Selected comments included: "Truce isn't always peace"; I         didn't realise how hard things are after war"; and "Before, I         thought [truce] was always effective and well sorted out &#8212; but         after watching the film, I've changed my mind".
Most importantly,       the evaluation revealed that 56% of interviewees thought that the BTT had       changed their view of the IWM itself, noting that for visitors "the         BTT display added another dimension to their experience and feelings of         the Imperial War Museum".
The most common reason cited was that the       exhibition moved away from a focus on the execution of war, towards a more       subtle consideration of the less obvious aspects associated with the       aftermath of conflict.
The report concluded that "there was the general         feeling that the museum was moving forward and `continues to grow and         evolve'", and this observation was attributed not only to the BPS,       but also the interactive and visual components of the IWML exhibition,       with 85% stating that the presence of eyewitness experience within the       film was `important' or `very important' in shaping their overall       perception of the display.
Finally, the success of the exhibitions has       been recognised by IWM staff, with the evaluation itself showing that half       of respondents saw BTT as positively affecting their view of the IWM as a       whole.
It was also notable that the touch-screens were not seen as       central to the exhibition; 78% of viewers did not use them, yet 73% of         those interviewed watched the whole of the film       [10, passim].
It has been recognised that "installing temporary exhibitions at both         IWM's main exhibition venues was a unique decision reflecting the         project's value and importance to IWM's developing brand identity and         mission statement."
As a result of these successful engagements, the       IWMN director invited Jacoby to join the IWMN `Academic Network' to advise       the museum on forthcoming events and medium to long term overall strategy       [1].
Jacoby also presented details of the project to the international       conference: `Challenging Memories: Silence and Empathy in Heritage       Interpretation' (7th - 10th July 2013); the aim of which is to further       solidify the bonds between academia and museum curation, with BTT seen as       an exemplar of this mode of engagement [1][3].
