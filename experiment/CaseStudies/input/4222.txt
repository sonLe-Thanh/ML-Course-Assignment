     Background     Prior to Allain's research, the 1926 definition of slavery had not       previously been utilised by courts of law.
Following the introduction of       the 1926 definition, Slavery was only utilised by the League of Nations       against non-Members, in particular Liberia and Ethiopia.
It was deemed not       to be applicable to Western states because colonial practices were instead       termed `forced labour'.
In the early years of the United Nations, newly       independent states attempted to argue that colonialism and apartheid       should be regarded as slavery.
These efforts were negated by Western       States.
As a result of this stalemate at the international level, slavery       was not considered by courts from 1926 onwards [6].
It was only after the year 2000, as a result of developments in       international criminal law, most notably the establishment of the       International Criminal Court and a number of anti-trafficking conventions,       that the early 21st Century saw courts trying slavery cases for the first       time.
However, in the absence of a clear historical understanding of the       concept, in 2002 and 2005 the European Court of Human Rights and the       International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) came to       diametrically opposed views as to the definition of `slavery'.
The Director of the UK-based leading international anti-slavery NGO,       Anti-Slavery International, Aidan McQuade, has noted that there was "a         fundamental conceptual issue at the heart of focus of Anti-Slavery.
The         very notion of `slavery' was contested, having no true settled meaning.
This has caused discrepancies in reporting parameters, confusion in         advocacy and difficulty in bring awareness to the general public".
With the notion of slavery re-emerging as an important legal, political       and social phenomenon, Allain's research (as attested below) has become       the benchmark for any discussion as to what constitutes contemporary       slavery.
The reach and significance of the impact of his research is evident       across three areas; in the courts, in the world of NGO activism, and in       the policy\funding community.
Legal Impact     Allain's research has become a central reference point in the courts.
By       way of illustration, in 2008 Allain was contacted by the Australian Human       Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, asking whether he had any new       material relating to his research on slavery as they were contemplating       intervening in a case before the supreme court of Australia (known as `the       High Court of Australia').
Allain provided the Commission with an advanced       copy of his book The Slavery Conventions.
On the basis of Allain's       legislative history of the 1926 and 1956 Slavery Conventions, the       Commission intervened[i].
In its ground-breaking 2008 judgment in the case (Tang), the High       Court agreed with Allain's view on the definition of slavery.
Allain's       work is discussed in some detail in the intervention (paras 38- 47), in       the oral proceedings (pages 59-68, 94-103, 110-111, 124-125) and in the       judgement (paras 25-26, 33-34).
As the transcript demonstrates, Allain's       test for establishing whether or not slavery exists in a specific       situation was discussed [ii] and later utilised by the Court in its       judgement.
The High Court noted that it "is important not to debase the         currency of language, or to banalise crimes against humanity, by giving         slavery a meaning that extends beyond the limits set by the text,         context, and purpose of the 1926 Slavery Convention.
In particular it is         important to recognise that harsh and exploitative conditions of labour         do not of themselves amount to slavery.
The term "slave" is sometimes         used in a metaphorical sense to describe victims of such conditions".
The Court continued, by stating that in all countries of the world "legal         ownership of a person is impossible", but that the 1926 definition       was also "concerned with de facto slavery".
The High Court of       Australia then cited Allain's research, and set out the legal test for       determining contemporary slavery that of "effective (although not         legal, for that is impossible) ownership" [iii].
As a result of the Tang judgement underpinned and justified by       Allain's research, individuals are being prosecuted and found guilty of       enslavement.
Before the arguments and subsequent decision in Tang,       nobody in Australia had even been tried for slavery.
Between 2008 and 2013       there have been six cases which have percolated up to the appellant level,       while dozens of cases have been tried to conviction in lower courts [iv].
Civil Society and Policy Impact     In addition to his influence in the legal arena, Allain has also had       significant impact in the civil society and policy community, particularly       in underpinning the lobbying and advocacy work of NGOs.
He is lead author       on the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines on the Legal Parameters of Slavery.
These guidelines were originally written to offer an accessible but       legally accurate guide to the 1926 definition of slavery for use in the       courts.
However, in part because they were written as part of a       collaborative process with key activists and organisations in the field,       they have become the central template around which such organisation       construct their lobbying and advocacy work concerning the lived experience       of contemporary slaves.
Kevin Bales (Co-founder of Free the Slaves, the       leading US-based anti-slavery NGO) has stated: "It is hard to convey         just how important this achievement is today and is likely to be in the         future.
In a fundamental way Allain's definitional guidelines have built         a solid bridge between law and reality, between policy and action"       [vi].
In a similar vein, McQuade, of Anti-Slavery International,       has summed up Allain's contribution by saying: "Allain's research has         given a solid foundation to our work at Anti-Slavery".
McQuade goes on to say that Allain's research on the definition of       slavery has had fundamental and wide ranging impact beyond his       Organisation: "this definition which had not been utilised previously         is now the benchmark which informs not only Anti-Slavery's work, but         increasingly all research, social policy, and advocacy around modern-day         slavery" [v].
Funding Impact     Allain's research is also the foundation upon which a global movement to       eradicate slavery is based.
That movement is an initiative of the       philanthropist Andrew Forrest, who has partnered with the likes of Bill       Gates, Richard Branson and others, to seek to achieve the stated aim of       `eradicating slavery in our life-time' (see: http://www.walkfree.org/).
An initial part of the work of this initiative has been to document the       prevalence of contemporary slavery worldwide.
Of course to make such a       determination the Walkfree initiative needed to have an agreed       definition of what constitutes slavery.
Walkfree have adopted the       Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines as its working definition of slavery       and is producing what is term the annual Global Slavery Index, which       estimates the prevalence of slavery in 162 countries.
The value of that       base-line data &#8212; based on Allain's underpinning research &#8212; is, as the       Attorney General of Canada has made plain, in its capacity to " improve         information sharing and raise greater awareness and provide policy         makers with the foundation they need to prevent and eradicate human         rights violations" [vi].
The Index is part of a broader four-pronged strategy that also includes a       popular movement, business-to-business pressure and the Global Fund for       the Eradication of Slavery.
While the initiative is in its infancy, it has       already had a number of conspicuous successes.
For example, it has been       successful in getting Inditex SA, the world's largest clothing retailer,       to stop using cotton picked by forced labourers in Uzbekistan and helping       Philippine activists pressure their Senate into ratifying the       International Labour Organisation's convention regarding the treatment of       domestic workers.
Allain's research, developed through the Bellagio-Harvard         Guidelines informs the decisions regarding the allocation of the       Global Fund for the Eradication of Slavery.
The Global Fund is being used       to back anti-slavery groups and help give governments and activists the       resources need to tackle the problem of modern-day slavery.
As Bales has noted: "Commitments to the fund already exceed $2 billion         and it is expected to lever further sums from participating governments.
It is another clear impact that the fund and its guiding research base         rest upon the foundation of Allain's work" [vi].
