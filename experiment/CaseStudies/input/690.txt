     The research insights achieved impact through their influence on the       policies and programmes of       the NC.
Although this impact is limited to one organisation, the potential       range and scope of       indirect second-level impact on school leaders can be gauged from the size       of the NC and its       programmes.
By 2008/09 participants on the four core programmes we       evaluated (LftM; LP;       NPQH; LPSH) numbered more than 10,000, one of the largest bodies of       sustained leadership       development activity for education in the world.
Overall impact       The research described here had a broad impact across the leadership       development work of the       NC for a number of reasons: the design of each study, the conclusions       reached as well as       underpinning conceptualisations and theorisations contributed to the       accumulation of knowledge       and understanding about the impact of the NC's leadership development       provision; our approach       to evaluating impact, refined over a number of studies, provided a robust       basis for understanding       not just whether impact had occurred, but key variables determining this;       and the number and       scale of the studies provided a robust evidence base.
Although a number of       the studies were       undertaken prior to the REF period, these factors meant that their impact       was cumulative at least       until 2011.
Key NC contacts emphasised the quality and robustness       of the studies and the various       study teams' 'ability to provide timely feedback and enter into         dialogue' on issues that were key to       programme development.
This was done through meetings during which interim       results were       presented and discussed and policy implications drawn out.
These strengths       were reflected in the       amount of repeat commissions in a competitive environment and the       development of a sustained       relationship between SHU and the NC that still continues.
A NC informant       stated `I would wish to         note the high degree of professionalism, insight and objectiveness of         the Sheffield Hallam research         teams.
The way they interacted with College on an on-going basis was         very important in ensuring         that the findings from the research impacted on the College's leadership         design And development         work in a timely way' (S2).
Specific impact: programme design and development       Evidence about programme effectiveness and the factors       that influenced programme outcomes       impacted on NC provision in a number of ways.
In terms of the portfolio of       provision, our earlier       reviews of the NC's programmes (G1) led to the decision to develop a new       programme -       Leadership Pathways (LP - piloted in 2006 and rolled out in 2007).
This       was designed: (i) to meet       the needs of more experienced leaders than LftM; (ii) to place a much       greater emphasis on on-line       materials and support; and (iii) to be delivered on a commissioned basis       rather than directly by the       College.
SHU was closely engaged with the NC in the implementation of LP       as it evolved over the       period 2006-2009.
We were asked to undertake a study of the design process       in 2006, looking in       particular at ways in which `personalisation' was embodied in the       programme and the implications       of the commissioning strategy.
Following implementation, SHU evaluated the       LP Pilot and Roll-Out       in 2007 and 2008.
These studies together influenced evolving programme       design as it developed       from 2008 in a number of ways, including informing: i) the move towards a       modular curriculum; ii)       developments in the blended learning approach; iii) the evolution of more       effective coaching       models and practices.
These outcomes drew on analyses derived from an       understanding of key       variables in programme design described above.
The evaluations of the MATD Programme (2009) contributed to a rather       different scenario.
The       programme was not successful: our studies demonstrated that the reasons       lay in       misunderstanding of the market rather than programme content or design.
The studies contributed       to the decision to discontinue the programme in 2011.
A key contact       in the NC (S3) stated that the       programme would have continued longer without the evaluation's conclusions       about the reasons       for its under-recruitment - it made them `bite the bullet' of         discontinuation.
Beyond this, however,       the studies informed the College's general thinking about how to support       leadership development       across a range of service contexts, such as through its programme for       Directors of Children's       Services, developing `a more mature way of operating across a group of       agencies' as a key NC       informant put it (S1).
Specific impact: strategic thinking       Contributions to programme design and delivery described above were       complemented by more in-       depth contributions to the NC's understanding of factors impacting on       leadership development       outcomes, and, as the scale of College activity expanded, to its strategic       thinking as it moved, in       2011, from a centralised model of leadership development to one where       consortia of schools and       others were licensed to provide leadership development on a commissioned       basis within a       centrally designed curriculum framework.
First, as part of the process of moving towards a licensing approach to       programme delivery the       College developed a leadership development framework comprising five       levels from middle leader       to experienced headteacher, embodied in a modular curriculum.
The research       informed this       framework, both through `distilling understanding of the signature         characteristics of good         leadership development' as one of our College informants put it       (S1), and, more specifically, by       feeding into the design of three levels of the programme which evolved       from previous programmes       that we had evaluated (Leading from the Middle [G1, G3], Leadership       Pathways [G2], National       Professional Qualification for Headship [G3]).
Another informant stated: `Through         detailed         evaluations of existing provision and of the context within which         programmes had to be delivered,         the studies informed our move towards the development, in 2011, of a         more modular curriculum         supported by a blended learning approach' (S2).
Second, it became increasingly clear that schools were key players in the       design and delivery of       programmes, through in-school projects of various kinds and the provision       of coach support.
However, research conducted by SHU indicated the challenges that       school-based delivery       involved, with some evidence indicating that the quality of support       provided by schools varied       considerably (G1, G2).
It was recognised that little was known about the       school as a site of       leadership development.
Consequently, SHU was commissioned to undertake a       comparative study       of in-school components of three major core programmes: Leading from the       Middle, the National       Professional Qualification for Headship and the Leadership programme for       Serving Headteachers       (G3).
This study identified similarities and differences between the three       programmes' in-school       components, and contributed to the implementation of the NC's involvement       in the broader national       policy shift towards a school-led system.
For example, the evolution of       the NC's approach to       coaching was underpinned by the availability of detailed information       provided by our studies about       what was actually happening in schools.
This highlighted the key issue of       coaching capacity,       factors that affected this and how it needed to be developed.
As one       informant put it: `It helped us         to see a picture of what was actually happening in schools' and `that         there had often been more         rhetoric than good practice' (S4).
These understandings contributed       to the NC's evolving strategy       to support coaching and coaches.
A NC informant summarised the overall       impact of our work on       NC strategy as follows: `More generally - and of particular         significance - the range of research         done by SHU in relation to the in-school aspect of leadership         development helped provide the         basis for a major shift of strategic focus towards a more school-based         and commissioned         provision' (S2).
