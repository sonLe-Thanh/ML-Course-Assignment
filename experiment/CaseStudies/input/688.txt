     This research has led to acceptance by both the past and present       Governments of several changes to the regulatory framework to facilitate       more effective financial reporting by charities.
Two key impacts are       highlighted - the first was implemented in law from 2008/09 and has       already led to direct benefits of around &#163;15 million for charities, as       explained below.
The second has been accepted by Government in policy       terms as creating a case for further reform.
(A) Changes to the regulatory framework of IEs, triggered       by the research above, have extended the regime for independent       examination of charity accounts - it is now available to almost all       charities in England &amp; Wales up to &#163;500,000 income (previously only to       non-company charities up to &#163;250,000 income).
Over the period 2009-13 this       has delivered possible savings of at least &#163;15 million for charitable       companies in the income band &#163;250,000 to &#163;500,000 which are now able to       have an IE rather than an audit (see below for computation).
The changes have also led to recognition of a new professional body in       this field - the Association of Charity Independent Examiners (ACIE) - now       listed in Charities Act 2011 s.145(3).
This impact can be explained         through a series of events as explained below, leading to substantive         impact on charities from 2009.
(i) Lord Hodgson (an opposition peer)       drew directly on Morgan's work to present arguments to Parliament which       were eventually carried in the Companies Act 2006; (ii) using powers from       Hodgson's company law amendment, the Charities Act 1993 was amended in       2008; (iii) the Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 were       made allowing IE for charitable companies for charity accounting years       ending 31 March 2009 onwards.
The process: The initial case for change to the legislation on IEs       in the Charities Act 1993 arose at least partly from policy submissions       made by Morgan (through ACIE) drawing on his research [3.1] for Government       and Parliamentary consultations on issues of charity regulation [5.1].
As       the legislation was proceeding through Parliament in 2006, the research       was directly used by Lord Hodgson (and supported by other peers and MPs)       to make possible a fundamental change allowing the extension of the IE       regime to charitable companies (previously it only applied to non-company       charities).
Hodgson contacted ACIE for any relevant research and was sent       a copy of Morgan's paper [3.2].
This led him to raise the issue initially       in the Charities Bill debate [5.2] and then to table formal amendments to       the Companies Bill - amendments which had been drafted by Morgan [5.3] for       ACIE based on this research.
After a 40 minute Lords debate on this sole       issue, it was put to a vote and carried as rare Opposition majority [5.4].
The changes were debated further in the Commons when the two Bills were       both coming to completion [5.5].
This created a power in s.1175 of the       Companies Act 2006 allowing the Business Secretary to make regulations       amending the scrutiny regime for charitable companies which became s.77 of       the Charities Act 2006.
However, these were only enabling provisions: consultations followed on       whether to bring them into force: final implementation arose only through       The Charities Act 2006 (Charitable Companies Audit and Group Accounts         Provisions) Order 2008 (SI 2008/527) which further amended the       Charities Act 1993 with effect from 1 April 2008.
The new IE framework was       set out in the Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008       (SI 2008/629) which, using the powers in the legislation above, formally       prescribed an IE framework for charitable companies for years starting on       or after 1 April 2008 (i.e.
years ending 31 March 2009 onwards).
A       completely new version of the Charity Commission's Directions to IEs was       issued in 2009 to reflect the new framework [5.6].
Effect of the research: The Parliamentary records make clear that       it is most unlikely these changes would have taken effect without the use       of this research to provide the arguments.
Measuring the impact: Charity Commission figures from 2008 show       5,500 registered charities in the income band &#163;250,000 to &#163;500,000.
Of       these, which 58% - over 3000 - are structured as companies [5.7].
These       are typically providing key services in local communities.
From 2009 year       ends onwards, each of these was able have an IE rather than an audit, at a       typical saving of approximately &#163;1,000 in fees (a typical difference in       cost between an audit and IE -evidence from data used in [3.1 &amp; 3.4]).
For the 3000+ charitable companies affected, this means a saving of 3000 x       &#163;1,000 = &#163;million per year from 2009 or &#163;15million over the REF period up       to 2013.
The savings meant resources released for other costs - in most       cases this would be spent directly on work with beneficiaries of these       charities.
A further 4,700 charitable companies under &#163;250,000 income       [5.7] have also gained a clear charity-specific form of accounts scrutiny       (which is typically also less costly) by use of IEs rather than reporting       accountants under company law.
(B) Further reforms to charity reporting and IE arising       from this research, particularly the later work on "public benefit"       issues, have now been accepted as a result of Lord Hodgson's appointment       in 2011 as Independent Reviewer of the Charities Act 2006.
His 2012 report to Parliament cited Sheffield Hallam University studies on       issues of charity regulation on three occasions, showing problems in the       existing regime: "[T]he ability, or perhaps in some cases the         willingness, of the sector to fulfil the reporting requirement is far         from certain; compliance is very low.
Research conducted by Sheffield         Hallam University for the Charity Commission found that, among charities         with income of over &#163;500,000, only 25% fully met the requirement in         their 2009/10 report.....
Subsequent research by the Institute of         Voluntary Action Research, with Sheffield Hallam University, has also         found that charities see the renewed emphasis on public benefit as part         of the modernisation of the sector."
[5.8 p28] "Finally,         evidence indicated that the Trustees Annual Report ... does not always         provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of [the charity's] work and         its impact.
This is borne out by the research conducted by Sheffield         Hallam University into compliance with public benefit reporting         requirements."
[5.8 p68] Hodgson expressed concern at the levels of       compliance reported by Morgan &amp; Fletcher [3.6] and called for stronger       PBR stating "Charities should recognise the importance of public         benefit reporting both to public confidence and their own ability to         attract supporters".
[5.8 p42].
He also recommended further       extending the IE regime to charities up to &#163;1M income and removing an       unhelpful assets threshold [5.8 p128] which had also been highlighted in       the research [3.1; 3.5].
Many of Hodgson's recommendations, including       proposals which were evidenced by the Sheffield Hallam University       research, have now been accepted in a Government response [5.9, p22 &amp;       32].
The beneficiaries of these changes are all those who are       served by the work of the charities concerned: resources previously spent       in inappropriate audit work were released to support charitable work.
Secondly there is a benefit to the public at large in that better       understanding is available of the work of charities, given an improved       reporting and scrutiny regime and better PBR, and more confidence that the       tax concessions available to charities are effectively used.
Further evidence of this impact on charity regulation appears in       various professional journals and newsletters used by charity       practitioners.
In particular, the findings of the SHU work on public       benefit reporting [3.6] and its implications for changed practice are       drawn to the attention of all 180,000 registered charities in a Charity       Commission newsletter [5.10].
