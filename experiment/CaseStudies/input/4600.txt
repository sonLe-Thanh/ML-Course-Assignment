     Educational Impact     The educational impact of Smith's prison writings is measurable in the       precedent they have set for revising prison curricula, addressing prison       staff attitudes, and considering issues of prisoner rehabilitation.
The       Education Manager at HMP Wellingborough concurred that the prestige gained       by inmates appearing in Smith's writings enhanced the reputation of Arts       and Humanities teaching in HMP Wellingborough, helped external       dissemination of information about its educational work, reinforced       positive standards of prisoner behaviour and encouraged education in       rehabilitation (5.1).
In an environment of emotional toughness dominated by masking and       controlling emotion, Smith's classes provided prisoners with an important       respite: "discussions of religion and politics took place between         prisoners with wildly different perspectives without tension or         reprisal."
(3.4, p. 14) His pedagogical aim &#8212; "to create a space         within his classroom that was as un-carceral as possible" (3.4, p.       6) &#8212; increased prisoners' self-esteem and helped them survive prison life.
Many completed Open University modules in prison; some, upon release,       studied at Bath Spa University, Coleg Harlech, University College       Falmouth, and Oxford Brookes University.
One has lectured at Manchester       University.
Although the impact of Smith's programmes cannot be quantified       (he has been discouraged from maintaining contact with former prison       students by the Ministry of Justice), qualitative data testifies to their       profound significance.
For one inmate, his Guardian articles       altered his family's perceptions of prison, helping his readjustment to       life after release: "The fact that ...
I know that people like Alan         exist and are trying to tell that story helped get me through ... a         knock back or a `no' from an employer or society."
(5.2, testimonial       20 July 2012) Another who will complete his University of Cambridge       doctorate in 2013 says: "Smith has been both an innovator in the field         of prison education and a source of encouragement and inspiration for         many prisoners who may not have had much success in traditional         education."
(5.2, testimonial 18 April 2013).
Smith's research has gained recognition through the concept of `prison       narratives', or rehabilitation through narrative as creative practice,       instigated at the `Prison Narratives' colloquium he convened at the UN       (June 2010), where criminologists and prison educationalists spoke to       approximately 30 students, staff, criminologists and members of the       Writers in Prison Network (5.3).
Further educational impact is measurable       through another UN public event arranged in collaboration with the then       writer-in-residence at HMP Leicester and the Project Manager of the The       Anne Frank Trust Prison Project, attended by 18 (5.4).
Smith's       prison-based practice has also been adopted by a UN PhD student, who works       on performance-based projects with male and female prisoners via her       organisation, The Ministry of Untold Stories.
Policy Change and Third Sector Impact     Smith's writings on prison have reached UK prison policy-makers and third       sector organisations, and contributed to individual and institutional       thinking about attitudes to prison education, thereby increasing public       engagement.
The Prison Education Trust (5.5) has cited his writings,       notably his assertion of the case for education rather than training in       prison.
According to a representative from the Ministry of Justice,       journalists have read Smith's articles or are directed to read them by her       department; a Labour government minister (2007-2010) read them, "whenever         they appeared and appreciated their unique insight into the prison         world."
(5.6) For the Education Guardian editor,       Smith sets, "a high example to journalists through the power of his         story telling and characterisation."
(5.6) Equally, the Project       Manager at the Anne Frank Trust Prison Project, whose activities are       mentioned in Smith's column, `Prisoners need a space in which to be       themselves' (The Guardian, 4 July 2011), said he "used this         article alongside our own publicity material at meetings with prisons."
(5.7)     Public Engagement     Smith's newspaper columns have also reached global readerships through The         Guardian website (monthly impressions are estimated at 528,293,401).
For examples of how his liberal agenda has provoked readers' opinions and       increased public visibility of prison issues, see responses to `The prison       philosophers debate their right to vote' (The Guardian, 21 February       2011, 10 comments); `In prison, food is all about self-esteem' (The         Guardian, 18 June 2012, 79 comments) and `In prison, education is a       route to self-respect' (The Guardian, 8 April 2013, 10 comments).
Smith's growing eminence among US audiences is evidenced by his interview       on Oklahoma City Public Service Radio on 25 October 2012 (5.8).
Furthermore, the impact of his work is sustainable beyond the REF census       date.
He was interviewed for North Carolina Public Radio (5.9, a Top 5       `Most Popular Stories' online the week following its 5 August 2013       broadcast), addressed the Saint Louis University Prison Education       Programme, which provides educational opportunities to prison staff and       prisoners in Missouri (October 2013), and plans to adapt his prison       memoirs into a Hollywood film.
