     This case focuses on impacts in terms of changes to union strategies and       actions to promote the position of women in leadership both at the       individual and organisational/collective levels.
The aim is that these       changes will lead to major, future shifts in the gender composition of       union leaderships.

Impacts within one union       Work with the National Association of Probation Officers (NAPO)       demonstrates how the team's research has had an impact on an individual       union's strategy and decision making, what can be achieved in this area       and the significant value unions place on the research.
Kirton is leading       this three-year strategy project in which her experience is both informing       her work and being shaped by it.
NAPO asked Kirton to advise on an action plan to improve women's       representation.
She drew up a series of recommendations based on the       earlier UK-US study, her analysis of NAPO gender monitoring data, and a       survey of Napo women members in which she initiated roundtable discussions       with three major Napo branches.
The NAPO National Executive Committee       accepted these recommendations in full in September 2012.
Kirton's close       involvement with the Union has deepened as she has further been asked to       advise the Union on the implementation of her recommendations.
NAPO       appointed her as an ex-officio member of its new Women's Strategy Steering       Group which is overseeing the three-year women's equality strategy       (2011-14), largely based on Kirton's recommendations.
She is working       closely with key NAPO officials on developing the case for devoting       greater resources to the promotion of women's equality.
To date, the Union       has: (i) initiated negotiations with the General Federation of Trade       Unions to establish a bespoke women's leadership training course; (ii)       improved its collection of data on women's representation within the       Union; (iii) placed women's issues as a standing item on the Equal Rights       Committee agenda; (iv) run two workshops on women and accessing power at       its biennial Women's Conference in June 2013 facilitated by Kirton; (v)       disseminated, via its conference, good branch practices which reflect       Kirton's recommendations; and (vi) agreed to monitor by gender attendance       and contribution at National Executive Committee meetings.
The General Secretary of NAPO stated: "Professor Gill Kirton was         engaged by Napo before the Women's strategy was put in place and was a         vital part of the team.
She offered advice and guidance on its format,         its pace, and its aims, and the make-up of the steering group.
She         enabled a survey of its women members to take place, capturing         information which then guided policy.
She helped educate the Union about         the issues facing women, and her collaborative work enabled a mature         debate to take place".
Importantly, and widening the reach and significance of the case study,       Napo put a motion to Women's TUC 2011: `Motion 26 was moved by Napo and       seconded by Unison.
Conference welcomed the publication of the academic       study by Gill Kirton and Geraldine Healy on women and trade union       leadership.
Conference called on the General Council to undertake research       into identifying any barriers to the full participation by women in       leadership roles'.
2.
The core project impact on individual careers and strategies for         change.
The core project, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, tackled       women's leadership under-representation through a series of       action-orientated activities.
The key activity was a two-week residential       leadership development course (one week in the US and one week in the UK)       between March and June 2009, for 10 American and 10 British women union       leaders.
This unique path-breaking course was designed to create: (i) an       educational and developmental experience for individual participants       enabling them to identify and devise their strategies for responding to       the gender democracy deficit, (ii) a new cross-national, self-organising,       network of women union leaders to disseminate understanding of and       collective action on gender issues, and (iii) to generate wider lessons       for the union movement in both countries.
The development course had immediate benefits for participants in the       form of shared experiences and learning, the formation of new networking       links and (post-course) individual promotions.
The benefits of sharing       experiences, not only nationally but also internationally, were striking.
Participants continued to complete learning logs, themselves organised       follow-up meetings and created an e-network.
Follow-up meetings have       included further exchange visits between the two countries and various       actions to support activities on promoting women as union leaders       (corroborations detailed below).
Not least several participants have now       been promoted to higher-level leadership positions.
For example, one UK       participant has moved from being a lay Unison branch officer to being the       National Association of Probation Officers (NAPO) National Official with       responsibility for NAPO's women's equality strategy.
One American       participant similarly has become Vice President of her Communications       Workers of America (CWA) local and established a local women's committee.
She said: "Another benefit to my organization is that the enthusiasm         that was shared ... spawned a move to establish a women's committee here         in CWA Local 1036.
Even more exciting is the fact that the committee         agreed that it wants to see a focus on international women's rights and         women's issues.
So for the very first time, we sponsored an event for         International Women's Day focusing on universal paid sick leave."
Participants' feedback was collated in the Southern and Eastern TUC (2009)       US Exchange Report.
One participant's (Unison) comment is       illustrative: "The whole experience has prompted me to consider new         and different ways to recruit, organise, politicise and educate women         within Unison.
I am grateful for the experience and knowledge gained so         far."
Another participant (National Air Traffic Services (NATS)       writes: "Taking part in this exchange has enabled me to build on my         knowledge and gain a wider understanding and appreciation of the role of         women in trade unions in an international context.
It has also helped me         to formulate strategies that I can apply to my roles, particularly as         PCS Assistant Secretary in NATS, and to actively promote the important         part that women play in the trade union movement."
The Regional       Secretary SERTUC, said: "The experiences [participants] had meeting         their US counterparts cemented their understanding of both the         collective nature of their work and the individual talent they brought         to it.
Outcomes were greater participation in their unions and within         the Southern &amp; Eastern Region of the TUC."
The research has continued to engender interest within the union movement       and beyond on women's representation in union leadership positions.
Kirton       was invited to speak on the topic at Napo's women's conference in May 2011       and June 2013 (estimated attendance 80), and Healy was invited to speak at       `Unions 21' in May 2012 (estimated attendance 80-100) at the TUC.
The       study has been widely referred to in the UK, US and union media, for       example, the research has influenced the following pieces: The         Observer (three-page article on women and unions) 6 August 2012,       Yvonne Roberts, The Women changing Britain's unions       www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/05/women-changing-union-movement-tuc;       BBC report on Trade unions: Not dead yet, (25 January 2012) www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16609527;       New Jersey Star Ledger (2009) article Women changing Britain's unions,       www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2009/05/women_labor_leaders_from_uk_vi.html;       a       Rutgers University Newspaper (2009); Berger Marks Foundation (2010)       www.bergermarks.org/news/2010/index3.php?art=148#148;       TSSA (Union) Journal (2009); Napo outputs (2011-12) www.napo.org.uk/about/news/news.cfm/newsid/191,       www.napo.org.uk/resources/win_blog.cfm     3.
Sustaining the momentum and widening the reach       The central challenge in this case has been to sustain women unionists'       motivation and work with union activists and leaders to embed the lessons       of the core project within the union movement.
The challenge is       particularly great as the aim of gender equality within union leaderships       will take many years to achieve.
The momentum was sustained through four       further activities: (i) Immediately after the development course, the       research team convened a UK networking conference attended by 50 women       trade unionists (June 2009).
The team disseminated the lessons from the       course and prominent union speakers stressed the benefits of an equitable       gender balance plus the individual and collective strategies for achieving       such a balance at the top of the union movement.
(ii) The research team       joined with Cornell University colleagues to organise a US women       activists' conference at Cornell in May 2010.
Again the Conference took       forward the lessons of the core project.
It focussed on change strategies       such as increasing the effectiveness of working parties and       task-and-finish groups on women's leadership in the two countries and       voter mobilisation campaigns targeted at encouraging women to vote for       women candidates.
(iii) The team worked with the TUC on a second UK women       activists' conference, held at TUC headquarters in September 2010.
The       team sought to maintain the prominence of the gender disparity issue and       again work on effective strategies for change with union activists, many       of whom supported a demand for more women's leadership development       courses.
(iv) Meanwhile, in the US the team joined with Cornell colleagues       in two workshops, involving book launches, at Cornell and, notably, at the       AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington in March 2013 (attended by 60 women       union activists).
These workshops reiterated the lessons of the UK/US       research findings, but the team also used them to focus activists on the       next steps for women in the labour movement.
These next steps included the       need for sustained collective action by women and their supporters as well       as stressing the value of individual development through mentoring and       women's networking.
