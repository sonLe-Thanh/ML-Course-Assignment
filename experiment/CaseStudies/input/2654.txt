     The credibility of sport is threatened by an unprecedented wave of proven       cases of manipulation       of events for betting gain, undermining its commercial viability.
Sport is       particularly vulnerable       given the importance of sponsorship in the modern sports business model.
For example, the       withdrawal of sponsorship in the Chinese football league following match       fixing revelations       precipitated its collapse; ticket revenue is also dependent on faith in       the authenticity of the       product; clubs in the Italian league exposed as involved in match fixing       experienced a persisting       20% drop in sales relative to other clubs in the league.
Match fixing is       also a threat to the       integrity of sport, with sportspeople acting as role models and brand       icons.
In this context, this       case study demonstrates the following impact:            Informing the development of nationally consistent approaches to and         codes of conduct for         deterring and dealing with match fixing and supporting international         policy development to         combat corruption in sport:                 2008: Report for the Central Council for Physical             Recreation (CCPR, now the Sport and           Recreation Alliance) commissioned Forrest and McHale to write: "Threats             to Sports             Integrity from Developments in the Betting Market".
The CCPR is           the UK umbrella body           for sports governing bodies and advises UK Government on all matters           relating to sport.
Key members of CCPR include the FA (football), ECB (cricket), LTA           (tennis), RFU (rugby           union), BHA (horse racing).
The work of the Centre for Sports Business           at Salford was           known to CCPR at the time Forrest and McHale bid for the contract;           David Folker in           particular, who commissioned the Player Performance Index on behalf of           the FA Premier           League in 2004, represented the FA on CCPR.
The report identified risk factors threatening sports integrity           including the types of sporting           contest and bet that were most dangerous for integrity.
These findings           influenced sports           administrators concerned with manipulation of events; cited in the           2008 report:           "Environmental Review of Integrity in Tennis", a report for the           World Tennis Association,           which includes an extract from the CCPR report demonstrating the           mechanics (developed           by Forrest and McHale) by which criminals can make a profit in betting           markets by fixing           the results of a set; "Threats to the integrity of sport in             Australia"           (http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/publications/crime-profile-series/threats-to-integrity-of-professional-sport-australia).Forrest           and McHale briefed the then Minister of Sport           (Gerry Sutcliffe, MP) on the recommendations from this report to CCPR.
There followed           the development of a compulsory policy for addressing threats to the           integrity of sport for           sports organisations in Britain ("The Parry Report").
2012: Forrest was a key advisor to the International             Centre for Sports Security (ICSS)             Initiative (Sorbonne, Paris).
This meeting brought together           leaders in world sport and           leaders in world betting to explore common ground regarding the           mitigation of match           fixing; concluding that such mitigation might be provided through the           introduction of           revised betting rules, cooperation, and information sharing.
Forrest           acted as moderator           (sole independent expert) providing an overview of the common ground           identified to an           invited audience (including betting operators, further representatives           of each industry, the           Director General of Interpol), and reported progress to the ICSS           conference, 2012.
2013: MINEPS V was the fifth meeting of Ministers of           Sport of all countries around the           world (such meetings occur roughly once every 10 years).
It made a           declaration setting           out policies that national governments and international sporting           bodies should expect to           follow in order to combat match fixing, Forrest was a contributor to           Working Group 3 (on           sports corruption) which provided the background report for           discussions by the ministers.
Facilitating networks for information sharing between governments,         sports bodies, betting         operators and law enforcement to improve integrity in sport:                 2013: Training of Sports Administration Leaders:           Forrest was commissioned as co-author           and principal researcher of a 2012 report on match fixing by IRIS           (Institut de Relations           Internationales et Strategiques), a Paris based think-tank.
There           followed a partnership           between the University of Salford, IRIS, European Lotteries, and           SportAccord to deliver a           series of seminars on Sports Integrity (EAC/S06/2012/036, funded by           the EU under           "Partenariato Europeens dans le Domaine du Sport") one in each of 21           EU member           states, where leaders of national sports federations would receive           training in the nature of           match fixing threats and how they should respond.
These seminars began           in July 2013           and will conclude in September 2014.
Forrest played an active role in           designing the           content of these seminars.
SportAccord is the international federation           of world sports           federations and is the global body for sports administration, members           thus including FIFA           (soccer), ICC (cricket), IAAF (athletics), ITF (tennis), IRB (rugby),           UCI (cycling).
Supporting international policy development to combat corruption in         sport:                 2012: Examination of Threats to Sports Integrity: A           study commissioned by the EU Sports           Platform was launched in the European Parliament, Brussels.
The study           "An Examination             of the Threats to the Integrity of Sports" identifies ten key           areas for sports to focus on, and           examines what can be done to minimise the risk to sports competitions           from these           threats.
Forrest is comprehensively cited in this report.
2012: Invited Plenary Speech at INTERPOL Experts'             Conference, by Forrest in           Singapore, funded by Interpol, on the vulnerability of sport to           corruption.
2013: World Bank Seminar (Washington D.C.): Forrest           was discussant on how to create           an index for assessing country performance in terms of sports           security, safety and           integrity, his visit sponsored by International Centre for Sports           Security.
The World Bank           plans to demand minimum standards in sports administration before it           will fund sports           projects in a country.
