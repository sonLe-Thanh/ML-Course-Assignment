     The impact of Rebellato's research is evident in the significant         contemporary interest in Rattigan, in the professional theatre, in       film and in the wider public; he has contributed in various ways, directly       and indirectly, to this interest and to shaping Rattigan's revived       reputation.
This is not, of course, to claim that Rebellato has       single-handedly revived Rattigan's reputation.
It is that his research has       contributed to the general reassessment through (a) the significance of       the ideas themselves, (b) the influence he has therefore been able to have       on revivals of the work, and (c) the interpretive activity around these       revivals that he has been asked to take on.
The impact of his research has been evident in some of the revivals         of Rattigan's plays in major theatres.
The director of After the         Dance at the National Theatre explained in a public interview at the       National Theatre on 17 June 2010 that she read the play in the Nick Hern       Books [NHB] edition, with Rebellato's introduction, and it was this that       persuaded her to direct a revival.
Rebellato was asked to chair the       platform in the Lyttelton Theatre and write an article in the programme.
The director's faith in the play, partly deriving from Rebellato's       edition, was born out by 97% houses, and four Olivier awards in 2011,       including best revival, and Best Director in the Critics Circle awards.
This in turn encouraged the director to revive Rattigan's Cause         C&#233;l&#232;bre at the Old Vic the following year.
Several theatres marked Rattigan's centenary in 2011 with productions,       including Flare Path at the Haymarket, The Deep Blue Sea       and The Browning Version at Chichester, and In Praise of Love       at the Royal and Derngate.
In each case, Rebellato provided programme       notes or pre-show talks to place these plays in context.
In the case of In         Praise of Love, Rebellato was consulted early by the director who       had read his edition.
When a new film of The Deep Blue Sea was       released in 2011, the tie-in edition published Rebellato's introduction to       the play alongside a piece by the film's producer who, in the 1990s, had       written a book on gay playwrights like Rattigan which made extensive use       of the NHB Rattigan editions.
When English Touring Theatre revived French         Without Tears in 2007, the director drew directly on Rebellato's         introduction to the NHB edition in shaping his production.
Every       major revival of Separate Tables since 1999 has used the `gay       variant' first published in Rebellato's edition, including Philip Frank's       acclaimed Chichester production (2009).
Frank later drew on Rebellato's       work in 2011, when, at the same theatre, he directed a reading of First         Episode using the pre-publication copy of the definitive text that       Rebellato had newly established.
The range of activity demonstrates Rebellato's impact in this area; he is       the principal academic commentator on Rattigan's work with an established         ability to talk to a wider audience.
In this REF period he has       appeared on platforms at the National on Rattigan and After the Dance       (both 2010), given three talks at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2010       and 2011, and one each at Birkbeck College London, Theatre Royal,       Haymarket, the English-Speaking Union, and Harrow School all in 2011.
Recent programme articles include After the Dance (National       Theatre, 2010), In Praise of Love (Royal and Derngate, 2011), and       French Without Tears (Shaw Festival, Ontario, 2012).
These might be       understood as interpretation activities (to use the term from the visual       arts) in which the insights given by the scholarly and critical work is       presented for a wider audience, offering a gateway through which the       academic work can have an impact on a wider non-academic public.
Audiences for the various publications and talks range in scale from       approximately three million listeners who heard the BBC Radio 4       Front Row special to the 150-strong audience for the talks at the       Chichester Festival Theatre.
The NHB editions have sold strongly, many       selling in the thousands and they have established themselves as the       definitive editions of the plays.
Rebellato's significance as a       commentator on Rattigan led to him being invited as a guest of honour at       the inaugural meeting of the Terence Rattigan Society in 2011.
In the       words of Rattigan's literary executor `There is no doubt in my mind         that [Rebellato has] contributed to the rise (re-birth?)
of Rattigan in         the past years'.
