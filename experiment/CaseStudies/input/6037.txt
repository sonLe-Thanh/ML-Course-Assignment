     Quick has focused on the creation of new audiences for innovative       practice through five new performance works.
Research into the creative       processes that are integral to the work's development have influenced       artists, teachers and secondary school students in a number of different       countries.
The innovative nature of this work is in part reflected by       national press interest.
The Guardian described ITD as "a company       at the forefront of testing the nature of theatre"; The Observer,       wrote of Kellerman, "it's as near as dammit a total work of art",       and more recently The Guardian wrote of The Zero Hour,       "Imitating the Dog are multiplatform theatre-makers of rare ambition and       invention"; The Guardian wrote of Hound of the Baskervilles,       "This version of Conan Doyle's classic is an enlightened, if somewhat       unexpected, collaboration between one of the North West's oldest       theatrical institutions, Oldham         Coliseum, which is currently under renovation; and one of its most       progressive, digital design specialists, Imitating         the Dog."
For a full list of reviews and other evidence of impact,       see www.imitatingthedog.co.uk     Since 2005 Quick has made five touring performance works.
Hotel         Methuselah (2006-2013) performed 68 times in 11 countries (UK,       Italy, Poland, France, Germany, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Bulgaria, Armenia,       Ukraine, Lebanon and Brazil).
ITD's audience figures show that 10,200       people attended performances, and 35 workshops were based around this work       with around 700 people in attendance.
Kellerman (2008-2013)       performed 22 times and toured three countries (UK, France and Taiwan) with       an estimated total audience of 4500.
This activity was accompanied by 15       workshops with around 300 participants.
Tales From the Bar of Lost         Souls (2009) was commissioned by The British Council and created       with The National Theatres of Greece and Cyprus.
It performed 20 times to       an estimated audience of 3000 and was accompanied by 2 residencies (in       Athens and Nicosia) and 4 workshops &#8212; the attendance for these was 100.
Six         Degrees Below the Horizon (2011) and The Zero Hour (2012)       have both performed 18 times with an estimated total audience of 3,500.
Since 2011 Quick has run 12 workshops, 3 residencies and 1 summer school       involving 300 participants.
Quick made appearances on the TV networks of       Ukraine, Brazil, Bulgaria and Greece to talk about the works.
Quick's       collaboration with Oldham Coliseum on Hound of the Baskervilles       (2012) resulted in ten-week tour with over 50 performances attended by       18,000 spectators.
Practice as research utilising digital technologies have been used in all       workshop activity.
An emphasis has been placed on exploring the potential       of camera and projection technologies to inform creative ways of exploring       history, the personal and cultural/national, the experience of city       living, and how to document individual life stories.
The wider research       into a broader cultural interest in cinematic/screen narratives has been       used to explore how individuals might begin to tell their `own' stories.
Specific beneficiaries of this research have been secondary school       students, who have engaged with Quick's approach to performance making and       use of technologies in over 40 workshops since 2005.
A recent example of       this work is the collaboration with Bootham School in York in their       creation of Three Stories using the interdisciplinary creativity       of Art and Theatre Students.
The teacher organising this also attended the       2012 ITD Summer School and commented the following in the Live at LICA       Annual Report:     "I found the summer school incredibly stimulating and useful.
As a         teacher (who normally spends his time giving out to others, rather than         being fed himself), it gave me a wonderful opportunity to work in a         medium and environment I believe passionately in, to learn new things         and to engage with a range of talented artists and practitioners in the         production of original, highly creative &amp; collaborative work.
The         atmosphere was friendly yet purposeful and focused.
It was, in so many         ways, the highlight of my summer.
The collaboration that followed on         from it, between Bootham School &amp; ITD, was incredibly fruitful &#8212; and         is still bearing fruit months after the collaboration ended."
This innovative approach to performance making has been shared       internationally, and included working with artists from all over the       world.
Quick was in residency at the Cena Festival 2012 in Rio, Brazil,       with Hotel Methuselah running workshops, master classes and formal       academic presentations with 9 other companies and in collaboration with       the Edinburgh and Avignon Festivals.
The British Council's engagement and the critical reception of Quick's       practice attests to the significance of its impact, in particular       approaches to innovative performance making and its reception,       particularly in the use of digital technologies.
This is also reflected in       how Quick's work is impacting on the mainstream theatre culture as       evidenced in collaborations with Oldham Coliseum (Hound of The         Baskervilles (2012) and The Mist in the Mirror (2014)) and       West Yorkshire Playhouse/Dukes Playhouse (A Farewell to Arms       (2014)).
