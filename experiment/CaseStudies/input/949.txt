     Process through which research led to impact: A clear 'pathway'       from the publication of the research through to impact can be identified.
This sequencing may be summarised as follows:     Electoral fraud (JRRT grant)            Extensive media coverage of the research findings, including         front-page headline in The Times, live interview on the Today         Programme, and citation of the work on Newsnight.
Discussion of the findings in Parliament and in a House of Commons         Select Committee (2008-09), including numerous questions to Ministers;       A 'Stamp out Voting Fraud' campaign launched by the pressure group,         Unlock Democracy, highlighting the concerns raised in Dr Wilks-Heeg's         work and pressing for reforms based on his recommendations (2008-10);       An Early Day Motion in the House of Commons, signed by 96 MPs from 6         different political parties, citing the research and urging the         government to take action (2008);       Invitations, arising from the Unlock Democracy campaign, for Dr         Wilks-Heeg to attend a meeting with the Minister of State responsible         for electoral matters (2008) and to present his findings to MPs and         Peers (2009);       Legislative change which initiated reforms of electoral registration         in Great Britain (2009) via a late government amendment to the Political         Parties and Elections Bill (2009);          Electoral registration (ESRC grant)            Extensive media coverage of the research findings (2010), including         coverage in all the broadsheets, on the Today programme and the BBC         Daily Politics;       Numerous discussions and citations of the findings in Parliament         (2010-12);       A highly-successful campaign, led by the Electoral Commission, to         promote electoral registration among key target groups in the run-up to         the 2010 General Election (2010);       An invitation to Dr Wilks-Heeg to give evidence on electoral         registration at House of Commons Select Committee sessions in September         2010 and September 2011;       Media appearances by Dr Wilks-Heeg discussing the coalition's         legislative proposals for electoral registration: Channel 4 News         (29/09/2011); extended interview on BBC Radio 4's `The Westminster Hour'         (16/10/2011); article for Guardian ('Comment is Free') website         (14/12/2011).
An invitation to Dr Wilks-Heeg to speak at a British Academy Policy         Forum event on individual electoral registration in December 2011         (alongside Mark Harper, Minister for Constitutional Reform, Jenny         Watson, Chair of the Electoral Commission and others);       Publication by the Cabinet Office in February 2012 of a revised         version of a literature review originally completed by Dr Wilks-Heeg         while working on this funded project (separate to the main research         report published by the Electoral Commission).
Beneficiaries: Both the research on electoral fraud and electoral       registration were taken up by others.
As detailed above, the JRRT report       led directly to a campaign led by Unlock Democracy.
The electoral       registration research, undertaken jointly with the Electoral Commission,       resulted in the Commission's own campaigns team leading a successful       campaign to promote electoral registration among under-registered groups       (local authorities reported unprecedented additional registrations before       the 2010 election, including Islington [+19,000], Leeds [+18,000] and       Manchester [+7,000] &#8212; see: "Remarkable'         rise in number of people registering to vote", The Independent,       30 April 2010).
A range of key stakeholders commended the electoral registration       research, including Michael Wills MP, Minister of State and John Bercow,       Speaker of the House of Commons (letters to the Electoral Commission's       Chair, Jenny Watson available on request).
Dr Wilks-Heeg's research also       informed the work of the Cabinet Office's Electoral Registration       Transformation Programme and was cited by the Minister for Constitutional       Reform in oral evidence to the Commons Political and Constitutional Reform       Committee.
Dr Wilks-Heeg provided written and oral evidence on electoral       registration to the same select committee on two occasions.
Nature and evidence of impact: The research findings shaped policy       development, ultimately contributing to legislative change.
Electoral       registration reforms initiated by the Labour government in 2009 came       within a year of the publication of Dr Wilks-Heeg's initial findings.
While others, most notably the Electoral Commission, had made the case for       reforms since 2004, the government had previously been resistant to change       and, given the timeline summarised above, it is evident that Wilks-Heeg's       work had a clear, independent impact.
Evidence of impact includes: the       number of MPs who signed an Early Day Motion citing the research; the       number of references to the research in Parliamentary debates,       particularly during the passage of the Political Parties and Elections       Act; and the knowledge of the relevant Minister of State about the       contents of the report.
Similarly, the citation of Dr Wilks-Heeg's       subsequent work on electoral registration in the media, in parliament, in       select committee reports and by government ministers are indicators of       impact, particularly during the passage of the Electoral Registration and       Administration Bill (now Act) through parliament in 2011-13.
