     Drawing on the methodology and findings of the research cluster founded       by Vice and Falconer,       `Storying Sheffield' uses accessible and universal ideas such as       narrative, storytelling, history, and       interaction with the local environment as ways of engaging with a diverse       range of people including       long-term users of mental health services, people with physical       disabilities, immigrants, older       people (some of whom live with dementia or other degenerative conditions),       primary school       students from economically disadvantaged areas of the city, and patients       in secure hospitals.
The       project (i) has had socio-economic and cultural impact, improving the       health, well-being, and       employability of participants, as well as increasing understanding of, and       changing attitudes to,       socially marginalised groups; (ii) has impacted on policy-making, by       informing City Council       practices for developing sustainable community policies; (iii) has       influenced therapeutic practice;       and (iv) has improved communication and co-operation between previously       separate entities within       the city and region, through the establishment of the Sheffield Arts and       Well-Being Network.
Socio-Economic and Cultural Impact       Storying Sheffield began in 2009 with an innovative course, which remains       at the core of its       activities.
This is a unique venture in British Higher Education in which       undergraduate students and       people from the city from disadvantaged backgrounds (chiefly people who       have long-term mental       health problems and/or physical disabilities) collaborate under Stone's       guidance to produce,       record, and collect stories and other diverse representations of the lives       of Sheffield people and the       `life' of this major UK city more broadly.
Working with a wide variety of       media, the project supports       participants to construct their own narrative artefacts, in which they       critically examine contemporary       life and identity, with the work produced showcased at a variety of public       events, including a one-day exhibition every year.
The primary aims of this course are to use       narrative (i) to open up       opportunities and resources in Higher Education for more people,       particularly those who are often       excluded (or feel excluded); and (ii) to give these people a voice, so       that the wider community can       learn from their experience and knowledge.
Its achievement of these aims       is evidenced by the fact       that it was shortlisted for the 2011 Times Higher Education awards in the       widening participation       category.
The Storying Sheffield course is further underpinned by the belief that,       in addition to       disseminating ideas, 'education' can benefit participants through offering       them new frames of       reference and critical skills.
It also connects them to various resources       and people who are able to       assist and advise them if they are interested in continuing further in       education, taking up       volunteering or employment opportunities, or developing new interests.
Evaluation of the course       reveals that some 70% of participants with mental health issues make a       measurable and       significant change in their life as a direct result of their       participation, from being able to leave their       house alone to enrolling in further study, getting a job, or starting       voluntary work.
This impact is       also evidenced through feedback on the annual exhibition [S4], and the       following comments (from       2010) are illustrative of the way in which the course enables participants       to enter into further       education or employment, or to order their lives more purposefully: `[Storying         Sheffield] gave me         the confidence to get back into education, and to enrol on the         foundation degree'; `This course has         given me confidence to express myself in ways I never thought         possible... [it] has given me the         confidence to apply for jobs, in which I have been successful and I         start my new job three days         after the exhibition'; `Previous to this course, I had led a         chaotic lifestyle for a number of years and         my life had lacked purpose and direction, but coming to this course has         made me think of what I         want to do in the future'.
The project also impacts on its       participants' sense of emotional well-being.
Feedback from the 2010 exhibition is testimony to this transformative       effect, and the following       comment is indicative: `Clearly some of the themes of the project         touched on some very personal         issues for me, and I haven't experienced that kind of emotional         catharsis in a long while, so I also         wanted to thank you for that.
[...] It was amazing to see something that         clearly had such a positive         effect on so many people &#8212; I add myself to that number'.
In       addition, Storying has had a profound       social impact by helping members of the public gain insight into the       plight and consciousness of       these marginalised members of the Sheffield community.
As one of the       participants wrote in a       published article about his experience on the project: `the Storying         Sheffield project will enable         more of us to feel comfortable in telling our stories and also help         people without mental health         conditions to understand us better and therefore see us in a more         positive light' [S6].
The impact of the original course and public exhibitions is further       demonstrated by the way in       which the project has diversified and grown, with organisations       approaching Stone to set up       projects utilising the narrative methodology developed.
These projects       include partnerships with (i)       Sheffield City Council and emergency service providers (e.g.
South       Yorkshire Police) aimed at       understanding community cohesion through narrative, the results of which       are feeding into local       government policy and informing interventions (see below, `Impact on       Policy-Making'); (ii) Rampton       Hospital and Sheffield Health and Social Care (see below, `Impact on       Therapeutic Practice'); (iii)       Rotherham's Youth Ready Hub, working with young people as a part of a       NESTA-funded project       (&#163;10,000) to improve educational attainment and enterprise using a       storytelling approach [S5]; (iv)       Learning for the Fourth Age, working with `memory books' and other       narrative artefacts to help       residents of care homes with degenerative conditions capture and recover       memories, a process       with positive impact on their self-esteem; (v) St Mary's Community Centre,       Sheffield, working with       migrant women, newly arrived in the UK and learning `survival skills' and       conversational English, to       produce narratives about points of cultural connection and difference.
From the initial research focus of trauma, then, the project has       developed into a much more       wide-ranging exploration of the ways in which narrative can give voice to       marginalised, deprived, or       overlooked communities.
An example of the way in which the success of the       original project and its       reputation for recovering marginalised voices led to this diversification       is supplied by the `Women       of Steel' project.
In 2011, Stone was approached by a group of women who       worked in the Sheffield       steel works during World War II.
Using methods and approaches developed on       the Storying       Sheffield course, students collaborated with the former steelworkers under       Stone's supervision to       produce a film about the lives of these women and a lasting record of a       previously overlooked &#8212; but       crucial &#8212; part of twentieth-century history and the role of working women       in the war effort.
This film       has been shown at several public screenings: at the Sheffield Showroom       (Feb 2011, sold out both       times), at Sheffield Town Hall, to mark International Women's Day (March       2011), and at the       Sensoria Festival of Film/ Digital/ Music (2012).
Copies of the DVD were       sold, raising almost &#163;400       for the cancer charity Clic Sargent, and the film has also been used as an       educational resource in       local schools and in Age UK training seminars for social work students.
Impact on Policy-Making       Storying Sheffield champions the principle that agencies must listen to       the views and experiences       of the public, and supports the development of an exercise in listening,       particularly to those parts of       the community that are most talked about but rarely heard.
This is       exemplified in work undertaken       for Sheffield City Council, the police and fire services on a pilot       project in the Abbeydale region of       the city to look at innovative ways of developing sustainable community       policy in an area of cultural       diversity and socio-economic disadvantage.
The project involved adapting a       technique &#8212; courage       mapping &#8212; devised with local primary school pupils.
This produced over 400       individual maps of the       children's neighbourhoods, identifying where and how they felt courageous       in different locales.
Stone and Forrest developed the methodology, supervised the operational       `delivery' of completing       the maps, and analysed this extensive resource.
The City Council also       wanted to hear and       understand the stories told about their neighbourhoods by local residents.
As the Council's Head of       Safe and Sustainable Community states [S3]: `the project [produced] a         substantial amount of data         about how people choose to talk about, think about and imagine their         neighbourhood [...] In terms         of wider impacts, the project is reporting to the City's Cohesion         Strategy Group (jointly chaired by         the Council's chief executive and the SYP [South Yorkshire Police]         District Commander) and the         City's statutory Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership.
The         methodology of the work has been         praised as being an innovative approach to exploring how and why         neighbourhoods work/don't         work.
The success of the project to date and its sustainability and         success in the future, is reliant         on the exemplary partnership approach adopted by the University.'
Impact on Therapeutic Practice       Storying Sheffield's methods have also been applied in a variety of health       and social care settings.
The Head of Education, Peaks Unit, Rampton Hospital (Notts, NHS Trust)       attended the 2010       Storying Sheffield exhibition and was struck by the evident impact of the       project on community-building       after traumatic mental health histories, commending the `pride and a         sense of         "togetherness" [which] emanated from the exhibition' [S1].
This       insight into a new way of achieving       `inclusivity and collaborative working' led directly to `Living       Narratives', undertaken with Rampton       Hospital, in 2011, in which the methods developed by Storying Sheffield       around narrative artefacts       were used to help patients &#8212; who do not always engage fully with therapy &#8212;       to understand and       articulate the routes of their offending.
The project, which produced an       exhibition and two privately       printed volumes (of poetry and art), won the 2011 award for promoting and       supporting recovery       from the Care Programme Approach Association.
As Rampton's Head of       Education notes, `The         principles behind Storying Sheffield have been very successfully used in         this forensic mental health         setting, and the project is now doing even more to promote the benefits         of learning' [S1].
As a result of the success of Storying Sheffield, Stone was also       commissioned by Sheffield       Health and Social Care (SHSC) to produce two DVDs: Digital Narratives         of Severe Depression       (2010) is used for training clinical staff, giving them a much more       informed sense of real-life       experiences through testimonials in which patients situate their health       within narratives about their       life; Film Narratives of Recovery (2011) , a series of interviews       with long-term service users, was       used to open a conference of practitioners and service providers, giving       unique insights into the       perspectives of vulnerable patients.
In 2011 SHSC also commissioned Stone       to work with       practitioners to develop a package of recommendations about how to       implement innovative       approaches to recovery (including education) within the health care       setting and how to broaden       routes to well-being beyond medication.
As a result of these       recommendations, the Executive of       SHSC has resourced the 'Recovery Implementation Group', chaired by Stone,       to oversee the       implementation of recovery approaches.
Impact on Civic Partnerships       Storying Sheffield's partnerships with health providers and the creative       industries led to the       establishment of the Sheffield Arts and Well-being Network in 2012.
Monthly meetings bring       together artists, health and social care professionals, academics, and       service-users, improving       communication and building sustainable relationships between previously       diverse groups.
In short, Storying Sheffield has had significant impact in a number of       ways: it has increased social       cohesion by breaking down barriers and increasing understanding between       different groups; it has       had economic benefit, by equipping socially-marginalised individuals with       new skills and       confidence; it has had a positive impact on the health and well-being of       participants through       creating a sense of community and inclusivity; it has influenced       policy-making and therapeutic       practice; it has drawn partners from across the city into productive and       sustainable collaborative       relationships; and it has enhanced knowledge and understanding of a       neglected piece of women's       history and the British war effort, validating and commemorating the       efforts of those individuals.
