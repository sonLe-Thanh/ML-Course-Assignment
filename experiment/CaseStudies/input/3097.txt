Context       Prior to this UoM research, school dental screening was a statutory       requirement of the NHS but had never been systematically evaluated to       determine if the resources consumed in this national programme improved       health or reduced inequalities.
There was also no knowledge of how many       children with untreated disease accessed services and received appropriate       care as a result of the national programme.
The research by the UoM team       comprehensively evaluated the effects of school dental screening for the       first time and could find no benefit for population health and we provided       evidence that the screening programme was likely to increase inequalities       in health and utilisation of NHS dental services.
Pathways to impact       Throughout the planning and delivery of this research programme the UoM       team had a very close working relationship with the Office of the Chief       Dental Officer.
This office has responsibility for dental policy in the       Department of Health (DH) and was supportive of the research from       inception to delivery.
In 2004 the preliminary results of the study were       discussed with policy makers from the Chief Dental Officer's office and       the Chair of the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) Child Health       Sub-Group.
The NSC is a high-level standing committee that advises       Ministers and the NHS in the four UK countries about all aspects of       screening for all diseases and conditions.
The NSC regularly reviews       policy on screening for different conditions in the light of new research       evidence becoming available.
Following these informal discussions the NSC       formally invited Tickle's team to present the findings of       the research programme set out in section 2 to a specifically convened       one-day workshop with policy makers from the four UK countries, senior       clinicians and representatives of stakeholder organisations, such as the       British Dental Association.
The research was subsequently peer reviewed by       the NSC and formally considered by the NSC Child Health Sub-Group.
In 2005       the NSC produced an interim report (S1) which summarised the methods and       findings of the research set out in section 2 and concluded that "The         data as presented suggest that routine screening of school children at         this age has no beneficial effect on their dental health.
The study         seems robust and the conclusion justified."
In September 2006 the Programme Director of the NSC met with the English       Chief Dental Officer to discuss the implications of the report and       recommended that the DH should stop the national school dental screening       programme.
In January 2007 the DH issued formal guidance to the NHS in       England (S2) which stated "The recently published results of a large         Randomised Control Trial have demonstrated that school dental screening         (as currently undertaken) is ineffective at a population level in         reducing levels of untreated disease and increasing attendance of those         who need treatment."
The DH guidance went on to say that "the UK         National Screening Committee recommended to the UK Chief Dental Officers         that there is no evidence to support the continued population screening         for dental disease among children aged 6 to 9 years.
The Committee's         recommendation was based in part on the view that the resources         currently used for screening could be used more effectively in other         ways to tackle oral health inequalities."
The guidance advised PCTs       to review their programmes in the light of advice from the NSC and "where         PCTs decide to discontinue with screening, how resources can be used         most effectively to address inequalities in oral health in other ways."
In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health and Social Services and       Public Safety (DHSSPS) issued a policy statement on school dental       screening in 2008 (S3) directly citing "important research         undertaken by the University of Manchester."
The policy document       advised that school dental screening "should cease once the screenings         for the 2007/08 school year have been completed.
Trusts are asked to         redeploy the resources used on screening into the other priority         business areas outlined in the Community Dental Service corporate plan,         issued by the DHSSPS in September 2006."
Reach and Significance of the Impact     Impact on national policy and the NHS       As a result of this radical change in national policy, school dental       screening ceased across England (S4) and Northern Ireland (S3).
The       research and its impact received national media coverage by the BBC (S5).
The resources previously used for screening were redirected into providing       primary prevention programmes and treatment services for vulnerable       groups.
An external review for the UK NSC (S4) in 2013 estimated that this       has freed up on average 4-5% of workforce hours (dentists and dental       nurses) of salaried primary care services.
Key Beneficiaries of Impact       Following the suspension of the school dental screening programme NHS       resources were redirected to expand primary prevention programmes and       clinical services provided by the Community Dental Service (CDS).
This       service is responsible for providing community based prevention programmes       targeted at high need, socio-economically disadvantaged communities.
The       CDS also provides clinical care services for patients with special care       needs and also safety net access services.
The main beneficiaries of the       redeployment of CDS resources are patients with impairments or       disabilities who need access to dental care, localities with poor access       to dental care and disadvantaged communities with high levels of dental       need that can benefit from targeted prevention programmes.
Therefore some       of this resource would have been redirected into improving access to       dental services, some into prevention programmes so the impact in terms of       additional patients seen or disease prevented is difficult to quantify       accurately.
However, a re-introduction of school dental screening was       proposed in the Conservative Party (S6) prior to the 2010 general election       and a figure of &#163;17m a year in England alone was ear-marked for the       programme.
Based on average annual costs of CDS salaried dentists and       dental nurses this would equate to funding approximately 120 senior dental       officers and nurses each year.
At a conservative estimate this workforce       would be able to provide care for an additional 250,000 patients each       year.
On-going policy impact       In 2010 the Conservative Party planned to reintroduce screening (S6).
Tickle       wrote to the then shadow Secretary of State for Health to draw his       attention to the strong evidence-base which demonstrates that this policy       would not be effective.
This stance was supported by the Chief Dental       Officer (S7) and the policy was subsequently changed to a broader one       prioritising the improvement of children's dental health (S8,9) This means       that the school dental screening is unlikely to be revived and precious       NHS resources will be spent on more effective interventions, a position       which has been reinforced by recent developments.
In 2013 the NSC       revisited the evidence base for school dental screening and in a new       report (S4) currently out for consultation, recommends no change in the       policy again citing research undertaken by the UoM and stating that no       further research has been published to refute this conclusion (S4).
