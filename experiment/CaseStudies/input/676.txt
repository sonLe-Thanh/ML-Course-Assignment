     Wide-reaching impacts have been facilitated by the interdisciplinary       nature of the review and its global relevance, the inherent Cochrane       Library acclaimed standard (References 1 &amp; 5) as well as by the       adoption of an active dissemination strategy.
Dissemination     Active and passive forms of dissemination have been important as pathways       leading to impact, notably:     Academic and professional journals and networks: This has included       publication through commentaries, editorials and peer reviewed papers in       journals (e.g.
References 2-4), conferences, health forums and invited       talks, targeted at various audiences including health care providers,       managers and practitioners.
Soltani has presented the work at several       conferences and networking seminars (an invited speaker at RCM event on       the International Day of Midwives "Celebrating Midwives: Celebrating       Achievements", 5th May 2011, London; "Reproductive Health"       conferences in Iran (Tabriz, Tehran and Mashhad universities 2011);       Lebanon (The American University of Beirut (2011), and Indonesia (Andalas       University 2012)).
Promotion via global organisations and reputable websites: The       summary of the findings has been promoted through globally accessible       websites (Sources 1 &amp; 2).
Media coverage: The NBC News       Australia covered the original review (Source 3).
Impact to date (31.7.2013)     Within the UK, findings from this work have influenced national policy,       specifically:            The DH Policy paper; "Midwifery 2020: Delivering expectations" (09         Sept 2009) which provides a UK-wide vision for midwives' contribution to         "achieving quality, cost-effective maternity services for           women, babies and families", uses this review to highlight key         messages on the leading role of midwives for low risk women (Source 4).
The Prime Minister's Commission (PMC): Caird et al (2010) who were         commissioned by the PMC to undertake a rapid review on the future of         Nursing and Midwifery cited our review to support their recommendations         on the socioeconomic value of Nursing and Midwifery (Source 5).
The Healthcare for London strategic review of maternity services:         "Improving maternity care in London: A framework for developing         services" (March 2011) cites this review in recommending ways of         reducing inappropriate interventions designed to improve women's         experiences of birth (Source 6).
Internationally our research has informed reviews of maternity services         in the USA, Brazil and influenced policy change in Australia:       Our review informed a report commissioned by the US Institute of         Medicine (The Future of Nursing 2011) which produced action orientated         recommendations for transforming the safety and quality of midwifery         practice (Source 7).
The review has been used by women's rights activists (WRA) as the best         evidence to support their case against the Brazilian Medical Council         (BMC) which has released resolutions prohibiting women from having         midwives as their carer during childbirth.
Using our review, WRA have         renounced the BMC resolutions as illegal and against women's human         rights and demanded action from the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
This         has informed subsequent plans for the redesign of maternity services in         Brazil (Source 8).
The impact of the review is well captured in the media release by the         Australian College of Midwives (13 May 2009: "Mothers and Midwives         Budget winners").
This used our review evidence to support the case for         midwife-led care to improve access to continuity of care by midwives for         all women and reduce the gap for disadvantaged groups.
It stated: "Research           evidence shows a range of benefits when women are cared for by known           midwives.....
These include .... less need for epidurals or for any           pain relief, fewer episiotomies, more normal births......."These           reforms (by the Australian government) pave the way for tens of           thousands of women and their families to benefit from continuity of           midwifery care" ......
Growing Impact     Following its selection by Cochrane for a press release, with the support       of public relation (PR) officers from SHU and other collaborators, we       developed promotional summaries in July 2013 and organised interviews to       ensure an effective response to the media interest.
All collaborators,       particularly Sandall, Devane and Soltani, divided media interviews among       them.
Media coverage has continued beyond July 2013 and details have been       broadcast by "Reuters", "Sky News Australia", "Evening Echo", "Daily       Mail", "Irish Times", "Yorkshire Post", "Real Radio", "BBC Radio       Sheffield", BC1 Canada".
Global free access is also facilitated by podcasts in several languages       in addition to English.
Soltani led production of Farsi and Arabic       podcasts and other colleagues translated it into Spanish and Portuguese (http://www.cochrane.org/podcasts/issue-7-8-july-august-2013/midwife-led-versus-other-models-care-childbearing-women).
Soltani       has been invited by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to act as       an external consultant to set up the first Midwife-led care initiative in       Iran.
The updated review findings have been identified by the DH as a       priority for incorporation into updated NICE guidelines on intrapartum       care.
In addition, through the new project "promoting Midwifery led care for       low risk women", Soltani led targeted seminars (for local researchers and       clinicians) and meetings with key stakeholders (e.g.
Nursing Director       &amp; Head of Midwifery, and Maternity Services Liaison Committee (MSLC)       members).
She established a team including Dr Helen Baston and Alison       Brodrick (Consultant Midwives) and Frankie Fair (Midwife) from STH-JW and       Alex Scott (Research Assistant) from SHU plus proactive engagement of       maternity users (e.g.
Rachel Dignall (user group coordinator) and Lucy       Atkinson (MSLC Chair) as part of this local awareness and implementation       project.
Through this, we have provided systematic evidence and women's       stories (http://www.sth.nhs.uk/services/a-z-of-services?id=171&amp;page=126)       about various models of care and place of birth (http://www.sth.nhs.uk/services/a-z-of-services?id=171&amp;page=125)       on the hospital website plus an electronic survey to capture impact of       relevant evidence from mothers' and staff's perspectives.
Although at an       early stage, being launched as recently as July 2013, when there were 281       hits, this project is aimed to raise and maintain awareness in supporting       women and staff in making informed decisions about the type of care during       pregnancy and birth.
Responses from health professionals continue to grow       and we are in the process of survey implementation for women.
