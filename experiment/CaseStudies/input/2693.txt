     The ultimate aim of CBR's research is to advance entrepreneurial and       innovation skills of SMEs in the NW Wales Convergence region so as to       contribute to business growth, innovation and sustainability over the       long-term.
The impact of CBR's research on SMEs over the 2008-2013 period       was facilitated by the involvement of user groups from the outset.
Collaboration in the design of the research included important public       sector bodies such as local government authorities, the Welsh Government,       National Health Service Trusts, the Department of Economy, Science &amp;       Transport, and tourism partnerships [a1 and a3]; as well as       local SME owner/managers (including trade contractors, firms operating in       the creative and digital/high tech sectors, as well as engineering and       business service companies) [e.g.
a4].
The resulting impact can be       evidenced at the local [b1 and b2], regional and national       levels [b5].
The findings demonstrate SME commitment to a wide       range of factors affecting their innovation orientation, but most       important are also a testament to the devotion by owners to encourage new       ideas, as well as to cultivate more innovative employees.
Pathways to impact have focused on identifying the actual needs of SMEs       in the region.
First this has taken place via dissemination of CBR       research at various workshops and seminars involving SME users.
Examples       of such include: presentations on "Successful marketing strategies and       business growth" (during the European SME Business Week at Wrexham Borough       Council, 3rd-7th October 2011); local business events (Marketing Master       classes for SMEs during Anglesey Business Week, September 20th       2011); and media work (BBC Radio Cymru (14th December 2011) and       Newyddion (15th December 2011; 26th June 2012)).
The       research has also been presented at conferences ranging from international       to local, attended by practitioner and government policy audiences as well       as researchers of enterprise and regional development.
Examples include       the Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (ISBE) Conference (3rd-6th       November 2009); and the Research Forum to Understand Business in Knowledge       Society (EBRF) Conference (15th-17th September       2010).
The second critical pathway to impact has been through a wide range of       SMEs and social enterprises providing the `test-bed' on which CBR research       would be applied; including involvement in co-development of research and       active participation in a variety of network initiatives.
Research on       High-Tech SMEs (2007-2011) has impacted upon local SMEs such as Draig       Technology Ltd [b1] where research from Sara Parry led to the       application of the CRAM model and a better understanding of customer needs       in a bilingual context.
Similarly research from Rosalind Jones at       Semantise (2007-2010) [b2] resulted in a 5% improvement in       Semantise's sales through a better understanding of the importance of       entrepreneurial marketing capabilities.
Between 2008-2011, the FEC framework guided the business activities of       several local female entrepreneurs in developing self-competencies, with a       fine example being Jwls Silver Keepsakes, [b6].
Such frameworks       have realised benefits such as increased profitability and improvements in       business growth.
This activity is in-line with Welsh Government policy to       use Convergence funds to increase pre- and post- start-up business support       specifically targeted at women to ensure accessible and appropriate       services to meet evidenced need.
Another example of CBR's research work with social enterprises included       The Holyhead Opportunities Trust's partially and Dr. Sonya Hanna on place       branding &#8212; this involved the development of a model for Strategic Place       Brand Management.
It had an immediate influence on local town planning       strategy and SMEs as the results directly informed the place branding       strategy and the process of place brand management of Holyhead (Anglesey)       which, in turn, led to the "establishment and delivery of a &#163;400k       rebranding and marketing project for Holyhead in the period 2009-13" [b4].
Local firm BIC Innovation has applied the insights and understandings       generated from joint research into the study of innovation in the food       processing industry [a6] as part of its consultancy services.
This       has ultimately led to improved competitive advantage capability for BIC       Innovation through an enhanced understanding of its substantial client       base as well as support for the internationalisation of SMEs based in NW       Wales [b5].
Research activities have also fostered on-going relationships with SMEs,       leading to impact through successive collaborations.
Much of this has been       through Knowledge Transfer Partnerships in High-Tech and digital       communication SMEs [b1 and b2], including the strategic       re-positioning of Sain Records of Caernarfon, North Wales (July 2009 to       July 2011, funded at &#163;63,997), an investigation of competition, integrated       communications strategy and Customer Relationship Management at Marco       Engineering Ltd &#8212; an SME in the engineering sector (May to December 2010,       &#163;30,400) and a study examining competitive advantage and marketing       capabilities in the green-building sector at Black Mountain Insulation of       Kinmel Bay (2011-2013, &#163;71,670).
Another subsequent project, sponsored by       the Attractions of Snowdonia Consortium (Feb 2010, &#163;10,000) was funded to       review existing web marketing strategies and scope for implementation of a       New Media/Web 2.0 based Social Marketing strategy to aid a consortium of       local tourism SMEs to improve their online presence and raise awareness of       existing good practice in the tourism sector [b3].
Findings       prompted a successful &#163;1m Interreg III bid (transnational Ireland-Wales       Structural Funds) to strengthen the region's digital presence and provide       a professional, integrated and bilingual interface, whose look and feel       reflects the ethos and `sense of place' of Snowdonia.
In addition to the significant impact on SMEs already outlined, other       initiatives such as LEAD Wales, GIFT, TESLA, Menter         Iontach Nua and forLab disseminate research and facilitate       an extended influence of the Centre:             LEAD Wales is an &#163;8m European Social Funded programme launched         in 2009 and is delivered in partnership with Swansea University.
Its         Bangor lead manager is the CBR director, Sally Sambrook.
The LEAD Wales         Annual Report (2012) details that, on average, LEAD Wales         participants increased their annual turnover by &#163;93,000 per business (an         average increase of 26%), and created an average of 2.3 jobs per         business (some part time) thus creating over 260 (FTE) new jobs within         the Welsh economy [b7 - page 19].
Green Innovation and Future Technologies Project (GIFT) is a         European Regional Development Funded partnership through the Ireland         Wales Programme (INTERREG 4A) between Bangor (lead partner), Waterford         Institute of Technology and University College Dublin.
Led by Griffiths         along with Sambrook, "GIFT aims to up-skill Welsh and Irish businesses         to better take advantage of the opportunities offered by the green         economy".
To date the project has engaged over 250 businesses.
Transnational Ecosystem &amp; Laboratory and Actions (TESLA) is         a &#8364;3.8m EU funded project partially supported by the Interreg IVA North         West Europe (2012-2015) supporting early stage high growth potential         companies.
It is a multi-university initiative, spanning several schools         at Bangor.
CBRs project element represents &#8364;707k and is led by         Mitchelmore who provides expertise including research work on         entrepreneurial finance initiatives, spin-ins and best practice         analysis.
Menter Iontach Nua (&#163;329k) is an initiative designed to improve         the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial skills of social         enterprises (in collaboration with the Ryan Academy of Dublin City         University, Business in the Community BITC Wales and the social         enterprise NorDubCo).
The project is co-ordinated by Griffiths, Molyneux         and Thornton.
forLAB, CBRs forecasting laboratory, has been involved in         Knowledge Transfer projects with a range of companies including local         start-ups &#8212; Alpha Maven Ltd. (Strategic Insight Programme (SIP) &#8212;         Project CS3009/2013 - &#163;2,250, on "Predictive Models for Financial         Markets Using Real Time Micro-blogging data streams"), to major anchor         organisations in the region &#8212; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products         Ltd (Welsh Government sKTP Programme KTP1000811 /2012 - &#163;60,989, on         "Improving Operations efficiencies in the Healthcare diagnostics         industry" and SIP &#8212; Project CS1070 - &#163;2,500, on "Determining the         Operational Management improvement process", both in the factory at         Llanberis, Gwynedd, Wales).
Both organisations changed the way they work         as a result of these projects achieving more efficient operations in         various aspects of their businesses.
