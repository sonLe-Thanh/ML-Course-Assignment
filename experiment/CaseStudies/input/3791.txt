     i1) Cultural heritage is presented and interpreted for a wide public         audience.
Burns is the most influential poet of the Scottish literary canon, and it       might be expected that The Bard would receive significant coverage       in the Scottish national press, especially as its publication was timed to       mark the 250th anniversary of Burns's birth.
In the event The         Bard was widely reviewed and praised not only in the broadsheet and       tabloid press of Scotland, but throughout the UK and also in the USA.
Comments from a few examples include: `This is a fine biography, and it         is difficult to imagine its being surpassed for a very long time.'
(Alexander McCall Smith, The Daily Telegraph); `excellent'       (Scotland on Sunday); `searching and sensitive' (John Carey,       The New York Review of Books); `carefully researched ...         unearths material unknown to previous scholars' (The Times         Literary Supplement); `a sympathetic portrait ... eerily         contemporary' (The New Yorker); `The joy of Robert         Crawford's biography of Burns is that it restores much-needed complexity         to the image of the Ayrshire balladeer poet.'
(The Independent on         Sunday).
[S5]     Citations in reviews outside academic literature are themselves an       indication of impact on public discourse about Burns's life and work: that       there were more citations than a critical biography of a poet might       usually attract, in a variety of different types of publication, and from       not only Scotland, but also the rest of the UK and the USA, is indicative       of the greater than usual reach and significance of the research       underpinning The Bard.
Crawford also endeavoured to raise awareness of the value of Burns's work       through a diverse range of engagement activities.
He has given public       lectures on Burns at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, the Royal       Society of Edinburgh, Aye Write!
(Glasgow), Words on the Water (Cumbria),       Wigtown Book Festival, the National Library of Scotland, StAnza (St       Andrews) and at other literary festivals.
He has also been actively       involved in promoting Burns's work in the media.
Parts of The Bard       appeared in the Sunday Times and Louise Yeoman produced a       45-minute BBC Radio 3 programme Creating         Robert Burns's Reputation, based on Crawford's research (broadcast       25/01/2009).
[S6] Professor Crawford was interviewed about Burns's life       and works on various television and radio programmes, including BBC's Newsnight         Scotland and Reporting Scotland.
In Best Laid Schemes,       Crawford and MacLachlan offered a potential new public an affordable,       accessible volume of the poet's best work.
i2) Advisory contribution is made to a major Scottish Government         initiative, and research from the School assists the development of         stimuli to the tourist economy to Scotland.
The Burns anniversary served as one of four major themes of the Scottish       Government's tourist promotion `Homecoming 2009' and as a result of his       work published in The Bard, Crawford in effect became academic       consultant to this theme, as well as delivering a series of public events       aimed at supporting `Homecoming 2009'.
Public events which Crawford       developed and delivered from his research included a reading and dinner       attended by representatives of several governments at the British Embassy       in Brussels, and a two-day public celebration at the Library of Congress       in Washington (filmed         and digitally archived for posterity), at which Alex Salmond, First       Minister of Scotland, also spoke (24-25/02/2009).
[S7] The Senior Folklife       Specialist at the Library of Congress, responsible for the public       programming of that institution, reported that Crawford's research made `an         important contribution' to their `mandate of presenting the         highest quality scholarship and stimulating informed public discourse'.
[S1] The event was followed by a reception `co-hosted by the US         Congress' Scottish Interest Section and the Office of Scottish Affairs         at the British Embassy, that was attended by more than a score of US         Senators and House of Representatives members'.
[S1] A report       produced by the economic and social development consultancy firm EKOS has       estimated that the Burns-themed `Homecoming' brought net additional       visitors of 73,000 to Scotland in 2009, with a further 23,000 visitors       citing `Homecoming' as one of their reasons for visiting the country that       year.
EKOS estimates that those visitors for whom `Homecoming' was their       main reason for coming to Scotland brought a net additional spend of       &#163;53.7M to the Scottish economy.
[S8] While it is impossible to calculate       the exact proportion of this sum attributable to the contribution made to       `Homecoming' by Crawford's research, it is clear that Crawford's work on       Burns played an important part in boosting the Scottish tourism industry,       and consequently the Scottish economy during `Homecoming 2009'.
[S9]     i3) Research from the School informs Lottery-funded redevelopment of a         major visitor attraction, improving regional economic prosperity and         contributing to the quality of the tourist experience in Ayrshire     As a result of the impact of his research described above at (i1) and       (i2), Crawford was invited to be involved in overseeing the National Trust       for Scotland's National Lottery-supported redevelopment of the Robert       Burns Birthplace Museum (RBBM) in Alloway, Ayrshire.
[S2] The       re-development project had a budget of &#163;21M, which brought much needed       spending and employment to a deprived area of Scotland (Ayrshire scores       highly on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and has higher       unemployment than the national average).
The then Curator of the Museum       has commented that: `Professor Crawford's input included advice on the         reinterpretation of Burns Cottage, the poet's iconic birthplace, and         direction in the display of artefacts of national and international         significance in a new 1600m2 museum facility.
Professor Crawford personally edited thousands of words of new museum         text, contributed directly to the `Inspired by Books' section in the         museum, and was instrumental in contacting eminent fellow writers to         solicit contributions from authors such as Seamus Heaney and Jackie Kay.
The sum total of Professor Crawford's work in helping to shape the         content and visitor experience in Alloway cannot be overestimated: RBBM         is the most visited NTS property and attracts a consistently wide         demographic, all of whom are affected in some way by Professor         Crawford's expert contributions to the new museum.'
[S2]     The Curator is also of the opinion that the timing of The Bard `was         undoubtedly responsible for a resurgence in research interest in the         Birthplace Collection'.
[S2] In the year following the re-opening of       the Museum in January 2011 visitor numbers increased in the first year by       over 50% on each of the two preceding years.
[S10] At the end of 2011 the       RBBM was the second most frequently visited tourist destination in       Ayrshire and Arran, drawing 444, 947 visitors.
[S10] Of these, 80% came       from within Scotland; 15% from England, Northern Ireland, or Wales; and 7%       from overseas.
[S3] Scottish visitors to Ayrshire and Arran spent on       average &#163;112.14 per trip in 2011; rest of UK visitors spend on average       &#163;473.80 per trip and overseas visitors on average &#163;347.83.
[S10] When 47%       of Scottish visitors to the RBBM are discounted from potential spend       figures (being local residents rather than tourists from further afield)       it can be estimated that visitors to RBBM produced a spend in the local       economy of in the region of &#163;62M in 2011.
In 2010 this estimated figure       was &#163;42M.
In other words, RBBM redistributed into the local economy       roughly the cost of its redevelopment in the year of its opening.
Entrance       fee payments (&#163;8 for adults) and associated spending also bring very       significant revenue to the local area.
i4) New artistic expression is inspired by research in the School,         also providing paid work for freelance photographic artist Norman         McBeath     Inspired by The Bard's `sensitivity to Burns as a poet who         used Scots but reached an international audience', [S4] Norman       McBeath, a portrait photographer with work in both the Scottish National       Portrait Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery London, sought out       Crawford to collaborate with him on a series of paired photographs and       Scots verse texts.
Remarking that `as I worked with Robert, my own         practice as an artist developed', the photographer was awarded a       Creative Scotland New Work Award of &#163;5,000 to develop the collaborative       project that became `Body Bags / Simonides', and which was exhibited at       the Edinburgh         College of Art during the 2011 Edinburgh International Festival.
[S4, S11] It was the only visual arts show at the 2011 Festival to receive       a five-star review in The Scotsman (09/08/2011) [S12] and was the       subject of a BBC Radio         4 programme, nominated for a Sony Radio Award (03/12/2011).
[S13]       The exhibition has toured to galleries in Glasgow, Oxford and at Yale, and       has been seen by more than 8,000 people.
After the current REF window for       impact ended, it went to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago during September       2013.
[S4]     Legacy         Resources for this case study will be curated at the School's       webpage to provide continuing benefit to our users beyond the end of this       REF cycle.
