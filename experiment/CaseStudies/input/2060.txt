     General Election coverage research.
Research carried out on UK election coverage by the Loughborough       University team had its impact through raising awareness (among working       journalists, politicians, pollsters and commentators) of (a) the extent to       which women politicians had been marginalised in news reports, and (b) the       extent to which there was a systematic absence of coverage of substantial       policy issues in health, economy and education.
Awareness.
The 2010 election research stimulated considerable, and immediate,       interest among the stakeholders listed above.
Members of the team made       numerous media appearances and also supplied additional data to a range of       external bodies including the major political parties; Sky News and BBC       News; the Electoral Commission, and pollsters [5.1].
Drug policy coverage research     Research carried out by the Loughborough University team formed a crucial       part of the UK Drugs Policy Commission's 2010 publication Getting         Serious About Stigma [5.2].
The report highlighted how       negative public reactions experienced by recovering drug users and their       families constituted a `hidden' barrier to their effective reintegration       into society [5.3].
The report, with the Loughborough University       research at its core, had impact on awareness and understanding.
(a) Awareness            The Loughborough University project findings informed a series of         recommendations that collectively strengthened the official guidance         drawn up by the Society of Editors' Code of Practice Review Committee.
This change was highlighted in the parent body's subsequent annual         report: `We continue to work in diverse areas such as sports rights,         drugs and human rights.
Work is progressing on the production of a         factual reporting guide about people fighting and recovering from drug         addiction' [5.4].
The LCRC research has contributed to raising awareness albeit         sometimes in unintended ways.
Commenting on the launch of the original         UKDPC report a columnist for a quality Sunday newspaper wrote         dismissively of the Loughborough University team's evidence based         findings: `My daily fix, Prof, is to stigmatise these smackheads (as)         drooling mindless imbeciles (and) `glassy-eyed and threatening,         desperate and aggressive' [5.5].
The research has, however, also         helped improve the quality of debate.
In her speech opening the June         2012 Scottish Parliamentary session devoted to her motion on `Family         Support for Drug Addicts' MSP Nanette Milne made reference to the work         of the UKDPC and commented: `The media's use of words such as "junkies"         only adds to the stigma' [5.6].
The research was also cited in         the 2011 annual report from UK Focal Points on Drugs, a body sponsored         by the UK Department of Health, which collates data and information on         behalf of the continental wide European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and         Drug Addiction [5.7].
(b) Understanding            The Society of Editors' annual report 2010-11 acknowledged that the         importance of the LCRC's empirical work in identifying changes were         already underway: `We welcomed the recognition by the UK Drug Policy         Commission that the media has become an important positive influence on         public understanding of the problems of stigma' [5.4].
The Loughborough University evidence based `Getting Serious About         Stigma' report led to and directly informed the UKDPC-Society of Editors         joint publication `Dealing with the Stigma of Drugs: a guide for         journalists' [5.8].
The UKDPC's Submission to the Leveson Inquiry: press reporting of           illicit drug use of January 2012 explicitly acknowledged the         Loughborough Unviersity study in introducing a briefing that used the         LCRC evidence to make the case for the strengthening of the code on         reporting of this topic from whatever form of regulatory body emerges in         the future [5.9].
