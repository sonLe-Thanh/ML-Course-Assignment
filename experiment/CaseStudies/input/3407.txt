     Helping to normalise young people's health concerns by raising         healthcare professionals'         understanding of the language used by adolescents The main impact of       the unit's adolescent       health communication research relates to the provision of new       evidence-based knowledge to a       range of health professional audiences, knowledge which has enhanced their       capacity to consult       more effectively and confidently with adolescent patients.
Two new       resources have provided GPs       with new research-based knowledge and insight into how to raise health       issues proactively with       young people and to normalise their health problems, potentially lessening       the stigma associated       with seeking health advice.
The online Teenage Health Freak         Encyclopedia (3.5) and the bespoke       booklet Am I Normal?
(3.6) were developed in order to address the       perceived communication       barriers between medical professionals and adolescents in clinical       settings (as commonly identified       by NHS practitioners working with adolescents, as well as young people       themselves).
The       encyclopedia, written by Adolphs, Mullany, Smith and Harvey, provides       insight into a       comprehensive (A-Z) range of recurring health concerns experienced by       young people.
In order to       make the contents of the encyclopedia accessible to a wide audience, the       researchers produced       the `Am I Normal?'
booklet, a succinct, reader-friendly document       providing health professionals       with access to adolescents' most frequent health questions, as well as       providing evidence of the       actual language young people use to articulate their health concerns       (3.6).
GPs who have read the       material feel that it has given them new knowledge and insight.
Comments       attest to the value of       the booklet as a means of helping to engender discussions between health       professionals and their       adolescent patients.
The Vice Chair of the Royal College of General       Practitioners' Adolescent       Health Group comments: "The booklet describes well the subjects and issues       that are important to       young people and will give GPs the confidence to start conversations about       these topics."
(5.1)       Another GP specialising in adolescent health concurs: "General       practitioners often perceive young       people as a healthy population with no significant worries.
However this       booklet provides       invaluable insights into some of the `hidden' health concerns of       teenagers....GPs will be able to       read it in a few minutes and will find it much easier to open       conversations with their teenage       patients about possible `hidden agendas' within the consultation."
Another       GP comments on the       booklet thus, "It highlights the importance of not assuming any prior       knowledge when dealing with       young people, even that of the basic anatomy."
Others comment that the       resources provide       practical insights to help them in their clinical practice: "Don't assume       that teenagers know what       certain words mean.
", "Raise issues proactively with teenagers; normalise       their concerns."
(5.2)       In addition to the booklet being shared with 1,300 general practitioners,       the resource has been       circulated to the members of the Association for Young People's Health       (AYPH), an organisation       comprising over 300 health professionals and researchers working to       improve young people's       health and well-being.
AYPH's Research Lead and editor of the Journal         of Adolescence observes       that, "The systematic approach draws on a significant number of emails,       and can reveal quite       surprising results, such as the top smoking question being `How do I       stop?
', which might not be       what most people would have anticipated.
Because of the systematic       approach, the reader has       confidence that these results provide a firm basis to go on and ask other       questions."
(5.3)     Influencing outcomes for young people by contributing to (local and         national) government         strategy discussions/ documents, and informing health information         materials In July 2011,       the Joint Health Scrutiny Committee operated by Nottingham City Council       and Nottinghamshire       County Council sought information from the research team regarding young       people's       communication of eating disorders and body image issues as part of its       drive to better understand       the potential links between public health messages and young people's       eating disorders.
The       research findings from the adolescent health corpus which emphasised the       negative impact of       unrealistic body images on young people's health were incorporated into a       specially commissioned       report produced by the Joint Health Scrutiny Committee (5.4): Joint         Health: Health Messages and         Eating Disorders, which forms part of 'The Nottingham City         Healthy Weight Strategy 2011-2020'       for Nottingham city and county schools.
According to the Democratic       Services Officer, who co-       ordinated the Scrutiny Committee project, the CRAL research "offered       evidence that young people       experience considerable pressure to reduce their bodyweight to match a       fashionable ideal via       cultural influences e.g.
fashion models.
The research highlighted the       importance of young people's       language and personal perspectives when considering eating disorders, and       the committee found       the information to be useful and informative, highlighting subtle       communicative issues which might       not be self-evident.
Dr Harvey's summary of the research was attached to       the final version of the       committee's report as an appendix.
One of the report's recommendations is       for schools to develop       special sessions on body image to counteract unrealistic body image       portrayals in the media - a       recommendation which is to be promoted to schools".
(5.5)     The Child Health Strategy Lead for the East Midlands Strategic Health       Authority has submitted       the Teenage Health Freak booklet as evidence to the Government's Children       &amp; Young People's       Outcomes Strategy (July 2012), overseen by the Secretary of State for       Health.
This strategy       informed health reform policy work during 2012-13.
(5.6)     The unit has begun collaborating closely with Medikidz (see       section 2 p.2) to deliver a change to       its product.
Research undertaken by CRAL based on the corpus analysis of       health emails that       underpins the `Am I Normal?'
booklet (3.5)) is currently being       embedded into Medikidz       publications.
One of the founders of the company says: "The research into       the most frequently       asked questions in the Teenage Health Freak database carried out       by Professor Svenja Adolphs       and her team is of significant value to us.
It has allowed us to shape the       content of our comics in a       way that is most relevant to the concerns of young people.
Our close       collaboration with this       research team has thus enabled an exciting new way of integrating the       voice of young people into       our product."
(5.7) Over the past 12 months, the collaboration with Medikidz       has focused on       aspects of design and conceptualisation of a new type of comic the content       of which will be driven       by the research results outlined above.
In the next REF period, these       material changes to       Medikidz' product will translate into tangible impacts on its user       community: The company currently       distributes over 2,000,000 comic books in 45 languages, from Bulgarian to       Zulu, with books       available in 42 countries worldwide.
Contributing to enhanced practitioner-patient communication through         CPD of Healthcare         Professionals Research data and findings (3.1-3.6) shared with       practitioners through       conferences, symposia and other CPD events have contributed to increased       knowledge, changes       in perception and in some cases, concrete changes in clinical practice.
The three examples below       are indicative of the type of impacts delivered by CRAL's CPD work based       on research in the field       of adolescent health communication :            A senior Health Visitor who attended the Unite/Community Practitioners         and Health Visitors         Association Annual Professional Conference, `The Future of Public           Health Nursing, Best Practice           in Home, School and Community' (7th-8th November 2012, Brighton,         UK), felt that the research         findings shared by Harvey "challenged my perceptions about anorexia and         eating disorders and I         certainly learnt a lot of new knowledge from attending the presentation.
Indeed I have used the         knowledge gained to enhance my clinical practice in these difficult and         sensitive areas of health         (particularly my increased awareness of young people's language and         their personal perspectives)         and I intend to disseminate these practically relevant linguistic         insights to my health visitor         colleagues."
This major national conference brought together national         policy-makers with 400         health practitioners (health visitors, nurses, school nurses) with the         aim of shaping the future of         public nursing.
Highlighting the importance of paying close attention to         young people's patterns of         communication, the research drew attention to linguistic issues with         which practitioners were likely         to be unfamiliar (as described in detail in item 3.3).
(5.8)       A `Managing Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health in Primary Care'         Symposium, (Harvey, Imperial         College, London, 26 March 2009) brought together paediatric         psychiatrists and general         practitioners and clinical psychologists.
The research presented at the         event (3.2/3.3) helped to         enable frontline practitioners to reflect on their own psychiatric         practice, drawing attention to         communicative issues which routine institutional demands are likely to         marginalise or efface         altogether.
A Consultant Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatrist commented:         "This communication-based         research is vital for raising the awareness of the importance of the         link between language and         adolescent mental health.
I suspect that we, as a profession, may have         over-medicalised childhood         as there is a pressure on Psychiatry to become more focused on diagnoses         and reporting         outcomes of interventions for particular diagnoses.
There is the risk of         medicalising normal         childhood by professionals unless we are cautious about the language we         use and how we deal         with the language we hear from young people about their difficulties."
(5.8)       Research focusing on adolescent eating disorders, weight and body         image concerns (3.5/3.6)         was presented to over 200 East Midlands-based school nurses at the East         Midlands Strategic         Health Authority School Nurses Meeting (18 January 2012).
This was         prompted by interest from         the nursing community in increasing their efficiency in the light of         funding cuts to the school nurses         programme: Access to the top 50 questions that young people ask about         health and body image         helps them to better predict the concerns that young people might raise         with them.
A Locality         Manager of Children's Services who attended the event remarked: "The         research findings were not         only thought provoking but also identified a way of responding to young         people's needs through         their communications.
This research will help health practitioners like         myself working with young         people, especially in relation to sensitive health problems such as         eating disorders and body image         which are difficult to broach with young people."
