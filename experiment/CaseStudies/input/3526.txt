     The research undertaken at the Centre for Music and Science has had       impact since 2008 well       beyond academia, embracing direct outreach, media representation, and       influences on public       discourse concerning music in society, as well as impact on specific       industrial working practices.
CMS research has been represented widely in the media, including       internet, print, radio and       television.
Interviews with Cross and representations of his research have       appeared in the       magazines Archaeology (2008) and Science (2010), on BBC R3       and R4 (in 2008, 2009, and most       recently in the May-June 2013 series The Science of Music; see       Section 5a) and in numerous       independent radio productions, on film (Music of the brain, 2009,       Screen Australia/f-reel pty Ltd)       and on the web (e.g., Guardian podcast in 2008, Pacific         Standard webzine, 2012, Naked Scientist       podcast, April 2013), while CMS researchers have contributed to television       programmes for BBC1       and most recently More4 (What makes a masterpiece?, broadcast in       January 2012).
The strands of research within the CMS that have elicited the most media       interest are those       concerned with music, evolution and communication, including the impact on       empathy.
Ideas and       findings from CMS publications have been widely cited, and have been       disseminated through       published or broadcast interviews and via secondary sources that have       drawn on CMS       publications; this has led to the incorporation of ideas derived from CMS       research into media       debates concerning the role and value of music in society in a wide range       of internet sources       (Section 5b, dating from January 2012 to February 2013) and in newspapers       and magazines (such       as Science News, Section 5c, dated 14.VIII.10).
They are also represented in a popular science book, The World in Six         Songs (Section 5d, 2008),       of which a reviewer wrote in New Scientist: `... a fantastic ride.
Along the way, you'll hang out with       Sting, Joni Mitchell and Oliver Sacks, as well as people you likely won't       have heard of but will be       equally interested to meet, like music theorist Ian Cross' (Section 5e,       dated 20.VIII.08).
These       reflections of CMS research in popular media have helped to place science       as a significant       element in public discourse concerning the nature of music and its role in       society, and have       enhanced societal understandings of music as embedded in both biology and       culture.
Another direct impact of CMS research on the social (empathic) effects of       joint music-making has       been on work practices in the oil and gas industry.
Senior executives from       the BG Group       encountered Cross's ideas and research at a seminar in Pembroke College on       20.VII.12 and       realised that joint music-making might provide an excellent means of team       bonding to enhance       health and safety in the field, an approach that they have found to be       efficacious: in the words of       BG's Executive Vice President for HR, `I cannot thank the Cambridge team       and Professor Cross       enough, the application of the theories discussed at Pembroke will help us       to ensure that people       working for BG remain free from injury and are able to go home to their       friends and family each       and every day' (Section 5f, dated 19.VI.13).
Cross has also brought his research to wider attention through extensive       public engagement       activities.
He has contributed to events organised by the Wellcome Trust       and the Royal Society, in       both cases aimed at public dissemination of recent thinking and research       on music from scientific       perspectives (e.g., participating in Beautiful Noise, held at the       South Bank Centre London in June       2010, and presenting as part of the Pint of Science festival in       Cambridge in May 2013, this latter       attended by around 170 members of the public).
He was guest speaker at the       46th Academia Film         Olomouc in the Czech Republic, discussing three documentary films on       scientific research into       music for public audiences of around 250 for each film.
CMS members       contributed to the       University's Science Museum's Science Live event in 2011, and all       members of the Centre have       also been closely involved in the Faculty of Music's outreach programme,       holding a CMS Family         Day in 2011 and a day-long event The Mind Behind the Music       for the Cambridge Festival of Ideas       in 2012, at both of which children (mainly teenagers), teachers and       parents encountered music and       science through discussion with CMS members and by participating in       experiments (each event       involved some 150 participants).
CMS members also wrote, organised and       presented Good         Vibrations, a musical show about music and maths designed for       primary school-age children,       which filled the Faculty's Concert Hall (with a capacity of 500) for both       of its performances at the       University's Festival of Ideas in 2010 and 2011.
