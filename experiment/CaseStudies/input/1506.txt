     8% of dairy calves are born dead and 15% of live-born heifers are lost       during rearing, in the UK, with similar figures overseas.
The US       Department of Agriculture reports 7.9% heifer mortality.
All perinatal and       rearing losses have an economic impact, but dairy heifers only become       profitable half way through their 2nd lactation, recouping the average       &#163;1,300 it costs to rear them (circa 20% of dairy farm costs).
Hence it is       critically important to optimise rearing to ensure sufficient heifers       reach adequate body size and good health &#8212; ideally for first service at 13       months &#8212; to maintain the herd.
RVC's academic work in analysing the       influencing factors has been translated into practical guidance, now       modifying practices in the sector, to improve efficiency and reduce the       welfare issues associated with wastage.
DairyCo and Defra promote key messages from RVC research regarding       youngstock feeding and management [a,b].
Some advice contradicts       historical practice and expectation: e.g.
Wathes's work showed group       housing of calves does not raise mortality from infection.
It is generally       recognised to have a welfare advantage, and further contributes to healthy       growth by providing peer stimulation for feeding.
Monitoring growth rate       through as simple a means as measuring heart girth regularly, and managing       feeding practices accordingly, has been shown to lead to optimal growth       giving higher fertility, higher milk yield per day of life and improved       longevity [c].
Feed supplier and calf-rearing specialist, Volac       International, has distributed 800 - 1,000 weigh-tapes (300 in Ireland,       200 in Czech Republic and remainder in UK) to facilitate this approach.
The employment of RVC post-doc, Jessica Cooke (n&#233;e Brickell), as Young       Animal Technical Specialist by Volac, has driven implementation of       research findings [d].
HST Feeds also directly references Wathes's       research &#8212; emphasising the lifetime profitability parameters &#8212; in their       `Next Generation Heifer' feeding programme [e].
The new advice has also been promulgated via the media: the `Stop the       Loss' campaign, launched in 2011, based largely on RVC research data and       championed by Tim Potter, an RVC alumnus who also completed specialist       clinical training at RVC, and now a practising veterinarian, highlights       this economic and welfare issue.
The campaign has the support of major       industry stakeholders across animal feed, health and housing, and food       sectors [f].
Similarly, `Successful Heifer Rearing to Increase Herd       Profits', reporting RVC's work, is featured on The DairySite, a recognised       information source for farmers internationally [g].
In parallel with economic considerations, the welfare issues from wastage       identified in RVC's research have been highlighted by the Cattle Health       and Welfare Group (CHAWG).
The Dairy Cattle Welfare Strategy of 2010 [h]       (drawing on the Farm Animal Welfare Committee's 2009 report to government,       citing RVC research [reference 4]) notes: "Further promotion of best         practice methods for calf rearing and feeding to dairy farmers would         also be beneficial."
Its 2012 report identified progress in this       area: "The increased publicity given by the farming press to the Stop         the Loss campaign is to be welcomed whilst the National Youngstock         Association is a further step in the right direction."
[i].
The       Chairman of CHAWG commented further: "RVC's research and dissemination         of research findings is contributing to a significant change in the         approach to management of calves, to reduce loss and ensure healthy         growth, and particularly in monitoring heifers for efficient herd         replacement in dairy farming."
[j]     Farm veterinary practices are also now promoting practical action to       their clients, such as attention to health and diet indicated from regular       weighing and measuring of youngstock.
The President of the British Cattle       Veterinary Association comments: "Fundamental research at RVC is         strongly linked to industry involvement ...
The BCVA has two principal         roles: representing the views of cattle veterinary surgeons [and]         signposting Lifelong Learning for cattle veterinary surgeons... New         evidence based approaches to youngstock rearing, as discovered by Claire         Wathes and the RVC team have been enthusiastically promoted by the BCVA         and the education programme for both recent graduates and advanced         practitioners includes many such concepts."
[k] A Clinician with       Synergy Farm Health, a large practice in SW England, comments: "...         [data from the RVC's studies was used] to benchmark the pilot phase of         the [heifer monitoring] service'.
Some 20 farms use the service, and         research results have also been incorporated into training courses for         farmers (around 200 participants so far) and other veterinary practices;         ... and at a heifer rearing course for veterinarians in South Africa."

DairyCo notes AFC as a major factor in economic herd replacement, in its       2nd Milkbench+ report (February 2013) [m] and has indicated its       intention to include AFC in its sire selection indices.
The Head of       Research &amp; Development at DairyCo, comments: "[This] work has         informed much of our recent guidance on the key topics of youngstock         feeding and managing herd replacements... [AFC in sire selection         indices] is an additional recognition of the importance of Wathes's and         Cooke's research ... the availability of such data will make a decisive         contribution to improving the sustainability of the British Dairy herd."
[n].
The RVC work has also impacted internationally: The US Dairy Cattle       Reproduction Council has promoted RVC's findings in newsletters and       flyers.
A Q&amp;A sheet highlights RVC's work on the association between a       leptin gene polymorphism and perinatal mortality &#8212; which may now be used       in selection of animals in breeding for herd replacements [o].
Much of the research has been undertaken on Holstein-Friesian cattle in the     UK, the principal dairy breed worldwide.
However, work on substantial     datasets of Chinese Holsteins has led to RVC involvement in implementation     of approaches to impact on the issue in China, through collaboration with     Huazhong Agricultural University and the largest dairy farm (3,000 cattle)     in the Hubei Province.
The Director of that farm comments: "Research       results from Professor Wathes's team at the Royal Veterinary College have       been highly influential in raising awareness of the level of calf       mortality and how farming practices can be modified to reduce losses &#8212;       both during rearing nd in culling sub-fertile stock...
This dissemination       [...] to opinion leaders in the Chinese dairy sector is now being       implemented in our farm practice."
[p].
Wathes, as a key opinion leader, has contributed more generally to the       dissemination of RVC findings and consequent advice to the industry       sector: she has been invited to give keynote presentations at major       international conferences, including those held in Karlstad, Sweden,       (2011) and Wuhan, China, (2009, 2011).
The most recent funding of Wathes by DairyCo incorporates support for a       wide-reaching programme of events across the UK, (average of 1 per month)       targeting UK farms, commencing in 2012 and continuing beyond the REF       Impact period, to reinforce the messages to deliver economic impact [q].
A       workshop focusing on calf health organised in July 2013 at RVC attracted       50 participants from stakeholders across the farming sector.
Feedback       indicated broad influence of the RVC research amongst delegates in       different roles in industry and the public sector.
(N.B.
The diverse       audience meant that not all questions &#8212; intended mainly for farmers and       veterinarians &#8212; were relevant to all participants.)
75% (27/36) reported       changed professional practice, with 81-93% (of 25) following guidance       suggested by research outputs.
Although 9 meeting participants reported       that impact was `too early to tell', 16 claimed improved survival rates       and 18 improved calf health and economic benefit to their own or clients'       business [r].
