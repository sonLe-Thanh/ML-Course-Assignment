     The risks of a poor diet       A poor diet is one containing unbalanced proportions of nutrients,       especially excessive consumption of saturated fat, salt and sugar and       insufficient intake of fruit, vegetables and fibre.
Poor diet contributes       to a range of health risks, including nearly 50% of all deaths from       coronary heart disease, a third of all cancer deaths, diabetes, obesity       and dental caries.
Obesity alone costs the NHS more than &#163;5 billion every       year, with over 60% of adults overweight or obese.
A proposed solution to tackle poor diet       One proposed approach to poor diet has been to clarify the nutrition       information on the front of food packaging to ensure that consumers are       able to make informed choices when purchasing food.
A report from January       2008 entitled "Healthy weight, healthy lives" set out Government       expectations of companies in every food sector to promote healthy eating       under the Healthy Food Code of Good Practice, stating "A single, simple         and effective approach to food labelling used by the whole food         industry, based on the principles that will be recommended by the FSA in         light of the research currently being undertaken" (pg.
18).
This       research, culminating in the publication of R4 and R5, confirmed that       different label formats were difficult for participants to interpret and       took time and effort to understand, and proposed that front-of-pack labels       be consistent.
The impact of Newcastle research on Government policy regarding front         of pack food labelling       In October 2012, the Department of Health announced the introduction of a       new, consistent labelling format (EV b), directly citing R5: "Consumers         are confused when more than one scheme is used and this reduces their         ability and inclination to use this information.
Available online at the         European Journal of Public health website [link given to R5]."
The final design was announced by Health Minister Anna Soubry in June       2013 (EV c) in a press release that also directly cites R5: "This comes         after research [embedded link to R5] shows that people can end up         bewildered by the different nutrition labels on food."
Many food manufacturers have signed up to this scheme, including MARS,       Nestl&#233; UK, PepsiCo UK, and Premier Foods.
As well as this, seven of the       top ten UK retail brands have agreed to take part in the scheme, including       Tesco Food Stores Ltd, Marks and Spencer, Boots, Asda Stores Ltd,       Sainsbury's, Waitrose Ltd (EV d), Morrisons Ltd (EV e) and The       Co-operative Food (EV f).
Health Minister Anna Soubry states: "Research shows that, of all the         current schemes, people like this label the most and they can use the         information to make healthier choices."
(EV c).
The Executive       Director of Which?, Richard Lloyd, states: "We welcome this big step         forward towards making it easier for consumers to make healthy choices"       (EV c).
Finally, Simon Gillespie, the Chief Executive at the British Heart       Foundation states: "This is undeniably a first-class scheme that will         make it easier for shoppers to scan the shelves and make more informed         choices about what's going in their trolley."
(EV c).
The announcement has generated a high level of public awareness and       debate: the BBC website covering the announcement accumulated over 500       comments in the two days the article was open for comment (EV g).
In summary: with the introduction of a standardised front of pack       labelling system, consumers are given clear information about the food       they purchase, helping them to be more aware of food that contributes to a       poor diet and therefore of the health risks, such as obesity, that are       linked to poor diet.
