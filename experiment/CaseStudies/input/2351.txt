     MEPLAN software developed by ME&amp;P from the work of Echenique has been       used extensively by the UK Government in LASER (London And South East       Region) model for London Crossrail, Thames Gateway, Congestion Charging,       and has become the core of the DfT National Transport Model4,.
Cambridge Futures has had impact on the planning of Cambridge3:       "It paved the way for a more positive planning strategy for Cambridge         which provided housing closer to where the jobs were being created, by         achieving higher densities on existing brownfield sites, a radical         review of the inner boundary of the Green Belt to provide urban         extensions, and a New Town to the north west of Cambridge connected to         the city by high quality public transport.
Cambridge's growth strategy has recently been described as `smart' by         the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and last week was praised by the         Planning Minister for its positive approach to achieving high quality         growth that is making a major contribution to the UK's economy.
I have         no doubt that Cambridge Futures played a key role in initiating and         developing this strategy."
Director of Joint Planning for Cambridge's Growth Areas 2007-2011       (writing in 2013)     Prof Echenique was a member of the expert group for the Foresight Land       Use Futures exercise of 2010 whose "key findings and rich evidence         base continue to resonate with the change in ministerial priorities"10.
Cambridge Futures is an exemplar model in the final report5       (Box 7.2, pg 246) and underpins a priority recommendation:     "Consider the need for a duty on local planning authorities to consult         formally with local residents on options, benefits and trade-offs for         new forms of development.
This should be based on detailed analysis and         evidence, as pioneered, for example, in the Cambridge Futures exercise."
(pg 23)     The impact on Bilbao, and the Basque region more generally, has been       continuous over a long period.
Decisions were made prior to and during the       impact period, infrastructure was built before, during, and is planned for       after &#8212; but infrastructure built prior to the impact period is still       contributing to the transformation of the Basque region to be the most       economically vibrant region of Spain today:     "The model was used in a number of studies for forecasting the impact         of alternative policies in the Area and their evaluation.
The results of         these studies were key to the formulation of the policies implemented         over the years and have contributed to the transformation of the area         from a declining industrial city (closures of shipbuilding yards, steel         production, etc.)
in the late 1980s to the successful city of today.
Today the Region where Bilbao is the centre has the highest income per         capita of Spain (in late 1980s was the 5th)"1     Former Technical Director of Metropolitan Area of Bilbao and Deputy       Transport Minister of the Basque Government     The infrastructure for which the model was used1 include:            Construction Plan for Bilbao Metropolitan Railway.

The model was also used to inform planning policies current in force in       Getxo and in Leioa, Municipal Authorities within Greater Bilbao1.
The process in Chile, and in particular Santiago, has been similar:     "The model was used in a number of studies to forecast the impact of         alternative policies in the area and their evaluation.
The policies have         been implemented... and contributed to the transformation of the area         from a developing world region to a developed world region...     "Chile has multiplied by 5 the per capital income over the past 20         years and [since 2010] is a member of OECD.
The work of the teams who         work in Chile, based on the theoretical work developed at the University         of Cambridge has contributed to make the Country and the Central Region         a successful region and world exemplar"2.
Ex-minister for Public Works, Chile     The studies in question included2 the Macro plan for the       central region which made the case for investment in highways, ports,       airport, water and sanitation (implemented); and the motorway plan for       Santiago (implemented).
A key feature was that the model provided       confidence to the private sector to invest:     "It is of particular note that the infrastructure has been         substantially developed by the private sector under the principle that         the user pays for it.
The consequence is that the level of taxations has         remained low encouraging the development of the productive sector of the         economy.
"2     Finally, Echenique's results on urban form, particularly the failure of       compaction to generate a reduction in energy use are informing policy and       professional debate, including discussion in Parliament and the       professional press6,7,8 including the highly influential       Atlantic Cities9.
It has also sparked an enormous debate11       in the US about the role of planning research in challenging widely held       planning assumptions &#8212; or indeed beliefs.
