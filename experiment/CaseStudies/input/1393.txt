     It is vital to find ways to protect and pay for ecosystem services at a       time when Governments around the world are operating under tighter       economic constraints, and there is growing interest in Payment for       Ecosystem Service schemes internationally.
Reed led the       development of a UK Peatland Code that could facilitate private investment       in peatland restoration, providing guidance and quality standards for       potential investors and for the landowners and managers who are paid to       restore peatlands.
The Code gives corporations the opportunity to sponsor       UK-based projects linked to their brands as part of their Corporate Social       Responsibility portfolio, with the potential to turn these investments       into future assets if the Code becomes part of the Government's GHG       Accounting Guidelines (as the Woodland Carbon Code did), making it       possible to include GHG emission savings in corporate carbon accounting,       or if it becomes financially viable to trade the carbon on the       international voluntary carbon market.
The Code also provides an       opportunity for landowners and managers to generate financial rewards from       restoration.
The Government's 2011 Natural Environment White Paper emphasised the       creation of new markets to pay for nature's services.
It announced the       formation of Defra's Ecosystem Markets Taskforce, which was tasked with       identifying business opportunities for nature.
The Taskforce ranked a UK       Peatland Code as their joint top opportunity out of 44 submitted       opportunities (http://www.valuing-nature.net/taskforce).
In October 2012, Reed was invited to join the Roster of Experts       for the second phase of the Taskforce's work.
In its final report in May       2013, the Taskforce recommended the development of a robust code for       peatland restoration (http://www.defra.gov.uk/ecosystem-markets/files/Ecosystem-Markets-Task-Force-Final-Report-.pdf).
The Natural Environment White Paper committed to producing a Payment for       Ecosystem Service Best Practice Guide, which Defra published in May 2013       co-authored by Reed, featuring the Peatland Code as a case study,       based directly on Reed's research at BCU (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/           payments-for-ecosystem-services-pes-best-practice-guide).
The       White Paper committed to producing a Payment for Ecosystem Service Action       Plan, which Defra also published in May 2013, and which drew specifically       on Reed's research to highlight peatland restoration via the       Peatland Code as one of five opportunity areas (reference 1, section 5).
This committed Defra to a number of actions, including the launch of a       pilot Peatland Code (reference 2, section 5), and publication of metrics       to underpin the research developed in collaboration with Reed       (reference 3, section 3).
In July 2013, the Committee on Climate Change       (an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act       2008) highlighted the development of a Peatland Code as a "key priority",       drawing on evidence from Defra's PES Action Plan (http://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ASC-2013-Chap4_singles_2.pdf).
Since joining BCU in July 2012, Reed has been Research Manager       for IUCN's UK Peatland Programme.
The government's commitment to the       Peatland Code is further illustrated by a letter to the IUCN UK Peatland       Programme (5th February 2013), from the four country Ministers, which sets       out a framework for action, including co-operation and co-ordinated action       to support the development of the Peatland Code (http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/sites/all/files/20130205           Joint DA letter to IUCN.pdf).
This intention was re-iterated       in the UK Government's National Adaptation Plan in July 2013       (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/           209866/pb13942-nap-20130701.pdf).
Reed is now       supporting Welsh Government to co-ordinate peatland restoration under the       Peatland Code across the country and integrate payments with their Rural       Development Programme.
Defra funded Reed to carry out the necessary underpinning       research and develop the Peatland Code, and Reed is now on Defra's       commissioning team to fund continued research to support the next phase of       Code development.
The Code was published online for public consultation in       June 2013 (for responses see appendix 2, publication 4, section 3), and       was launched by the Environment Minister, Richard Benyon, at an       International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conference on 10th       September 2013 (http://iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/news/230).
The       Code has the potential to become a template for similar initiatives       internationally, and with this in mind in June 2013, Reed was       invited to present progress on developing the Code to a conference       organized by the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) in       co-operation with the European Network of Heads of Nature Conservation       Agencies (ENCA) (http://www.bfn.de/0103_conferenzce-biodiversity0.html).
Since then, Defra asked Reed to design and organize a conference       to bring together all their PES Pilot projects to help them evaluate the       research programme, and identify cross-cutting lessons and implications       for policy (http://ekn.defra.gov.uk/2013/10/04/ecosystems-knowledge-network-event-practical-experiences-with-pes/;       the event attracted over 70 participants and was over-subscribed).
The       Living with Environmental Change partnership commissioned Reed to       write two Policy &amp; Practice Notes integrating his team's research with       findings from across the partnership: one on Payments for Ecosystem       Services generally, and another translating this work for the professions,       titled "Natural capital for land management professionals" (http://www.lwec.org.uk/resources/policy-and-practice-notes).
Defra's Deputy Director of Sustainable Land and Rural Evidence and       Analysis stated (Testimonial 1, section 5): "Professor Reed's work         since joining BCU has made a significant contribution to the Payment for         Ecosystem Services agenda within Defra, with work he led on the UK         Peatland Code featuring prominently in the Defra PES Action Plan.
Moreover, the success of the research has been helped considerably by         Professor Reed promoting a collaborative and a multi-disciplinary         approach.
Overall this research has made a considerable contribution and         provided us with valuable lessons for the development of Payment for         Ecosystem Service schemes in the UK."
