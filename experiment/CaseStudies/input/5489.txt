     Process from research to impact: The research was       Strathclyde-originated with McIvor as PI       and Johnston employed as RA.
This research collaboration continued after       Dr Johnston moved to       a lectureship at Glasgow Caledonian University (until his retirement in       2010).
The research findings       reached a wider audience directly through readership of publications       (including the two research       monographs) together with other modes of research dissemination, including       conferences,       seminar papers, training workshops and speaking at stakeholders groups,       from trade unions to       asbestos activist groups, such as the global Ban Asbestos Network (for       example in Tokyo, 2009).
The methodology developed and experience accrued has also had important       `spin-off' impacts in       relation to public and community heritage, including within museums.
For       example, the AHRC KTF       with Glasgow Museums (noted above) provided an important conduit to a       non-academic audience,       as does McIvor's work as Director of the Scottish Oral History Centre.
The       AHRC KTF       incorporated auditing and supervising the digitising of existing       collections (notably Glasgow 2000         Lives), training curators, undertaking new interviews and promoting       oral history in the public       domain, and with contributions made to several exhibitions, projects and       publications (Source 6;       Source 7).
Types of impact: The body of research on miners' respiratory       diseases and asbestos-related       diseases and disability, using an oral history methodology has       specifically contributed to:            occupational health policy debates at international level,       raising awareness in Scotland and contributing to legislative change,         care practices and         campaigns to improve health and safety in the contemporary workplace,       widening public understanding of the connections between work         processes, employment         environments and well-being, and growing oral history within museums,         the heritage sector         and the local community          1.
Impact on international debate and awareness: McIvor acted as an       adviser to and speaker       for the International Ban Asbestos Secretariat (IBAS), drawing upon the       asbestos oral history       research to provide presentations.
For example, on 28 March 2009 IBAS       (Japan) held its annual       meeting in Tokyo.
Throughout the day, a panel of Japanese victims and       experts detailed the       current situation and discussed strategies for achieving the provision of       free medical treatment and       equitable compensation for all asbestos victims and the asbestos       decontamination of the built and       natural environment in Japan (Source 2).
McIvor addressed the meeting and       spoke of the human       tragedy of the "innocent victims" (of asbestos contamination).
A feature       on the underpinning       research has been permanently on the IBAS website for the past decade.
The       IBAS Coordinator       (Source 1) has said: "There is absolutely no question in my mind of how         your research has         impacted on the global campaign to ban asbestos and achieve justice for         victims.
...Your help with         the Queen Mary case was pivotal in getting justice for the California         victim".
The latter refers to       McIvor's role in research and the provision of witnesses from oral history       interviewees who worked       on the construction of the ship, The Queen Mary, in compensation       litigation.
Coal miners' respiratory diseases (as well as accidents) are currently at       epidemic proportions in       China.
A consultant to the ongoing EU-China Safety Co-operation Programme       (and former Energy       Adviser to the ETUC and TUC) has said: "The book [Miners' Lung]...has         encouraged us to move         ahead and organise international research/action on pneumoconiosis and         other miners' lung         diseases.
I asked the Chinese government to invite an international team         of specialists to China to         visit the miners' hospitals there" (Source 3).

Influence on health care: The research has also been       influential in developing therapy and       palliative caring practice in relation to asbestos related diseases       (ARDs).
Dr Helen Clayson, MD       (an asbestos campaigner and previously cancer hospice manager), has       testified that: "Professor         McIvor's work is widely read amongst UK asbestos victim support groups         and by researchers and         campaigners worldwide.
He continues to support research into         asbestos-related conditions and to         make serious occupational diseases more visible through exposure of the         experience of affected         individuals and communities.
He is an adviser to my current project in         Mumbai and Ahmedabad         that aims to deliver self-help low-tech, low-cost, palliative         interventions to very disadvantaged         former asbestos industry workers."

Legislation, compensation and raising awareness in Scotland:         Lethal Work and subsequent       research publications on asbestos were also influential in raising       awareness amongst Scottish       voluntary agencies and Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) of the       extent and the effects of       ARD disability on peoples' lives.
This contributed to a more progressive       compensation welfare       regime in Scotland than in England, for instance with the statutory       recognition in Scotland in 2010       of pleural plaques as an ARD.
Scotland is the first country in the world       to do this.
MSPs and ex-MSPs, 	  such as Rt Hon Lord McFall, MP, and the MP for Clydebank (Source 5)       have testified to the       importance of our Lethal Work book in influencing campaigning in       relation to the latter as has the       Welfare Rights Officer at Clydeside Action on Asbestos (Source 6) who has       said of Lethal Work:       "No other book or piece or research has had such fundamental effect on         our thinking.
It made an         important contribution, in particular, to the passage of the Damages         (Asbestos Related Conditions,         Scotland) Act 2009 which radically improved the welfare compensation         rights of asbestos disease         victims in this country" Our work is cited on the websites of the       main asbestos campaigning       groups (Source 2).

Contribution to heritage: The research has also made a       contribution to sustainable public and       community heritage.
Research findings, including oral interview extracts       from both Lethal Work and       Miners' Lung, have been featured in a number of public forums,       popular magazine articles and       other media.
For example, the riverside public display boards at the       Science Museum, Glasgow       and the public exhibition on occupational health organised by the Centre       for the Social History of       Health and Healthcare at Summerlee Museum, Coatbridge, for the ESRC       Festival of Social       Science in Nov. 2012.
Summerlee Museum had 3,627 visitors during the time       when the exhibition       was on show.
McIvor brought the archive of the UK's leading asbestos       victims' pressure group (the       Occupational and Environmental Diseases' Association, 1979-2009) to the       University Archives in       2009, and this has attracted significant interest from outside the       institution from researchers, the       media and advocacy groups (with 161 archive visits to July 2013).
This       complements the       interviews accumulated from the research, available for public access       through the archive of the       SOHC.
The new SOHC facilities at the University, opened in Sept 2012, have       facilitated public       access, and made a significant contribution to raising awareness of the       importance of memory /       oral history in museums and public heritage, growing the public stock of       archived recorded oral       history interviews in Scotland (Source 7).

Consultancy and training: McIvor's research experience       has directly benefitted the community       via advice and guidance services, public talks, formal and informal       training, CPD, consultancy and       project management activities through the Scottish Oral History Centre       (SOHC).
The evocative       workers' interviews undertaken in the research provided an array of       specific examples of interview       dynamics, intersubjectivity, memory `framing', narrative construction and       story-telling which have       wider implications for the practice of oral history within the community.
McIvor's public impact here       includes training for 14 Heritage Lottery Fund supported local groups       since Jan 2008, such as the       Rainbow Lives Group in Kirkcaldy, the Scottish Council on Deafness (Source       8) and the Govanhill       Peoples History Project, as well as Glasgow Museums (Source 9).
The SOHC       Archive (comprising       several hundred oral interviews, including those relating to occupational       disease) is used by the       wider public, researchers, journalists and the media.
The underpinning       research interviews have       been used, for example, by the writer Piers Dudgeon for a book on Glasgow       and for research on       Scottish dialects (Source 10).
McIvor has been involved in the oral       history training of more than       240 non-academic individuals representing 32 different groups and       organisations through the       auspices of the SOHC over 2008-2013 and public interest continues to rise       on a year-on-year       basis.
In sum, this research has been important in terms of reach and       significance in raising awareness,       contributing to campaigns and policies promoting occupational health and       has had a series of       notable impacts in the heritage sector, museums and the local community.
