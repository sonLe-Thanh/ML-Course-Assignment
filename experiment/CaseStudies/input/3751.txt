     Ingenza is an industrial biotech company spun out from EaStCHEM research,       which employs 34 people and had a turnover last year of &#163;2.7M.
[F1] It is       based in Roslin BioCentre, a science park in Midlothian for       research-intensive and commercial life-science related SMEs.
Ingenza was       set up to optimise and exploit the new robust, general, and scalable       biocatalysis platform technology described above.
The new screening       methods for strain-engineering developed in the research has helped the       company expand its portfolio of biocatalysed transformations and       engineered production microbes into other industry sectors, with       wide-ranging catalysed transformations for polymers, biofuels, feedstocks,       nutrition and other applications.
These enabling technologies have helped       establish Ingenza as the leading UK industrial biotechnology and synthetic       biology company.
As a direct result, Ingenza's staff has grown 2-fold in       the past 4 years and revenues have grown 5-fold.
The President of Ingenza,       in a corroborating letter, states " Turner's group conducted important         research at the School of Chemistry between 2001 and 2003...This work         was an important foundation on which we originally built Ingenza's         business base...Since that time Ingenza has evolved and diversified into         the leading industrial biotechnology and synthetic biology company in         the UK with global reach in its customer base and technology         implementation...I can attest to direct linkage between research ...and         the significant societal and economic impacts that followed the spinning         out of Ingenza and its ongoing expansion" [F1].
The Life Sciences       Director at Scottish Enterprise said "The company ... is a great         example of Scotland's thriving life sciences sector" [S2].
Economic:     In the financial year 2012-2013 Ingenza turned over &#163;2.7M and expects to       continue strong and profitable growth as its capabilities and interface       with multiple market sectors expand.
Ingenza's revenue growth reflects the       unique capabilities of the company's technology in a challenging economic       climate and its adaptability to other industries' awareness and uptake of       sustainable manufacturing practices.
Total turnover for 2008-July 2013 =       &#163;7M.

Development of bioprocess routes to pharmaceuticals/chemical         building blocks Industrial biotechnology as a means to produce       platform chemicals, polymer or important drug intermediates is of high and       increasing value.
Enzyme expertise (engineering and catalysis optimisation       by directed evolution) has been applied to the large-scale manufacture of       pharmaceutical intermediates.
The value of sales for 2008-July 2013 is       &#163;3M.
[F1]     b.
Provision of process development and bioprocess optimisation for         other industries The enabling technologies developed in Section 2       are being used much more broadly by Ingenza for bioprocess optimisation       and supply of improved production microbes, to provide large industries       with new, sustainable manufacturing processes from renewable rather than       petrochemical feedstocks.
For example, multi-year partnerships have been       established with leading global companies, such as Lucite International,       the world's leading manufacturer of poly-methylmethacrylate [S3].
Ingenza       piloted one of its improved biofuel strains with another end-user in the       US at full production scale of 2.4 million litres; the Ingenza President       can provide information on the number and range of other companies that       have benefitted.
A major two-year development programme employing five       people at Ingenza to work with Invista, one of the world's largest       integrated producers of polymers and fibres (10,000 employees in 20       countries), has also just completed successfully, with ten people starting       on this project in the near future as a result of the expansion of the       project.
The Ingenza President can provide corroboration on this [F1].
The       President of Invista is quoted in the most recent press announcement "We         see Ingenza's capabilities as very complementary to our own and are         pleased to announce this extended collaboration."
[S4]     In a corroborating letter, the co-founder of Ingenza, who recently moved       to Australia to be involved in new biotechnology start-up initiatives       writes "The deracemisation research and the interest that was         generated by the high impact publications in Nick Turner's group was         really the foundation of Ingenza ... and the interest that was generated         by the high impact publications.
As well as the research, the School of         Chemistry really supported Ingenza in those first few years in an         operational sense and that support was key to starting the company on a         strong footing...The ongoing relationship with the School of Chemistry         has also been important for Ingenza...
The international impact of the         published research from Prof Turner's lab meant that Ingenza had a         standing on the world stage from day one to the present day, with the         majority of company's business coming from abroad."
[F2]     Human Capital:     Ingenza's scientific team spans the disciplines of molecular biology,       biochemistry, enzymology, fermentation science and synthetic organic       chemistry, and has recruited and trained numerous scientists, including 12       scientists trained to PhD or post-doctoral level at Edinburgh University.
Currently 34 staff are employed, 12 of whom have PhDs.
[F1]     There is also strong R+D collaboration with EaStCHEM staff, with joint       awards from TSB, SPARK, ERA-NET, and collaborative PhD students.
Ingenza       has engaged with the Government's Modern apprentice scheme since 2009,       winning 'Small Employer of the Year 2011' at the Scottish Modern       Apprenticeship Awards.
[S4] In 2012 Scottish Minister for Youth Employment,       said "I commend Ingenza for their forward thinking approach in         fostering a new generation of young scientists, and offering up some         excellent opportunities for training in this exciting sector".
[S5]     Impact Development Timeline:     2002 First paper and patent; Ingenza launched and incubated within       School of Chemistry.
[F1]     2003 The Edinburgh (University) technology fund invested &#163;25,000       in Ingenza for a 5% stake; Ingenza won &#163;120,000 funding from the Scottish       Executive, Scottish Enterprise and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
2005 Scottish Enterprise helped Ingenza with direct funding       (&#163;20,000) to offset costs of new business development.
This helped Ingenza       to establish its initial base of customers and strategic partners.
2007 Commercialisation partnership established with Richmond       Chemical Corporation.
2008-2010 Awarded 2 new SMART awards and 3 Technology Strategy       Board grant awards, two in partnership with the University of Edinburgh,       totalling in excess of &#163;1M.
Receives two Biosciences KTN SPARK Awards.

[S3] 2) Awarded       over &#163;500k from TSB for three new biotechnology projects on Industrial       Biotechnology and the commercial application of high-throughput genome       sequencing, demonstrating Ingenza's diversity and leading position in       industrial biotechnology.
3) Ingenza named 'Small Employer of the Year       2011'[S4] for its technical apprenticeship scheme.
4) 5 people at Ingenza       are employed to work on a large bioprocess development project for       Invista.
