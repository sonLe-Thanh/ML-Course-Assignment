     The research described in Section 2 was designed to bring benefits to       those living with dementia and it has done so in a number of ways both       nationally and internationally.
The potential impact of the EOP is to a significant extent reflected in       the research itself, particularly the RCT study (see Reference 1)       which clearly highlights the benefits of the programme for those living       with dementia in extra care housing as well as the economic benefits:       there was an overall cost saving of &#163;15,383 over a six month period,       compared to a cost increase of &#163;55,376 at the control sites.
This is       further emphasised by a technical report from the National Audit Office       which also highlights the economic benefits of the programme: "This EOP       initiative has demonstrated that by providing a proactive and integrated       service between health, social care and housing services, people with       dementia could be effectively cared for in extra care housing.
Furthermore       our analysis...indicates that if the EOP programme is rolled out to all       extra care homes in England, over a two year period the savings to the       public through reduced inpatient care and less utilisation of more       intensive housing care provision could be around &#163;21 million, shared       between local government (for housing) and NHS (health care)" (Corroborating         Source A).
The EOP has subsequently been rolled out in ECCT's 14 retirement villages       and 17 smaller housing developments where it has had a direct impact on       the lives of over 2000 tenants (Corroborating Source B).
It is       included on the Housing LIN (Learning Improvement Network) dementia in       focus website which is the best used source of innovative information for       housing with care services (Corroborating Source C).
The development of the DCB had an immediate impact on the study site.
Upton's evaluation of the intervention shows how it both significantly       improved patient outcomes and changed the practice of nurses and doctors       for the better (Corroborating Source D).
The impact on practice is       further borne out by personal testimony.
For example, a modern matron at       the hospital stated: "The impact on me personally is I now         understand how to care for patients in a person centred way.
The impact         on the Trust is an appreciation of skills and knowledge to care for         patients with dementia, not seen as Cinderella service anymore.
Person         centred care is on the Nursing and Midwifery programme and Safeguarding         plan for the Trust.
Patient care has benefitted through improved         outcomes and better experience" (Corroborating Source E).
In       addition, an external evaluation was undertaken by Dementia Care Matters       to assess the continued impact of the research.
Their CEO reflecting on       practice at New Cross post-intervention states: "The service is         exceptional and nursing staff inspired and led by passionate medical and         nursing leaders achieve the very best of dementia care seen in the         NHS...We all commented that it is rare to find in a Trust so many very         passionate people committed to proving how much dementia care really         matters" (Corroborating Source F).
The impact of the intervention on patient safety has been highlighted in       a number of ways: the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust won the 2012       Patient Safety in Clinical Practice for its dementia care initiative;       while the DCB is a featured case study on the Health Foundation's Patient       Safety Resource Centre (Corroborating Source G).
The impact of the research has moved beyond the Royal Wolverhampton       Hospitals NHS Trust.
It was always intended by NHS West Midlands that New       Cross would act as a demonstration site and that lessons learnt could be       adopted by other NHS Trusts.
A 12 month adoption programme ran over       2012-13 which led to 12 NHS Trusts signing up to implement elements of the       intervention.
All the Trusts have implemented dementia education       programmes and have developed the "This is Me" patient passport       information systems that were advocated as the first element of DCB.
Four       Trusts have commenced pilots of the DCB with plans to commence in 3 others       (Corroborating Source H).
The research has also fed into four Dementia Leadership Education       Programmes which the Association for Dementia Studies won the contract to       deliver.
These have been delivered in Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and       Oxfordshire to 75 dementia care leads in health across 15 NHS Trusts       during 2012-13.
One of the course participants states: "The         Programme...enabled me to gain an understanding of person centred         approaches in caring for people with dementia and how this can be         implemented within the acute hospital environment.
I am also developing         a dementia training programme for Trust employees to ensure that all         staff have the knowledge and confidence to care and work with people         with dementia, their families and carers...the educational programme I         attended has given me the knowledge to be able to fulfil my new role and         to successfully make a positive change to dementia care within my trust"       (Corroborating Source I).
This reflects how the research will feed       into practice across these trusts and change this practice for the better.
The research has also had impact internationally.
The German charitable       trust the Robert Bosch Foundation have funded a programme to improve the       quality of care for those living with dementia in German hospitals which       has incorporated key elements of the DCB (Corroborating Source J).
