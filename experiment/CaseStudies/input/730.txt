     National Geographic's television producer [S1] became aware of the DD and       approached Swansea       University in 2008 regarding concepts for a proposed new series involving       animal migrations.
This       individual became Senior Producer for Great Migrations and, in a       letter to Swansea University       (available on request) stated: "This work was inspired by the finest         scientists and scholars,         including to a large part Professor Wilson's innovative work using smart         tags to track a whole suite         of animals and his invention of an animal-attached unit that he calls         `the Daily Diary'.
This unique         technology .... has revolutionized the study of animal movement and has         made him a world leader         in this field.
Professor Wilson's expertise, technology and ability to         communicate his findings was         pivotal for the conceptualization and execution of our Series.
Following         initial contact with         Professor Wilson during our development phase, he became our chief         scientific advisor for the         Series.
He was intimately involved in the planning of the fieldwork,         including species and site         selection, and deployment of his tags on various species to inform the         science (this latter being         funded by National Geographic).
His input was also critical for         interpretation of the results obtained         from the tags to bring new, exciting information on the science of         animal movement to the general         public."
National Geographic's television programmes are science-driven and       scientifically robust, based       on the latest research and research techniques.
The methodological       advances conceived by       Wilson were pivotal to the way in which National Geographic set out their       concept for Great         Migrations [S1] because the fine-scale properties of animal movement       paths and their associated       energetic costs were previously impossible to quantify despite being       central for defining movement       efficiency and thereby understanding patterns of migrating animals.
National Geographic provided funding [G2, G3] to enable Professor Wilson       to use the DD on       whales, seabirds, sharks and seals.
This resulted in new discoveries about       movement strategies in       free-living animals and their ecological consequences [R5-6] which were       included in the television       series.
Specifically, Professor Wilson featured in the episode The         Science of Migrations, in which       he explains the DD and its importance for understanding how animal       movements relate to       energetics (e.g.
how penguins use positive buoyancy to catch prey from       below, and the       movements of elephant seals conducting drift dives).
Evidence of impact from the television series     Great Migrations was first presented in November 2010 as a       seven-part series (of 1-hour       episodes) showing animal migrations in different areas of the globe.
This       work, the highest budget       in National Geographic's 124-year history, was eventually aired in 166       countries (in 34 different       languages), accessible to 330 million people [S2].
There was a strong       positive response to the       series from both the press and the public:     The Press [S3]     The Guardian: "The "Great Migrations" footage, which took three         years to shoot, was filmed on         land and from the air, in trees, cliff-blinds, ice floes and underwater         across 420,000 miles and in 20         countries.
... four core hours chronicle the stories of some of the         planet's many animal species and         their movements, thanks to new scientific discoveries about them and         their natural history.
...
This         is a beautifully filmed, scripted and produced programme.
...
I loved         this programme."
New York Times: "National Geographic wants its own showcase of         glossy, high-definition wildlife         cinematography, whose success will be measured in marketing terms: sales         of DVDs, books and         overseas broadcast rights.
In competitive terms, the main and perhaps         the only question is, how         does it look?
Is the photography, done over the course of two and a half         years in 20 countries (and         involving 420,000 miles of human travel), sufficiently spectacular?
...         At moments, the answer is         yes."
Los Angeles Times: "We can see the glorious and the brutal ...         (and) bring to them our own         metaphors and meaning, and draw the inspiration that has moved so many         to write, paint,         chronicle and learn."
More specialist coverage, such as `Deep Sea News' wrote `They         ... paid homage to the decades of         science that went into all the observations and behavior that were         described.
You almost need to         see it through the lens of a science documentary, instead of a nature         documentary.
With that being         said, I am sure it will remain one of the epic documentaries of our time.'
The general public     Jason G. Goldman, a science writer who contributes to Scientific       American, BBC Future, and       Nautilus Magazine, explained how the Great Migrations impact is       manifest; "Documentary series         like Great Migrations are important to science education and to         nature conservancy, and in general         they fulfil their function well.
They inspire children and adults to         care more for the world, and they         leave us in awe of the biodiversity that surrounds us."
National Geographic used the series to inform and educate the largest       cross-platform initiative in       its history, by releasing audio books, books aimed at adults and books for       children.
The children's       books include `Great Migrations; Whales, Wildebeests, Butterflies,         Elephants, and Other Amazing         Animals on the move' and `Amazing Journeys', `Butterflies',         `Elephants' and `Whales'.

In addition, `Great       Migrations' was the cover story and supplement in the November 2010 issue       of the National       Geographic Magazine and was featured in National Geographic Traveller       and National Geographic         Kids magazines.
`Great Migrations' was also the subject of a map,       iPhone apps, downloadable       games, a National Geographic Museum exhibit, National Geographic Live       lecture series and       screenings, education programmes, and several National Geographic       Expeditions during which       travellers could experience the wonders of migration first hand.
As chief       scientific advisor to the       Great Migrations series, Professor Wilson was involved in       red-carpet premiers of Great Migrations       in New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Nairobi and several television       and radio interviews       across Europe and the United States, as well as in some of the National       Geographic Expeditions.

The Scientific Community [S5]       The value of this technology to biologists is manifest by its uptake by       the commercial sector       worldwide including for use on humans.
A spin-out company from Swansea       University (Wildbytes       Technologies Ltd) was conceived to market the DD, and five companies now       sell the tag       (Customized Animal Tracking Solutions, Gulf Coast Data Concepts,       Loggerhead Instruments,       Wildlife Computers and Little Leonardo).
Some of these companies [S5]       refer specifically to       Professor Wilson's contribution in their websites.
