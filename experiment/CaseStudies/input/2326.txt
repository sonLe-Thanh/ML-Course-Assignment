     This pioneering research has informed NGOs, industry and managers       about the ecosystem effects of fishing, different fishing gear-habitat       interactions and the consequences of displacing fishing activity on seabed       biota as a result of area closures (marine protected areas, MPA).
The       research improved fisheries management in two main areas:     1) Impacts on fisheries industries and Special Area of Conservation         management     The research has been crucial to the development of sustainable         management of the UK's largest mussel fishery (since 1999) and Isle       of Man (IoM) (since 2006) and Cardigan Bay (since 2009) scallop         fisheries, and is ongoing.
The research has significant economic         impacts on these fisheries and improved relationships between       fishermen, conservation bodies and local governments, as illustrated       below.
Through implementation of management strategies, the research has an       ongoing and direct positive impact on yield for the Menai Strait       mussel industry.
Through reduced losses to crab predation and costs of       excessive stocking, it has increased harvested mussel:seed ratios by 50%,       without harmful impacts on the environment1.
Importantly, the       research demonstrated the lack of harmful environmental effects of the       fishery and allayed the concerns of government regulators (Countryside       Council for Wales and North Western North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee)       regarding impacts of the fishery on birds.
The research and reports       delivered by Kaiser et al.
continue to provide the science-base for         new management decisions, area closures and fishery practices.
Statutory nature conservation bodies, e.g.
Countryside Council for Wales       (CCW)9, Natural England (NE)2, have used Bangor       research on mussels and scallops to inform policy with respect to         fishing in Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and other marine       protected areas.
Our quantification of the effects of mussel cultivation       on diversity of associated benthic communities demonstrated that these       impacts were entirely restricted to within the cultivated areas.
This       finding has been applied to many management decisions for the       Menai East and West Fisheries, including the 2009 lease renewals and       ongoing applications for new and renewed Fishing Orders to Government10.
Similarly, our Defra-funded research (Kaiser et al.
2006, Hinz et al.
2011) benefited the relationship between SAC managers (CCW, NE) and Welsh       Government and provided them with empirical scientific evidence that the       mussel seed and scallop fishing practices were compatible with the Menai       Strait (2010), Morecambe Bay (2008) and Cardigan Bay (2009/2010) SACs and       therefore could continue without further intervention2.
Bangor research was fundamental in the reorganisation of the Isle of         Man scallop fishery since 2006; leading to the first catch quota for       scallops in Europe (2010), and implementation of five new closed areas to       underpin sustainable fisheries.
It provided the science evidence for a by-       law introduced in August 2010, critical in protecting the fishery, and for       improved management3.
As a result landings have increased         by around 30% and scallop abundance has more than doubled.
These led       directly to recent improvements to the processing sector, by justifying       the long-term &#163;5-M redevelopment of the Isle of Man food park (2012-2014),       resulting in 30% more jobs in the processing sector within the REF period       (an additional 100 jobs are expected by 2014).
The current value of the       fishery is in excess of &#163;2.5M and of the entire sector an estimated &#163;12M3.
In 2011, the fishery won the prestigious Billingsgate Sustainable       Fisheries award, in recognition of the innovative ways in which it       implemented research findings towards sustainability.
In 2010 implementation of the Bangor research evidence led directly to MSC         accreditation of sustainability of the Menai Strait mussel fishery,       becoming the first enhanced fishery in the world to be certified1,6.
The MSC ecolabel provided the industry with access to better quality       markets and ensured the future of its 20 employees.
Accreditation of the       IoM scallop trawl fishery followed in 20113,6.
Close         linkage of Bangor research with both fisheries is on-going, continuously         improving knowledge on fishing impacts and advising on best sustainable         practices1,3.
In addition, the research has benefitted       the majority of benthic fisheries that have passed the MSC assessment       process, by providing evidence of their environmental footprint, as       indicated by referencing in the certification reports of a further 28       MSC-certified fisheries4,6.
2) Impact on industry sustainable food sourcing and public knowledge     Global companies cite our research as evidence to inform the public about       their choices of food origin.
For example: our research is central to the       public documentation of Young's Seafood, the UK's leading frozen fish       brand with over &#163;200M sales per year7, and it contributes to       the scientific reference base of 11 fisheries represented on FishSource,       the global online fisheries database of the Sustainable Fisheries       Partnership that is used by major seafood buyers to inform on the       sustainability of fisheries, and other publically-available databases informing         market supply chains, consumers and retailers on sustainable fish         sourcing [e.g.
8].
Through this research, Kaiser has become       established as a world-leading authority in the field as reflected by his       board membership (since 2006) of the Seafish Industry Authority and board       membership (since 2012) of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and       his frequent representation in the media as an authority on sustainable       fishing.
In 2008, Kaiser and the team supplied the essential expertise that         allowed the Cooperative supermarket to introduce a risk assessment         framework for wild caught fish and introduce a sustainable fish sourcing         policy.
In addition to Kaiser's crucial role in the development of       the policy, the Bangor Research Vessel Prince Madog was used to `launch'       the brand and help publicise the cooperative approach.
The ship, with       Bangor scientists and journalists on board, was taken to London and up the       Thames, which exposed the journalists and public to the science behind       sustainable fisheries and led directly to greater dissemination and public       awareness of the Cooperative's approach to sustainable fish sourcing.
The       policy is still used today and has formed the cornerstone of the         Cooperative's pioneering responsible fish sourcing policy, and their         claims that all own brand fish is responsibly sourced.
Since its       introduction, the Cooperative has twice topped the MCS Supermarket       Sustainable Fish ratings exercise, and was also named as one of only five       worldwide recipients of a prestigious Seafood Champion Award for 2010; in       recognition of their outstanding leadership in promoting environmentally       responsible seafood, and directly resulting from input from Kaiser's       research5.
