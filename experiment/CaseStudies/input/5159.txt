     The research impact achieved with Belron&#174; is the result of a combined       computational and experimental study into the impact creation of a       windscreen `chip' and how that chip will grow into a non-repairable crack       if left untreated.
This market-driven research has been influenced by       environmental climate changes that alter the temperature gradients       experienced by automotive windscreens on start-up in extreme ambient       conditions.
In this context the temperature controlled ballistics chamber       used by the Unit is vital in validating the computational model.
Our work       for Belron&#174; has developed for over twenty years and has provided objective       scientific understanding of windscreen damage.
This has kept Belron&#174; at a       competitive advantage in a service sector that typically provides little       objective evidence.
The contribution from the unit is based on       computational modelling of the initial stone impact event and the       subsequent chip-to-crack failure mode due to a windscreen experiencing       thermal and mechanical stresses.
The peer-reviewed published research has provided independent evidence of       the reduction in residual stress following a resin-injected repair to a       windscreen.
The computational modelling shown in the Paris conference       video has clarified the critical role that the plastic interlayer plays in       the stone impact event.
In particular, the change in mechanical stiffness       of this interlayer with ambient temperature has been shown to have a       significant influence on the impact damage level.
Impact and benefit to Company:     Dr Chris Davies, Head of Technical Research &amp; Innovation at Belron       Technical Ltd:            "The work carried out by Swansea Metropolitan University [now known as         UWTSD] over the years has allowed us to assess some of our tools and         equipment, support our advertising claims worldwide and in some cases         fend off challenges from competitors.

"Professor Donne, Dean of Faculty of Applied Design and Engineering &#8212; computer modelling expert of Swansea Metropolitan University [now known         as UWTSD], also features in one of our videos alongside Professor         Conradt from Aachen University and Dr Fouvry from Ecole Centrale de         Lyon, where he explains how his modelling work using finite element         analysis (FEA) has helped Belron&#174; understand and visualise complex         physical behaviour.
The video was first aired in Paris in 2010 during a         Belron&#174; event in front of over one thousand viewers that included most         of Belron&#174; insurance partners from over 30 different countries.
The         impact of the video was far-reaching and helped convince some of our         partners of our `repair first' strategy."
