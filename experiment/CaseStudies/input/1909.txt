     The development of new and improved treatments for cancer remains       challenging.
Treatments are often associated with side effects that arise       because of damage that occurs to healthy cells, particularly in children       with cancer, where treatment can damage normal tissues leading to       impairment of physical, educational and emotional development (even where       treatment of the cancer is successful.)
University of Salford researchers       have developed a number of novel approaches aimed at maximising the       desired effect against the cancer whilst minimizing damage to normal       health tissues.
These approaches include light activation of antivascular       agents and Es5; a prodrug that is selectively activated within the cancer       itself:             2004-2011: RH1 was licensed to Allos Therapeutics in 2004 Allos         Therapeutics Inc., announced the initiation of patient enrollment in a         Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, multi-centre dose escalation study         of the Company's targeted chemotherapeutic agent RH1 in patients with         advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
"We are           pleased to advance the development of this agent," said Pablo J.         Cagnoni, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Allos.
"RH1 is a small           molecule chemotherapeutic agent that is bioactivated by the enzyme           DT-diaphorase (DTD), which is over-expressed in many tumours,           including lung, colon, breast and liver tumours.
We believe that           because RH1 is bioactivated in the presence of DTD, it has the           potential to preferentially target certain tumours while limiting the           amount of toxicity to normal tissue."
[A] RH1 completed         Phase I clinical trials both in the UK and the USA in 2011.
2009: The Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group,         Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester, UK evaluated the         preclinical efficacy of the RH1 against paediatric tumours concluding         that the demonstration of RH1 efficacy against paediatric tumour cell         lines suggests that this agent may have clinical usefulness in childhood         cancer.
2011: Second generation drugs based on RH1 (Es5) are currently         under development by Onco-NX, a spin out company of the University of         Salford formed by Hadfield and McGown to exploit the oncology research         within the University [B].
Onco-NX received &#163;50k funding in 2011         from the North West Fund for Biomedical (venture capital investor).
The         North West Fund for Biomedical is managed by early-stage venture capital         firm SPARK Impact and is part of the &#163;185 million evergreen fund         provided jointly by the European Investment Bank and European Regional         Development Fund, to supply equity funding to small and medium-sized         enterprises (SMEs) in the North West.
In 2012 Onco-NX secured a further         &#163;100k from the Fund based on positive results of in-vivo testing of the         efficacy of Es5 [C].
Current: Research into light         activated antivascular prodrugs (Hadfield/Bisby/McGown) in collaboration         with the STFC Lasers for Science Facility and the Rutherford Appleton         Laboratory is continuing, with the aim of developing a new area of laser         surgery for both cancer patients and also those with vascular         proliferative disease (e.g.
macular degeneration).
Drug synthesis and         screening are undertaken at Salford whilst the laser facilities at         Oxford are used for analysis of the effects at the cellular level.
The         potential of this technology to treat both cancer and other diseases         associated with abnormal vascular proliferation (e.g.
macular         degeneration) is great.
Expertise in cancer within the University of Salford resulted in the         establishment of Kidscan, a charity based at the University of Salford,         whose work is focused on developing new and improved treatments for         children with cancer [D].
Local people directly and personally         affected by childhood cancer are able to access opportunities for active         fundraising in their own communities, directly contributing to research         undertaken in the region and which attracts venture capital and Research         Council funding; building personal investment and agency in innovation         in treatment among North West communities.
Kidscan has raised over &#163;2M to date and &#163;275k in 2012-2013, to fund         research both at the University and in other centres throughout the NW         of England, at a time of significant economic pressure affecting         communities in the region.
Kidscan not only supports work on new and         improved pharmaceutical interventions but also into research aimed at         establishing the factors that determine quality of life, health status,         psychological wellbeing and self-esteem for children undergoing         treatment for central nervous system (CNS) tumours.
Kidscan's work has been the subject of a recent Granada TV news         report, showcasing the approach to engaging local communities and         developing their stake in cutting edge technology for improving cancer         treatment, demonstrating public interest in and commitment among         communities in the North West for locally grown fundraising into         research and development in the biomedical sectors in the region [E].
The charity has supported student/ industrial placements, technical         support, equipment purchase and maintenance, and consumables.
Funding of         projects is decided by an independent scientific committee.
In addition         the charity provides speakers (members of staff of the University) to         increase public awareness of the causes, prevention and treatment of         cancer (paediatric and adult) throughout the North West of England.
The         fundraising events organised by Kidscan are designed to encourage public         participation and the development of a charity ethos, bringing together         communities, corporate partners and students, whilst raising public         awareness of cancer and the role of Universities in the development of         new treatments.
The charity has initiated a healthy lifestyle campaign backed by the         celebrity nutritionist Jeanette Jackson with the development of an         innovative campaign where ten celebrities have donated a healthy recipe         compiled into a book with all proceeds going to Kidscan [F].
