     The start up and growth of a new international company     SRS was started in China in 2009 with initial funding for the company       (&#163;2000), donated by Dr John Davis (USA), being used to complete the       registration of the company.
The income generated by the completion of the       first SR training course held in Shanghai at the end of 2009 was       approximately &#163;18,000 gross (&#163;8,000 profit) indicating promising results       for company growth.
Since inception in late 2009, SRS has grown to employ four full-time and       one part- time senior and associate administrative staff based permanently       in China.
Along with four part-time research assistants, 2 systematic       review trainers (all former attendees of the systematic review training       coursea) and 7 senior consultants from different backgrounds       including mental health research (Professor Adams, Nottingham), pain       research (Professor Wiffen, Oxford), drug and alcohol addiction (Steve       Lui), psychiatry (Mahesh Jayaram, Leeds), obstetrics (Masoud Afnan, Chief       Medical Officer for Beijing United Family Hospital), translation of       systematic review to NICE guidelines (John Rathbone, University of       Sheffield) and information specialist (Samantha Roberts, Nottinghamshire       Healthcare NHS Trust) demonstrating the company's international links.
To pilot SRS in other cities, early training courses were set up by Xia       in 2010 with support of Professor Li and Professor Adams, providing       additional Cochrane methodological review expertise and mental health       consultancy.
As a consequence of this collaboration and training,       Professor Li's unit in SMHC is now a satellite group of the Cochrane       Schizophrenia Group in Nottinghamb, narrowing the gap between       knowledge exchange between China and the West as identified in Xia's       publication5.
From its early beginnings, demand for training       courses has doubled in the last 3 years and courses are now held six times       yearly in Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'An generating &#163;100k incomea.
Impact on International Commerce and Healthcare     SRS has achieved commercial impact by applying UoN CSzG methodology as a       template for doctors in China, using knowledge exchange to generate       economic impact across the Chinese Healthcare system, in particular in       Beijing and Shanghai.
Highly skilled people have gained employment, for       example all research assistants and trainers in SRS were attendees of the       SR training, thus providing students the opportunity for high quality jobsa.
Additionally, clinicians are employing new methodologies to better       identify evidence-based treatment upon SR training in order to translate       this into better clinical practice (patients are treated based upon the       best evidence available)c. For example, attendee of the SRS       training course and Director of the Department of Clinical Psychiatry in       SMHC and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine said:     `The SRS course changed my perception of evidence-based practice, it         made me more aware of searching up to date literature to inform my         clinical practice.
For example, what are the most effective         interventions to treat people with schizophrenia.
The course was         incredibly interactive, accessible and an asset to SMHC.
I hope that it         continues to extend across China to help other clinicans be better         informed'c.
SRS has also shown economic impact through collaborations with industry       across China, including high quality knowledge transfer partnerships as       evidenced by support of Capital Medical University (Beijing) and United       Family Healthcare Group, the largest private hospital in Chinad.
Previous Chinese collaborations have also included University of       Nottingham Ningbo Campus (Ningbo) and hospitals including Shanghai Number       1 People's Hospital (Shanghai) and Beijing Xiyuan Traditional Chinese       Medicine Hospital (Beijing), Teaching Hospital of Xi'An, Medical Collage       (Xi'An).
Private SR courses have also been given to clinicians in Beijing       Tiantan Hospital (one day course $5,000) and Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital       (&#163;100 half an hour), Shanghai Number 1 People's Hospital (one day &#163;1,500),       Shanghai Yangpu District Hospital (3 days &#163;6,000) and researchers in       Yantai Binzhou Medical University.
Internet SR courses began in May 2013       and, to date, on average each large 4 day training event generates       &#163;15,000-18,000 gross with a single day training generating &#163;4,000.
Impact on practitioners and services through increased uptake of         scientific training     Since 2009, SRS has been providing high quality intensive training for       healthcare professionals across China.
These courses have gained in       popularity and have been extremely well received with 82% of attendees in       the largest course to date in 2013 rating the course as `excellent'e.
When asked how relevant each session is to their needs as clinicians, over       90% reported `very relevant'e.
When asked how attendees found       about the course, 30% was based on word of mouth therefore the course has       generated positive reviews within the healthcare communityf.
Course attendees provided independent feedback on a popular online       bioscience website for professionals in medical, pharmaceutical, and       bioscience sector (Ding Xiang Yuan).
Feedback was very positive,       including: `the programme is very well designed with a balanced         mixture of didactic lectures and hands-on workshops.
Teaching staff are         not only the experts of this area, but also are very patient with         answering queries.
They did a great job in teaching SR to both layman         and researchers in confined time 'g.
As well as being popular and well received within the Chinese medical       community, the training courses have also changed clinical practice in       various Chinese institutions, for example the change of prescription of       psychiatric medications for schizophrenia based upon up-to-date evidencec.
Systematic Review Project Management Service     Finally, started in August 2012 due to demand in China, a specialised       systematic review service was developed to assist healthcare       professionals, and in particular clinicians, in the development of their       Cochrane reviews and protocols in order to inform clinical practice.
There       are currently 9 active reviews and 3 protocols on clinical topics such as       cancer, chemotherapy, septic shock, schizophrenia and pseudomyxoma (see       publications resulting from SRS input) generating a total income of       &#163;50,000 (gross).
In early 2013 alone, 5 SR reviews with authors based in       China were published as a result of input from SRS (Publications available       upon request): reviews that greatly benefited from SRS input.
