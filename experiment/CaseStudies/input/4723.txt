     Publications.
Both of GW's books recount the history of major       human scourges and the attempts to defeat them in a scientifically       rigorous fashion, while engaging the general reader as well as health       professionals.
Angel of Death [1] has sold over 3,600 copies,       making this the second best-selling title in the Palgrave Academic History       series 2010-13, and the eighth bestselling history title for Palgrave       since 2000.
It was shortlisted for the Wellcome Trust Book Prize 2010, the       BMA Medical Book Awards 2012 and for the Medical Journalists' Open Book       Awards 2011.
Historian Michael Neve described the book as "medical history       at its absolute best".
This book has led to over 60 invitations for GW to       speak at schools, health professional meetings, history societies and       literary festivals in Britain and abroad (see below).
Paralysed with         Fear [2] has also garnered positive reviews from the general public,       professional publications and polio survivors in the short time since its       publication.
The book was reviewed in the Lancet as "an incredible       story told by a great story-teller" [a].
Polio survivor and leader of the       Post-Polio News Service, Chris Salter, explains that `whilst bristling       with information [the book] manages to read like a novel'.
Presentations, lectures, webcasts and broadcasts.
GW has given       numerous lectures to a variety of audiences in the UK and overseas, on the       history of smallpox, Jenner and vaccination, and the history of polio.
The       same qualities of clarity, scholarship and accessibility praised in his       books have also been prominent in feedback from GW's lectures and       presentations, by both health professional and lay audiences (see below).
He has also appeared on national and international radio and TV to discuss       vaccination and smallpox, including the Today Programme (18/5/11), BBC       World Service, BBC World TV and BBC Parliament [b].
GW has recently given lectures on the history of polio at the Tavistock       Festival (29/04/13), the Edward Jenner Museum (where he was Writer in       Residence in June 2013), Gresham College (12/06/14), the Gladstone Library       (03/10/13), and the Heswall Festival (02/10/13).
Future presentations       include the Thackray Medical Museum, Leeds (08/02/14).
Dr Robert Spencer       of the Health Protection Agency comments that the audience for GW's       presentations is "very widespread &#8212; [including the] general public,       scientists, medical both junior and senior grades" [c].
GW's research has generated impact in several domains:     1) Engaging health professionals     GW has given numerous talks on the history of smallpox and polio       vaccination to physicians, nurses, and other health professionals.
Selected talks: Milroy Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians, London       (30/10/12); Anglo-French Medical Society (1/10/10); Royal College of       Physicians of Edinburgh (10/11/10); Anglo-Swiss Medical Society, Geneva       (16/2/11); Southmead Hospital, Bristol (5/9/11); Vaccine Development       Group, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Pennsylvania, US (11/11/11); Infection       Control Conference, South-West Region, Bristol (29/5/12); Rudolf Korec       Memorial Conference, Topolcianky, Slovakia (21/2/13); International Day       for Fighting Infection, Verona (23/4/13).
Audience feedback from the 8th       Annual Infection Control Conference (29/5/2012), delivered to 184 NHS       professionals was very positive.
91% of delegates who responded thought       that GW's talk was `excellent' or `very good'.
Several commented that the       talk was `very interesting' and GW was described as a `very knowledgeable       and inspiring speaker' [d].
GW has run seminars for the Health Protection Agency (29/11/10); Centre       Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne (15/2/11); Research Summer       School, Facult&#233; de M&#233;decine, Angers (10/7/11, 3/7/12, 1/7/13); Bloomberg       School of Public Health, John Hopkins University, Baltimore (9/11/11).
Dr       D.A.
Henderson (University of Pittsburgh and Johns Hopkins University)       commented that in engaging medical professionals GW "is an especially       effective advocate" by his "open, friendly manner, and his internationally       respected knowledge of immunization" [e].
Dr Trevor Thompson (Reader in       Healthcare Education, University of Bristol) notes that GW "had a       considerable impact on the [medical] profession's awareness" of the       history of vaccination [g].
2) Promoting the history of medicine to medical and allied         professions students     GW speaks at the Research Summer School, Facult&#233; de M&#233;decine, Universit&#233;       d'Angers (10/7/11, 3/7/12, 1/7/13).
This annual EU-funded workshop brings       together 70 students in medicine and allied professions from across Europe       for a residential course.
GW has given the introductory lecture at each       course since its inception.
GW lectures students in the Faculty of       Medicine at the University of Bristol, their only formal lecture on the       history of medicine.
3) Engaging the public and schools     GW has spoken about vaccination in a wide variety of public fora, ranging       from schools to internationally renowned literary festivals.
He has       addressed audiences of over 100 at the UK's two foremost literary       festivals, Hay Festival 2010 [g] and The Telegraph's Way with       Words festival 2011 [h].
Talks at schools include: St. George's School,       Montreux, Switzerland (14/2/11); Mockton Combe School, Bath (8/3/11);       Marlwood School, Thornbury (11/5/11); Redland Green, Bristol (13/9/11);       Clifton College, Bristol (4/5/12).
Timna Lyons, Academic Mentor at Redland       Green School, notes that student feedback was "unanimously very positive",       citing the following student comments: "the explanation and stories made       [the workshop] very interesting"; "[the workshop] was very interactive";       "[GW] took real interest in everyone"; "use [GW] again".
This evidences       the success of GW's approach in engaging young people in the history of       vaccination.
He has also given other public lectures, including Thornbury       Arts Festival (29/4/10); University of Bristol Twilight Talks, Watershed,       Bristol (10/6/10); Cyder House Talks, Edward Jenner Museum (22/7/10);       Gladstone Festival, St. Deiniol's Library, Flintshire (9/9/10); Thornbury       Science Festival (7/7/11); Tavistock Music and Arts Festival, The Wharf       Arts Centre, Devon (23/4/12); Wellcome Trust series, `Matters of Life and       Death', Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol (4/413).
GW addressed a public       audience of over 100 at Gresham College, London.
His talk has been viewed       over 2,300 times [i].
Richard Taverner (r.taverner@gresham.ac.uk)       reports that numerous requests have been received for a full transcript of       the lecture.
Widespread attention has also been given to GW's media work.
Public figures such as Clive Anderson (writer and television presenter)       have positively advocated his work.
Dr Henderson noted that Angel of         Death was "widely reviewed and quoted" [e].
It has been warmly       reviewed in the Times Higher Education Supplement, the Lancet,       BBC History Magazine, The Times, New Scientist, Laboratory         News, The Week, and at www.historyextra.com.
4) Promoting Edward Jenner's legacy     GW has done much to promote the UK's intellectual heritage by campaigning       for greater recognition of Edward Jenner, the creator of the smallpox       vaccine.
Unlike Alexander Fleming, who played an analogous role in the       history of bacterial disease, Jenner's achievement in the prevention of       viruses has not been sufficiently appreciated in this country.
GW was a       Trustee at Dr Jenner's House, Berkeley (now the Edward Jenner Museum) from       2009-11 and was the Chair of the Trust from 2010-11 (http://www.jennermuseum.com/).
GW appears in the introductory video at the Jenner Museum and Angel of       Death is on sale.
He is a regular speaker and fundraiser at the museum,       which receives the royalties from his book.
He also speaks at the annual       Oxford Brookes infectious disease control nursing course held at the       museum.
GW also helped lead the campaign to have Jenner's statue restored       from Kensington Gardens back to Trafalgar Square from where it was removed       by anti-vaccination groups soon after it was erected [k].
5) Patient advocacy     In May 2013, the British Polio Fellowship appointed GW one of their six       `Polio Ambassadors'.
GW's role as Ambassador is to promote an       understanding of the historical importance of polio and the role of the       patient support groups in the UK and elsewhere, and to raise awareness       among health professionals and the general public of `post-polio       syndrome', which affects up to 120,000 polio survivors in the UK.
6) Promoting public health by helping to dispel myths about         vaccination     GW helps to counter some of the myths surrounding vaccination and so       promote greater acceptance of its value.
He explains the science and the       evidence base behind vaccination (especially against smallpox and polio),       and presents both sides of the debate over vaccination in an accessible       and lively way.
