     After nine years and two phases of research, the I'DGO consortium       presented its findings in       April 2012 in Europe House, London, in celebration of the European         Year for Active Ageing.
Chaired by Baroness Greengross, who praised the "phenomenally exciting         research on how         we can bloom as people from we are very young to very old", the       event included an online       Q&amp;A.
During the debate, one Twitter follower commented "At last!
Finally pedestrians!
Somebody has noticed us and those who are trapped by unfriendly         environments!"
SURFACE       Inclusive Design Research Centre at the University of Salford has made a       particular       contribution to the I'DGO evidence base on the everyday pedestrian       experience of urban       streets and to the subsequent impact of this research on environmental       `walkability'.
In its guidance on Lifetime Neighbourhoods (2011), the         Department for Communities and         Local Government (DCLG) describes `walkability' as lying at "the           heart of lifetime           neighbourhoods... with crucial implications for individual access to           services and facilities,           sociability, health and well-being".
Referring to I'DGO as a "very         significant source of         research and guidance", the publication pays particular attention, in         the section on Creating         Walkable Environments, to the SURFACE-led work on different features of         the street         environment.
The guidance it cites in this section is, together with I'DGO guidance         on open space, one of         only two such sources referenced in the World Health Organization's Global           Age-Friendly           Cities: A Guide (2007).
This has also been used by the Department         for Transport (DfT),         including extensively in Local Transport Note: Shared Space           (LTN1/11), leading to an on-going         collaboration between SURFACE and the DfT to embed evidence into         national         guidance, as confirmed by Gereint Killa of the Traffic Division in a         recent letter (Nov 2012):         "We hope that I'DGO will be contributing to the development of           planned revisions to two           key pieces of Departmental street design guidance, namely guidance on           the use of tactile           paving surfaces, and Inclusive Mobility &#8212; a guide to best practice on           access to pedestrian           and transport infrastructure."
I'DGO is promoted in the Age UK publication, Pride of Place         (2011), which sets out how         councillors can improve neighbourhoods for older people.
Other impact in         the local         government sector ranges from Ormerod participating in an invited Local         Government         Association / UK Research Councils workshop in October 2010, to train         planning officers in         Norfolk and Suffolk County Councils (as part of a joint Planning Skills         Programme) and         contributing to Manchester City Council's action plan on Age-inclusive         Design and the Built         Environment (taken forward by its Valuing Older People team).
In August 2011, SURFACE was invited to present its work on street         features to a meeting         of the pan-European SaMERU (Safer Mobility for Elderly Road Users)         programme, led by         Southend on Sea Borough Council and also involving Lancashire County         Council and the         local councils of Modena (Italy) and Burgos (Spain).
Southend on Sea         Borough Council         Team Leader, Cheryl Hindle, said: "I hope you will be pleased to hear           that we have           arranged to implement one aspect of your results already &#8212; you           mentioned that walking           times on signage were seen to be a real advantage, we are investing in           new directional           signage in our town centre and seafront so we have arranged for all           the signs and           information boards giving walking time to each destination".
The linkages with SaMERU were made at Traffex 2011, an annual         international showcase         for the highways engineering industry at which SURFACE researcher,         Newton, presented         I'DGO as part of a programme of free CPD-certified seminars.
Similar         training has been         provided for a range of industry stakeholders, from architects (Ecobuild         2013, London) to         occupational therapists (AOTI Conference 2010, Dublin).
In 2010, at the         invitation of the         Chartered Institution of Highways &amp; Transportation (CIHT), I'DGO         provided inclusive         design awareness training to over 500 professionals in six British         cities as part of the         national and regional roll-out of Manual for Streets 2: Wider           Application of the Principles.
The CIHT has since approached I'DGO to review its guide to the design         and management         of urban road networks, Transport in the Urban Environment.
I'DGO has worked collaboratively with older people, providing them         with the evidence to         create their own impact.
SURFACE has particularly close connections with         the Kilburn         Older Voices Exchange (KOVE) in London, which describes the research as         having         "greatly benefited KOVE's community projects; it has helped develop           our knowledge and           how we campaign and practice at a community level".
Events for         older delegates have         been co-hosted with Age Scotland, as part of the latter's Walk in           our Shoes; Act on our           Issues campaign, and Living Streets, including at the World         Congress on Active Ageing         (Glasgow, 2012).
SURFACE participation in the British Science Festival         2011 led to         interviews with Newton on BBC Radio Manchester and Scotland and to a 10         minute,         walkalong, three-way interview with Science Correspondent, Matt McGrath,         focusing on the         real world challenges encountered by older Bradford resident, Mavis         Crosley, for an audio         feature on the main BBC website.
On the strength of its overall impact, I'DGO is featured as a case         study in Making the Case           for the Social Sciences: Ageing, published by the British Society         of Gerontology, the         Academy of Social Sciences and AgeUK and launched by Baroness Greengross         in         Westminster in July 2010.
Seven elected members of parliament have         publically supported         I'DGO's work, including Ieuan Wyn Jones (Plaid Cymru) who has said: "With           its emphasis           on practical solutions and easy `wins' in the local environment, I'DGO           makes clear the links           between making our neighbourhoods easier to get around and increasing           older people's           chances of ageing well".
I'DGO was a runner up in the         not-for-profit category of the         International Design for all Foundation Awards 2013.
SURFACE has been         proactive in         achieving a number of international impacts from the research, including         advising the         Japanese Government on its FutureCity initiative and the Chinese         Housing Ministry on         current trends and innovations in UK research into accessibility.
I'DGO was a finalist in the Design           for All Foundation Awards 2013.
