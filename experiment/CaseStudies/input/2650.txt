     Fundamental understanding of the theoretical concept of Enterprise       Cultural Heritage has transformed the commercial viability of SMEs by       unlocking their heritage.
The concept has been transferred into Open       Access training material in brand, change, heritage and IPR management,       enabling thousands of businesses worldwide to transfer this knowledge into       tangible benefits.
Translation into Italian, Czech, Greek and Finnish       facilitates its use throughout Europe:            Enterprise Cultural Heritage (ECH) is a complex combination of a         company's own history and creations (technical contents, industrial         design, organisation, marketing) that can transform information and         materials into extended products and services.
Effective ECH management         can increase creativity in production and knowledge management skills,         boosting the productivity of those SMEs with a rich history.
The         training material created by our project helps SMEs to identify and         exploit the economic added value of their cultural heritage.
ECH as a         topic is entirely novel in the area of vocational training.
Our work         closes the gap to open accessible knowledge by making free training         material that integrates examples of good ECH management available to         all companies with an internet connection.
The dissemination strategy for the training material uses extensively         social media such as SlideShare, Wikipedia and LinkedIn and is         demonstrating the success of this method for reaching out the audiences         worldwide.
ECH management enhances the competitiveness of SMEs.
The MNEMOS         project focused on mature (40+ years of trading) SMEs in craft sectors         (food, textiles, ceramics and jewellery).
During the project it was soon         evident that other sectors can benefit as long as they have ECH.
The international consortium from 5 countries (Czech Republic, Greece,         Finland, Italy and UK), spanning the geopolitical regions of EU (South,         West, Scandinavia, post-socialist areas) and industry and academia,         contributed complementary specialist skills in research, training         material development, validation, linkage with SMEs and Information         Communication Technology (ICT) competences.
A key aim has been to         produce outputs relevant to SMEs so that successful engagement with         beneficiaries was facilitated from an early stage (training needs         analysis) and continued throughout development and into impact.
This         combination of competencies and perspectives has transformed a series of         ECH case studies into a rich resource of commercial training materials         used worldwide.
An entirely novel area of vocational education and training (VET), ECH         management, as used by large enterprises, for example, the 'new' FIAT500         and the Guinness brand, is conferring material competitive advantage in         established SMEs.
ECH management in SMEs transforms an intangible asset         into a key competitiveness factor in both internal and external markets.
SMEs that have traditionally operated without access to specialised         training to promote higher performance have been given access through an         open web community to innovative new training that opens pathways for         new practices; over thirty thousand individuals have accessed the         training material.
Entrepreneurs have recognised and managed the strategic value of ECH         by developing new skills based on the creative use of heritage knowledge         and by developing and integrating complementary technical and marketing         competences: "The training material gives a great opportunity to           many organisations to exploit their cultural heritage instead of           "throwing it away" in the name of modernisation" (MNEMOS SME         partner).
Learning has been made more attractive.
Pro-active involvement of         entrepreneurs, managers &amp; technical staff in continued vocational         training (CVT) has been strengthened by adopting a new approach to         introduce ECH management in SMEs with a rich cultural tradition.
Senior         managers recognise its strategic value as it supports the recognition of         learning outcomes for technical and managerial staff involved in         non-formal training, increasing the recognition of the benefit of CVT         for individual and company return.
MNEMOS training packages have been accessed by c. 30,000 users.
Training material is available for all on SlideShare, optimised for         search engines and social media searches, and is constantly being         discovered by new visitors.
The project website, LinkedIn group and         Wikipedia page continue to be maintained.
MNEMOS has obtained affiliation to the Natural           Europe project to foster training on traditional ways of farming         and "environment-friendly" practices in specific agriculture sectors.
The training material developed will support environmental education and         has also obtained affiliation to the ARIADNE           Foundation and is now expanding worldwide through a network of         institutions and projects.
Passport to Trade 2.0, a MNEMOS spin-off, engages business         culture in the use of social media and extends our worldwide impact of         innovation in SMEs.
