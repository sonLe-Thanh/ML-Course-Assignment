With       the KTP, Hyquip remained focussed with the task at hand, consolidated its       position and is now looking forward to the next 5-7 years from a position       of strength.

However VIP is in a better position to market it's       products and services to the slowly growing economy once the financial       situation begins to improve.
VIP now has an increased arsenal of tools       with which to stake it's claim once the UK economy begins to get back on       its feet.
