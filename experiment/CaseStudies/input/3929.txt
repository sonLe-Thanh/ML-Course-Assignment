     Rappert has helped identify poorly recognized issues and facilitated         international debate through a dedicated programme of outreach       activities and educational work on the responsible stewardship of the life       sciences (undertaken with Prof. Malcolm Dando &#8212; Bradford).
Since 2008,       over 1,800 bioscientists in industry, academia and government have taken       part in more than 75 workshops that have redressed practitioners' lack of       familiarity with security related policy initiatives and encouraged them       to give serious consideration &#8212; in many cases for the first time &#8212; to the       issue of how to avoid the hostile use of their findings, methods, and       techniques.
Collaborating institutions that have taken part include the US       National Academy of Sciences, the Japanese National Institute of       Infectious Diseases, and the Argentine National Intelligence School.
In 15       of the 16 countries visited, Rappert partnered with government agencies       and professional science organisations.
Rappert advised in the organization of national and regional biosecurity       meetings in Ukraine, Israel, Uganda, and the Netherlands held by their       national science academies (Section 5, Reference 1).
He has aided established         networks of concerned practitioners in many of the fieldwork site       countries (2, 10).
Rappert's commitment to bringing together varied       communities in setting future agendas is evidenced by his edited books,       which are notable for the range of their non-academic contributors       (Section 3, References 1, 3, 4).
Rappert has not only drawn attention to a central area of concern, but       has helped provide the tools, impetus and intellectual agenda for       affecting professional standards.
In April 2011, the findings of       Rappert's outreach efforts formed an integral component of a submission to       the Preparatory Committee of the Seventh Review Conference of the United       Nations Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) (Section 5, Reference 3).
Put       forward by Australia, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, the submission cited       the importance of Rappert's contribution to `a stimulation of debate         and reflection among researchers on life sciences, security and the         potentially destructive application of their activities', and       described how many of those who took part in Rappert's seminars spoke of       them as `an eye-opener'.
The submission concluded that Rappert's       research helped `provide the base for possible ways forward, such as         the inclusion of educational modules on biosecurity for biosafety         officers in research facilities or the encouragement to introduce         educational modules on biosecurity in academic courses for future life         scientists'.
In December 2011, the 164 governments of the BWC agreed       a 5-year plan of work.
Rappert's contribution to shaping agendas       is demonstrated through reference to it in an official Working Paper       submitted by 12 nations that laid a basis for that 5-year plan (1, 2, 4).
A number of individual governments have acknowledged the importance of       his advice and evaluations: thus a 2008 report by the Netherlands'       Biosecurity Working Group, which successfully established a code of       conduct for the country's bioscientists at the request of the Dutch       Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, credited Rappert with helping       raise awareness of the potential risks of `dual use' research and with       providing a framework for understanding codes (5).
A 2012 report by the US       Government's National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity &#8212; an       organisation which has produced a "toolkit" and an educational module for       institutions and scientific associations &#8212; highlighted the significance of       Rappert's work in assessing codes, as well as noting his `extensive         educational engagement efforts' (6).
Rappert's work on cluster bombs has also had an impact in the wider field       of international disarmament.
In part through a series of reports for       civil society organisations which were widely distributed in diplomatic       forums, he helped reframe international attention to this technology (see       Section 3, Reference 5 for an overview summary).
This was done by shifting         agendas away from the terms of international humanitarian law, and       on to more precautionary principle arguments which re-distributed burdens       of proof within the negotiations.
Specifically, Rappert formulated       and advocated an intellectual strategy for agreeing what should be       defined as prohibited under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions       (Section 5, References 7, 8).
This treaty was adopted in May 2008, and has       so far been signed by over 110 nations.
These states held in excess of 140       million explosive submunitions.
These are now prohibited from use, with       more than 64 million already destroyed.
The lead negotiator for a grouping       of over 300 NGOs stated that the `change of approach that Rappert         initiated was central to the dynamic of the subsequent campaign and         provided a framing for the negotiation of definitions that allowed the         Convention on Cluster Munitions to achieve a significantly greater level         of humanitarian protection than would have otherwise been possible'       (9).
