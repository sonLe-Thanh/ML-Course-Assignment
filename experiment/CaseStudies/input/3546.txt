     The recognition by Lindley of the importance of the fragments of       sculpture unearthed at Thetford, has led to impact in a number of areas,       affecting national and regional heritage organisations, local communities,       artists and companies.
Lindley's analysis and insight, directing the work       of the Project, has focussed new attention on an important period in       English history and has highlighted the importance of material culture in       understanding and interpreting the historical context.
Impact on heritage organisations       The underpinning research has changed the way local and national heritage       organisations display and present information on the dissolution of the       Thetford priory and the Howard family.
Major fragments of sculpture from       the Howard tombs, identified by Lindley, formed the basis of new permanent       displays at the EH managed Framlingham Castle (10 pieces from 2008 onwards       (A)) and at Norwich Castle Museum (managed by NMAS, 5 pieces).
Other fragments form a key component of the exhibition at the Ancient       House Museum in Thetford (NMAS) &#8212; Thetford's Lost Tudor Sculptures       &#8212; which showcases the findings of the Representing Re-formation project       (opened on 27 July 2013).
Lindley also wrote the free 40-page guide which       accompanies the exhibition and includes images and scans arising from the       Project.
In addition, the British Museum have placed on long term loan       with the Ancient House Museum two relief panels from the Thetford tombs       which they have held since the 1860s (B).
The exhibition has       allowed the Ancient House Museum to use the Tudor Hall as an exhibition       space for the first time, opening up new possibilities for future       activities (B).
The research has also impacted on the understanding and conservation of       sculpture from other significant buildings.
Amongst the sculptures       unearthed at Thetford, Lindley discovered part of a terracotta roundel by       Giovanni da Maiano, who produced identical roundels for Cardinal Wolsey at       Hampton Court Palace in 1521.
The rediscovered roundel fragment, unlike       its Hampton Court counterparts, retained its original paint, providing a       clear impression of how the originals would have looked when new.
This       discovery has informed the research and conservation programme (2012) by       the Historic Royal Palaces.
In addition, EH loaned the roundel to the       exhibition `Giving our past a future: the work of the World Monument         Fund' held at the Sir John Soane Museum between October 2012 and       January 2013 (A).
Having studied the Roubiliac tombs at Warkton, Lindley worked with The       Buccleuch Living Heritage Trust and the Parochial Church Council at       Warkton to underwrite a successful bid (C) (submitted       February 2013) to the Heritage Lottery Fund for &#163;318,000 to restore and       conserve the monuments which have been described as "surpassed only by the       monument to Lady Elizabeth Nightingale at Westminster Abbey" (D).
The conservation and restoration work is due to start shortly.
Impact on Local Communities       One of the key features of the research described has been the involvement       of local communities and the research has impacted on the way local people       think about and value their history.
Framlingham: Several public events and lectures were held for the       people of Framlingham including a series of public lectures (given by       Lindley, Hall and Fraser) at the church in June 2011 during 3D scanning       week and others in October 2012 (attendance at each 50-100 people).
Another talk was given in the local town of Aylsham in January 2013.
In       addition, there were tours for the general public from Framlingham round       Thetford Priory in June 2012 (50 people) and a talk plus tour to the       Society for Church Archaeology Conference in July 2012 (50 people).
Thetford: The Project has impacted on the people of Thetford in a       number of ways (B).
New audiences have visited the museum through the free entrance         (funded by the Project);       Local people have learned more about their town's history through the         talks and lectures by Lindley and members of the project team.
Young people working on their Arts Awards and members of the Matthew         Project, for people recovering from addictions, have used the exhibition         as inspiration and directly contributed to the displays.
Local schools have worked with the Norfolk Museums Service Education         team to develop and test a project app whose content has been directly         shaped by the work of Lindley and colleagues.
As a direct result of the plans for the exhibition, in early 2013,         Thetford Tourism and Heritage Partnership applied for a Heritage Lottery         Award.
This successful bid (&#163;9300) funded a very popular Meet the Tudors         day for local people (over 600 attendees), the day following the         official opening of the exhibition.
Lindley, Ford, Gunn,         Claiden-Yardley, Hall and Karim were all involved in this event, giving         lectures, tours and app demonstrations.
Warkton: In January 2013, Lindley gave lectures explaining the       architectural and cultural significance of the tomb monuments (C)       to the churchwardens of Warkton and separately to the Duke of Buccleuch       and an audience from Cambridge.
This was followed in July 2013 by a       similar lecture to local (paying) public.
As stated by English Heritage, "Without your input, English Heritage         would not have identified the international significance of the Thetford         Priory collection and neither would the collection have been promoted to         such a wide and diverse audience" (A).
Impact on Contemporary Artists       Contemporary multimedia artist Andrew Williams explores issues of       disability and identity through his work.
He developed a video       presentation, which forms part of the Thetford's Lost Tudor Sculptures       exhibition, featuring the fragments, extant and virtually-recreated       tombs to explore notions of evanescence and decay.
Williams says the       following about how working with the project has affected his work "I         was pleased to find that my meditations on transience and the damage         that time inflicts seem to have echoed your academic concerns.
For a         professional artist, used to working for very different types of         audience, this has been reciprocally a transformative experience,         putting a different type of artistic challenge in front of me, and         placing the result before new audiences" (E).
Impact on Commerce       A key innovation of the Representing Re-Formation project was the       development and application of computer imaging techniques for digitizing       and reconstructing tomb monuments virtually.
Working on the project opened       up new commercial opportunities for the technology company who used their       involvement as a case study at trade fairs and noted a considerable       increase in enquiries and company recognition following Lindley's       appearance on BBC TV and Radio on 16 June 2011 (F).
Lindley's       presentation on these novel uses of 3D scanning at the Digidoc Conference       (22 October 2012) to a mixed audience of archaeologists, heritage       professionals and commercial organisations (200 people) further       highlighted the potential of digital technology.
The Company gained increased expertise and confidence from working on the       tombs and as a direct result of this work employed a Creative and       Marketing Manager in June 2013 to develop a new company (to be launched in       late 2013) focussing on 3D scanning for non-industrial markets (G).
This development is particularly important in view of the 2013 decision at       National Museums, Liverpool to close their Laser Scanning and Conservation       Unit.
English Heritage commented that "An additional benefit has been an         exemplary use of modern technology and scientific investigation in         showing how rather unprepossessing bits of stone can be used as elements         in reconstructions, using 3d scans and prints.
This will undoubtedly         have wider applications at other museums and heritage sites."
(H)     Although the underpinning research for this case study focusses on a       specific set of tomb monuments from the 16th century, the       research has had impact far outside this area in both heritage and       commercial sectors and on the public understanding of this tumultuous       period in England's history.
