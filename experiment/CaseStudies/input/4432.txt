     The identification of the E3I belt generated initially       considerable controversy amongst regional policy makers because it       challenged the approach taken in existing strategies.
However, it was       subsequently directly used in 2010 to determine the geography of the new       Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership (GBSLEP).
This meant that the boundaries for this LEP drawn by local policy makers       and business leaders included a broader area encompassing the E3I       belt in addition to the Birmingham and Solihull conurbation.
Subsequent       economic development activities by the GBSLEP have continued to use this       formulation.
Without these findings, the close economic relationship of       the wider area to the core conurbation was unlikely to have been       recognised in 2010 and the GBSLEP would not have subsequently achieved the       benefits of its greater scale.
The branding of this belt as E3I       in the research papers has been followed by the continued use of the term       by the GBSLEP and other agencies in the region, helping to evidence the       influence of these findings on regional economic development in a       partnership area with a population of nearly two million people, 918,000       jobs and a GVA of about &#163;35.5 billion.
Initial reception to E3I     When the results of the research were first issued in 2006, two       organisations were responsible for economic development in the West       Midlands.
One was the Regional Assembly which was responsible for the       Regional Spatial Strategy and, at this time, their focus was on ensuring       development was confined to established built-up areas.
The existence of       the E3I belt challenged this approach.
The other, Advantage       West Midlands (AWM), was responsible for regional economic strategy, but       the politics related to the Regional Assembly meant that AWM did not refer       to the E3I belt in its strategies.
The E3I research       stimulated an on-going debate between AWM, the Regional Assembly,       Birmingham City Council, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Shropshire and       Staffordshire councils between 2008 and 2010.
The concept of the belt and       the identification of the functioning economic geography of the region       influenced all economic development strategies during this period and       continues to do so through 2013.
The E3I analysis determined       the partners that were incorporated into the LEP.
LEP policies must       include actions that embrace the economic geography of the partner       organisations and this reflects the functioning geography identified in       the E3I analysis (see selected references in section 5: D &amp;       E).
In March 2010, Business Voice West Midlands, which represents 20 business       organisations in the region, quoted extensively from the E3I       research in a submission to a Parliamentary Committee's review of housing       and economic development in the West Midlands.
This submission argued that       the existence of the E3I belt had been confirmed by "... by         work undertaken by the West Midlands Regional Assembly".
It stated       that: "During 2003-04, the amount of (employment land) completions         within the Major Urban Areas (MUAs) declined while the number of         completions outside of the hierarchy increased.
The MUAs, therefore, did         not act as the main focus for development, contrary to the policy         objectives of the RSS" (source A, p. 48).
This is important.
as       although the Regional Assembly found the identification of the E3I       belt challenging.
they eventually came to appreciate the significance of       the research.
Defining the GBSLEP area to include the E3I         belt     The importance of identifying the relationship between the belt and the       core conurbation grew following changes to the governance of sub-national       economic development after the May 2010 general election.
In June 2010,       the new coalition government invited businesses and councils to come       together to form Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) as replacement for       the regional development agencies.
The government wanted the geographical       areas to be covered by these partnerships to reflect natural economic       areas rather than simply replicate previous regional structures or local       administrative boundaries.
The Local Growth White Paper, published in       October 2010, set out the roles that LEPs could play depending on their       local priorities.
Working with local firms, the Leaders of Birmingham and Solihull councils       with East Staffordshire, Lichfield and Tamworth councils responded to this       invitation to develop a LEP; subsequently North Worcestershire joined the       partnership.
The area of this LEP was defined by the 2006 Birmingham       research and the identification of the E3I belt.
The successful       submission to the Secretaries of State to establish the Greater Birmingham       and Solihull LEP noted that the new LEP would: "Capitalise on the           attributes of the E3I belt.
This covers an area 20-40km outside of the conurbation, and combines         factors including lifestyle, accessibility, quality of environment, as         well as a range of innovative manufacturing and business and         professional service activities.
It provides a major potential growth         area" (source B).
Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP and the E3I     The GBSLEP has continued to make use of the E3I concept in its       strategic proposals since 2010.
The proposal made to government by the GBSLEP in 2011 for an enterprise       zone explicitly referred to the Birmingham research.
This said that the       GBSLEP growth strategy brought together "the Core City of Birmingham         and the economically related Belt around it comprising Solihull,         southern Staffordshire and northern Worcestershire".
Phase 1 of the       strategy was an Enterprise Zone in Birmingham city centre; Phase 2 was an       "Enterprise Belt comprising the M42 growth corridor in Solihull and the         E3I Belt in southern Staffordshire and northern         Worcestershire, which a study by the University of Birmingham           has shown to have the potential for substantial business growth that           complements that of Birmingham and Solihull" (source C, pp1-2,       emphasis added).
This was the only research finding specifically referred       to in the submission.
The GBSLEP's successful City Deal proposal (July 2012) noted       that:     "The Southern Staffordshire and Northern Worcestershire part of our         LEP includes the E3I belt.
Situated 20-40 km         outside the urban conurbation, this zone has been identified by         academics as an area with significant potential for sustainable,         knowledge-based economic growth.
The area has strengths ranging from         advanced manufacturing to leisure tourism - and builds upon the         nationally significant features that the area possesses.
Our Strategy         for Growth, based on the three components of `Business, People and         Place', is focused on maximising the economic potential of our strategic         assets" (source D).
The size of the GBSLEP has enabled this organisation to attract the       attention of Whitehall and to work with government on policies that will       transform their relationship with the LEPs.
One indication of this       development is the Greater Birmingham Project (Jan-April 2013) led       by Lord Heseltine, working with a Whitehall team, the GBSLEP and Bryson.
This project reported to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 17 March 2013       and led to the creation of a single economic pot to support local economic       growth.
The report on this project continues to show the Enterprise Belt       as a crucial element in the way the partnership area is conceptualised       (see for instance source E, p. 15).
Reach: The research impacted on economic development across the       West Midlands and in particular Birmingham, Solihull and the counties of       Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire and Shropshire.
It played a       critical role in economic planning undertaken by these counties, AWM, the       RA and since 2010 the GBSLEP.
Significance: The 2006 research was path breaking as it developed       an approach for identifying the functioning economic geography of a       regional economy.
Without this research both AWM and more importantly the       GBSLEP would have been unable to develop a governance structure,       administrative area and set of policies that were more closely aligned to       the functioning economic geography of the West Midlands.
