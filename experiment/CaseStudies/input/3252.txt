     Impact on health: Work by Clark on producing a non-depleting and       non-mitogenic Fc modified       antibody through use of an aglycosylated IgG1 Fc region in the anti-CD3       antibody (Bolt et al 1993)       led to the development of otelixizumab, which was licensed to GSK in       October 2007.
It has since       been tested in 8 clinical trials, including phase 3 trials for Type 1       Diabetes Mellitus (NCT00678886       13/5/2008 &amp; NCT01123083 11/5/2010) and on-going Phase 1 trials in       Rheumatoid Arthritis       (NCT01077531 25/2/2010 &amp; NCT01101555 8/4/2010).
The two phase 3 trials       for Type 1 diabetes       both failed to reach significance for the primary end points and a current       on-going trial is now       exploring a different dosing and delivery route (NCT00946257 23/7/2009).
The published human clinical volunteer studies by Clark and colleagues       have demonstrated that       antibodies with selected modifications to the Fc regions have the desired       properties for the       intended purposes (Armour et al 2006, Ghevaert et al 2013).
These       volunteer studies showed that       cells coated with the Fc modified antibody had longer survival times than       cells coated with wild       type IgG1 and that this could extend to situations where there was a       mixture of the two antibodies       on the cell surface as would be encountered in an affected foetus.
These       results identify an       alternative strategy for the treatment of FMAITP, a disorder that       currently is usually treated with       high doses of intravenous IVIg and prednisone, an expensive therapy that       also is associated with       serious side effects and potential risks of infection (IVIg is a prepared       from pooled human plasma       donations).
The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has taken a license (agreement dated       Dec 18th 2009) to       develop a number of therapeutic antibodies that incorporate the mutations       described in Armour et       al 1999, protected by world patent application WO1999058572 and US7597889.
Pfizer had a       clinical requirement that their antibodies would be non-depleting and       non-activating, with a low in-vivo       toxicity profile, which could be provided by incorporation of our modified       Fc regions into their       products.
They initiated clinical trials with several licensed antibodies       within the period 2008-2013       that are listed on the US NIH website ClinicalTrials.gov.
These include 25       listed trials with the anti-nerve       growth factor antibody tanezumab, several of which have been in phase 3       (NCT00744471       29/8/2008, NCT00809783 16/12/2008, NCT00733902 11/8/2008, NCT00863304       13/4/2009).
Another antibody ponezumab to the beta-amyloid protein has been tested in       8 listed trials for the       treatment of Alzheimer's disease including three phase 2 trials       (NCT00722046 23/7/2008,       NCT00945672 22/7/2009, NCT01821118 4/3/2013).
RN316 specific for       Proprotein Convertase       Subtilisin Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a therapeutic antibody aimed at       lowering cholesterol levels and       has been used in 7 listed trials, including two at phase 2 (NCT01342211       25/4/2011, NCT01592240       3/5/2012).
A fourth antibody RN564 has recently entered phase 1 clinical       trials for treatment of       osteoporosis (NCT01293487 9/2/2011).
The constant region used in these       antibodies have       behaved as expected in that the antibodies had extended half-lives, normal       biodistribution, and no       reported side-effects attributable to Fc mediated functions.
Full results       of the Phase III trial with       Tanezumab in osteoarthritis have just been published (Spierings et al       2013) and this reports       significant efficacy in pain relief and no additional safety issues with       the antibody.
Commercial impact: The modifications that have been identified in       Dr Clark's research have been       protected by a number of patent families with patents that are still in       force and that have been       assigned by the inventors and Cambridge University to BTG plc.
The aglycosylated IgG1 CD3 antibody otelixizumab is protected by the       world patent family       WO1993019196 (Bolt et al 1993) and a recently granted patent US RE43898       (Gorman et al 2013)       and US6767996 (Bolt et al 2004).
These have all been assigned to BTG plc.
Other intellectual       property relating to this antibody has been created by Waldmann and       colleagues at Oxford       University and this too was assigned to BTG plc.
In an agreement dated 18th       Sep 2012 the two       Universities of Oxford and Cambridge entered into a joint revenue sharing       arrangement with BTG       plc under which all the income arising from the various IPRs is to be       pooled and then shared       equally.
Between 2008 and 2013 &#163;2.8 million has been received by Cambridge       under these       arrangements.
Mutations resulting in non-depleting and non-activating Fc regions but       retaining low       immunogenicity and also binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn have been       protected by the       world patent family WO1999058572 (Armour, Clark and Williamson 1999) with a       granted US patent       US7597889 (Armour, Clark and Williamson 2009).
This patent has been       licensed to Pfizer for use       in multiple products, four of which are already in clinical trials (see       above) with others still at the       pre-clinical stage (e.g.
RN 307).
In an agreement dated 20th       Feb 2013, GSK have taken out a       research license to explore the applicability of this technology to one of       their research programmes       in order to reduce the unwanted toxicity that they have encountered with       their antibody.
Between       2008 and 2013 these licenses have returned &#163;382,148 in revenue to       Cambridge Enterprise Ltd.       Vectors encoding these mutations for research use are available from the       San Diego based       company Invivogen under license and a number of preclinical and research       studies have made use       of the mutations (e.g.
Richter et al 2013)..
Recent research by Clark and colleagues has led to further findings       identifying residue changes       from a human pseudo-gamma sequence that, when introduced into human IgG1,       result in       increased binding affinity for the inhibitory human Fc receptor FcgRIIb.
This receptor is of interest       because it plays a role in dampening down and regulating immune responses,       such as inhibiting       mast cell degranulation mediated by IgE, thereby preventing allergic       hypersensitivity reactions.
World patent applications have been made under WO2012146934 (Armour and       Clark 2012) and       the potential to further exploit this technology by commercial licensing       and incorporation into       therapeutic antibodies is being explored.
Specialist Advisory roles: In addition to the licensing of patents       and know-how to industry, further       commercial impact arises from consultancy and advisory roles of Dr Clark       to several established       international biotech companies and to several smaller start-up and early       stage biotech companies       operating in the UK that are developing therapeutic antibody based       programmes.
In the period       2009-2013 Dr Clark has been a member (and since 2012 Chair) of the       Scientific Advisory Board of       the Centre d'Immunologie Pierre Fabre in France.
In 2013 he joined the       Scientific Advisory Board       of UCB.
Smaller biotech companies with which he has worked as an       advisor/consultant during the       period 2008-2013 include Antitope Ltd, Crescendo Biologics Ltd, Kymab Ltd       &amp; VHsquared Ltd. Dr       Clark also provided advice and assistance to licensees of the patents and       know-how derived from       his laboratory research to the companies: BioAnalab (Millipore), BTG plc,       Genzyme, GSK and       Pfizer.
