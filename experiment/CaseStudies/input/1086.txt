     Knowledge exchange, that is close working with end-users, has always been       a core principle of our       research team and is the process that has led to the impacts described       below.
We work with real       sites and use science to address complex practical problems.
We have       developed close       relationships with industry and the regulator (the Environment Agency)       including, for example,       Visiting Professors and secondments from Shell, Environment Agency, and       consultancies such as       AEAT and Sirius.
With these partners, we created and led an EPSRC-funded Network         on Natural         Attenuation in Groundwater and Soils (NNAGS; 1998-2001),       which led to policy documents,       economic impacts and training [see quote from S1 below].
Four inter-related types of impact are described here: (1) changes in       professional practices, (2)       creation and application of national policy, (3) national and       site-specific economic impacts, and (4)       influencing European industrial practice.
(1) Changes in UK professional practice.
The Environment Agency       funded a Fellowship for       Thornton to work on natural attenuation research, policy development and       training (1999-2003).
During the Fellowship, he helped create their guidance document (see       below) and delivered 20       training events to over 200 staff across the UK.
Since then, we have       delivered virtually all the       professional training on Natural Attenuation in the UK, giving 24 CPD       courses on Natural       Attenuation and Risk Assessment, and including specialist modules in our       Contaminant       Hydrogeology MSc.
From 1999-2013 we have trained ~100 students and ~300       CPD delegates in       these fields.
We also gave 3 courses in China to ~100 delegates, and       inspired the inclusion in a       Chinese textbook of a major section (1/8 of book) on natural attenuation;       the book has already had       26 printings [S5].
(2) Creation and application of national policy.
We used our       research to help write two new       policy documents in 2000, which remain in force.
They enable and encourage       the appropriate use       of Natural Attenuation as a management strategy for contaminated land       through the use of       science-based investigation, assessment and monitoring of field sites.
The       Environment Agency       says:     "With regard to research into natural attenuation (NA) of pollutants         and development of practice         in the use of monitored natural attenuation (MNA) as a remediation         option it seems undeniable         that the University of Sheffield played a pivotal role in the UK.
The         strong links that were made         between Sheffield and the Environment Agency (and other regulators),         industry (small and         large) and indeed research groups in other academic institutions played         a major part in this.
Your work at Four Ashes on the biodegradation of phenol and related         compounds was         instrumental in getting Environment Agency buy-in to the idea of natural         attenuation as a         serious component of site management.
The outputs from that work       [examples given above,       R1, R2, R3, R5, R6] and the subsequent network NNAGS led to a range of         Agency guidance         and policy documents, most obviously the R&amp;D Publication 95         "Guidance on the Assessment         and Monitoring of Natural Attenuation of Contaminants in Groundwater".
This in turn influenced         our strategic "Policy and Practice for the Protection of Groundwater"         that sets out Agency         thinking on groundwater protection.
Both of these documents are widely         used, within the         Agency on a daily basis and by our customers in industry to understand         our regulatory needs.
R&amp;D Publication 95 has stood the test of time and I estimate it         helps to inform remediation         decisions on dozens of sites per year at the current time."

(3) Site-specific and national economic impacts.
Financial       information on individual sites is       difficult to obtain due to commercial confidentiality.
However we are able       to present information       from one of our research sites, from one major land owner, and a national       survey, as follows:            At Site A, where many research projects were based, the owners are         prepared to give         information on the multi-part clean-up operation they implemented in         2009.
The design drew         significantly on our research-based understanding of the inhibiting         effects of contaminant         toxicity on biodegradation in the aquifer [R1, R2, R3, R5] and our         research-based assessment         that natural attenuation would only occur satisfactorily under specific         conditions.
This design         has saved &#163;1M per year between 2009-2013, compared with the cost of the         alternative full         pump and treat operation [S3].
An owner of 50 large problem sites has stated that Natural Attenuation         plays a significant role         in reducing risk and remediating 11 of the 14 sites where it is taking         action.
It has analysed the         cost-benefit of Monitored Natural Attenuation in comparison to more         aggressive remediation on         3 of these sites and found that the cost avoided is at least &#163;20M [S2].
CL:AIRE, the industry's knowledge exchange group, estimates that         Monitored Natural         Attenuation was formally adopted for about 3% of site remediations in         2008-12.
Through a         survey of consultants active in contaminated land and groundwater,         CL:AIRE derives very         conservative estimates for the period 2008-12 that Natural Attenuation         was adopted as the         remedial strategy on at least 120 sites per year, with a typical saving         of &#163;166k per site, i.e.
a         total saving of at least &#163;100M since 2008 [S2].
(4) Influencing European industrial practice.
CONCAWE, the       association of almost all the oil       refining companies in the EU, Norway and Switzerland, has stated "...         research on monitored         natural attenuation undertaken at Sheffield University over the past         decade has had a significant         beneficial impact on industry good practice issued by CONCAWE, and on         the practices of its         member companies.
...
In financial terms alone, the cost savings to our         industry in Europe         associated with the use of MNA solutions instead of intensively         engineered solutions, is probably in         the order of hundreds of millions Euros during the period 2008 to 2012"       [S4].
Overall, the policy and practice changes that resulted from our       research have led in the census       period to:            Savings of typically &#163;166K per site, and up to several million pounds         on large and complex         sites       A total saving in the UK of at least &#163;100M       Savings in Europe in the oil sector alone of several hundred million         Euros.
