     The research outlined in section 2 has improved how museums and other       memory institutions are able to engage the public with their cultural       heritage, resulting in social, cultural and public         services impacts with global reach &#8212; illustrated below.
The impacts       are enabled by research and innovative systems (e.g.
ARCO) that allow       museums themselves to develop and deploy approaches that go beyond       standard multimedia methods (typified by technologies such as Adobe Flash)       to create interactive virtual museums and exhibitions that combine       Internet and 3D technologies and virtual and augmented realities in novel       ways.
In 2008, the University transferred its IP resulting from the ARCO       project to a spin-out based in Poland (ARCO Centre), which has       commercialised the system targeted at Polish museums [C1].
Although the       creation of the spin-out and the receipt by the University of consultancy       and licensing income associated with the transfer of IP represents an       economic impact, the main impacts are related to end users: members of the       public.
In particular, virtual reconstructions of sites, monuments and       artefacts allow visitors to situate their heritage within its cultural       context; 3D, virtual and augmented realities allow visitors to appreciate       how such heritage was first created and used; interaction with a       2017digital object` or 2017augmented representation` can lead to a better       understanding than, for example, a museum`s physical display of the       object; and digital representations can be viewed remotely across the       Internet and in combination with Web 2.0 technologies to develop virtual       communities around cultural objects.
One key example is a 3D reconstruction of the Church of Santa Chiara,         installed at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) in 2009.
The         church itself is located in Florence, Italy.
However, the V&amp;A         purchased the church`s chapel and altars in 1861.
This dislocation of         church, chapel, altars and other artefacts (lost through time) presents         a classical problem associated with understanding our past heritage.
The         3D reconstruction allows visitors to explore the chapel and altars         2017virtually` within the context of the missing church.
The Santa         Chiara interactive system was installed for the public opening of the         new Medieval and Renaissance Galleries [C2].
In a visitor survey commissioned by the V&amp;A in April/May 2013, 93% of       visitors who used the Santa Chiara interactive reported that it had       enhanced their enjoyment, and 60% reported that it had caused them to look       more closely at the physical chapel exhibit [C3].
This is supported by a       V&amp;A evaluation report, which states that the "interactives are well       utilized, as 40% of visitors report using a Gallery interactive during       their visit", and that the effects of the Gallery interactives influence       their users to "see a larger proportion of the Gallery than non-users"       [C4].
Recent evaluation "has demonstrated that the digital interactive       enhances visitors` understanding of the chapel".
The digital model is on       the V&amp;A`s website, thus "reaching a wider international audience" [C5,       C6].
The range of beneficiaries is broad, and impacts span the areas of       public awareness and understanding of their heritage, and of museum       service delivery.
A further notable example is the digitisation and aggregation of         several major Sierra Leone collections of cultural artefacts, resulting         in the SierraLeoneHeritage social media-based digital-heritage         repository (online at http://www.sierraleoneheritage.org).
For this virtual museum, Sierra Leonean material culture from the Sierra         Leone National Museum, the British Museum, Glasgow Museums, and Brighton         Museum and Art Gallery were digitised (augmented with appropriate         metadata and media objects) to form a unique repository.
After its         launch, the British Library and the World Museum Liverpool asked for         their Sierra Leonean collections to be added to the repository, and, in         early 2013, the Cootje Van Oven Collection was also added.
The requests         to integrate further collections after the end of the associated funded         project demonstrate the value that these leading memory institutions         place on the repository.
The British Museum staged a combined physical and virtual display of       Sierra Leonean artefacts in spring 2013, with a touchscreen kiosk giving       access to http://www.sierraleoneheritage.org.
The museum`s evaluation       report states that there were 66,996 visits, with the touchscreen being       used by 22% of those tracked.
A number of people were observed spending       over 10 minutes using it.
The report concludes, "the touchscreen enabled       those who were interested to explore Sierra Leonean heritage further and       so appears to have been a useful addition to the display" [C7].
The museum       considers that "the digital resource has been extremely useful in       encouraging exploration of Sierra Leone`s heritage by specialists as well       as non-specialists ... the unprecedented access it provides to multiple       museum collections is impressive".
The Sierra Leone National Museum has       developed a schools outreach programme supported by a version of the       website on DVD, received "with much enthusiasm by teachers and students       alike".
The website has been "recognised as coming at a key moment for       schools", and is being used in extra-curricular clubs in the capital city       and in charity-sponsored educational development projects in the poorest       rural area of northern Sierra Leone [C8].
In the 50th anniversary of independence celebrations in 2011,       the country`s president announced in a speech that "Sierra Leone now had a       cultural website and congratulated [its creators] on this achievement".
The website "provides a way for people in the Sierra Leone diaspora to       connect with their home country ... they are proud of it too" [C9].
A       Sierra Leone Facebook community is integrated within the website, allowing       people in this diaspora to connect with each other and discuss their       shared culture.
The community has global reach: in the period 1 February -       31 July 2013, people in 206 cities/regions in 45 different countries have       2017liked` content [C10].
The beneficiaries are thus spread across the       world, and impacts include support for social cohesion and greater public       awareness and understanding of dispersed heritage.
