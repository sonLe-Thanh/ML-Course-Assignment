     World polyolefin production has risen from 25.6M tonnes in 1983 to an       estimated 150M tonnes in 2010, with a total market value of several       billion US$.
Research at UEA has focussed on single-site polymerisation       catalysts and this market sector shows an annual growth rate of more than       10% p.a.
A key route to economic impact for the UEA research on olefin       polymerisation catalysis has been through industry funded IPR protection.
For example, within the butyl rubber polymerisation area, research has       resulted in 5 world-wide `patent families' each containing 5-7 filings and       naming UEA academics as the inventors [corroborating source A].
Importantly, these patents were all financed and continue to be maintained       by the industrial partner.
The specific uptake of UEA research results within the industrial sector       is a matter of commercial secrecy.
However, statements from key industrial       partners, DSM and Sabic, indicate quite clearly the importance of the UEA       research.
DSM is a Dutch-based global life sciences and materials company with a       wide range of products including a range of ultra high molecular weight       polyethylene (UHMwPE) applications such as knee implants and high-tensile       strength fibres (`Dyneema'&#174; used for nets and ropes for the       commercial fishing / shipping industry, and personal ballistic       protection).
In 2012 DSM had net sales figures of &#8364;9.13B.
Bochmann's research on the trityl effect has been instrumental in       the development of commercially viable polyolefin products at DSM, as       shown by the following statement from [text removed for publication]:     `If I was asked to be specific on a particular theme that has had       industrial significance and that can be easily linked to $$$ then it would       be his [Professor Bochmann's] work on the `trityl effect' ....
This work       has long been regarded as a step change in our knowledge and has led to       the commercial success of a family of polyolefin products that only became       commercially viable by the addition of an extra equivalent of       `co-catalyst' [text removed for publication] which resulted in the products       becoming economically attractive to produce.

The "trityl" effect and       the mechanistic review papers also aided the development of commercial       heterogeneous catalysts.'
[corroborating source B]     Sabic, one of the World's top 10 petrochemical companies, is based in       Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
In Europe, Sabic is a major producer of plastics and       chemicals with approximately 6,300 employees.
Sabic-Europe operates 13       petrochemical production sites, including a site at Geleen in The       Netherlands which produces large volumes of polyethylene (940 ktpa), and       polypropylene (620 ktpa).
Geleen's output is used in the automotive,       luggage, and food packaging industries.
A supporting statement from [text removed for publication] shows the       importance of Bochmann's research on weakly coordinating anions       (WCA) to the operation of [text removed for publication]:     `To the best of my knowledge, almost all low pressure/high temperature       solution phase processes currently operated by industry make use of such       WCA's as activators for polyolefins.
It is especially in this important       area where Professor Bochmann and his co-workers have played a major role       in the discovery, fundamental understanding and subsequent further       development of boron containing WCA's as activators for polyolefins that       allowed commercialization of this groundbreaking technology.
[text removed for       publication]     Without the introduction of these speciality olefins it is hard to         envisage that [text removed for publication] would still be in         operation today.'
[corroborating source C]     The packaging market accounts for nearly a third of all Sabic-Europe's       polymer sales within Europe.
For the production of food packaging       materials, it is crucial that all polymers comply with EU Plastics       Regulations, including the catalysts.
Bochmann's research on [text removed for       publication] has been important within such polymer production, as shown       by the statement from [text removed for publication]:     `The commercial relevance of [text removed for publication] was not very well       recognized because of the generally encountered low productivity.
For       this, pioneering publications on the performance of [text removed for       publication] catalysts by Professor Bochmann's group.... were and still       are leading references ...Although not able to go into details, the large       economic relevance of [text removed for publication] EU's positive list for       substances allowed in Food Contact Applications.'
