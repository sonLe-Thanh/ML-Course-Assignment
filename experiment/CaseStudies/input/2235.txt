     Pathway to impact     Grubin's 2003-2006 study carried out for the Home Office, in which       offenders were tested voluntarily (R3; results reported to       government in July 2006), informed the Child Sex Offender Review of 2006,       which recommended that a trial of mandatory polygraph testing be carried       out (Ev a and Ev f).
Necessary changes were made to the Offender       Management Act 2007 (to authorise mandatory testing), and in April 2009       the National Offender Management Service began a three-year pilot study of       mandatory polygraph assessment of high-risk sex offenders on parole       (Ev a and Ev b).
The Head of Public Protection Partnerships at the       Ministry of Justice has confirmed in a statement that:     "...without Professor's [sic] Grubin's research it is unlikely         that the CSOR [child sex offenders review] would have been aware         of the potential role of polygraphy in managing offenders nor is it       [the mandatory polygraph trial] likely to have become a manifesto         commitment" (Ev a).
The aim of the trial was to evaluate whether mandatory testing, like       voluntary testing, would be associated with higher rates of clinically       significant disclosures by offenders to their case managers and whether it       would lead to an increase in subsequent actions by supervising officers.
The testing arm of the mandatory polygraph trial was led by Grubin, and       he was also a member of the research steering group (because of his       knowledge of the practicalities of testing and the kinds of data that       should be collected).
The pilot began in April 2009 in the East Midlands       and West Midlands probation regions.
The comparison areas, where no       testing took place, were the Yorkshire &amp; Humberside and North West       regions (Ev a and Ev c).
A total of 332 offenders received a polygraph       test over the course of the trial; they were compared with 303 individuals       in the comparison areas who did not.
Formal evaluation of the pilot study       was carried out independently by the University of Kent between April 2010       and December 2011, and the final report was published by the Ministry of       Justice in July 2012 (Ev c).
The mandatory polygraph trial achieved similar outcomes to the voluntary       trial.
The researchers found that the number of clinically significant       disclosures made by offenders in the polygraph-tested group was       significantly higher than that made by offenders in the non-tested group       (2.60 and 1.25 mean disclosures per offender respectively).
Depending on       the seriousness of the disclosure, a range of actions were taken,       including recall to prison.
In the absence of disclosures, whether an       offender passed or failed a test also had an impact on management &#8212; for       example, a non-deceptive test outcome provided reassurance regarding case       management and risk assessment, while a test failure helped focus       supervision towards problematic areas or led to increased attention being       given to the offender by hostel workers or the police.
The trial therefore       demonstrated that polygraph testing increased the number of preventative       actions taken by offender managers to protect the public from harm (see       table below).

The odds of changing the focus of supervision in the polygraph       group was 2.9 times greater (CI = 2.0, 4.0)     The odds of issuing a warning to an offender in the polygraph       group was 2.7 times greater (CI = 1.5, 4.6) than in the comparison group.
The Ministry of Justice report on the trial concluded:     "...it [polygraph testing] increased the likelihood of         preventative actions being taken by offender managers to protect the         public from harm" and "the polygraph is a suitable tool for         eliciting CSDs [clinically significant disclosures] for all         types of sexual offender" (Ev c).
On the basis of the trial results, ministers decided in summer 2012 that       probation trusts in England and Wales should use polygraph assessment on a       mandatory basis to manage the most serious sex offenders that have been       released on licence (Ev a and Ev d).
Implementation of the policy     Secondary legislation has now been passed, enabling polygraph conditions       to be inserted into the release licences of offenders (Ev g).
Other       aspects of policy implementation are also underway: a Polygraph       Implementation Board has been established, and it has been given the tasks       of procuring a provider of polygraph testing and organising training       programmes for staff (Ev a).
On 26th February 2013 the Ministry       of Justice published a prior information notice, indicating its intention       to start the following month a formal procurement exercise for the       polygraph testing service.
The value of the contract is estimated to be       &#163;2.75 million and it is expected to last four years.
At least 750       offenders per year (those on parole and perceived as high risk) are       expected to undergo polygraph testing, with testing occurring on average       every six months (Ev e).
Based on the trial data, the policy expectation       is that polygraph assessment will improve markedly the quality of       supervision provided by probation offender managers: supervision and       monitoring will be more focused and increased risk will be identified       before a new offence is committed.
