     The reach of this project was trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific with       Northcott providing over 100 presentations to religious and community       groups in the UK, US, Australia, and Southeast Asia.
The monograph was       co-published by Maryknoll Books, New York, United States and widely used       in ecclesiastical settings in the UK, North America and Australasia.
For       example a Benedictine Monastery in the South of England used it for       readings at meals.
UK churches associated with the `Eco-Congregations'       movement adopted the book for home group study.
The book was taken up as a       classroom text in the study of ecology and religion in HEIs in the USA and       UK.
But the book also reached lay religious as well as scholarly audiences       in Australasia, Europe, the United States and Canada, and Southeast Asia.
The impacts of the reading of the book in these many settings were in       shaping beliefs and behaviours about the moral implications of climate       change, and in mobilising faith communities as sponsors of low carbon       living, renewable energy, local food and other climate change related       practices as indicated in the following verbatim testimony details:            `In 2010, the Diocese of Southwell in collaboration with Environmental         Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and the Cathedral Chapter at         Southwell held a three day conference: 'Green as a Leaf: Renewing a         Theology of Creation' (5.1 below).
Michael Northcott's lecture and         sermon on caring for creation/climate at Southwell Cathedral had a big         impact on the conference audience, as could be seen in the feedback         sheets, where people said that he really brought home the importance of         locality and the local ecology in care for creation.
The sermon in         particular highlighted farming and renewable energy, putting these         topics in a spiritual frame.
Since this conference, we have begun a         climate change web community for Southwell, initiated by those who heard         Michael's sermon and lecture, and this is leading to public action on         climate change in Southwell in the form of proposals for a communal wind         farm.
His sermon also impacted the Dean and staff of Brackenhurst         Agricultural College and made them much more aware of the spiritual         significance of ecology, and this has led to continued collaboration         between them and the cathedral in services and talks.
His lecture at the         conference also impacted the Dean and Chapter of Southwell Minster and         encouraged them to introduce the sourcing of local food in catering         venues associated with the Minster Shop and Cafe.'

`I read A Moral Climate soon after being challenged on the         need to respond to raising awareness on climate change in 2007.
The         sections on environmental justice and ethics framed my own views         considerably which in turn have helped prompt subsequent actions (an         active 8th Day discussion group in my church which has influenced the         decision to install underfloor heating in our church and a Photovoltaic         array on our parish centre as well as ongoing lifestyle challenges).
The         book's prophetic challenge and encouragement to provide a spiritual         frame for public action on climate change has been a useful stimulation         for the board of Operation Noah (Michael was a board member for two         years).
His presentation at the AGM in 2009 on the faith implications of         climate change fired the board and members and encouraged the formation         of the Carbon Exodus campaign: http://www.operationnoah.org/carbon-exodus.'

`A Moral Climate has helped provide a discerning theological         and spiritual framework for public action on climate change here in         Australia.
The book is well researched and has a prophetic urgency about         it.
His chapter dealing with Tasmanian forests obviously has particular         relevance in Australia.
Northcott's presentations at Ethos' mid 2011         `Consuming Creation' conference in Melbourne on the faith implications         of climate change brought home the moral responsibility of Christians         and churches to care for creation (link at 5.4 below).
His work was the         catalyst for 12 workshops on Australian ecological issues and actions         that could be pursued e.g.
Ethos' Cut Your Carbs program for tracking         churches and parachurch groups' ecological footprint taken up by c. six         groups, the Uniting Church's ecological audit solar panel program for         church roofs, Church gardens at St. Mark's Spotswood and Ringwood         Baptist etc.
Michael's interviews on two ABC radio programs broadened         the impact of his book and the conference.
He also spoke to the         Australian Public Theology Network extending his work's influence         through a number of agencies represented.
Zadok Perspectives and Papers         in September 2011 further publicised key papers and workshops from the         conference Michael keynoted.
It also indirectly led to our December         edition on Local Food.
All in all it made an enormous impact, both on         church and parachurch groups, seminaries, and Green groups he dialogued         with.'

`The insights in A Moral Climate around climate justice &#8212;         especially the intergenerational debt which our continuing despoliation         inflicts on today's &amp; tomorrow's children &#8212; strongly influence a         diocesan working party on which I sit, working now to sharpen the         Diocese of Southwark's environmental policy.
Below diocesan level, and         benefitting communities beyond the Church of England, Professor         Northcott's advocacy of a revived localism and of Christian witness by         communities to climate crisis is demonstrated here in south west London.
Readers of A Moral Climate established Wimbledon Green Churches,         our locality's first ecumenical faith group co-ordinating practical,         ecumenical responses in environmentalism, ranging from energy         conservation and ecumenical worship to food localism; Northcott's book         is frequently mentioned.
His thinking on energy decarbonisation has led         several Wimbledon faith groups to investigate solar generation on church         properties, and of lobbying &amp; protest directed at safeguarding that         possibility.'

`The interface between climate change, religion, and public action, is         one that is very important for us in New Zealand.
Dr Michael Northcott's         visit from Scotland came at an especially opportune time for us.
We were         thinking our way into personal action and public action, in relation to         climate change, water quality, and mining.
We wanted to resource         congregations and community groups to (a) reflect on their own         lifestyles and (b) to engage in public debate and action to encourage         our own government, and governments generally, to act for the benefit of         our immediate environments, and for the global environment.
Michael         Northcott's book A Moral Climate was important for us, and his         visit, involving face-to-face gatherings in urban and rural situations,         enhanced the benefits of his writings and widened the awareness of         academic groups, church groups, and local community groups.
One of the         highlights of his visit was the leadership he provided in the Wanaka         Summer School on "Living Hopefully", and the manner in which he related         to the spectrum of resource speakers and participants from universities,         churches, Indigenous groups (in our context Maori), and community         groups.
He equipped us to reflect better on our own lifestyles and to         engage more effectively in the public debates.
Conversely, he has taken         our insights back into the global community.'
