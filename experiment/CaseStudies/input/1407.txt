a) International Level     The reach and significance of Dooris' generic research on healthy       settings [2] is evidenced by his publications being cited on the WHO       Healthy Settings global web portal [A].
The Healthy Universities research       [1, 3, 4] was a catalyst to WHO reinvigorating its engagement with higher       education as a setting &#8212; and UCLan was acknowledged as key in the genesis       of Healthy Universities and being one of only two universities worldwide       to be linked from this portal [A].
Furthermore, Dooris is the European       Healthy Universities representative on a WHO Working Group on Implementing         Health 2020 and Strengthening Public Health through Improved         Collaboration and Synergy of Health Promotion Networks [Contact 1].
The generic settings [2] and criminal justice research [5, 6] in 2013       acted as a lever for the WHO Health in Prisons Project Steering Group to       prioritise international research into the whole system prison approach,       being undertaken by Baybutt and Dooris on behalf of its Collaborating       Centre.
The research [1-6] made a significant contribution to the decision of       IUHPE to adopt healthy settings as a priority theme and recognise       universities and prisons as important settings [Contact 1].
Dooris chaired       IUHPE's Global Working Group on Healthy Settings until 2011 and was a key       member of the Executive Scientific Committee for its 20th World       Conference in 2010, with lead responsibility for convening the conference       stream on healthy settings.
A meeting convened by Dooris at this       conference led to the establishment of a European Health Promoting       Universities Network www.eurohpu.aau.dk:       this has 15 member countries, with Dooris as the UK focal point.
Additionally, Dooris was the invited keynote speaker leading the healthy       settings stream at 2012 IUHP European Conference and a key note speaker on       healthy settings at the 2013 Nordic Health Promotion Research Conference,       the 2013 Danish Public Health Society Annual Conference and the 2013       Australian Health Promotion Association Annual Conference.
Baybutt was on       the planning group for the Healthy Settings sub-plenary at the 21st       World Health Promotion Conference in 2013 and the invited specialist       speaker on prisons, health and justice [Contact 1; Contact 2].
Dooris' work [2] underpins Section 4 of Ireland's 2011 Health Promotion       Strategic Framework [B], which explicitly draws on his conceptual research       &#8212; and the Irish Health Service Executive have commissioned Dooris' Healthy       Settings Unit to transfer the learning from their research through       developing and delivering a `train the trainers' course, extending the       impact into health promotion practice.
b) National Level     The Healthy Universities research [1, 3, 4] has made a significant       contribution to national strategy and guidance.
Building on a case study       of UCLan's work within the earlier `Choosing Health' publication, the       Government's 2010 public health strategy reinforced the importance of       universities as a setting for health &#8212; stating that "Healthy Schools,         Healthy Further Education and Healthy Universities programmes will         continue to be developed by their respective sectors, as voluntary         programmes, collaborating where appropriate and exploring partnership         working with business and voluntary bodies" [C].
The inclusion of       Healthy Universities was clearly influenced by the work of Dooris and       colleagues and represented a significant achievement in an era of       `stripped down' government, offering continued legitimacy to the growing       number of HEIs adopting this whole system model of working [Contact 2].
Dooris is also an expert adviser to the Welsh Government in the       development of its own Healthy and Sustainable FE and HE Framework, which       draws extensively on the work of Dooris and colleagues [1, 3, 4] [Contact       3].
Research by Dooris and Doherty [1, 3] has been recognised and cited by       bodies such as Universities UK, National Union of Students and the Royal       College of Psychiatrists &#8212; the latter stating in 2011 that "the         `Healthy Universities' systemic and holistic approach is commended and         should be adopted as widely as possible" [D].
Research by Baybutt and colleagues [McAllister et al, Stirling       University) examining the benefits of adopting a whole system approach to       regional tobacco control has strengthened the evidence base and thereby       contributed to national-level policy debate [5].
c) Institutional and Population Level     Perhaps most significantly, the research has had far-reaching influence       on institutional practice, impacting on population health and wellbeing &#8212;       through the implementation of the Healthy Prisons model by establishments       across the North West region [Contact 4; and through the adoption of the       Healthy Universities approach by a growing number of HEIs within the UK       and internationally [E; Contact 2].
The research on prison-based wellbeing (with a particular focus on       horticultural and environmental projects) [6] has highlighted the reach of       such work (3828 beneficiaries) and the value of such activity in       transforming individual offenders' lives [Contacts 4-5].
Furthermore, it       has demonstrated the importance of adopting a whole-system approach that       addresses wellbeing, reoffending, citizenship and social justice agendas &#8212;       thereby levering further Big Lottery and National Offender Management       Service funding for Healthy Prison implementation and evaluation by       Baybutt and Dooris within North West establishments, with current interest       in wider roll-out into North West probation and other community settings       and into prisons beyond the region [Contacts 4-5].
Evaluative research of       offender health trainer services has led to wider roll-out within the       North West and strengthened the case for further investment in the work.
Building directly on their research [1, 3], Dooris and Doherty (with       Powell at MMU) were in 2009 awarded &#163;200,000 from HEFCE for an       implementation project Developing Leadership and Governance for         Healthy Universities www.healthyuniversities.ac.uk.
This enabled previous [1-3] and concurrent [4] research findings to inform       developments &#8212; and specifically for: the UCLan- convened National Network       to be formalised and expanded, with membership increasing from 47 HEIs and       10 other stakeholder organisations in 2008 to 73 HEIs and 22 other       stakeholder organisations in 2013; a website and toolkit to be developed,       facilitating the translation of research into practice through offering       guidance packages, case studies and a self-review tool; and advocacy and       leadership for Healthy Universities to be strengthened through a       high-level Leadership Advisory Group jointly chaired by the Chief       Executives of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education and the Royal       Society for Public Health [E; Contact 2].
The reach of this work is       evidenced by the extensive use of the website (9,043 unique visitors from       125 countries since its launch in 2010); the request from the Welsh       Assembly and HEIs outside of England for UCLan to widen the Network's       remit from England to the UK [Contact 3]; increased demand for `associate'       membership of the Network by HEIs in countries outside of the UK (e.g.
Australia; Canada; Ireland; New Zealand); and requests for Dooris and       Doherty to act as advisers and to speak at Healthy University events (e.g.
Simon Fraser University, Canada; University of Sydney, Australia;       University of Calgary, Qatar; University of Extremedura, Spain).
