     We demonstrate impact from the two areas of research outlined above:       Policy and Practice interventions; and research with `hard to reach' young       people.
Policy and practice:     Our body of research into CSE informed the 2000 and 2009 Government       guidance noting that children selling sex were victims of abuse, and       promoting multi-agency work to link child protection and law enforcement       strategies to protect children [5.1].
Our two-year national review of 144       LSCB's implementation of the 2009 government guidance revealed that only       one quarter of LSCBs were protecting children and prosecuting abusers of       CSE.
This informed the `UK Action Plan Tackling Child Sexual exploitation'       (2011), which referred to our research evidence on 15 occasions [5.2].
We       acted as academic advisors for The UK Police Child Exploitation Online       Protection Service (CEOP) thematic assessment of police interventions to       protect children from CSE who used our research on five occasions to       evidence the need for multi-agency interventions and for staff training on       CSE [5.3].
A current review of LSCB and police responses to CSE undertaken       by the Office of the Children's Commissioner for England (OCC) Inquiry       into CSE in gangs and groups to be published in late 2013, shows the       impact of our work, with 68% of 97 LSCBs recording progression in       collecting data since 2011 using tools adapted from our research outputs.
Fifty-three percent have now established CSE sub-groups to oversee local       policy and practice following recommendations from our research [5.4,       5.9].
Our researchers are actively involved in influencing government responses       to protect children.
Pearce is a member and invited speaker to the       Government `Roundtable' implementing the UK Action Plan 2011 `Tackling       Child Sexual Exploitation'.
Attended by three government ministers, policy       leads of major children's charities and committed MPs from all parties,       this roundtable is implementing child protection policies to safeguard       children from sexual exploitation.
Pearce chairs the Eurochild Child       Participation Reference Group, incorporating marginalised children's'       voices into conference presentation and written materials, and is a member       of Eurochild Policy Steering group, working on each to specifically       challenge child sexual exploitation [5.5].
As result of the reach of this       work, practitioners and policy makers supported her successful bid for       funding from the Oak Foundation for the `Our Voices' Project: facilitating       children's involvement in policy to protect them from CSE.
Pearce's work       as rapporteur with the Council of Europe and with Eurochild has led to her       being an invited expert advising Bulgaria on safeguarding children       affected by sexual violence and exploitation throughout the process of       deinstitutionalisation from residential care.
The impact of the work on       advancing CSE as a core safeguarding issue for has been recognised through       the award of The 2013 Queens Anniversary Prize for applied research on       child sexual exploitation: noting the work to hold strategic national       importance, influencing UK policy and practice.
Pitts' studies of violent youth gangs in three London boroughs informed       the deliberations of Ian Duncan Smith's Centre for Social Justice `Working       party on youth gangs', facilitating the awareness of peer-on-peer violence       and sexual exploitation.
Pitts consulted for this group which was composed       of leading national experts in the fields of crime, justice, child and       adolescent social care and safeguarding care.
Its report, Dying to         Belong (2009), cited Pitts work 40 times and adopted his gang       definition [5.6].
This definition was subsequently adopted by the       Association of Chief Police Officers, the Metropolitan Police Service and       the government's national gang strategy, published in 2011 as `Ending         Gang and Youth Violence,' in which his work is cited 5 times       advocating the need for multi-agency responses to gang violence [5.7].
His       research also had an impact in the area of child and adolescent       safeguarding, and the London Children Safeguarding Board report (2009), Safeguarding         Children Affected by Gang Activity and/or Serious Youth Violence,       cites his work 15 times.
As rapporteur, Pitts advised the Prime Minister's       International Gangs Forum (Oct 2011) including William Bratton, the       high-profile American police chief.
Forum participants included       representatives from police departments and social welfare agencies from       all over Europe and North America.
Pitts is now a member of the expert       advisory group steering the UK national strategy `Preventing Gang       Violence'.
Finally, recognising the impact of our work, new developments arising       include:            Working with Oxford University on a new ESRC seminar series titled         `Fostering teenagers: challenges, theories and research'.
Developing the evaluation of new Child Sexual Exploitation Services         funded through the CSE Funders Alliance, for whom Pearce acts as         coordinator.
Pearce is managing the collaboration of over 23 major         trusts and funders who are promoting practice-based interventions to         prevent child sexual exploitation by funding 16 new CSE services from         2012-2015.
Research with hard to reach young people     Through externally funded participatory action research we have directly       engaged with over 800 marginalised and sexually exploited young people       from the UK.
This work has impacted on the confidence and self esteem of       the young people involved and has resulted in wider distribution of       child-appropriate messages, given in young people's voices about the       meaning and impact of sexual exploitation.
The work is distinctive as it       provides opportunity for exploited young people's voices to be heard.
For       example, four young people spoke at a Council of Europe conference in Rome       (2010) and two young people were selected from 8 volunteers to speak at a       Eurochild European conference of over 300 European policy leaders in Milan       (2013).
The work brings young people's own research agendas to the fore.
For example, we have, with our partner agencies, trained and supported       young people affected by child sexual exploitation to work with the `What       Works For Us' (WWFU) group.
They produced a WWFU Annual Report listing       topics that need research in the future [5.8].
This was distributed to 144       LSCBs and specialist CSE services.
The report documents their activities,       including advising mass media coverage of CSE through the BBC East Enders       CSE story line; directing the Police `Child Sexual Exploitation On Line       Protection Service' (CEOP) in youth sensitive policing; and advising The       Office of the Children's Commissioner for England OCC on the dissemination       of youth appropriate materials from their Inquiry into CSE in gangs and       groups, with the OCC recognising the impact of the University's work in       this field on their developing policy [5.9].
In our research with and for hard to reach young people we have       co-produced creative writing project outputs.
To create these outputs,       young people identify a problem; engage with other young people through       one-to-one interviews/ focus groups or workshop activities and document       findings in youth-friendly materials.
This impacts on improving the self       esteem of the young people concerned and on the reach of dissemination to       other young people and those who work with them.
This has included            Working with 53 sexually exploited young people to produce two         booklets that explain the impact of abuse caused through CSE (see www.beds.ac.uk/iasr/centres/intcent).
These booklets have been accessed by 46 specialist CSE projects with a         reach to over 2,000 young people with whom they work.
CSE funders         have also been influenced by viewing these materials: The CSE Funder's         Alliance has recognised the impact of participatory research activities         on both the young people participating and those who access the outputs.
The funder's alliance has, in recognition of this, opened requests for         funding for further peer research projects with the intention of         producing more similar outputs.
Working with The Association of Young People's Health (AYPH) to engage         with 10 young people under the `be healthy' project.
The young people         have produced a booklet and CD film about their use of support services         [5.10].
This was launched to an audience of 56 young people and is         widely disseminated to child health agencies and child sexual         exploitation services.
Its relevance to young people is demonstrated         through calls for reprinting of a further 3,000 copies of the booklet         with CD for distribution to CSE projects across England and through         Eurochild and The Council of Europe.
Reaching and engaging with 35 young people affected by sexual violence         to produce a high quality film which, prior to final production, has         already reached 55 gang-affected young people.
Following media training,         12 of these young people represented the group at the report launch at         The UK Government `Speaker's House' to an audience of Government         ministers, MPs and key policy makers.
