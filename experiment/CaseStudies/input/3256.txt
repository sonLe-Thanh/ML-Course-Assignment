     Creating and interpreting cultural capital to engage Nottinghamshire         audiences with their local history     The archival material used by Gaunt had not been researched or exhibited       before.
Its integration into the exhibition `W E Gladstone, The Grand Old       Man in Nottinghamshire' (11 December 2009-21 March 2010) thus represented       an opportunity to present this previously neglected element of local         heritage to Nottinghamshire audiences for the first time, and       through its digital legacy to conserve the material and ensure its wider       appreciation.
Gaunt's research and the archival sources upon which it is based, relate       specifically to Nottinghamshire.
The exhibition programme-part of a       regional series of events to mark Gladstone's bicentenary &#8212; was explicitly       intended to engage Nottinghamshire audiences.
At the Weston Gallery       (Nottingham), the material was presented through six exhibition cases and       exhibition boards (which reproduced approximately 50 items in facsimile) [5.1],       attracting 3,240 visitors during its first [three-month] run (compared to       average figures of just over 2,000 and thus representing a `pleasing'       success for the venue).
[5.2] Gaunt's research on the Newark       election songs [3.4] led to the retrieval, performance and digital       preservation of a song that otherwise would not have been heard by the       public and would have remained in the archive in manuscript form.
A local       singing group, Sempre, recorded the song (based on the original Manuscript       of the song book in Nottinghamshire Archives) which was subsequently       included in the exhibition, enriching the visitor experience.
[5.1]       Visitor feedback demonstrates how the exhibition changed public         understanding of Gladstone's early (neglected) political career and his         life in Nottinghamshire.
[5.3] Following on from a lunchtime       talk given by Gaunt, a reporter from the `BBC Politics Show' in the East       Midlands contacted him to contribute a feature on the research and the       exhibition (17 January 2010) demonstrating regional reach and interest in       the exhibition's accessible style, appeal, and its contemporary purchase.
Three free lunchtime talks at the Weston Gallery, delivered by Gaunt and       academic colleagues from Nottingham and the `History of Parliament'       research project proved so popular (audiences totalling 298) that they had       to be relocated from a small performance room in the Lakeside Arts Centre       to the much larger theatre space.
[5.2]     Through the Team Manager Archives &amp; Local Studies for       Nottinghamshire, Gaunt was able to mount a satellite version of the       exhibition between 20 November 2009 and February 2010 at Newark Library.
Integrated into the main body of the library, the exhibition benefited       from a daily footfall of between 555-570 visitors over the period.
The         much broader demographic of the local library audience (compared to the         museum audience) helped to make the material accessible to new audiences         who might otherwise not have engaged.
[5.4]     Through the use of digital resources, the impact of the research has         been extended by making the findings available to a wider community       online: the exhibition boards have been published as downloadable pdf       files and two exhibition films have been released on You-Tube.
[5.1]       As of 31 July 2013, the films had received 1,366 views and had generated       significant interest beyond the UK (in the US, Canada, India, Australia       and Germany), demonstrably extending the reach of the research beyond its       intended local audience.
Their continued popularity (downloads continuing       into 2013 rather than clustering round the time of the exhibition and       stopping) demonstrates an on-going engagement with the material.
[5.5]     Supporting the delivery of enriched curriculum content for school and         college students studying the Victorian period     The Lakeside Educational officer developed curriculum content to       complement core curriculum areas of citizenship and the Victorians.
This       was used in three workshops, delivered to a total of 75 year 6 pupils       (March 2010).
The workshops focused on role-playing different situations       represented in the exhibition such as the corn laws (fighting for free       food), elections (fighting for free choice) and slavery (fighting for       freedom).
Additionally, Gaunt spoke to 32 visiting A-Level students about       the exhibition and its themes (5 February 2010); feedback attested to the       role of the detailed knowledge presented and the opportunity to ask       questions in contributing richness to the curriculum.
[5.3]     Expanding the knowledge base and networks of local curators     Gaunt provided historical advice and context for the Town Hall       exhibition, enhancing the quality of the research base available to         the curator and ultimately contributing to the improved quality of the         visitor and tourist experience.
His use of the Newark Town Hall       museum's collections in his research [References 3.1-3.4], led to       Gaunt being invited to be historical consultant on the `Images of       Gladstone' exhibition mounted there (25 November 2009-6 February 2010) at       which he also gave the launch event key-note address.
Representatives of       the exhibitions worked together to develop a trail between the University       and the various places in Newark.
According to the curator of the Town       Hall Museum, this `was a really interesting and valuable project' [5.6],       with Gaunt's contribution providing `those extra links and I know more       about where I can go to find information as a curator.
It's useful to know       who are the people to contact and that working together helped in that       way.'
[5.6] Part of the legacy of Gaunt's work with the curator       lies in her continued access to an extended knowledge network which the       museum will continue to draw on in the future to consolidate the knowledge       base behind its exhibitions.
Contributing to engagement from new audiences and to a sense of         cultural ownership     An initiative to encourage local residents to engage with the exhibition       resulted ultimately in it reaching, according to the Curator, `people         that wouldn't normally come into a museum'.
Given the premium placed       on expanding the diversity of and increasing the volume of visitors       in the Museums sector, this constituted a particularly valuable outcome       for the museum.
Press coverage around the time of the exhibition       (broadcast, print and web [5.5]) and specifically an advertisement       placed by the Museum in the local press for Gladstone-related memorabilia       resulted in the temporary loan of many Gladstone bags and other artefacts       from Newark residents.
According to the Curator, those who loaned items       then visited the exhibition with `their spouses, children, grandchildren       [and] friends'.
As the curator notes, this made 'them feel that they         were putting down their own mark and contributing to Newark's heritage'.
She comments that even now (2013), people come in saying that they `had       heard that Gladstone was a Newark MP and wanted to know more about it',       demonstrating what she feels to be the continued legacy of the original       exhibition.
