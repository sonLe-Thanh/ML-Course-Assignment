     Impacts on eating habits of children and parents     Internationally, over half a million children from diverse social,       economic, and ethnic, backgrounds have taken part in Food Dudes since       2008, with full evaluation in 25%.
As in our proof-of-principle research       [3.2, 3.3, 3.4], the rollout Programme produced large and significant       increases in fruit and vegetable consumption [5.1, 5.2, 5.6, 5.7].
Effects       were even bigger in children who ate the least before the intervention,       showing that inequalities in children's diets were addressed [5.7].
Twelve months after the Programme in the Ireland study [3.4], parents       were still providing 93% more fruit and vegetables and children's       consumption had increased by 90%, relative to baseline, adding two       child-sized portions of fruit and vegetables to their daily diets.
Following this successful study, from October 2007 the Irish Government       began a 7-year Food Dudes rollout to their primary schools:       419,000 children have participated so far, and independent evaluations       report reliable increases in consumption following the Programme [5.1].
Impacts extend to the home.
Parents report that their children asked them       to buy more fruit and vegetables following the Programme; parents       also increased their own daily intake of fruit and vegetables [3.2, 3.3,       3.4, 5.6, 5.7].
A 20% decrease in children's consumption of       calorie-dense snacks was also reported in UK regional rollouts [5.6, 5.7],       and Italy trials [5.5].
Parents and teachers also reported this impact on       their own diets [5.6, 5.7].
Children with learning difficulties are particularly susceptible to poor       dietary habits and obesity.
In our 2012 Special Schools trial (N=248),       fruit and vegetable consumption increased and unhealthy snack consumption       decreased [5.6].
Rollouts of the Food Dudes programme     The Ireland national-rollout team serve as international ambassador and       mentor for the Programme.
In 2009/2010, Wolverhampton Primary Care Trust       and Italian researchers visited Irish schools to observe the Programme's       impact on children's fruit and vegetable consumption and to learn the       logistics of large-scale implementation &#8212; knowledge that was       shared with other UK commissioners [5.6, 5.7].
Recognising the potential impacts of increased fruit and vegetable       consumption at the population level, the UK fruit and vegetable industry,       including 7 major UK supermarkets, multinational companies [5.3], and       government agencies, have provided funding and on-going (2008-present)       support for the Programme.
The Food Dudes in England Collaborative Group was formed in 2008.
With       representatives from the Bangor Food and Activity Research Unit, the       School Food Trust, and the Horticultural Development Council, its       objective is to promote rollout of the Programme in England.
Our       researchers have presented the Programme's extensive evidence-base to       Industry and Government departments in many other European countries, and       in the US.
Companies in Ireland have accrued substantial economic benefits over the       roll-out duration.
Increases in turnover are: Real Events Solutions       [Programme delivery] = &#8364;6,366,648; Giraffe [Programme materials] =       &#8364;5,307,215; Pallas Foods [Fruit and Vegetable supply] = &#8364;7,181,614; Video       Company [Food Dudes DVDs] = &#8364;166,223; jobs created = 13 full-time and 40       part-time posts, maintained annually to deliver the rollout.
The Irish Government has spent &#8364;19.3 million on their Food Dudes       Programme, demonstrating a strong impact on national public policy and       services [5.1].
Extensive take-up by UK NHS Trusts and Local Authorities       (investments of &#163;1.9m, &#163;1m respectively) demonstrates a policy shift       towards behaviour change interventions, away from health education       approaches.
The UK Conservative Party Policy Green Paper, "A Healthier Nation",       highlights Food Dudes as "a good example of how many of the       characteristics of successful behaviour change programmes can be       incorporated in a single highly specific initiative" [5.9].
DEFRA's First       Report from the Council of Food Policy Advisors (2009; p13) recommends       that "If evaluation shows long term benefits, extend the `Food Dudes'       healthy eating programme for children".
Lowe and Horne were advisors in 2007 to the EU's &#8364;90 million European       School Fruit Scheme; Lowe subsequently became the current Deputy Chair of       the Scheme's Scientific Expert Panel.
The Scheme now promotes       take-up by Member States of recommended evidence-based interventions,       including the Food Dudes.
This provides an excellent opportunity to extend       the Programme throughout Europe.
Since 2008 the EU (DG AGRI and DG SANCO)       features Food Dudes within their healthy eating policy.
In 2012, responding to a rapid escalation in demand for the Programme,       Lowe and Horne &#8212; in partnership with Bangor University &#8212; established Food       Dudes Health Limited, a spinout company with a new corporate website.
In       doing so, 20 new jobs were created.
This Social Enterprise has developed       new Food Dudes programmes and, by attracting further research funding from       a variety of sources, scaled-up their delivery to improve children's       health and wellbeing globally.
Media and Awards     Food Dudes has attracted increasing media attention: ITV's Tonight       programme "Obesity the Time Bomb" (23/2/2012) received 30,000 more views       than their average (17% of the viewing population watched).
And a Guardian       article (9/8/2010) argues for Food Dudes in every UK school.
The Programme's health impacts have been recognized by 8 prestigious       awards, among them:       Social Marketing Showcase Award (2009), UK Chief Medical Officer's Gold       Medal Award (2010), Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis       (ABAI) Award for Translational Research (2012; 5.10), and Local       Authorities Research Intelligence Association (2013).
