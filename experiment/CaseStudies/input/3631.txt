     The Colonial Film project made visible and accessible crucial aspects of       the history of British       colonialism.
It facilitated public engagement with the visual records of       colonialism, and made them       available in a process of international exchange intended to be       diametrically opposed to the       exploitative exchange of colonialism.
In cataloguing films which were       previously inaccessible it       uncovered valuable forms of cultural and artistic capital in which facets       of world heritage are       preserved and commemorated.
The conservation of this significant resource       and its interpretation       (re-)connected audiences within and beyond the UK with that heritage.
In       particular, by illuminating       aspects of colonial history that are frequently occluded in contemporary       discourse, the research       allowed an interrogation both of Britain's colonial heritage and of a       shared global history.
The       project brought significant benefit to its non-academic partners: it       enhanced their cataloguing and       recording processes; supported development of new exhibitions and learning       resources; and       provided them with a model for future collaborations with academia.
The project's success in promoting global engagement with the visual         records of colonialism       is indicated by the large numbers of regular visitors to the website.
Between January 2012 (the       earliest date from which tracking data is available) and February 2013,       128,575 people visited the       site.
More precisely, 168,081 visits, with a total of 478,994 page views,       were made to the site from       across the world, with the top 9 countries being the UK, USA, Australia,       Canada, Malta, Israel,       India, France and Malaysia.
Website traffic averaged about 32,000 page       views per month [1].
The       website's significance to these visitors is apparent from emails to the       project: between its launch in       September 2010 and July 2013, the project received over 300 emails,       predominantly from users in       the UK and former British colonies, including Ghana, Malaysia, India,       Singapore and Nigeria.
While most are queries or simple expressions of appreciation, others       exemplify its profound       capacity to re-connect people with their family and national histories.
Thus an email from a man in       India, for example, explained that the project had allowed his family to       see, for the first time, a film       in which his father appeared as a young man in 1943.
He wrote: `It was, I       can tell you, a jolt to       suddenly see my father at an age when there were not even photographs of       him.
Strange too for       my mother!
In fact we asked someone to be with her when she got to see it,       in case it was       perturbing, but she took it in her stride.'
[2] In January 2009, the BFI       posted Springtime in an         English Village (1944), a film from the project corpus showing a       young African girl being crowned       May Queen in an English village, on their YouTube channel, where it has       since been viewed more       than 45,000 times.
One of those viewers was the subject's own daughter,       now living in Maryland,       USA; her identification of her mother in the film on YouTube led to the       restoration of contact       between the latter and people from the village in which she had spent time       as a young girl: the       extraordinary story was shared with the public via its coverage in the Observer       [3].
Although they       are unusual, these responses exemplify the website's capacity to support       remarkable transnational       and post-colonial exchange.
The project's capacity to reconnect the British public with its own         cultural heritage (through       our partner institutions in the cultural and museums sectors) was evident       at its launch in 2010,       which prompted substantial public engagement both with the films       themselves and with issues       relating to the truths they reveal about the British Empire.
To celebrate       the launch, a major public       film series took place at the National Film Theatre (NFT) in London.
Grieveson and the project       team assisted with the organisation of a commercial film season titled       `Film and the End of Empire'.
This season, which set nonfiction films from the combined catalogue       alongside better-known       fictional feature films about Empire such as Zulu and Windom's         Way, played in November 2011 to       a paying audience of 1,033 [5].
It was accompanied by a two-month long,       free exhibition of film       posters, programmes, and archival documents, staged in the NFT's public       gallery and accessible       to all who attended screenings between October 2011 and December 2011.
Both `Film and the       End of Empire' and the accompanying exhibition were covered in the press,       including in Sight &amp;         Sound, the UK's top film magazine (19k subscribers) [6].
A smaller -       but still substantial -       audience of some 280 people also attended a film programme developed by       UCL researchers and       the curatorial team (shown at the Imperial War Museum during the first two       weeks of July 2010       [4]), and a Tate Modern event entitled `Out of the Archive: Artists,       Images, History', which was       shown in November 2011 and included screenings and panel discussions       amongst scholars and       artists about the use and place of film in historical research.
Grieveson       also curated a public film       screening at the prestigious &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure, Lyon, in November       2011, and answered       questions after the screening from the audience.
In addition to providing public access to a catalogue of previously       little-seen evidence of Britain's       colonial past, the project has also provided an invaluable new         resource for use by heritage,         cultural, and museums-sector professionals.
Its collation of over       6,000 films has preserved,       catalogued and contextualised more than one hundred years of filmmaking       practice, enabling       archivists and film curators at participating collections and other       external organisations (such as       the Palestinian Film Foundation) to access and present this important -       yet long overlooked &#8212; part       of British and world history.
The website received widespread acclaim       amongst such professionals:       it was a Finalist in the Focal Learning on Screen Awards in 2011; was       praised by the British       Library's Lead Curator of Moving Images, Luke McKernan, as a valuable       resource for silent film [8];       and ranked 1st in the Film Studies for Free annual list of Online Film and       Moving Image Resources       [9].
The archive has also inspired artistic production: it was       used as a resource by the video       artist Filipa C&#233;sar, whose collage short Black Balance reflects on the       language of these films and       was shown at the Tate Modern (November 2011) and in London, Hyderabad and       Pittsburgh during       Colonial Film symposia.
The participating archives, at the BFI, Imperial War Museum and, until       its demise the       Commonwealth Museum, also benefited from the research.
The project       preserved fragile celluloid       film through digitisation, saving significant but under-valued and       under-studied films from       deterioration or indeed loss.
The BFI in particular noted that its records       and cataloguing had been       improved, as researchers brought records to a high standard, and even       corrected errors directly       into the BFI's own database [10].
Archivists identified three additional       ways in which the project       impacted positively upon their collections and work:     A) Bringing new traffic to their websites and new interest in their         collections from both       researchers and the public.
According to a senior archivist at the       Imperial War Museum: `From the       moment of its launch the new site attracted a more numerous and diverse       range of researchers       than the IWM's own film catalogue was then capable of attracting,' and       called it the most important       means of popularising the museum's collections internationally since the       Thames Television World         at War documentary series in 1974.
[7]     B) Providing a model for future collaboration between the archives         and academic         institutions.
The IWM, for example, modelled its inclusion of a       database of film materials used in a       project exploring the inter-war experiences of empire on the Colonial Film       archive [7].
C) The use of academic contextualisation provided by the research team to       bring new meaning         to film texts languishing, untouched, in archives.
The IWM reported       that contextual and analysis       pieces produced during the project were vital resources in themselves, and       models of how it could       `enhance popular understanding of other parts of its collections' in       future projects [7].
Its       Department of Research produced similar contextual essays, launched in       February 2013, to       accompany a research project on digitised films of World War I [11].
The       catalogue and contextual       information produced during the project likewise enabled the BFI to         make far fuller use of their         holdings.
As with Springtime in an English Village, the BFI       included several films uncovered and       digitised by the research team on their YouTube channel, facilitating       global public engagement with       this unique material and the archive as a whole.
From July 2010 to July       2013, videos in the `India,       Pakistan, Tibet' playlist were viewed over 499,000 times [12], and films       uncovered through the       project have been included in the BFI's Mediatheque-curated collections on       India and Colonial       Africa (the collection `Cape to Cairo: Moving Images of Colonial Africa`       [10]), freely available to       viewers at six locations around the UK.
Films uncovered during the research have also been used by other cultural       organisations,       including the Egyptian film collective Mosireen, and the Palestinian Film       Foundation, whose annual       film festival at the Barbican in April 2012 drew on project resources       (several films from the archive       were shown) and expertise (a former postdoctoral researcher introduced the       films) in a special       programme on British Colonial Films in Palestine.
The interest this raised       is apparent in the sudden       spike in hits to the Colonial Film website around the time of the annual       festival.

Furthermore,       the project's work led to new international partnerships, including on a       collaborative project with the       Universities of Hyderabad and Pittsburgh exploring cinema and economy, led       by Grieveson and       funded by the British Council [see section 3, above].
