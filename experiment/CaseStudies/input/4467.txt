     Dissemination of the research findings and the approach have largely been       achieved through       publication of a training manual and field guide (see reference 2 above),       invited talks, personal       contacts and invited presentations at international conferences including:       international workshop in       Senegal in December 2012 (Scaling Up Climate Services for Farmers in       Africa and south Asia)       organised and funded by WMO, CCAFS and USAID; international meeting of       national       meteorological staff across Africa (Nairobi, April 2013) funded by WMO;       and international       workshop organised by CCAFS on provision of climate information to farmers       through       intermediaries (Nairobi, June 2013).
These, together with the current       international focus on seeking       ways to support smallholder farmers to deal with climate variability and       change, led to requests for       training and support and for further information, which in turn have       influenced policies and       practices of organisations.
Examples of requests include those from IFAD       who are developing       major national agricultural programmes in several countries, Malawi       (National Director of       Meteorological services), Tanzania (National Director of Agri Met       Services) and Ethiopia (National       Director of Agric.
Met.
services) who requested support with developing       information services using       the Reading approach, and international NGOs such as CARE and Oxfam.
USAID       invited and       funded Reading to develop a proposal to plan scaling up provision of       climate information services       to smallholders in six countries in East and West Africa.
Direct training in the approach has been provided across countries.
In       Zimbabwe, 224 extension       staff were intensively trained in the initial phase, followed by a further       1,023 staff [1].
The       Rockefeller Foundation funded training by Reading of 24 key staff from       NGOs and Met services       from Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia [2].
Seven National Farmer Organisations       (FOs)s from Niger,       Mali, Burkina Faso and Senegal received training from Reading in December       2012 (funded by the       Mcknight Foundation and CCAFS) [3].
These FOs represent tens of thousands       of farmers in their       countries.
The World Meteorological Organisation has also endorsed the       approach and is       promoting scaling up of training across Africa through funding the       development and delivery of a       new e-learning course by University of Reading (currently being taken up       by over 200 participants       from 5 countries in Africa).
In Zimbabwe during 2012-13, the national agricultural advisory service       (Agritex) reported that       6,168 farmers had benefited from the approach [1].
A sample of 58 farmers       gave a mean score of       4.6 for usefulness of the approach (using scale of 1-5 with 1=no use,       5=extremely useful) and the       end of project final report documents farmers changing to practices that       better suit local climate       and weather as a direct result of using the approach, including farmers       demanding and obtaining       seeds of particular varieties for their location and adopting conservation       agriculture practices (see       reference 4 in section 3 above).
The dissemination and training have directly resulted in a range of NGOs       and national       organisations adopting the approach.
These include Oxfam, Farm Africa,       Practical Action and       World Vision who have incorporated the approach into their training       materials and work [4].
For example, Farm Africa reported that farmers who had been involved in       Kenya "by the end of the         training were more knowledgeable and could relate the rainfall patterns         to their environment and         also make informed decisions especially on choice of crop varieties ,         when to plant and how to         conserve water through the type of farming/land preparation methods they         use" [4] and Practical       Action that "both farmers and extension staff [in Zimbabwe] have         recognised the positive impact of         the project in assisting them to choose coping and adaptation strategies         which enhance crop         production and livelihood security" [7].
The research has had impact       on NGOs policies and foci       across countries they work in.
For example, Practical Action report that "the         success of the above         approach and project, along with other Practical Action interventions         has influenced Practical         Action in making the collation and dissemination of weather and climate         information a key         component of our work in promoting climate resilient agriculture"       [7].At a broader scale major       international organisations have adopted the approach and it is       influencing their policies.
The       global programme of Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)       is the main       international organisation working to improve climate services to       agriculture in developing       countries.
For example, Reading's work has led to CCAFS placing much       greater emphasis on the       use of analysed historical information and participatory planning and       CCAFS have incorporated the       approach into their plans for climate service provision "...to lead to         better targeted upscaling of         climate services for millions of farmers across Africa and south Asia       ..."[5].
In addition, CCAFS       notes that the Reading research has "led to the successful development         of an `approach'..... to         develop, tailor, deliver, communicate and evaluate relevant climate and         weather information for         smallholders in ways that facilitate farmers to use it to improve         decision making, agriculture and         livelihoods.
"[5]     IFAD, a Specialized United Nations Agency present in more than 90       countries, commissioned       Dorward and Stern to conduct assessments and prepare plans to "outscale         the approaches         developed in Zimbabwe throughout its emerging programme in the region"       which includes Uganda,       Kenya, Malawi, Lesotho, Tanzania, Madagascar [6].
Climate and weather information provided through the approach developed       by Reading research       has changed the activities of and approaches used by major international,       government and non-government       organisations working to improve agriculture and reduce poverty in       Sub-Saharan       Africa and south Asia and helped thousands of smallholders to improve       their decisions and       livelihoods.
