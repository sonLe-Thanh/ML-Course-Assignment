     Since July 2011, our stochastic infectious disease simulator has been       installed on computers at       Cefas, with a user-friendly interface.
Since then, Cefas have used this       simulator to model potential       epidemics in the aquaculture industry of England and Wales, and develop       contingency planning to       control them.
By using simulations of infectious disease outbreaks, Cefas have gained a       much better       understanding of the dynamics of such diseases in the aquaculture system       and are able to       determine the efficacy of potential control strategies.
This very detailed       quantitative analysis was       not previously available to them and has had an impact on their practice       by significantly increasing       their analytic capacity and capability.
Our collaborators at Cefas       state[5.1]: "This research has         enabled us to better understand the potential impact of exotic disease         introduction to the salmonid         aquaculture industry in England and Wales."
and: "The information         obtained provides support for         our methods of control and, in conjunction with other qualitative and         quantitative inputs, provides         evidence to underpin contingency plans for combatting infectious         diseases in the UK.
The         simulator is currently being used in further development of contingency         planning contributing to the         drafting of disease-specific annexes which inform government policy on         the control of infectious         diseases in the aquaculture industry."
Indeed, a primary extension of analytic capacity available to Cefas       provided by the simulator lies in       its ability to study specific infectious diseases.
Cefas say that "This         (the simulator) has significantly         impacted on our capacity to tailor our analysis towards specific         diseases as opposed to more         generic measures of control.
Our use of the simulator has so far focused         on the infectious diseases         that are likely to cause the most damaging outbreaks in the UK including         IHN, VHS and Gs."
Another key advantage brought by the simulator is a much greater degree       of confidence in       understanding the dynamics of the system than can be gained from a       qualitative analysis alone.
Cefas say that "By unifying all of the major routes of transmission         into a single assimilated model,         we have a better understanding of the scenarios we would face given an         outbreak.
The level of         detail incorporated within the model has also increased our confidence         in measures to control         infectious diseases in the aquaculture industry. "
Combining the complexities of several modes of transmission together with       the impact of       interventions was not previously possible in a quantitative way.
Increased       understanding of the       pattern of spread is also vital, as well as highlighting the most       important generic aspects for       targeting which are found to be time to detection, laboratory testing       capacity during an outbreak,       delays in implementing control measures on infected sites and the time       until fish-farm restocking       should be allowed.
Another major impact is the increase in capability for Cefas to       investigate different control       strategies including proactive and reactive strategies.
This is       particularly important as many fish       diseases can spread without obvious symptoms, complicating control       efforts.
The cost of an outbreak of a notifiable infectious disease becoming       endemic is potentially millions       of pounds per year (see section 2, first paragraph), and so the impact of       any percentage increase       in the chance of successfully controlling outbreaks can measured on this       scale.
Reducing the       impact of these notifiable diseases is central to the viability of many       aquaculture businesses in a       global market environment, with some diseases inevitably leading to       unsustainable losses for fish       farmers.
Additionally it should be noted that the export market to any       country which does not have       these notifiable diseases will immediately disappear until the infectious       disease is demonstrably no       longer present.
