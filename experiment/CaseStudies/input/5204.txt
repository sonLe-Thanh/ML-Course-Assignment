     The ICR has made a major impact on the international search for       inhibitors of PKB, a key signalling enzyme and a target for the       development of cancer therapeutics.
This research has enabled a number of       pharmaceutical companies to advance their research programmes for the       development and commercialisation of novel drugs: currently, seven novel       PKB inhibitors are in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), two of which       are from the joint ICR and Astex PKB drug discovery programme.
Impacts on health     Two distinct drugs discovered by ICR and Astex are progressing           through clinical trials in the UK and overseas; patients are           benefiting by participating in these trials.
The ICR has discovered two series of PKB inhibitors in a collaborative       research programme with Astex.
As a result, one series was licensed in a       commercial agreement with AstraZeneca and the lead drug, AZD5363, is       currently undergoing clinical trials at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation       Trust (RM), The Christie (Manchester), the NKI (Netherlands) and in Japan,       involving a total of over 400 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:       NCT01226316, NCT01353781, NCT01625286, NCT01692262, NCT01895946) [1].
The       ICR has led on the first trial of AZD5363 and Dr Udai Banerji (ICR       Faculty) gave an oral presentation at AACR 2013 summarising its exciting       potential in the clinic in selected patients.
Results of the first phase I       clinical trial of AZD5363 have reported both partial responses and stable       disease in patients harbouring mutations in PIK3CA or AKT1.
This therefore       identifies these mutations as potential predictive biomarkers of response       for AZD5363.
The lead compound of the second series, AT13148, which is       being developed by Astex, has different properties and could be useful in       a distinct patient group.
This drug is also in clinical trial at RM,       enrolling 40 patients with advanced solid tumours (ClinicalTrials.gov       Identifier: NCT01585701) [2].
Impacts on commerce     The international PKB drug discovery effort has been facilitated by           ICR's work to solve the crystal structure.
The ICR solved the PKB crystal structure and published this work       (Research Refs 1 and 2 above) and in total, over 30 international       commercial companies, including many major pharmaceutical companies, have       cited the influence of these publications in their own publications (17       commercial companies have cited Ref 2 since 1 January 2008).
This shows       that this work had an important impact on their in-house research       investment and endeavour (data from Web of Science).
For example, since       2008 GSK has made major investment into developing PKB inhibitors as novel       therapeutics.
Its lead product, GSK2110183, progressed into Phase II       clinical trials in 2009.
GSK cited Reference 2 in their       publications [3, 4].
Two distinct drugs discovered by ICR and Astex are being           commercially developed     The drugs AZD5363 and AT13148, derived from chemical series discovered by       ICR and Astex, are being developed by AstraZeneca and Astex, respectively.
Both are in clinical trial.
This has a commercial benefit to both these       companies by adding to their development pipeline and therefore increasing       shareholder value.
Industry is investing in pre-clinical research and clinical           research to develop PKB inhibitors in the UK (including at ICR and RM)           and overseas.
AstraZeneca and Astex are investing in the clinical research of AZD5363       and AT13148 respectively by conducting clinical trials.
These drugs are       based on the chemical series discovered by the ICR.
Companies such as GSK       that have cited ICR's underpinning research are investing in clinical       research worldwide (ClinicalTrials.gov lists several GSK2110183 clinical       trials, for example NCT01428492, NCT01531894, NCT01532700 and NCT01653912)       and seven novel PKB inhibitors are now being developed.
