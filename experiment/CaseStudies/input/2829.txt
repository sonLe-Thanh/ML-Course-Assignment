     In the UK, there are currently 7.2 million young people aged 18-25,       representing 12% of the population.
Among the 16-24 age group, 1.09       million are currently not in education, employment or training (NEET).
Around half experience complex, non-linear transitions in their pathway to       employment.
The economic and social impact of young people in these       situations is becoming increasingly visible in the UK and worldwide.
At one time labour market dynamics were understood simply in terms of a       dichotomy between employment and unemployment and framed in policy terms       by an emphasis on activation measures that aimed to move people quickly       into jobs.
Over the past decade, University of Glasgow research has       contributed to increasing awareness among policy-makers of the limitations       of such activation programmes and the complexity of young people's       pathways into and within the labour market.
Furlong has helped to       highlight (in international fora) the limitations of policies that focus       on the NEET group, has drawn attention to those people churned between a       series of poor-quality and insecure jobs and shown how non-linear pathways       from education to work increase long-term vulnerability among all groups       of young people (from early leavers to graduates).
His research has also       led to the recognition that acute social withdrawal among young people can       be a consequence of negative labour market experiences.
Furlong's work has contributed to policy debate and influenced policy       change and service provision by agencies supporting young people in a       number of countries.
Specifically, the Glasgow research has:             Contributed to recognition of the limitations of a focus on the           NEET group and highlighted the extent to which such an approach risks           neglecting the needs of other vulnerable groups.
Furlong was         invited to act as an expert adviser to a 2011-12 EUROFOUND (a tripartite         EU Agency, providing knowledge for social and work-related policies)         project on NEETs in Europe.
At the request of the project leader, he         helped the team understand the implications of his own work for European         policy, specifically promoting a broad focus which included those who         were not NEET but who nevertheless occupied vulnerable positions in the         labour market while also advising on the problems of NEET as a category.
He was asked to attend four meetings, and to produce and present at each         a briefing paper on an aspect of the work as well as providing general         advice and criticism.
The Research Manager, Employment and Change, for         EUROFOUND stated:         Given all the work Professor Furlong [has] carried out in the field of         youth and his expertise on NEET, it was a great pleasure for me when he         accepted to be part of our network of experts and his contribution was         essential for the success of the project...
The direct impact of the         participation of Prof. Furlong in our project ranged from reviewing and         providing feedback and guidance to our research to contributing directly         to our report and illustrating new dimensions and problematic[s] of         using the concept of NEETs for policymaking.
Moreover, his previous publications in the field have been the starting       point of our desk research and literature review....As [a] main outcome of       the project, the report "NEETs &#8212; Young people Not in Employment,       Characteristics, Costs and policy responses" was published in October       2012.
...[T]his report is the most successful publication of Eurofound       since its foundation in 1975.
The report had a huge media and policy       impact.
The day of publication 330 newspapers in the world reported the       main messages of the research.
Most importantly, the report shaped the       European policy debate...the report contributed to explain[ing] the       concept of NEETs to millions of European citizens and, especially, to       European policymakers.
The contribution of Andy Furlong in achieving this       result was essential.
There is also strong policy interest in the NEET group and in young       people in precarious forms of employment in Japan (where the       classification of NEET extends from 16-34 years of age).
Professor Furlong       has had several pieces of work published in Japanese to meet this interest       (e.g.
a translation of Young People and Social Change published by       Otsuki Shoten, Tokyo in 2009), has been invited to present to the Japanese       Ministry of Labour's Institute for Labour Policy and Training (which       advises on policy planning and implementation) and the Institute for       Labour Policy and Training published his report to the Ministry of Labour.
From 2008-12 Furlong served as advisor to the Japanese Youth Cohort       survey, which is funded by the Japanese Department of Education and       Skills.
The survey team adopted key aspects of the approach Furlong had       developed for the Scottish government report on transitions.
He received a       'Furusato Award' from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in       2010 (the country's main research council) for 'excellent achievements       towards Japan-UK academic collaboration'.
Highlighted the growth of precarious work forms among young people           in influential world forums.
Comparative work between the UK and         Australia and the UK and Japan was used as the basis for a briefing         paper commissioned by the International Trade Union Confederation to         inform the response of the international labour movement to the G20         summit in Mexico in 2012.
The briefing was entitled 'Unemployment and         precarious work among young people' and aimed to draw attention to young         people in precarious forms of work who can be overlooked by         policymakers' focus on unemployment/NEET.
Raised public awareness of the psycho-social consequences of new           forms of working among young people in Japan where precarious         employment is much more common than in Europe.
Acute social withdrawal         (the hikikomori phenomenon) has traditionally been treated as a         psychological problem.
Glasgow research found that acute social         withdrawal was actually a sociological issue linked to labour market,         family and education structures in Japan.
Furlong suggested that changes         taking place in Europe could trigger similar outcomes there.
These         claims stimulated significant public debate, primarily through         widespread media coverage.
On 14 May 2008, he discussed the issue on         Laurie Taylor's BBC show, Thinking           Allowed, triggering email exchanges from concerned parents and         journalists.
More recently the findings were covered in a BBC           Magazine feature (5 July 2013) which received more hits than any         other on the day of publication, triggering numerous email exchanges         from parents and journalists in countries as far away as Columbia &#8212; plus         an exchange from a senior member of the UK Cabinet Office.
