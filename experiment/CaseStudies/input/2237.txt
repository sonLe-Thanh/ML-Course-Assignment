     In the 1990s, it was commonplace to see statements such as `[the] rodents         did not experience pain' or `rodents and rabbits show no signs of         pain and so require no analgesics' in scientific publications.
However, the Newcastle research has had a significant impact in changing       such attitudes.
This has led to worldwide changes in a range of policy       statements, practice guides, institutional policies (academic and       industrial) and individual research worker practices, with guidance on the       use of animal analgesics within the UK being enforced by the Home Office.
These changes relate to which analgesics are given and the dosing of these       products as well as the assessment of pain via behavioural observations.
The change in practice has clear benefits for animal welfare; ensuring       that animals used in research suffer the minimum of pain and distress,       which, in turn, also benefits scientific research, since pain is otherwise       an uncontrolled variable which can adversely affect study results.
The findings of the research at Newcastle were summarised and       disseminated to a wider audience via a website, workshops, conferences, a       text book, book chapters, review articles and a Dutch television       documentary.
The website was set up with the aim of `...providing       practical guidance in recognising signs of health and good welfare and to       help users of the site to become better able to identify signs of pain,       distress and poor welfare in laboratory animals' (www.ahwla.org.uk).
UK policy and practice       In the UK animal research which may cause pain, suffering, distress or       lasting harm is regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act       1986.
In England, Scotland and Wales, this Act is implemented by the Home       Office.
According to their statistics there were around 15,000 personal       licences in force in the UK at the end of 2012 [EV a, p.23] and 4.11       million scientific procedures were started, with just over 3 million of       these carried out on rodents [EV a, p.12].
The Home Office is required by       the Act to thoroughly assess every research project involving an animal       before granting a research licence and it is clearly stated in the licence       conditions that `The licence holder must use analgesia or another         appropriate method to ensure that the pain, suffering and distress         caused by regulated procedures are kept to a minimum' (Home Office:       Draft guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures)         Act 1986, updated Jan 2013, p.95).
The Home Office also carry out       regular inspections to ensure that all animal research is in accordance       with licence conditions and, as testified by the Head of the Animals in       Science Research Unit (ASRU) at the Home Office, their inspectors `...frequently         make use of [the Newcastle findings] when evaluating research         procedures in rodents that require assessment and alleviation of         post-surgical pain' [EV b].
In addition, ASRU `...frequently         recommend research workers to refer to [the Newcastle findings] when         formulating their post-operative care regimens' and `...regularly         facilitate direct contact between research workers and [the] group         at Newcastle whenever specialist advice on analgesia is required'       [EV b].
In 2012, 1.16 million research animals required anaesthesia during       a procedure [EV a].
Flecknell makes a conservative estimate, based on his       experience in the UK that at least 70% of these would require       post-operative analgesics.
The UK Joint Working Group on Refinement publish reports that       provide practical guidance on setting up and operating effective protocols       for assessing the welfare of animals used in research and testing.
Their       report published in 2011 cites Roughan and Flecknell (2001) when stressing       the importance of observing animals' behaviours in order to assess       potential pain levels [EV c].
They specifically state that it is necessary       to observe each individual animal post procedure `...for at least 5 min         to ensure that [any potential pain related behaviours] are         detected' [EV c; citing R3, Section 3].
International policy and practice       In the 2011 US National Research Council of the Academy of Science         Report (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research), the underpinning       Newcastle research is referenced (R1, R4 &amp; R5, Section 3) in       conjunction with the statement that `...fundamental to the relief of         pain in animals is the ability to recognize its clinical signs in         specific species' [EV d, p.120].
This report informed revisions to Pain         and Distress in Laboratory Animals guidelines, produced by The         Animal Research Advisory Committee [EV e], which now clearly state       that `Preemptive measures should be taken to minimize or prevent the         development of pain and/or distress', and that analgesic agents `...can         have a positive effect on the speed with which animals return to normal         behavior' [EV e, p.3; citing R3 &amp; R4 from Section 3].
These       guidelines form part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)       policy and thus must be adhered to by all who are funded by NIH.
NIH funds       research at over 2,500 institutions and is the largest single source of       funding for medical research.
Thus, NIH policies impact significantly on       animal research worldwide.
UFAW (Universities Federation of Animal Welfare) is       internationally recognised as having led the way in improving, and       promoting high standards of animal welfare, and their Handbook on the Care       and Management of Laboratory and Other Research Animals serves to inform       and guide practice.
Their most recent edition (2010) extensively cites the       Newcastle research in relation to the assessment of pain and welfare.
The       behaviour-based assessment developed at Newcastle and their researcher       training system is suggested as an aid for researchers to `...identify         and score pain more accurately and reliably' [EV f, p.86].
In 2008, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council       published their Guidelines to Promote the Wellbeing of Animals used         for Scientific Purposes and in a chapter concentrating on assessing,       minimising and monitoring pain they cite the Newcastle work (R3 Section 3)       when highlighting the importance of being aware that in many species `...signs         of pain or distress may be transient and interspersed with normal         behaviour' [EV g, p.30].
Education and training       The work at Newcastle has led to a major change in practice across the       world, not only through implementation of guidelines but also a widespread       use of the resulting educational materials in training courses.
The       website AHWLA (Assessing the Health and Welfare of Laboratory         Animals) was set up (with support from the Swiss 3R Research         Foundation) to provide practical guidance in recognising signs of       health and good welfare and to help users of the site to become better       able to identify signs of pain, distress and poor welfare in laboratory       animals (www.ahwla.org.uk).
In the       period January 2008- July 2013, the website had over 70,000 unique       visitors, and 900 copies of the CD `Pain Assessment in the Rat'       have been distributed worldwide.
The CD is recommended as an educational       resource for behaviour-based pain scoring in the Australian Guidelines to       Promote the Wellbeing of Animals used for Scientific Purposes [EV g].
A       senior clinical veterinarian and associate director of the Laboratory       Animal Resource Centre at the University of California, San Francisco has       delivered training courses for veterinarians and scientists across America       and Brazil [EV h].
He certifies that:     `The training videos are directly valuable in helping students and         veterinarians identify particular pain behaviors they can monitor in         laboratory animals, as well as supporting and stimulating discussion of         the ethical and regulatory commitment to seriously address laboratory         animal pain management' [EV h].
These materials have also been used in obligatory courses for biologists       and veterinarians performing animal experiments, run by Animalfree       Research in Switzerland [EV i], and in the Netherlands [EV j].
