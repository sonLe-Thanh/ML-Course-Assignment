     Improving Policing and Child Protection Practices     The research has impacted on CEOP, as well as police in undercover       operations, and has had an impact through expert training regarding child       protection practices with respect to online grooming.
Martellozzo's research with Davidson has had a significant impact on the       structure, content and delivery of the Think U Know Internet Safety       Programme.
Most of the recommendations have been implemented and       influenced the thinking and development of their programme and enhanced       peer involvement in development.
The findings have been used as a base       line indicator in the CEOP 2010/11 performance indicators (5.1), the       National Audit Office memorandum `Staying Safe Online' (2010) (5.2) and       child internet strategy developed by the Kingdom of Bahrain (5.3).
Martellozzo's investigation of how children from different cultural       backgrounds behave online has influenced the work of undercover officers       when they develop profiles of children from different backgrounds and pose       as vulnerable children online, as reported in the Guardian and on Channel       4 (http://tinyurl.com/c4myz88 and       http://www.channel4.com/news/eu-improve-moderation-or-we-will-shut-you-down).
This       research and engagement with undercover police officers led directly to       the arrest of suspects who had interacted online with undercover police       posing as online children.
`Her research became an increasingly integral       part of the development of law, procedure and investigative practices in       the Paedophile Unit.
The development of on-line investigative practices       are now at the cutting edge of such covert work worldwide' (5.4).
A       specific partnership in 2011/12 with the Child Abuse Command's       occupational psychologist also produced a formal training programme for       online covert investigators in both tactics and support for their       wellbeing.
`Overall, the relationship was a model of mutually beneficial       collaboration between front line and strategic policing priorities and       academia' (5.4)     Informing public debate on pornography, healthy relationships and sex         educationHorvath's research on `lads mags' has been used as key       evidence in the successful `Lose the Lads Mags' campaign [http://www.losetheladsmags.org.uk/]       and was picked up in the USA where it was trended on Jezebel, one       of the biggest women's interest blogs.
An article based on the research       was the most read one of 2011 and was shared over 97,000 times (http://jezebel.com/5866602/can-you-tell-the-difference-between-a-mens-magazine-and-a-rapist).
A       subsequent story appeared on ABC news (http://tinyurl.com/89kxups).
Horvath et al's, research for the Office of the Children's Commissioner       (OCC), Porn is Everywhere, has informed practice and influenced       policy on children's exposure to and uses of pornography, as evidenced by       the statements made by the Children's Commissioner (http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/Schools/health-and-education/departments/psychology/fps/testimonials.aspx).
The       work provided, for the first time, incontrovertible evidence that viewing       pornography affects the behaviour of young people (5.5).
The report was published at an opportune time: it captured the public       interest following high profile child abuse cases and public anxiety about       the online safety of children (Bringing up Britain: Parenting and         Pornography, 3 April 2013, http://tinyurl.com/qeh6akr).
It received widespread media coverage and was cited in a number of       parliamentary debates and discussions.
It has also been cited by a range       of statutory, including CEOP (5.6), and non-statutory organisations,       politicians, and NGOs as evidence for changes in sex education and       internet service provision (http://www.brook.org.uk/index.php/what-s-new/latest-news?view=article&amp;id=126).
The report generated numerous supportive statements by organisations such       as the Sexual Education Forum, which welcomed the call to boost       sex education; Netmums which called the report a `wake-up call' http://tinyurl.com/phwhatm; and End         Violence Against Women Coalition (5.7) and Rape Crisis.
They       argued that the report provided evidence for schools to teach pupils about       sexual consent and how to deal with pornographic imagery, which were       reported on the BBC (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22643072).
Other beneficiaries include providers and users of social media.
Facebook       requested a meeting with Horvath and the OCC to explore what changes they       could make to their policies and procedures; the independent co-regulator       for the editorial content of UK video on demand services (the Authority       for Television on Demand) requested a meeting with Horvath and the OCC to       garner advice about how the findings could influence and support their       work.
Playwrights with the Royal Court Theatre invited the team to       participate in a playwrights' workshop.
From Fact to Fiction, a programme       that publicises a key news story of the week in a dramatised response to       it, set the play `Into the Woods' entirely around an incident in which a       young person inadvertently viewed his father's hardcore pornography.
Several premises within the play were directly drawn from the team's       findings ().
The report received extensive national and international media coverage       and was the basis of an edition of BBC Radio 4 programmes Call You and         Yours, (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01sm70r)       and Analysis (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02ykg3m).
This media coverage led to widespread secondary reach including an array       of petitions and campaigns.
For example the Daily Telegraph's Wonder Women       campaign for better relationship and sex education mirrors almost exactly       what we recommended in the report.
Impact on Government Policy          Porn is everywhere also had a significant impact on government       policy.
The Government moved quickly to address many of its       recommendations       (http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/content/press_release/content_511),       including making it harder to access online pornography and revisiting the       Personal, Social and Health Education teaching curriculum (5.6).
The       report generated questions and speeches in the House of Commons and the       House of Lords (Baroness Howe of Idlicote; Diana Johnson, MP) and the       report's key recommendations regarding search engines were picked up by       the Prime Minister David Cameron (22 July 2013) who insisted that internet       service providers tighten protections on search engines (http://tinyurl.com/loggqds).
Cameron's statements were further developed by MP Claire Perry - the Prime       Minister's Adviser on Preventing the Commercialisation and Sexualisation       of Childhood - who cited directly from the report in an article in the       Telegraph (5.8) and set out the government's commitment to work with       internet providers to deliver a national online safety campaign and to       close existing regulatory loopholes (http://tinyurl.com/o46qjgp).
