     Thurston's research as both critic and practitioner in the context of       innovative poetry and the UK small press scene has developed a focus on       the relationship between innovative form, publication,       professionalisation, performance and audience engagement.
The impact of       this research is as follows:            The research has informed a practice methodology which has directly         influenced the creative choices of new professional writers.
It has         enabled them to: place their work in an alternative context and to         participate in a lively literary scene; to publish their work in         magazines, chapbooks and anthologies; to start their own publishing         initiatives; and to participate in the live context for literature         established by Thurston's research practice by performing their work and         setting up events.
The success of a number of these ventures has         developed the profile of alternative literary practice and brought it to         wider national attention in the context of publishing and awards.
As an example of this, Salford graduate Alec Newman set up his own         small poetry press called The Knives Forks and Spoons Press (KFS), which         over the last three years has blossomed into one of the most dynamic and         exciting small press poetry publishers in the UK, with an expanding list         of over 100 authors.
The press was shortlisted for two years running for         the Michael Marks Award for Best Publisher of Poetry in Pamphlet Form,         and one of the press' authors has been shortlisted for the Michael Marks         Best Pamphlet Award.
As Newman states:        "KFS is committed to promoting new generations of poets working in           an alternative literary tradition, and our poets' careers are           flourishing.
Scott Thurston's continuing support as an academic at           Salford is essential to the success of this endeavour.
His academic           writing and his academic publications, such as the Journal of British           and Irish Innovative Poetry, and his active role in The Other Room,           where many KFS poets have performed, give critical validation to           individual poets and to schools of poetry.
By working together &#8212; as           publisher and academic &#8212; with the universal goal of elevating the           profile of alternative literary practice we have succeeded where           previous generations have failed: we have brought alternative           literature to the attention of mainstream publishers and event           organisers."
This year nine of the poets discovered by KFS were published by         Bloodaxe, one of the three major poetry publishers in the UK, in a major         new anthology called Dear World and Everyone in It.
This has         created a broad range of financially beneficial opportunities for young         innovative writers that simply did not exist before.
The press has also         hosted four student interns from the research-led undergraduate and         postgraduate creative writing programmes.
Two of these students have         subsequently gained full employment with publishing houses Electric Word         (Birmingham) and Elektra Media (Manchester).
Thurston's commitment in bringing innovative poetry to new audiences         led him to co-found The Other Room, a reading series devoted to         innovative poetry and based in Manchester.
Based on Thurston's knowledge         of contemporary poetry and contacts in the field, The Other Room has         also had a significant impact on local literary culture, attracting a         large number of internationally significant figures to Manchester to         perform at the event.
The series is therefore very closely informed by         the knowledge and contacts Thurston has built up through his research as         a writer, editor and interviewer.
Developed in 2008, The Other Room is a         free to attend, open to all, reading series, presenting experimental         writers.
So far it has entertained more than 1000 audience members who         have seen over 100 performers.
All performances are recorded and         archived on the series website, constructing a rich open resource.
The Other Room project website acts as a route to existing and further         research and a community resource.
It includes links to important         resources for innovative poetry hosted by academic institutions,         supports the development and sale of publications via the many small         presses which produce them, and links wider communities to poetic         practice and the growing community of poets it supports.
The website has         had 132,564 hits since January 2009 and currently receives an average of         130 hits per day.
It contains around 40 hours of video recordings of         performances and interviews with poets.
As our users note:                 "I have to confess that The Other Room is a kind of lifeline for             me: in a city that seems at times to be dominated by performance             poetry evenings, it's a real pleasure to go somewhere where the art             of the bleeding obvious isn't constantly on display."

Three significant local poets who have attended the Other Room         regularly since its inception &#8212; Nigel Wood, Stephen Emmerson and Richard         Barrett &#8212; have themselves begun their own publishing enterprises, events         and magazines (Sunfish magazine, Department magazine and small press,         the Counting Backwards reading series and the Writers Forum North         creative writing workshop).
All these writers subsequently studied at         Salford on the MA Creative Writing: Innovation and Experiment, and         Barrett is currently preparing a PhD proposal.
The annual Other Room anthology has sold around 120 copies and is         collected internationally by a number of important public archives such         as the Poetry Collection at SUNY Buffalo, the Sackner Archive in Miami,         Florida, the University of Wisconsin, Madison and the Poetry Library in         London.
