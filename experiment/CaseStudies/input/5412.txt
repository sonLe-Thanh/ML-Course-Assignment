     Dickie's research on the history of criminal organisations in Italy has       had direct impacts on the training and practice of law enforcement and       judicial professionals, and of civil society organisations in Italy.
The       work has also directly engaged wide public audiences both beyond and       within Italy, both through its publication in accessible texts bought and       read by a global non-specialist readership, and through its contribution       to international media discourse about Italian mafia and the social and       political implications of their operations.
Since the mafias are distinguished from ordinary gangs by their       historical continuity, understanding this history and how the       organisations have changed &#8212; or not &#8212; is a prerequisite for successful       anti-mafia work.
The most powerful mafia in Italy today, the `ndrangheta,       remains under-researched: for example, before Dickie's work, there was no       adequate explanation of its origins.
Moreover, since 1992, both Italy's       police forces and its prosecutors have been organised in specialised       anti-mafia teams, coordinated nationally.
This new level of specialisation       means that, unlike the past, it is now a regular occurrence for both       police and magistrates to work on combatting different mafias in different       phases of their careers, and to work on several mafias contemporaneously.
Dickie's comparative research on mafia history provides a single       historical narrative of all the mafias together that is adequate to this       new, broader perspective.
The use of Dickie's research as a resource for practitioners has       ensured the considerable impacts of the research on professional         understanding and practice among anti-mafia officials in Italy.
However, the nature of Italian law enforcement, particularly in anti-mafia       work, is such that much of this influence occurs through informal channels       such as meetings, emails and telephone calls.
The most dedicated       magistrates and law enforcement officers take it upon themselves to read       around the subject.
Accordingly, law enforcement officials and judicial       practitioners routinely refer either to Dickie himself and/or to the       written outputs of his research in seeking to better understand these       organisations' operation and evolution.
As such, the research has made       significant contributions to the professional preparation and development       of law enforcement officers engaged in front-line work against the mafias.
The unique comparative approach used by Dickie to contextualise and       understand Italy's three principal mafia organisations sets his work apart       from comparable books, ensuring its widespread use at all levels of the       Italian law enforcement and judiciary services [1, 2].
This use of research has supported the successful investigation and         prosecutions of mafia members through its use to establish       correlations between contemporary investigations and the history of mafia       activities.
Describing its general utility in this context, a magistrate       involved in anti-mafia investigations, and with experience investigating       both Sicilian and Calabrian organised crime, explains that: `[Dickie's]       research has confirmed empirical data that has emerged from investigations       I have carried out in Calabria' [1].
A Captain in the Carabinieri's ROS       section (which specialises in organised crime and terrorism) with       experience of front-line operations against both Cosa Nostra and the       `ndrangheta similarly attests to his use of Dickie's work `to confirm       dates or people involved in particular crimes' [2].
A specific example of this occurred in 2010 by magistrates in Reggio         Calabria to build a case by prosecuting the `ndrangheta as a whole under         Italian mafia laws as part of `Operation Crimine', a national police       operation that led to the arrest of some 300 suspected members.
The       assumption that the Calabrian mafia constituted only a loose collection of       local gangs had previously meant that each `ndrangheta trial had to start       from scratch by proving the existence of the particular local gang in       question.
This was a serious impediment to effective law enforcement.
Operation Crimine sought to remedy this by providing the first evidence of       the existence of a coordinating body known as the Crimine (the Crime).
Dickie used both Mafia Brotherhoods and supplementary       documentation communicated personally to the Assistant Chief Prosecutor of       Reggio Calabria to demonstrate that the Crimine (or something very like       it) may already have existed in the 1930s and is perhaps even as old as       the `ndrangheta itself.
This information was used, in the prosecutor's       words, `to analyse the results of [police and judicial] investigations and       to construct hypotheses based on that evidence which, particularly in       relation to the complex project known as Crimine, have so far met with       substantial confirmation in the rulings issued by a number of Italian       judges in trials that have taken place in both Milan and Reggio Calabria'       [3].
The trials resulting from Operation Crimine are still ongoing.
Once       the judicial process is complete, it is hoped that they will establish a       precedent for recognising the `ndrangheta as a single, unified criminal       association, allowing for collective prosecution under Italy's 1982       anti-mafia law no.
416bis - a huge step forward that will parallel that       achieved by the famous maxi-trial against Cosa Nostra in 1992.
Dickie's expert research insights are widely and frequently used to inform         understanding and practice within anti-mafia civil society organisations.
These include the Sicilian organisation Addiopizzo, which takes a       revolutionary approach to fighting the mafia by bringing together       businesses that refuse to pay protection money to Cosa Nostra with       consumers who want to make sure that the money they spend does not end in       the mafia's coffers.
The organisation's officers and volunteers use       Dickie's work to better understand the history and operation of the mafias       and thereby to enhance the services that they provide to both local         communities and tourists.
Addiopizzo Travel, for example, requires       all of its trainees to read Cosa Nostra as preparation for       delivery of organised tours of Palermo's `sites of memory' in relation to       the mafia and the city's fight against it [4].
Dickie's books have also       promoted Addiopizzo's work and objectives among a wider public audience:       many non-Sicilian tourists have been introduced to Addiopizzo by reading Cosa         Nostra in its various translations, and have become involved in its       efforts as a result, including, for instance, by donating money and       choosing hotels that do not pay protection.
Addiopizzo uses Cosa         Nostra to introduce young Sicilians to the history of the Mafia       including, for example, a three-year project (2008 to 2010) sponsored by       the Ministry of Education, in which Addiopizzo worked with secondary       school students to research the history of the mafia in an effort to       reduce its influence on day-to-day Sicilian society [4].
The reach of the books' impacts on public engagement with and         understanding of mafias is considerably enhanced by the fact that Cosa         Nostra, Mafia Brotherhoods and Mafia Republic are       written for non-specialist audiences, presenting both original and       established research to a global audience in an accessible while still       academically rigorous manner.
As a Financial Times article (June       2011) described the narrative of Mafia Brotherhoods, it `bowls       along, powered by the sort of muscular prose one associates with great       detective fiction' [5].
The books' reach across international public readerships is suggested by       the number of translations and sales.
This is particularly so for Cosa         Nostra, which has appeared in 21 languages plus Braille since       publication in 2004; by Spring 2011 it had sold 750,000 copies worldwide.
The book's yearly English language sales (excluding the US market) from       2008 to 2011 exceeded 60,000, with sales peaking in 2008 (16,371) and 2011       (16,465) [6].
The book's continued relevance to broad non-academic       audiences is further demonstrated by renewed contracts for continued       publication in countries including Holland, Spain, Norway, and Germany;       and sales and translations have flourished in new markets such as Finland,       China, Poland.
Mafia Brotherhoods has likewise been widely       translated into Dutch (2011), Italian (2012), Czech (2012), and Chinese       (2013) and sold over 39,000 copies since 2011.
Mafia Republic,       published in the UK in May 2013, is already contracted for publication in       the same territories.
While contracts to produce single volumes combining       the two books had been signed in Germany and the US [6].
Cosa Nostra's       reach, moreover, extended well beyond casual readers: in June 2008, a       filmed raid on a Russian mob boss's palatial villa in Rome found the book       on his bedside table!
However, the most significant channel for the broader impacts of the       research on public engagement with the issues covered in Dickie's books is       their coverage by media outlets around the world.
Mafia Brotherhoods       was subject to extensive media coverage surrounding its publication in       2011, ensuring the communication of its key insights to a huge audience,       including interviews on BBC Radio 5 Live's Up All Night (6m       listeners per week) and Newstalk 106-108 FM (12% audience share in       Dublin); and a major July 2011 book tour in Australia &#8212; where the       `ndrangheta has long had a presence &#8212; including appearances on Late Night       Live with Philip Adams (over 300k listeners) [7].
As recently as 2012, Cosa         Nostra was the book club selection by the influential American       pundit David Frum on the hugely popular Daily Beast website which receives       18 million visitors per month.
[8]     Dickie's provision of expert advice to media professionals through       informal consultations and organised events has also informed and         enhanced media professionals' knowledge about &#8212; and thereby the accuracy         of global media discourse on &#8212; mafias, which are often reported in       sensationalist terms.
Dickie's books frequently inform coverage of mafia       stories by providing relevant historical and societal information.
This is       gleaned not only from use of the published work, but also through Dickie's       presentations to media professionals of expert insights gained through his       research.
On 2 September 2009, for example, he drew on research later       published in Mafia Brotherhoods and Mafia Republic to       deliver an invited presentation on mafias and the media to some 150 news       professionals at the annual conference of the European Broadcasting       Union's radio news group in Turin.
Media interest in his work recently       extended to the production of two related television documentaries based       on it: the first of these, Mafia Bunker, was transmitted on       History Channel Italia in April 2013; the second, The Mafia's Secret         Bunkers, aired on BBC2 on 1 May 2013.
The latter, according to its       Executive Producer, used Dickie's research not only as a credible source       of support for the original commission, but to move `beyond an engaging       current affairs piece into the most detailed and informative piece on the       `Ndrangheta Mafia in Calabria that there has been on international       television' [9].
It was watched by 1.23 million (5.27% audience share) and       was recommended by the Telegraph, Daily Mail, the Times,       Observer and the Sun.
The Italian version pulled in 114,000       viewers, doubling History Channel Italia's average audience, and also       received positive advance notices in the Italian press [10].
