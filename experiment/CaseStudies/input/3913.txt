     The Glasgow CMPS-SF       Assessing pain in animals is a challenge for veterinarians because of the       inherent communication       difficulties and because different animals and species have varying       responses to pain.
An animal       will experience acute pain immediately after a traumatic injury (e.g.
after breaking a bone or       following surgery) and appropriate intervention with pain relief can       significantly enhance recovery       and minimise the risk of chronic pain developing.
The CMPS-SF is the first       statistically validated       scale to incorporate a structured and objective approach to pain       assessment in dogs.
This       behaviour-based assessment provides an accurate, unbiased indication of       the pain level       experienced by the animal.
The assessment is easy and quick to perform       with results available in       3&#8212;4 minutes.
Uniquely, the CMPS-SF provides a threshold for analgesic       intervention, thereby       enabling clinical decision making on pain relief provision.
A practical resource for veterinarians to guide clinical decisions       The CMPS-SF is available for open-access download from the University of       Glasgow website.
Since 2008, the CMPS-SF has been downloaded by 3266 non-academic users       worldwide &#8212; 3109       and 157 of whom stated their intended use was in veterinary practice and       industry, respectively.a       However, once downloaded the CMPS-SF can be copied; download data are,       therefore, likely to       underestimate total usage.
The CMPS-SF is further disseminated and used       within the veterinary       profession through its inclusion in textbooks, establishing it as a       standard reference for measuring       pain for both teaching and veterinary practice.
The CMPS-SF has featured       in key pain       management handbooks for practitioners such as `Anesthesia for         Veterinary Technicians' (2010)       and `Practical Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Nursing'       (2013), with global sales of 2,600       and 750 respectively.b     Impacts on the veterinary healthcare industry       As detailed below, the CMPS-SF has been used by the following       market-leading veterinary       healthcare companies since 2008: Merial, Novartis Animal Health Inc.,       Nexcyon Pharmaceuticals       Inc., Vetoquinol, Dechra and Animalcare.
Use of the CMPS-SF in clinical trials and regulatory application for         novel analgesics       Before new analgesic drugs for animals can be made available on the       market, they must gain       regulatory approval, a process that relies on robust clinical trial data       that demonstrate a drug's       effectiveness in the target species using validated pain measurement       scales.
The following       applications have gained regulatory approval based on data obtained with       the CMPS-SF:c            2008, Merial Ltd.&#8212; approval from the US Food and Drug Administration         for `previcox' chewable         tablets in dogs following orthopaedic surgery.
2011 &#8212; approval from the European Medicines Agency for `Recuvyra' in         dogs following         orthopaedic surgery.
2011 Novartis Animal Health US Inc. &#8212; approval from the FDA for         `DERAMAXX' chewable         tablets in dogs following dental surgery.
2012, Nexcyon Pharmaceuticals Inc. &#8212; approval from the FDA for         `Recuvyra' in dogs following         general surgery.
Use of the CMPS-SF by veterinary healthcare for promotion of         analgesics       Vetoquinol is the 10th largest veterinary pharmaceutical       company in the world, with reported sales       of &#8364;17M for the first half of 2013.
Since mid-2012, its UK subsidiary has       used the CMPS-SF as       marketing support for its pain medications (including Cimalgex&#174;&#8212;the       fastest growing non-steroidal       anti-inflammatory drug for dogs in the UK and Ireland).d The       company has reproduced the original       copy and layout of the CMPS-SF on Vetoquinol branded pads containing 50       leaves of the       questionnaire (see example sheet).
Vetoquinol specifically chose the       CMPS-SF acute pain scale       because:     `it is scientifically validated and well known in the UK whilst being         simple to use....it was         recommended to us by various veterinary surgeons throughout the UK'e     Almost 2,000 copies of the pad have been distributed (100,000       individual copies of the acute pain scale) to complement       Vetoquinol products.
The Vetoquinol CMPS-SF marketing       supporting materials were a major focus of Cimalgex&#174;       promotional activities at the London Vet Show (November 2012)       and British Small Animal Veterinary Association Congress       exhibition (April 2013)d &#8212; these prominent events were attended       by over 3300 and 4000 veterinary professionals respectively.
Since 2010, Animalcare have employed a similar use of the       CMPS-SF to support their analgesic products.
The company       have distributed the CMPS-SF in pads (50 sheets) to veterinary       surgeons and nurses across the 4,000 practices in their UK       territory through their `lunch and learn' programme.
During these       sessions the territory managers inform staff on `why and how' to       use the CMPS-SF thus `[promoting] awareness of the scale to         vets and nurses (many of whom have limited time and finances to attend         external CPD).'
e                   In spring 2013 the Dechra UK Marketing Team confirmed the key inclusion       of the Glasgow CMPS-SF       in its new UK-wide marketing campaign of Comfortan&#174;       (the UKs only veterinary licenced       methadone) via distribution of the CMPS-SF in a laminated form with the       product.
Prior to spring       2013 Dechra had been directing customers to the CMPS-SF download at the       University of       Glasgow website.
The decision to formally incorporate the Glasgow CMPS-SF       into the marketing       material was taken following an internal recommendation of the scale by       Dechra's technical team       who highlighted the CMPS-SF as `the most recognisable system' and       one which was `easy to use',       `familiar to most vets and nurses' and `known internationally by         [Dechra's] other international         territories'.f     Recognition of the University of Glasgow CMPS-SF       In 2009, the University of Glasgow research team was awarded the       Universities Federation for       Animal Welfare (UFAW) inaugural Companion Animal Welfare Award for the       development of the       CMPS-SF acute pain scale.
This award is given in recognition of `outstanding         innovation in animal         welfare science to the benefit of companion animals.
'g     Raising awareness of animal pain in the veterinary community &#8212; The           Global Pain Council       In 2011, Professor Nolan was recruited as one of only two European experts       on the World Small       Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Global Pain Council (eight members       in total).h Professor       Nolan's appointment to the committee resulted from her reputation as a       world-leading authority on       pain, and her pioneering research track record in the field of the       pathophysiology of pain in small       animals (detailed in section 2), as well as the pain assessment tools.i       The council has produced       comprehensive practical guidelines that raise awareness of animal pain       around the world and       provide tools to manage pain in animals, with the aim of providing a       resource that veterinarians       worldwide can tailor for pain management strategies in companion animals.
Professor Nolan has       had particular input towards the guidelines on recognising acute and       chronic presentations of pain.
The protocols are specifically written for international audiences,       providing tiered options for       analgesic therapies that recognise the variable availability of drugs       across the individual countries       of the world.
These guidelines, in which the CMPS-SF was reprinted, were       presented at the World       Congress of WSAVA, March 2013 with 1500 delegates from over 50 countries       in attendance.i,j
