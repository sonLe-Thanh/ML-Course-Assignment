     Research led by Jones and Dick became the foundation for a number of       events leading up to the bicentenary of Matthew Boulton's death which       provided significant opportunities for impact.
Supporting and influencing the working practices of heritage         professionals     In preparation for the bicentenary, beginning in November 2007 and       running to March 2008, Jones and Dick co-organised 6 AHRC-funded Boulton       workshops on the subject `Investigating and Communicating the         Historical Significance of Matthew Boulton (1728-1809)'.
Speakers       and attendees from the UK, Australia and the USA addressed audiences       (around 30-40 per workshop) drawn from academia, museums, libraries,       archives, and community groups.
The series helped bring together       stakeholders involved in the planning of the Matthew Boulton bicentenary       to share their knowledge and understanding of Boulton, of the world in       which he lived, and of the challenges faced in communicating his       historical significance in 2009.
The workshops encouraged effective         exchanges of historical understanding between the two groups and       assessment of the challenges of `communicating shared historical       understanding of Boulton' to wider and more diverse audiences.
The       Steering Group included members from Birmingham Museums Trust, The       Birmingham Assay Office, Birmingham City University, and Birmingham       Archives &amp; Heritage.
This type of engagement was key to ensuring that       the bicentenary events run by cultural partners were informed by academic       knowledge, but also that partnerships between the two were sustainable,       and that collaboration between academic partners and heritage       practitioners resulted in a change to working practices not only amongst       the academics involved but also the heritage practitioners working on the       project.
This model of cultural partnership has become recognised       as best practice, and is now influencing future plans for the bicentenary       of James Watt in 2019 (initial work to begin in 2014).
As a result of the workshops Jones and Dick were invited to serve on the       advisory board of Birmingham Museums exhibition `Matthew Boulton: Selling       What all the World Desires' (30th May &#8212; 27th September 2009) in 2009.
As       members of the board, Jones and Dick were able to influence the design and       delivery of the exhibition, again having impact through enriching       curatorial practice in the form of a change to the working practices of       heritage practitioners in terms of increasing collections knowledge, new       approaches to the collections and to interpretation.
Following the Boulton collaboration in 2009, Dick has served as a member       of the Historians' Advisory Board for the new History Galleries at the       Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (an &#163;8.9 million development project),       attending quarterly meetings and meeting with curators directly to advise       on content, displays and interpretation for the eighteenth-century       section, based upon his research.
`The tangible results of [his] support       can be seen in the new public gallery displays, where his advice to       curators fed directly into text panels and interactive elements of the       exhibition relating to Birmingham's history from the eighteenth to the       twentieth century' (Head of Programming, Birmingham Museums [see source 1       below]).
The curatorial team and the new galleries themselves have       benefitted from such input to the extent that when they opened in October       2012, they have received excellent feedback from visitors to date with       over 40,000 people visiting the galleries in their opening two months [1].
Contributing to a better public understanding of Matthew Boulton and         the Industrial Enlightenment     The free exhibition `Matthew Boulton: Selling What all the World Desires'       at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery attracted 33,000 people and achieved       a consumer feedback approval rating of 99% &#8212; the highest level of any       temporary exhibition in 2009-10.
Most significantly, 87% of visitors       indicated in feedback that they now had a `better understanding' of       Boulton, the Lunar Society or the Industrial Revolution as a result of       their visit [2].
In addition, the majority of visitors to the exhibition       (around two thirds) were from outside the West Midlands, thus indicating       the exhibition was a stimulus to tourism in the region [2].
A further legacy of the impact of Jones' and Dick's involvement in the       bicentenary events can be seen in the ongoing collaboration between The       Birmingham Assay Office (co-sponsor of the Boulton 2009 events) and the       Centre for West Midlands History.
Boulton was the founder of the       Birmingham Assay Office, and in June 2012 and 2013, joint public day       schools at the University of Birmingham explored aspects of industrial,       scientific and artistic history and provided a reminder of Boulton's       relevance.
Over 50 people attended each event, including heritage       professionals, graduate students, artists, employees of Jewellery Quarter       businesses and members of the public.
Each event was evaluated and       revealed that attendees' knowledge of Boulton increased [3].
During and after the bicentenary, as a part of sustained and continued       input into events for the public and special interest groups aimed at       promoting understanding and awareness of Boulton and the Industrial       Enlightenment, Jones and Dick also contributed to events for: The British       Numismatics Society (Jones, July 2009); British Science Festival (Jones       Sept. 2010); Historical Association branches in Birmingham, Isle of Wight       and Durham (Dick, March 2009, April and May 2011); The Lunar Society       (Dick, 21 Jan. 2010); Aston University's Boulton Discovery Day (Dick, 17       Sept. 2009); Erasmus Darwin House (Dick, 2 June 2009); Staffordshire and       Warwickshire Archaeological and Historical Societies (Dick, Oct. 2009,       April 2010); Selly Oak Local History Societies (Dick, 6 Nov. 2009);       Birmingham Metallurgical Association (Dick, 31 Jan. 2013); Worshipful       Company of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (Dick, 30 June 2013).
Since 2008, both Jones and Dick have also contributed to books aimed at a       wide audience:     - S. Mason ed., Matthew Boulton: Selling What all the World Desires       (Birmingham City Council and Yale University Press, 2009);     - R. Clay and S. Tungate eds, Matthew Boulton: the Art of Making         Money (Brewin Books, 2009);     - M. Dick ed., Matthew Boulton: a Revolutionary Player (Brewin       Books, 2009).
In addition, Dick is the editor of a new quarterly magazine History         West Midlands (HWM), the first edition of which (May 2013)       was devoted to the theme: `The West Midlands Enlightenment'.
Jones       contributed the lead article on the Industrial Enlightenment.
The magazine       had a circulation of 5,000, and e-mails from readers reveal a very       positive response [4].
Influencing curriculum design and provision of educational resources     Jones and Dick were invited to advise and present their research to the       Education Committee of the Council of Europe as a part of the second phase       of the `Shared Histories for a Europe without Dividing Lines' project:       `The consequences of the Industrial Revolution on European societies'       (Strasbourg, 27 - 28 Oct, 2011).
The committee is tasked with producing an       e-book of educational resources on the Industrial Revolution for European       secondary teachers and students.
Jones and Dick emphasised the       significance of the West Midlands Industrial Enlightenment and industrial       heritage to an audience of educators, textbook writers, heritage and       business professionals and MEPs.
Dick also participated in a follow-on       session on a draft of the resources organised by the committee       (Strasbourg, 16-17 May 2013) and will be contributing to a future event       outside the impact period `Shared Histories' event, Vienna, 9-11 April       2014).
Jones and Dick's involvement demonstrates contribution to the         development of educational materials at an international level.
Contributing to the commemoration of Boulton     Jones' research identified Boulton as a leading figure in the Industrial       Enlightenment, and as a result of Dick's talk at the Durham Historical       Association meeting in 2010, Professor Sir Arnold Wolfendale (former       Astronomer Royal) approached Dick to begin a campaign to secure a         memorial in Westminster Abbey to Matthew Boulton alongside his       business partner James Watt.
Dick took the proposal to interested parties       in Birmingham and a campaign began, led by Marion Roberts (former chair of       the Lunar Society), Sir Nicholas Goodison (former chair of the Stock       Exchange) and Birmingham Museums Trust.
In 2012, the Dean of Westminster       gave his consent to the creation of a Boulton memorial [5].
The memorial       will recognise Boulton as a figure of national standing as a result of his       contribution to industrial and technological development; it will be       installed in 2014.
