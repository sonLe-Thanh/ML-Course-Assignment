     The development of the AVVQ has had impact in a range of areas:             National and international adoption of the AVVQ as the measure of         choice in research studies.
Varicose veins are a common medical       condition, with approximately 25% of women and 15% of men having some form       of visible varicose veins.
The recently introduced minimally invasive       therapies for the treatment of varicose veins has led to their       effectiveness being assessed in a number of observational studies and       randomised controlled trials.
The AVVQ has become the most commonly used       disease specific questionnaire in venous studies and has been used in all       of the large recent randomised controlled trials eg a review of published       venous studies in the Journal of Vascular Surgery, European Journal of         Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Phlebology found that out of       60 studies assessed, 47 studies adopted the AVVQ as the gold standard       measure for assessment of disease-specific quality of life.
The AVVQ has       also been translated into Dutch in 2009 [a] and Portuguese in 2012 [b] by       international groups in the Netherlands and Brazil and validated for use       in these countries.
Recommendation of the AVVQ as a preferred measurement tool by           international agencies: Reporting standards for the treatment of         varicose veins issued by the American Venous Forum and the           Society of Interventional Radiology recommended from 2007 that the         use of both generic and venous disease-specific measures to be the         accepted standard for studying quality-of-life (QOL) changes.
Specifically, it recommended the AVVQ as one of only three acceptable         disease-specific validated questionnaires worldwide.
More recently in         2011, the clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular         Surgery and the American Venous Forum strongly recommended that, as part         of the assessment of the outcome of treatment, a disease-specific         instrument (such as the AVVQ) be used to evaluate patient-reported         outcomes [c].
The current UK NICE guidelines [d] on the diagnosis and         treatment of varicose veins also highlights the key role         disease-specific quality of life measures, including the AVVQ,         contribute to the assessment of the effectiveness of different treatment         options and subsequent recommendations on their use in the NHS.
Adoption of the AVVQ as the mandated measurement of quality           of varicose vein treatment in the NHS in England to in form         NHS service planning: In 2008, Lord Darzi         published a review of the NHS in England entitled High Quality Care           for All.
The review was commissioned by the Prime Minister, the         Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Health to develop a vision of         a health service fit for the 21st century.
A core tenet of         this review was that "quality should be at the heart of the NHS" and a         recommendation made that the NHS should "systematically measure and         publish information about the quality of care ... including patients'         own views on the success of their treatment and the quality of their         experiences" &#8212; so called "PROMs", or Patient Reported Outcome Measures.
This information would then be used to assess the quality of services         provided across the NHS and inform service redesign [e].
To enable this,         the Standard NHS Contract for Acute Services, was revised to include a         requirement for all licensed providers of NHS-funded procedures         including varicose vein surgery to ask patients to complete PROM         questionnaires before and after surgery, from April 2009.
The associated         guidance document produced by the Department of Health mandated the use         of the AVVQ as the disease-specific PROM for varicose vein surgery [f].
Since April 2009, all patients in England undergoing varicose vein         surgery now complete the AVVQ before and after their surgery.
To date         over 27,000 patients have already completed these multiple assessments         using the AVVQ.
Data from these measures are collated centrally by the         NHS Information Centre in England and reports produced quarterly to         allow the assessment of quality of service across the country and the         planning of service delivery nationwide [g].
Already the PROMs data for         varicose vein surgery &#8212; ie the AVVQ data &#8212; has shown that treatment in         England results in significant improvement in health for patients [h].
Patients with the lowest &#8212; less severe &#8212; pre-treatment scores have been         found to benefit least from surgery.
These observations are now being         used by individual NHS providers to assess the quality of their care         (the NHS Information Centre provides data by provider) and to improve         their services in line with providers seen to provide high quality care.
Data is also being used for planning and commissioning of services         nationwide.
Data is now also being linked routinely to national Hospital         Episode Statistics by the National Information Centre to allow long-term         tracking of outcomes.
The claimed impact, as defined by REF guidance, therefore includes impact       on: public policy and services particularly through the       specification of AVVQ-reporting as part of the NHS contract;         practitioners and professional services through the widespread use       and adoption of the measure and health and welfare through its use       to plan NHS services.
