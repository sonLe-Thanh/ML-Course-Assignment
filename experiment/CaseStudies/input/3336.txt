     MMU had a close and productive relationship with Becta (1999-2010), which       provided a conduit for influencing policy.
Subsequently, a developing       relationship with European Schoolnet (an organisation representing 30       European Ministries of Education, working with policy makers, teachers and       researchers) has created opportunities to influence policy at European       level.
The selected projects described in this case study were       commissioned by the UK government and/or its agency for ICT in schools       (Becta) in order to develop policy to support the use of ICT in schools.
ImpaCT2 was led by the University of Nottingham with MMU and the Open       University as co-investigators; ICT Test Bed was led by MMU with       Nottingham Trent university as co-investigator; SWEEP was led by MMU with       consultancy from the University of Bristol and Web 2.0 Technologies for       learning was led by the University of Nottingham with MMU and the       Institute of Education, London University as co-investigators.
The program of research underpinned government strategies for ICT in       education (Harnessing Technology from 2005-2010) during the last Labour       Government (eg Becta 2008a, p14         and p19).
In Becta's annual review of technology and education       (Harnessing Technology Review), for the years 2008 and 2009 (eg Becta         2008b), Somekh and Lewin were co-authors on 4 reports cited as key       evidence of the positive impact of ICT on learning.
ImpaCT2, ICT Test         Bed and SWEEP are also cited in a current       government-authored paper summarising the impact of technology (DfE         2011b) evidencing the continuing importance of this work under the       current coalition government.
The beneficiaries of resulting policy       developments include schools, teachers, young people and their families       through financing of infrastructure in schools and homes, and impact on       learning outcomes.
The research insights have also informed policy making       and research at an international level.
ImpaCT2 continues to be cited widely internationally as evidence       of the impact of ICT on attainment.
For example, in a recent publication       from UNESCO (Kozma         2011).
Drawing on findings from ICT Test Bed (Home         Access Task Force, Becta 2008c) the Government sought to reduce the       inequitable home access to the Internet through the Home Access       Initiative, a &#163;194 million voucher programme.
267,244 low-income houses       with children were provided with an Internet-enabled computer between 2009       and 2010.
PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated the project produced a positive       Net Value of +&#163;768 million through improving educational attainment and       the consequential improvement in lifetime earnings for the beneficiaries (DfE         2011a: 5).
In one ICT Test Bed cluster (one secondary school, seven primary       schools) a trailblazing learning platform was developed that underpinned       an integral part of Becta's approach to embedding such technology in       schools (Becta 2008a).
In the       year 2009-2010 67% of primary schools and 93% of secondary schools had       learning platforms (Becta 2010).
ICT Test Bed also marked an important shift in government-sponsored       evaluations, which had given primacy to quantitative empirical work.
The       project included 116 action research projects of innovative work with ICT       led by 90 teachers and para-professionals from the ICT Test Bed sites.
Nine of these were cited in a Becta-commissioned large-scale research       review evidencing the impact of this work on the nature of research       evidence that is acceptable.
This further embedded ICT R&amp;D in schools       impacting on professional practices, including producing published       teacher-led studies (e.g.
Burkett         2008).
Some practitioners presented their work at international       conferences such as CAL, the National Teacher Research Panel and the       Collaborative Action Research Network annual conference.
Participation in       the project for many of these teachers resulted in changes in career       trajectories.
One, for example, now manages the iTEC project on       behalf of European Schoolnet whilst others have moved into academia.
Since 2008 there has been widespread international interest in the use of       interactive whiteboards (IWBs) to support teaching and learning.
The       EUScribe project (Bannister         2010), commissioned by European Schoolnet for its Ministry of       Education partners to provide guidance for effective use of IWBs, refers       to SWEEP and ICT Test Bed as `essential reading'.
In a       recent review for the OECD on IWBs commissioned, SWEEP and ICT         Test Bed were cited 18 times and drawn on extensively (Hennessy         and London, 2013).
The archived         website for Becta, captured on 30th January 2011 just before it       closed, includes a page on the impact of ICT; it lists ImpaCT2, ICT         Test Bed and SWEEP as key projects evidencing the benefits       of technology for learning.
SWEEP (the Primary Schools Whiteboard       Expansions project evaluation) was also cited as evidence for the       cost-effectiveness of interactive whiteboards in Hansard,         21st July 2010.
The Web 2.0 Technologies for Learning project has informed policy       makers and practitioners on supporting collaboration through technology.
For example, a blog         post on the iTEC website about this project (published in February       2011) has had over 8500 views.
Other users include OER Africa (an open       educational resources site for the African educational community) and the       Victorian government in Australia (presented as an international exemplar       of ICT use in schools).
The iTEC project directly involves 14 European Ministries of       Education as project partners plus a further three national organisations       as associate partners.
The evaluation, which MMU is leading, is supporting       mainstreaming activities in a number of countries and influencing policy       making.
In France iTEC is linked to the national strategy and has       been promoted through online channels (http://eduscol.education.fr/cid71352/projet-europeen-itec.html).
