     University of Glasgow research contributed to a campaign against gender       violence in El Salvador that was driven by civil society organisations,       gained widespread popular support and ultimately helped to create the       momentum that led to a change in the law.
Dr Mo Hume conducted case       studies, collecting qualitative evidence of violence against women which       was utilised by Oxfam America and a coalition of Salvadoran NGOs in their       campaign Una Vida Diferente       (A Different Life).
In 2008 Oxfam America published an internal report on Hume's fieldwork       which detailed the evidence-based findings of women's perceptions of and       responses to gendered violence in San Marcos and Ahuachapan.
This report       directly informed the Una Vida Diferente campaign, by confirming       (and exploring in depth) initial indications that public perceptions were       a significant contributing factor in the problem of gender violence (a       2005 survey by Salvadoran NGO CS Sondea had shown that 83% of people did       not consider rape a crime and 56.4% considered it normal behaviour for a       man to strike a woman).
Oxfam America, together with Salvadoran NGOs and the Human Rights       Institute of Central American University working in a coalition called       Campaign to End Gender Violence (Campa&#241;a de Prevenci&#243;n de la Violencia de       G&#233;nero &#8212; CPVG), launched the Una Vida Diferente: A Different Life       campaign, to raise awareness, mobilise public opinion and drive changes to       both practice and legislation.
Una Vida Diferente recognised the       importance of preventing gender-based violence through advocacy,       leadership programmes and working with men to try and influence cultural       factors and concepts of masculinity.
As part of this wider campaign, Hume       assisted in disseminating evidence from her study to a wider audience,       presenting her research findings to women parliamentarians in 2008,       focusing on the stories of women who had lived in a climate of fear and       violence, and highlighting the importance of improved legislation on this       issue.
The female parliamentarians participated in a certificate course on       gender violence as part of the CPVG, and later played an important role in       drafting the new legislation.
Hume's second field study in 2011 (report published by Oxfam America in       2012) assessed the impact of the campaign for Oxfam and allowed the       organisation to measure the success of their initiative and focus efforts       on the methods shown to be successful.
Key achievements of the CPVG       include:            development and approval of the Protocol for the Application of the         Domestic Violence Law, allowing it to be more consistently enforced.
development of the draft bill that ultimately resulted in the Special         Integrated Law for a Life Free from Violence for Women.
This was a major         policy victory for the women's movement in El Salvador.
Ministry of Education's adoption of school-based violence prevention         as a priority and inclusion in curriculum of content on gender based         violence.
establishment of specific standards and procedures for dealing with         teachers accused of violence or sexual harassment under the Reform of         the Law Teaching Profession.
This had not existed previously in El         Salvador and there was no disciplinary mechanism available to schools to         dismiss teachers who had been found guilty of sexual harassment.
Oxfam America's Research and Evaluation Advisor says "Campaign       stakeholders still speak very fondly of [Hume's] research and work with       [Oxfam] on indicators; it was truly of great value to partners and field       staff."
Due in part to the Una Vida Diferente campaign, the       Salvadoran government passed the Special Integral Law for a Life Free of       Violence for Women on 25 November 2010.
This law addresses El Salvador's       record of femicide, which in 2006 was 13 times higher than that in the       United States, by introducing a penalty of 30-50 years' imprisonment for       femicide, and fines and jail sentences for pornography and psychological       abuse.
The law came into effect 1 January 2012.
Hume's research had shown       that many Salvadoran women did not report domestic violence due to the       paternalistic reaction from police and other officials, which often meant       that a woman would be sent home to suffer further abuse from a husband       outraged that she had complained.
The new law enforces the role of the       police and other officials in protecting women's rights in all cases of       domestic or gender violence.
Hume's follow-up fieldwork from 2011       demonstrated that local service providers who had been working with the       campaign demonstrated greater effectiveness in detecting and following up       cases of gender violence and highlighted important developments in local       women's advocacy strategies whereby women have formed `Citizen Windows' to       provide support for survivors of violence and to hold state institutions       to account.
As a result of Hume's work with Oxfam and her ongoing research into       gender violence in Central America, she has been asked to act as an expert       witness in Canada and the United States for political asylum cases where       people have escaped gender or gang violence in El Salvador.
Hume       contributed expert witness evidence (both written and oral) to over 10       cases since 2007.
The attorney of one such political asylum case in the       United States stated:     We are extremely grateful for your assistance on our recent asylum         case, concerning an imputed LGBT and gender-related violence claim out         of El Salvador.
Your research and expert affidavit was very on point to         our client's case and the fears he faced if returned to El Salvador.
It         was absolutely essential to corroborating his claims before the court.
Your research and analysis...provided the necessary context through         country conditions and addressed the validity of his unique situation &#8212;         both the past horrors he had suffered and the future fears he faced if         returned.
In January 2008, Hume was an invited speaker at a roundtable workshop at       the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on violence in Latin America.
In May       2012, she was invited to speak on `Social Peace: Poverty, Social Inclusion       and Security: the Ongoing Challenges' at a discussion panel hosted by the       Salvadoran Embassy in London.
The purpose of the event was to inform the       public of the achievements in El Salvador since the 1992 peace accords, an       aim that the Ambassador stated `would not have been possible without         your (Hume's) participation'.
