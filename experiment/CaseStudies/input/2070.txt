     In 2000 the DCMS established the Spoliation Advisory Panel, a       Non-Departmental Public Body that advises the Secretary of State on claims       for the return of cultural objects looted during the Nazi era.
The       Secretary to Panel has stated: `I write to confirm that Professor Sir         Richard Evans, who is the Deputy Chair of the UK Spoliation Advisory         Panel, was appointed by Ministers to the Panel in 2000 specifically on         the basis of the research he carried out on Nazi Germany.
In the case of         his initial appointment to the Panel, we took account of his work as the         lead expert witness in the High Court defamation case of Irving vs.         Lipstadt and Penguin Books.
Professor Evans was reappointed for a         further two terms and then subsequently as a member of the Panel         following its redesignation in 2010 on the basis of his published         research on the Nazi period in his three books `The Coming of the Third         Reich', `The Third Reich in Power', and `The Third Reich at War', as         well as `Lying About Hitler'.
Making sense of events that occurred some         70 years ago represents a considerable challenge and having recourse to         Professor Evans' knowledge and published works is an invaluable resource         for the Panel and for the Government.'
[5A]     12 reports have been issued by the Panel to date, 5 of them in the period       2008-12.
Professor Evans drafted [5F] the Report of the         Spoliation Advisory Panel in respect of an oil sketch by Sir Peter Paul         Rubens, The Coronation of the Virgin, now in the possession of the         Samuel Courtauld Trust, 2010, (HC655).
The Report recommended       rejection of the claim, and the recommendation was accepted by the       Secretary of State [5B].
The rejection was based on Professor       Evans's finding that the claimant had lost his fortune in the banking       crash of 1931, discussed in The Coming of the Third Reich.
It also       depended on a number of findings about the process of `Aryanization' in       the Dresdner Bank, researched for The Third Reich in Power.
The Report of the Spoliation Advisory Panel in respect of fourteen         clocks and watches now in the possession of the British Museum, London       (HC1839, 2012) rejected the claimant's case for restitution but       recommended that the display in the Museum be accompanied by a plaque       recording the original ownership of the watches and the circumstances       under which they came into the Museum's possession [5C].
Professor       Evans's contribution was on the historical circumstances of the original       forced sale of the objects and drew on his work on `Aryanization' and the       confiscation of Jewish property presented in The Third Reich in Power.
The Report of the Spoliation Advisory panel in respect of pieces of         porcelain now in the possession of the British Museum, London, and the         Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (HC602, 2008) recommended restitution       to the claimant on the basis that there was clear evidence that his       collection was seized by the Gestapo.
Professor Evans's contribution to       the report was on the circumstances of the original spoliation.
The       Secretary of State accepted the recommendation and the porcelain objects       were returned.
The Report of the Spoliation Advisory Panel in respect of a renewed         claim by the Metropolitan Chapter of Benevento for the return of the         Beneventan Missal now in the possession of the British Library       (HC448) was issued on 15 September 2010 and recommended the return of the       Missal to the Benevento Chapter Library [5D] on the basis that it       had been illegally acquired by a British officer in 1944 and the British       Museum Manuscripts Department knew this at the time.
Professor Evans       advised on the circumstances of the fighting in and around Naples in 1944,       as researched for his book The Third Reich at War.
The missal was       formally returned to the Benevento Chapter Library by the British Library       in 2011 [5H].
The Report of the Spoliation Advisory Panel in respect of eight         drawings now in the possession of the Samuel Courtauld Trust (HC757,       24 June 2009), recommended the rejection of the claim for restitution with       the proviso of a plaque accompanying the display of the objects explaining       the circumstances of their original sale.
Professor Evans advised on the       circumstances under which the Gestapo requisitioned the apartment of the       owner, and the subsequent sale of the objects, as well as on the owner's       German state pension and the blocked account into which it was       subsequently paid.
His advice drew on the research into the Nazi removal       of Jewish civil servants in 1933 presented in The Coming of the Third         Reich.
The Holocaust (Restitution of Cultural Objects) Act 2009 was       prompted by the Benevento Missal case (see above) and led to the Missal's       restitution.
The Panel exercised its right, as outlined in its Terms of       Reference, to recommend legislation and drafted an initial Bill, which was       then scrutinized by Parliamentary Draftsmen and passed through both Houses       in 2009 as a Private Member's Bill [5E, 5G].
