     The underpinning research validates the biomedical function of the       Cadisc&#174; implants, which       underwent clinical trials on 30 patients from October 2009 to June 2010       [4.2] and has since led to       the impacts described below.
Patient health benefits     The research has led to the development of two products that are       specifically designed to treat       patients suffering from degenerative disc disease &#8212; Cadisc&#174;-L, which       mimics the biomechanical       properties of the natural lumbar disc, and       Cadisc&#174;-C, which does the same for the natural       cervical disc.
Based on the research insights       into the mechanical loading on spinal discs and       the transfer of fluid, Cadisc&#174; (see Figure 1) is       designed to replicate the behaviour of a real       spinal disc and hence give better results in       terms of pain relief, mobility and quality of life to       patients soon after surgery.
It is unique in that it       does not have a metal endplate and therefore       conforms to vertebral anatomy better than conventional implants [4.3].
The graph below left shows the improvement in Quality Adjusted Life Years       (QALY, a standard       measure of disease burden including both quality and quantity of life) in       the 24 months after       patients received the product, in comparison to alternative treatments       available.
QALY accrual rate       for Cadisc&#174; is 0.7 over 12 months, which is approximately twice that of       conventional disc       replacements and three times that of spinal fusion, the current "Gold       Standard" of care [4.4].
In the UK the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)       values 1 QALY at &#163;20k to       &#163;30k [4.4].
Using this methodology, the intervention already brings a       value of around &#163;30k to &#163;45k       over the first two years after the intervention per patient.
Figure 2: Performance of Cadisc&#174; against competition against QALY&#8217;s and ODI over time [4.4, 4.6]      Under the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), one of the principal       condition-specific outcome       measures used in the management of spinal disorders, Cadisc&#174; has shown a       33% performance       improvement compared to competitor products and treatments (see Figure 2       right) [4.5, 4.6].
Between October 2009 and the end of July 2013, 226 patients received       these implants; the       operative success rate was 100% [4.3].
In 2011, after the clinical trials for Cadisc&#174;-L, Dick Zeilstra, the       trial's principal investigator,       highlighted the enormous significance of the discs for patient well-being:       "Over 80% of patients       experienced a clinically significant improvement in Oswestry Disability       Index (ODI) scores and       there was an average improvement in ODI scores of 63% at 12 months; this       compares with an       average improvement of 47% in studies of other disc prostheses.
Patients       also experienced       remarkable improvement in quality of life, with Cadisc&#174;-L patients       accruing 0.7 of a Quality       Adjusted Life Year (QALY) at 12 months.
In recently published trials,       competitor products       demonstrated a mean accrual of 0.14 of a QALY at 12 months and 0.41 at 24       months."
[4.5]     The biomechanical advantages of Cadisc&#174; and its ability to mimic the       natural disc, informed by       UoN research, have been commended by Dr. Hamid Afshar, one of the leading       surgeons       specialising in this area: "The Cadisc&#174; concept is very unique &#8212; a single       block disc with no metal       components which offers biomechanics similar to the natural disc.
Conceptually, it's the ideal       solution for the spine.
Aside from the biomechanical advantages, the       Cadisc&#174; also offers MR and       CT imaging compatibility which allows clear visualisation of the adjacent       skeletal anatomy and       neural tissues.
Having nearly 10 years of product development and testing       provides surgeons the       reassurance that the device will meet the mechanical and functional       demands of the spine.
The       Cadisc&#174; technology has helped patients become pain free and enable them to       return to work.
In       particular, It gives young patients (20-50 years) the opportunity to       return to a more active, pain-free       lifestyle" [4.7].
Commercial benefits     The research directly contributed to the development and sales of       Ranier's two flagship products,       Cadisc&#174;-L and Cadisc&#174;-C. &#163;8M of third-party investment was secured (from       Alliance Trust Equity       Partners (ATEP) and First Ventures) to fund the clinical testing and       European launch in February       2008 [4.8] followed by a further injection of &#163;5M in 2010 by the same       companies [4.3, 4.9].
Both       products, along with their associated surgical instruments, have been       successful in gaining CE       marks and have been sold commercially throughout Europe since 2009.
An       application for an IDE       clinical study was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)       on June 27th 2011       with a view to marketing the devices in the USA and is pursuing further       funding to enable full scale       clinical trials to obtain full FDA approval.
Distribution contracts were       signed in early 2013 to cover       the supply of products to the surgical community in South Africa,       Australia and New Zealand [4.10       a&amp;b].
The research has transformed Cambridge-based Ranier Technology from a       small medical device       development company into the only UK manufacturer of total disc       replacements.
Cadisc&#174; now       accounts for all of the company's business.
It has gained international       reach, exporting 90% of its       production, mainly to Germany.
Since 2008 its workforce has grown to 35,       and its turnover has       increased by more than 80% between 2008 and 2013 [4.3].
