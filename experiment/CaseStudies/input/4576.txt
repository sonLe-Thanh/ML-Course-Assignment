     The body of work and expertise created by UAL researchers has helped       position the UK as a leader in the field of Sustainable Fashion and       Textiles.
Impact is demonstrated through work with the UK government,       industry bodies, corporations, and via exhibitions and publications, that       have raised awareness of the issues with the wider public and industry.
Research has influenced UK government policy through work with Defra on       the Sustainable Clothing Roadmap and Action Plan (commenced in       Sept 2007 and first Action Plan published in Feb 2009, subsequent updates       in Sept 2009 and Feb 2010) that brought together over 300 UK fashion and       textile organisations.
Williams and Black worked closely with Defra on       this initiative, with Shared Talent informing its development and       being cited eight times in the Action Plan (2010 update).
UAL researchers       (Black, Fletcher, Goldsworthy and Williams) were represented on four out       of five strands investigated (with associated projects) by Defra under the       initiative.
The Sustainable Clothing Roadmap and Action Plan were awarded       The 2013 Global Leadership Award in Sustainable Apparel by the       Swedish fashion industry.
CSF (Fletcher, Williams) is co-secretariat to       the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Ethics and Sustainability         in Fashion chaired by Baroness Young of Hornsey, providing agendas       and content for the group and debates.
Fletcher has twice given       presentations to the APPG (2009 and 2011), and wrote a briefing paper for       Baroness Mackintosh for the first debate on ethics and sustainability in       the House of Lords (03/11).
Williams wrote a briefing paper for Baroness       Young of Hornsey for a second House of Lords debate (03/13), who opened       with `Special thanks go to Dilys Williams, the head of the CSF, for         bringing me up to date on key developments.'
Internationally,       representatives from Sweden's MISTRA Foundation for Environmental Research       consulted UAL researchers, when formulating their sustainable fashion       research programme in 2010 (now in progress with collaboration from Earley       and TFRC).
TED's TEN has been used to encourage new thinking in organisations       such as the VF Corporation, USA and H&amp;M, Sweden.
Since 2011 Earley has       delivered training programmes for H&amp;M based on TED's TEN.
`TED's         ideas offered a really informative, inspiring and accessible way for our         designers to grasp the broad landscape of sustainable design.
In a short         space of time we found creative ways to make product and service         innovations.'
(Johan Ward, Head of Sustainability, H&amp;M).
Earley       has worked with 28 Swedish and Danish brands (2010-2013) via the       Sustainable Fashion Academy, Stockholm (SFA).
`When empowering key         people in fashion companies [...] with TED's tools, companies realise         that working with sustainability can lead to tangible, commercially         viable results, quite quickly.'
(Mike Schragger, SFA, Stockholm).
During 2011 and 2012, VF Corporation commissioned Earley (with Politowicz)       to develop a series of exhibits, workshops and lectures for the VF Summit,       USA, demonstrating approaches to sustainable textile design products based       on TED's TEN.
In 2011 Earley and Politowicz delivered a       sustainability workshop to the top 20 leaders of VF, including the CEO and       group presidents.
Work with the Nordic Fashion Association's Nordic         Initiative Clean and Ethical (NICE) resulted in TED's TEN       becoming part of the NICE educational programme and being included in NICE         Code of Conduct and Manual for the Fashion and Textile Industry       (2012).
Approaches developed through Shared Talent were utilised by CSF       in the &#163;1.4 million ERDF funded London Style project.
In       collaboration with Newham College of Further Education, East London Design       Show and Holts Academy of Jewellery, the project provided specialist       business support to SMEs to enable them to access new markets through       sustainable fashion practice.
CSF focused on skills development relevant       to sustainability to help businesses meet growing demand for products with       high ethical and environmental standards.
As a result of the project, 198       out of the 346 businesses adopted an active environmental policy and/or       used an environmental management reporting tool.
CSF collaborated on       Nike's Mobilize Makers project (led by Williams), drawing on       understandings of the interconnected nature of the industry.
The project       resulted in Nike MAKING App (07/13) allowing designers and makers       to innovate through sustainability, using resources that reside within our       ecological limits.
Creative outputs have helped raise awareness of issues with regard to       fashion and textiles sustainability.
For example, UAL researchers were an       integral part of the Science Museum's exhibition Trash Fashion:         Designing Out Waste (06/10-09/11) seen by an estimated 700,000       visitors (Source: Science Museum).
Earley (with UAL staff Geesin, Round       and Bowles) produced new exhibits which demonstrated design-led concepts       on the re-use of old clothes and textiles.
Black was commissioned to       produce a considerately designed seamless one-piece sweater, shown       alongside a film of its making produced by the Science Museum.
CSF       (Williams and Fletcher) have worked with Marks and Spencer to raise public       awareness of their Shwopping programme via events and       installations.
Publications have contributed to raising general and       industry awareness.
Reviews for Eco Chic: The Fashion Paradox       (Black) include `a fascinating account of the fashion industry's         attempts to balance the conflicting demands of style-hungry consumers         and the impact it has on the planet' (The Ecologist), and       Black's Sustainable Fashion Handbook covers the industry from       micro businesses to high end designers and major companies and includes       academic essays by over 100 industry contributions, interviews, and       perspectives.
The significance of UAL research in the field is evidenced by       representation on high-profile bodies and at events including: the British       Standards Institute Sustainable Design Group, Soil Association Textile       Standards Committee and Member of the Advisory Panel for NICE (Fletcher),       with Earley and Politowicz are also advisors to NICE; Steering Group for       Fashioning an Ethical Industry, Reducing the Impact of Textiles on       Environment (RITE), expert judge for fashion category of The Observer       Ethical Awards from 2009 to 2011 and fashion category of Earth Awards 2010       (Williams); keynote at Towards Sustainability in the Textile and         Fashion Industry Conference, Copenhagen, 2011 (Fletcher); and       participation in the Copenhagen Fashion Summit in 2012, (Williams,       Earley, Fletcher and Politowicz), a conference gathering 1,000 fashion       professionals and leaders from 27 countries to discuss the importance of       making the fashion industry sustainable.
This included Williams' joint       leadership of the associated Youth Summit where 80 young people from       across Europe worked to articulate their demands for the future industry,       which they then presented to the main conference.
