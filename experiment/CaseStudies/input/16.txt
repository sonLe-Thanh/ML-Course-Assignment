     The reach of the impacts, cumulatively, has been       extensive in that the outworkings of the review of public administration       has, and will continue, to impact on all of the public sector in Northern       Ireland, notwithstanding the initial lack of involvement of civil service       departments.
The Northern Ireland economy is highly reliant on the public       sector employing approximately 220,000 people or 31% of the workforce.
The       review of public administration impacts not only on these employees but       ultimately on all those using public services.
The significance of the impacts, or how much difference       it has made to beneficiaries, is listed as follows:            By challenging from the outset the premise of the review of public         administration, in particular, why government departments were excluded         from the review process, it has led to proposals to reduce the number of         government departments.
By contributing to the public consultation and subsequent policy         debate on the proposed number and powers of reorganised local         government, the final recommendations for reform have changed         accordingly.
By the researchers acting as academic advisors to a reform task force,         the research has shaped the model for regulating central-local         government relations in the future.
By conducting the first pilot exercise on community planning in a         local authority the research has been used as a benchmark to roll-out         this process across Northern Ireland.
By providing academic advice to two key non-departmental public bodies         (Local Government Staff Commission and Northern Ireland Housing Council)         earmarked for abolition under the review, their futures have been         secured.
Attribution and other significant factors: It will always       be difficult to establish a direct cause and effect relationship between       research conducted and impacts on public policy.
There is however a       cumulative body of evidence to suggest that Carmichael and Knox's research       was, and continues to be, seen as an independent source of data which had       significant influence in a highly political milieu.
The review of public       administration was initiated in 2002 by the devolved administration at the       behest of locally elected ministers.
Given the instability associated with       the wider political settlement in Northern Ireland, the Assembly was       suspended four times during the period between December 1999 and March       2007 until the St Andrew's Agreement (2006) resulted in a power sharing       Executive.
The review of public administration became embroiled in these       wider political machinations with British (direct rule) Ministers pushing       ahead with public sector reforms against the will of local representatives       and `threatening' them to strike a macro political deal or live with the       consequences of their imposed reforms (`like it or lump it' approach).
In       this politically charged environment Carmichael and Knox were able to       provide evidenced-based advice to politicians and senior government       officials within the wider constraints of these macro political       developments.
In short, their advice was valued and influenced the       unfolding review of public administration in several ways.
