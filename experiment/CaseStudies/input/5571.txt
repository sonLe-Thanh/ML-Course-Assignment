Impact on Oxfam's UK Poverty Programme     Collins's contributions led Oxfam to fund research for their UK Poverty       Programme.
This work (3.2) was reported widely in 2008 (e.g.
The         Herald, July 2008, BBC Scotland News, June 2008) and written       up for three professional journals.
It was used by the Clydebank       Independent Resource Centre to ensure its survival in a time of cuts       (2008-present), and used by Oxfam, both in highlighting the plight of       community organisations to government and in reconfiguring its UK Poverty       programme in Scotland (2008-present) (5.1).
This success led to further Oxfam requests for engagement with Collins       and UWS colleagues.
Collins's 2009 report on `Welfare to Work' (3.4),       again funded by Oxfam, was also widely reported (e.g.
BBC Radio Scotland's       `Good Morning Scotland', April 2009), used by the high profile Scottish       Campaign on Welfare Reform (e.g, The Herald, 18/02/11), featured       at the annual Document Film Festival in Glasgow (October, 2009), and       became the subject of high-level discussions between Oxfam and the DWP       (2009) (5.1).
Collins also introduced Oxfam to a UWS economist to assist with the       economic side of Oxfam's policy.
This led to Oxfam Scotland's high profile       Whose Economy?
seminar programme (2010-11, co-organised by UWS and       Oxfam), which in turn provided the basis for its more recent Our         Economy report and strategy (2013).
The report fully acknowledges       the contribution of UWS staff, and has substantially influenced Oxfam's       work at UK level and internationally (5.1; 5.2).
The UWS-Oxfam Partnership     The growing engagement between UWS and Oxfam led the latter in the summer       of 2011 to instigate a UWS-Oxfam Partnership (5.1).
The Partnership,       established in 2012 with &#163;50,000 of initial funding from UWS, primarily       comprises:            A Policy Forum, focused on Oxfam's ongoing policy development and         advocacy strategy, engaging UWS academics with Oxfam, its community         partners, and a range of other organisations beyond academia (e.g.
NHS;         SURF; Scottish Community Development Council; New Policy Institute;         Poverty Alliance; STUC; Scottish Family Business Association);       A programme of research collaborations (currently nine), initially         funded by the Partnership, engaging academics with Oxfam and its         community partners, both to support these organisations and to inform         Oxfam's policy development and advocacy strategy.
Some of these         collaborations are already producing impacts of their own (5.1).
This Partnership, which Collins leads from the UWS side, is progressing       well and working towards levering external RKE funding (5.3).
It is seen       by Oxfam as an exemplar for its wider activities (5.1).
Impact in Public Health Field     Collins's work impacted significantly on the work of NHS Health Scotland       and the Glasgow Centre for Population Health (GCPH &#8212; a collaboration       between NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Glasgow City Council, the Scottish       Government and the University of Glasgow) (5.4).
Hitherto, the causes of Scotland's health deficits have been inadequately       understood.
Remedial interventions have had little or no impact.
In 2008,       Collins was approached by an NHS colleague (Gerry McCartney) to       collaborate on broadening understanding of how immediate causes are linked       to broader processes of socio-economic and political change (3.3) (5.4).
Discussions (2009-10) were conducted with key public health figures       charged with reporting to the Scottish Government.
From 2010, the two Public Health Programme Managers at the GCPH became       involved in furthering the work initiated by Collins and McCartney, and       co-authoring outputs.
In 2011, GCPH itself published one of these &#8212; a       major report endorsing and further developing the broadening of       perspective advocated by Collins (3.5, see also 3.6).
All this work has       been widely reported in the media, at Scottish level (e.g.
The         Scotsman, August 2011, The Herald, June 2012, Sunday Herald,       August 2011; BBC Scotland News, November 2012, Scotland on Sunday,         June 2013), UK level (e.g.
The Guardian, June 2011 and       November 2012, The Economist, August 2012) and internationally       (e.g.
Le Monde, November 2012).
The ongoing impact is now clearly reflected in the continuing work of NHS       Health Scotland and the GCPH &#8212; all of which is conducted `beyond academia'       (5.5, 5.6).
It has also informed the critical assessment of prevailing       interventions focusing on `immediate' causes, to the neglect of `causes of       the causes' (5.7).
This is evident in a recent Herald report on       the current view of Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, Sir Harry Burns       (5.7).
Urban Regeneration and the `Community Voices Network'     Collins's work raised broad critical awareness of the failings of the       prevailing regeneration model.
From 2006, it raised particular awareness       as to the nature of the Community Voices Network &#8212; a national community       organisation, created in 2006, led by a private company and funded by the       Scottish Executive.
This impacted on wider attitudes to the organisation,       which was subsequently disbanded by the Scottish Government (in 2009)       (5.8)     Impact on Trade Union Organisations     Collins's work played a key role in Clydebank Trades Council's securing a       2007 Scottish TUC mandate to organise a national conference (`Communities,       Regeneration and Democracy', September 2008), which Collins addressed.
This has contributed to ensuring that community engagement and       regeneration have remained on the agenda of the STUC and individual unions       (e.g.
Unite and Unison).
(5.9)     Collins's research on the UCS Work-In was the basis for a national       training event for Unite trade union activists (August 2011), and was used       extensively by FairPley Associates, who organised this training and also       the wider programme of celebrations for the 40th anniversary of       the Work-In sponsored by the Unite trade union(in 2011-12).
Collins       provided the material for David Hayman's re-enactment of Jimmy Reid's role       at the main anniversary event (February, 2012).
