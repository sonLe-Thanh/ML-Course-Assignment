     Impacts of research at The Open University on environment, development       and the media fall into three areas:     A.
Communicating `interdependence' and global environmental         change in wider media     The notion of `interdependence' as a way of theorising transnational       relations has informed public debates via:     i. a series of sell-out public Interdependence Day events held at the       Royal Geographic Society (RGS) (350 participants on each occasion) and       Southbank's Bargehouse (1000 participants);     ii.
three Interdependence Reports, produced with the New       Economics Foundation (the last in 2009; 5.6), which gained wide       attention and obtained coverage in a range of news outlets.
The Secretary       for State for International Development at the time, Hilary Benn, who       contributed to the volume Do Good Lives Have to Cost the Earth [5.7]       which directly drew on their arguments (e.g.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8461727.stm,       17 January 2010).
The reports thus shaped modes of political thought.
B. Impacts on content and tone of mainstream programming     Since 2008, Smith's arguments about the need to expand the range of tones       and voices on climate change [5.3; 5.5] have led to a shift in the       BBC's approach to programming.
Specific seasons and programmes widened the       range of contributors and perspectives (more global; more varied in       content; more direct testimony and thus engaging diverse publics) in       response to the seminars and the research underpinning them.
Complementing his work on the Real World seminars, Smith worked       as a consultant on climate change for BBC Vision and News.
Since 2004 he       has advised senior decision makers on climate change in order to foster       the cultural imaginations required in the contemporary anthropocene       period.
Smith and colleagues' seminar work underpinned the commissioning       of groundbreaking material such as the world's first climate change       political thriller, Burn Up (BBC 2, 2008), and a Springwatch         Special (BBC 2, 2010).
Burn Up launched with 2.6 million       viewers and 12.3% market share (46% higher than BBC 2's prime time       average), and average viewing figures for the Springwatch Special       were 2 million.
Smith was academic adviser for both programmes.
TV       producer John Lloyd (originator Blackadder and QI), who       participated at the Real World seminars, stressed their       `astonishing' impact, commenting that `none of this would have happened       without Joe Smith' and concluding that `It is a textbook example of how       essential it is to continue funding "pure" academic research because,       without it, the "practical" world would hardly change at all'.
Shifts in BBC programming have been directly attributed to the seminars       organised by Smith, and often specifically to him, by academics [5.4];       bloggers [http://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2008/07/04/5287;       5.9]; reports [5.1]; and media, including two Mail on         Sunday stories (19 November 2011, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2063737/BBCs-Mr-Climate-Change-15-000-grants-university-rocked-global-warning-scandal.html;       26 November 2011, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066706/BBC-sought-advice-global-warming-scientists-economy-drama-music--game-shows.html).
For instance, a storm of climate contrarian newspaper and blog activity       around the seminars charged Smith and his BBC partners with shaping BBC       policy on climate change:     `Billed as its "scientific adviser" was Dr Joe Smith of The Open       University, the self-described "action researcher" who, as Harrabin's       partner in the CMEP [Cambridge Media Environment Programme], had helped       organise all those seminars to brief BBC staff on climate issues, notably       the gathering in 2006 which played such an important part in leading the       BBC to adopt a more committed stance in its coverage of global warming.'
(Booker, 2011, p. 73; 5.2)     (Also see: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100223342/the-bbc-long-ago-became-a-mouthpiece-for-green-lunatics-why-does-it-pretend-otherwise/.)
Although       failing to represent the nature of the meetings accurately, these pieces       do demonstrate the continued and ongoing impact of Smith's research on BBC       programming.
C. Directly commissioning new work     Based on research insights about the need to engage diverse publics in       new ways, Smith also co-commissioned five hours of BBC World Service radio       programming as part of the Creative Climate project (Climate         Connections, 2009 and 2010,       http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/2009/11/091118_climate_connection_listing.shtml)       and six BBC World News broadcasts (Hope in a Changing Climate,       2009,       http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/ou-on-the-bbc-hope-changing-climate-0,       &amp; and Earth Reporters, 2011, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-13359848).
These programmes covered pressing issues at the intersection of       environmental research and action.
The reach of these programmes is evidenced by the audience figures:       advertisers on the channel accept viewing figures of 70 million on first       BBC World transmissions, and the BBC World Service Radio slots reached       approximately 40 million listeners.
The TV and radio shows reached further       audiences (tens of thousands) via their free online screening on the Open       University, BBC and TVE platforms.
These commissions were directly       informed by the research outputs outlined in section 2.
They pursued the       research conclusions regarding the need for more plural and dynamic       representations of environmental change by means of a diary motif that is       threaded throughout the broadcast and web content in the Creative Climate       project.
In a mould-breaking move, the research and policy communities are       represented in the films by a much more diverse body of leading       contributors, including researchers and policy experts based in the global       South and, specifically, young women scientists.
Smith (working with BBC       Comedy Executive Producer Jon Plowman) also commissioned ten short films       arising out of a competition for young film-making talent http://www.bbc.co.uk/filmnetwork/features/creative_climate_shorts_2.
Collectively, these have been viewed at least 20,000 times online, and       screened at film festivals, including the British Film Institute Festival,       Futures Film Festival (winner) and Screentest 2013, and are evidence of       Smith's role in producing new cultural imaginations of environmental       change.
