     In 2008, Parliament's Health Select Committee reported on an inquiry into       the NHS and Health Inequalities, to which Professor Dame Sarah had given       evidence about KCL research showing the inequitable distribution, funding       and implementation of health visiting services in relation to area       deprivation (Source 1).
She also presented a report on these topics to the       Early Years Commission, established in 2008 by the Centre for Social       Justice, a Conservative-leaning think tank which included several       references to KCL research (Source 2).
Professor Dame Sarah's testimony to       these two inquiries, and the research studies she mentioned, were cited in       the Conservative Research Department's Helping New Families policy       document, which set out its vision for a universal health visiting service       (Source 3).
This document supplied the rationale for the Conservative       Party's manifesto pledge to increase the number of health visitors by       4,200.
The manifesto pledge was carried forward by the new Coalition       government and included in its 2010 Spending Review, despite the general       commitment to a 20% reduction in public spending.
The KCL research studies underpinning Professor Cowley's report also       provided core evidence for the UK Public Health Association's (UKPHA)       report Health Visiting Matters, which was developed in       collaboration with Professor Cowley and launched at the House of Commons       in November 2009 (Source 4).
The UKPHA was an independent voluntary       organisation that acts as an information platform to support people       working in public health, now part of the Faculty of Public Health.
Health         Visiting Matters discussed a number of challenges including the need       for secure funding, criteria for best practice, a stronger evidence base       for health visiting and future options for employment, education and       recruitment.
The Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association (CPHVA) was       also very active in lobbying prior to the 2010 election, and some of its       publications are cited in Helping New Families.
As part of the       Department of Health's Action on Health Visiting programme set up       in 2009, the CPHVA published a report entitled Getting it right for         children and families: Defining research to maximise the contribution of         the health visitor.
That report cited several KCL studies as       instances of good practice (for example Cowley et al, 2007 is discussed as       an existing data source available to influence health visitor service       development )(Source 5) Additionally, in its document Exploring the         role of the Health Visitor and the Registered Nurse in the Health         Visitor Team and the Health Visiting Service (Source 6) the CPHVA       drew on KCL findings regarding health visiting assessment processes to       recommend that, while registered nurses could contribute to the health       visiting service, their role should not go beyond the boundaries of their       training.
The interim workforce/funding and caseload weighting models developed at       King's led to widespread acceptance of the need for more health visitors       and for their numbers to be distributed equitably.
These models have been       used in a number of local Trusts and by at least three Strategic Health       Authorities (East of England, North West, London) (Source 7).
This was the       `public face' of KCL work, which became known through the policy evidence       outlined above, but which drew on a far wider body of knowledge and       understanding about health visiting developed over two decades of       research.
Our standing in this field was summarised in a local authority       scrutiny review of health visiting as follows: `The reason that Prof         Cowley's model has been chosen is that she is the academic who has         nationally done the most work in this field and is always quoted in the         work by e.g.
Commons Select Committees etc.,' (Source 8, para 107       page 31).
It is arguable, therefore, that the government's commitment to expanding       the health visiting workforce was influenced by the whole body of research       at King's.
The significance of Professor Cowley's work in this field was       noted in her DBE citation, where the academic research she led was       described as having, "created the evidence base for modern health         visiting.
She has ensured that this research has been translated into         practice to improve health outcomes for children, families and         communities and has been an especial champion for the most vulnerable         families."
Once in power, the Coalition government developed its own Health         Visitor Implementation Plan (Source 9), aimed at growing the       workforce, mobilising the profession and aligning delivery systems.
This       report heavily cited KCL research regarding the health visitor's `journey'       with a client and how best it should be initiated and developed, and the       need to retain health visiting services in forms that would help people       most in need.
To support the plan, the DH Policy Research Programme       commissioned researchers at KCL to undertake a programme of research into       the provision of health visiting services under the leadership of       Professor Jill Maben (Professor of Nursing Research 2011-present; Senior       Research Fellow 2007-2011.)
and Professor Cowley.
Outputs from this       programme included a literature review which confirmed the findings from       KCL research on the importance of service organisation and the skills,       attributes and values of health visitors in promoting access to and uptake       of the service (Source 10).
In February 2013 according to the NHS Information Centre for Health and       Social Care, 1000 more health visitors had been employed (now 9113) than       the baseline figure at May 2010 (Source 11).
