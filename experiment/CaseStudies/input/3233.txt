     The global impact of research undertaken in trimaran ships by the Marine       Research Group at UCL       over the past 20 years, which influenced Classification Design Rules for       Trimaran Ships, can be       identified in the period 2008-13 by considering how RV Triton has been       adopted as a tropical patrol       vessel and the building of new trimaran ships, notably the Independence         Class of littoral combat       ships for the US Navy [f] and the introduction of a new trimaran-variant       car ferry.
As described in Section 2, initial research into ocean-going trimaran       vessels was undertaken at       UCL with a focus on structure, form, seakeeping, resistance, and       propulsion arrangements.
This       led to the building of a research vessel RV Triton, which was sold       in 2002 after having completed       extensive trials.
Over the past 5+ years it has been used by the       Australian Customs and Border       Protection Service (ACBP) as a coastal patrol and fisheries protection       vessel on the northern       tropical coast of Australia.
ACV Triton was refitted with additional       accommodation, a more powerful       propulsion plant, and a command and control centre which was easily       facilitated within its trimaran       hullform, which itself remained unchanged.
Triton was selected over       alternative equivalent       monohull vessels for the patrol role because the trimaran hullform that       UCL designed offers lower       resistance, improved sea-keeping and improved larger upper deck area,       which enhances       operational capability.
These advantages manifest themselves in achieving       a superior range and       improved fuel economy resulting from its inherently lower resistance;       higher operating speeds       which is important to the ACBP since the ships are used to catch       smugglers; and its large working       deck area which allows for multiple operations of helicopters and boats.
Overall, the impact of       using a trimaran in this role has provided enhanced capability at lower       fuel consumption and       reduced emissions over similar sized monohull or catamaran vessels [a].
At the end of the Cold War the US Navy determined a need for new ship       types to combat       asymmetrical littoral (close to shore) threats and the littoral combat       ship (LCS) concept was born.
In 2010, Austal's USS Independence was the first modular       high-speed trimaran LCS to be       commissioned into the US Navy; this was followed in 2012 by USS         Coronado, a second trimaran       vessel of similar design that completed trials in August 2013.
Four more       trimaran Independence         Class vessels have been ordered since 2008, including USS         Jackson, construction of which began       in 2012 [d], and eventually a fleet of 20+ LCS trimaran vessels are       expected [b].
An important       economic benefit of the trimaran LCS programme has been to support jobs at       Austal in Alabama,       USA, which has been able to double its workforce to 3,800 [e].
In 2010,       the Navy awarded Austal a       $432-million contract to build a trimaran LCS, with a further $681-million       contract for two more       ships awarded in March 2013 [b, c].
The trimaran Independence Class LCS design has been tested       thoroughly by the US Navy and       shown to provide significant benefits to naval operations, including the       largest usable payload       volume per tonne of ship displacement of all US Navy surface combatants, a       large flight deck that       has facilitated near simultaneous operation of two helicopters and proven       capability of operating       the large H-53 helicopter, and operations of multiple unmanned vehicles       for reconnaissance and       warfare operations.
The increased stability of the trimaran hullform has       improved flight operations       by allowing them to be achieved in higher sea-states than equivalent-sized       monohulls and       catamarans.
Other operational benefits result from the ability of the       trimaran configuration to       effectively decouple the resistance/powering from the stability relative       to an equivalent monohull       which can yield a reduction in resistance at higher speeds.
The subsequent       reduction in the       vessel's full-speed power requirements allows a corresponding reduction of       around one-third in       both fuel consumption and associated emissions [c].
Chief of Naval       Operations Adm. Gary       Roughead praised the Navy's plan to add both ship designs to the fleet       [2010]: "The LCS is         uniquely designed to win against 21st century threats in coastal waters         posed by increasingly         capable submarines, mines and swarming small craft.
Both designs provide         the capabilities our         Navy needs, and each offers unique features that will provide fleet         commanders with a high level of         flexibility in employing these ships."
[c]     The trimaran concept is also useful for commercial vessels: the trimaran       ferry Benchijigua Express       entered service in 2005 and has been successfully used to carry cars and       passengers between the       Canary Islands throughout the REF impact period.
The design of the ferry,       also built by Austal,       draws on the experimental results UCL obtained from its role in the       development of RV Triton [h].
In common with other trimaran designs, the reduced resistance resulting       from its three slender       hullforms means the ferry uses much less fuel at its high speed (40+ knot       operation) when       compared to an equivalent-sized catarmaran or monohull, which confers an       important advantage in       the competitive ferry market [i].
Benchijigua Express ferry's       improved stability also ensures a softer       roll, enhancing passenger comfort.
Auto-Express, the second       generation of trimaran passenger       ferries launched in 2012, offers further benefits still.
The improved       design has resulted in an       increased waterline length providing improved internal volume and a speed       of 39 knots [g].
According to the Head of Research and Development at Austal: "The         trimaran offers greater speed         for the same cargo weight and the same power compared to a monohull and         a catamaran.
It's got         better passenger comfort, by which I mean less sea-sickness.
It's got a         better sea-keeping ability &#8212;         able to operate in higher sea states...
The power consumption is         reduced about 20% when         operating in a seaway compared to a catamaran...and reduced by as much         as 50% when         compared with a monohull operating in waves..." [g].
The rules governing the design of ships (naval and commercial) are       predominantly the       responsibility of national Classification Societies such as Lloyds       Register (LR) for UK.
New       Classification Society Rules for Trimaran Ships were developed in 2004,       with UCL involvement       and drawing on expertise developed during the research described in       Section 2.
Since 2008, the       Marine Research Group at UCL has been assisting LR with the approval of       new rules governing       naval vessel designs including structure and propulsion, thereby providing       the foundations that       enable ship builders to offer trimaran ships to their customers.
Transfer       of specialist advice based       on our research has been effected via Professor Bucknall's provision of       expertise into the LR Naval       Rules Technical Committee, of which he is a member [i].
