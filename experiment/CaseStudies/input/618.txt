     The research has impacted on policies and practice in the treatment of       those with IDD exhibiting challenging, abnormal and criminal behaviour       both in the UK and overseas.
The beneficiaries have included policy-makers       and practitioners in health and social care, the carers who live with       those with IDD, and those with IDD themselves who have benefited from more       humane and appropriate interventions instead of punitive ones.
The Chief       Executive of the Care Quality Commission states that the researchers have       made `an outstanding contribution to improving the quality...care and       support for people with learning disabilities' [see corroboration 5.1].
This is confirmed by the Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation       who writes that the research has made `a major contribution' to the       treatment of those exhibiting challenging behaviour [corrob 5.2].
Impact on government policy and legislation     The Department of Health's (DoH) 2007 policy guidance on services for       people with IDD [corrob 5.3] and the Government's policy document Valuing         People Now [corrob 5.4] both cited this research, concluding       that, `where individuals with problems are cared for in environments which       do not respond well to their needs, challenging behaviour is likely to       develop and then to remain in the person's repertoire' and `the reduction       of challenging behaviour is likely to require attention to other factors       (such as communication) than just the behaviour itself' [corrob 5.3,         p.7 and p.9].
The recommendations of Mencap and the Challenging       Behaviour Foundation's influential document `Out of Sight' [corrob         5.5] also drew directly from Mansell's and McGill's research.
Following this, and as a result of the research on Positive Behaviour       Support (PBS), the DoH commissioned McGill to contribute to a service       specification for commissioners, policy-makers and regulators on PBS       services which is being integrated with a similar specification for       services for young people with IDD commissioned from Gore (Kent, 2007 -).
Once integrated, the combined specification will be disseminated through       the NHS Commissioning Board and the Local Government Association.
McGill       is also contributing to the development of guidance on PBS through his       membership of steering groups for Skills for Care and the Royal College of       Nursing.
Following the Winterbourne View scandal, McGill chaired a DoH       stakeholder event in 2012 and was invited to chair a Ministerial round       table in 2013.
Murphy sits on the Ministry of Justice's NOMS (National       Offender Management Service) committee on Learning Disabilities, providing       advice on screening for IDD in prisons.
These interactions evidence the       influence of the research on government policy across a range of       departments dealing with people with challenging behaviour and IDD.
Improving professional standards and guidelines     The involvement of the researchers in influential policy networks has       allowed the research to be disseminated to key stakeholders.
For example,       in fulfillment of a pledge by the DoH following the Winterbourne View       scandal, Murphy chairs the NICE Guideline Development Group concerned with       challenging behaviour among people with learning and intellectual       disabilities [corrob 5.6].
This role ensures that research evidence       will guide subsequent practice in health and social care services for       people with IDD and challenging behaviour.
Murphy also sits on the DoH's       National Learning Disabled Offenders Steering Group (NLDOSG), which has       produced guidance for professionals from health, social care, police,       prison and probation services (Positive         Practice, Positive Outcomes).
The Steering Group has also designed       training for prison officers and established IDD screening in prisons [corrob         5.7].
As a result of the research in relation to mild IDD and challenging       behaviour in the criminal justice system, Murphy was also asked to join       the Steering Committee for Jenny Talbot's `No One Knows' programme (Prison       Reform Trust), which used Murphy and Mason's learning disability screening       tool (LIPS) and Murphy's checklists for action for people with IDD in the       CJS [corrob 5.8; 5.9).
The Director of the Prison Reform Trust       states the research `has made a significant impact on national policy and       practice for people with learning disabilities who find themselves in       contact with the criminal justice system' [corrob 5.9].
Murphy was       also invited to help the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities       (part of Mental Health Foundation) and NOMS to adapt the `Thinking Skills'       Programme for people with IDD: this has been trialled in three prisons [corrob         5.2].
Murphy and Sinclair's research on sex offender treatment for       men with IDD - the Sex Offender Treatment Services       Collaborative-Intellectual Disabilities (SOTSEC-ID) programme - is now       used across the UK (over 500 therapists have been trained).
Therapists in       New Zealand (2009) and Japan (2013) have also completed training [corrob         5.10] and training has been requested in Australia and US.
Improving the quality of life of service users and their carers     The research has directly supported service users with severe IDD and       challenging behaviour and their families and carers.
For instance, McGill       helped to establish a UK charity in 1997, the Challenging         Behaviour Foundation (CBF) and remains as a trustee and contributor       to the charity's Challenging         Behaviour Charter.
CBF promotes evidence-based approaches to       challenging behaviour underpinned by the latest research (i.e.
non-institutional services, ethical use of physical intervention, and a       PBS approach) through a number of activities: CBF website, telephone       helpline (1391 calls in 2012); educational DVDs (including: `An       Introduction to Challenging Behaviour', of which 1286 have sold, and       `Self-Injurious Behaviour', of which 890 have sold) and CBF newsletter       (circulation of 5,000).
The Chief Executive states `The CBF has been very       successful at raising the profile of this marginalised group of       individuals, improving the quality of information and support to family       carers... in no small part due to the partnership developed with [these         researchers], which brings together the expertise of leading       academics in the field, with families supporting individuals on a day to       day basis' [corrob 5.11].
In another example of the research's       impact on service users, Murphy has also worked on a number of projects       offering direct support by producing `easy-read guides', both as part of       the DoH's National Learning Disabled Offenders Steering Group's work to       revise prison guides into `easy-read' formats (with Mencap) and also       co-authoring 'You're under Arrest' and `You're On Trial' easy-read books       for service users.
In sum, the research has led to better standards of care for those       exhibiting challenging behaviour by changing policy guidelines, resulting       in improved quality of life for service users and their carers.
