     All research highlighted in the topics above has impacted on       policymakers' decisions.
It has led to       corporate discussion and policy intervention which affected government       policy investments,       people's lives and future prospects.
The work has underpinned the South West of England Regional Development       Agency's       understanding of the South West economy in terms of key sectors, spatial       distribution and       concentration.
The research provided the RDA with a knowledge base of       those factors which could       be influenced to generate a positive impact on the region's productivity       and those over which the       agency had little or no control.
This was confirmed by the Chief Economist       at the South West RDA       who stated that, `This research identified and quantified a range of         economic factors influencing the         region's productivity gap which influenced strongly the internal debate         and decisions about policy         and real investments concerned with addressing productivity.'
In       particular, the research had a       significant impact on the development of regional economic policies in       respect of distance/time to       key markets and agglomeration effects, and impacted on the work of the       Regional Development       Agency's policy and activity.
In this respect, the Director of Strategy at       the South West RDA       disclosed that `The work was used by the South West RDA to inform the         Regional Economic         Strategy and the RDA's own Corporate Plans.
The work was reported to the         Board and the         Executive of the RDA and was an influence on the investment decisions         made, using both RDA         and EU funds.'
The RDA used the work to develop appropriate interventions on       communications, skill       development, investment and innovation.
As our testimonials illustrate,       the work influenced the       RDA's investment decisions (using both RDA and EU funds) and was often the       evidence base for       the South West of England Regional Economic Strategy, the South West of       England International       Trade Strategy, and the South West of England Regional Spatial Strategy.
The research highlighted in topic 1 above identified and quantified a       range of economic factors       influencing the regional productivity gap that exists across Britain.
As       our testimonials confirm, the       research was disseminated widely amongst local government, business       organisations and peers in       other regions and central government and influenced and enhanced job       creation while flattening       the welfare divide.
The research was used by the South West of England RDA       and the Welsh       Assembly Government to actively consider applied interventions in       communications (broadband in       particular), skills, investment and innovation and underpinned the       understanding of the South West       and Wales economies as a whole and in its parts (sectors and places).
The       SW Regional       Development Agency policy makers confirmed that the research was       disseminated wider afield       and across the country and was highly influential and frequently quoted by       the media and other       bodies to explain and justify development activity at various levels.
The spatial economic analysis research outlined in topic 2 formed an       important part of the       evidence base for formulating transport infrastructure improvement       policies from a productivity-enhancing       perspective in Wales and in targeting assistance for areas likely to       continue to suffer       from geographical isolation.
An offshoot of the research was the       examination of the impact of       "virtual peripherality" in the sense of an absence of Broadband access in       certain areas of Wales,       which was again commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government.
The Welsh       Assembly       Government has used this amongst other evidence as the foundation of       ambitious policies to       improve Broadband coverage in the Principality.
Recognition of the value       of this spatial economic       analysis has led to further recent work funded by the Government for Wales       using the       peripherality/accessibility model to investigate the impact of varying the       toll levels on the Severn       Crossings.
The spatial economic analysis was conducted in association with       Arup consultants who       provided traffic modelling.
Although not yet in the public realm owing to       political sensitivity, the       evidence has been used to formulate draft policies ready for adoption in       2015 when control of the       crossings passes to the Government for Wales.
The research outlined in topic 3 informed the preparation of the       Sub-Regional Economic       Assessment for the West of England (collectively the areas of the four       local councils of Bath and       North East Somerset; Bristol; North Somerset and South Gloucestershire)       being undertaken       largely `in-house.'
The Sub-Regional Economic Assessment informed, in       turn, the preparation of       the West of England Multi-Area Agreement.
The South West Councils Overview       and Review report       stated that the research `assisted the Partnership in clarifying the         actions required to deliver one of         the main outcomes of the MAA.
This was to attract and grow business         investment to increase         economic growth and competitiveness.'
