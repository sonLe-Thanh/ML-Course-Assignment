     This research has generated the following impact for policy making bodies       and migrant and       nomadic communities:            The use of a community-based research process to generate valid and         reliable data for         planning and policy decisions that affect mobile and migrant groups;       The extension of the research methodology to new areas, such as the         housing         requirements of black and minority ethnic households and the uses of         empty homes;       o Strengthening the voice of excluded groups in the planning and         policy-making         process.
o Supporting local authorities in fulfilling their statutory duties         regarding the         accommodation needs of mobile and migrant groups;       o Addressing a broad range of social needs affecting various migrant         communities,         particularly those from Eastern Europe and the problems facing Roma         communities         in six European countries;       Reducing exclusion, improving cohesion and improving life chances.
Reliable and Valid Data:             2008-2011: Migrant Communities: Scullion et al         conducted ten assessments of the         experiences and needs of migrant workers which supported local         authorities in         understanding migrant worker populations, particularly in terms of         experiences of         employment, accommodation, access to services and issues around         community cohesion         in local areas.
The recommendations have been used by the commissioning         bodies to         target resources for communities: The research findings and         recommendations in         Nottingham           were used to secure funding through the Migration Impact Fund to         set up five         new projects (housing, children's services, ESOL, Refugee Forum,         Volunteers) totalling         &#163;723,224 in the first year and &#163;719, 874 in the second year and         Liverpool City Council         used the Migration           Impact Funding to sign up to the Minimum Standards Charter: A         Voluntary Code of Practice on Employing Migrant and European Workers.
2008-2013: Gypsies and Travellers: Scullion et         al were contracted to conduct 18 Gypsy         and Traveller Accommodation Assessments (GTAAs) for local authorities.
In each case,         recommendations were incorporated into the relevant local authority's         Development Plan         in compliance with a statutory requirement to identify a supply of land         and options for         Gypsy and Traveller site development.
The GTAA carried out by Scullion         and colleagues         in Solihull,         has led to four potential locations being identified for site         development (see         Preferred           Options).
The GTAA in Warwick           led to the identification of 20           possible sites for         Gypsies and Travellers, where no specific accommodation needs for these         groups had         been identified prior to publication.
2011-2013: The Roma Source Project: Scullion et al provided the         principal research         support for the European Roma           SOURCE Project which looked at the experiences of         Roma communities in six countries and made recommendations for         addressing their         needs and promoting integration (see The           Limits of Inclusion?).
A second European         project Roma           MATRIX, with 19 partners in ten countries, including the         University of         Salford, is running from 2013 to 2015.
The Salford team is developing a         UK network of         policy makers, practitioners, researchers, end users and other         stakeholders to improve         integration of Roma by influencing both policy and practice and a Roma         mentoring         scheme.
Extension of the Research Methodology to New Areas:             2011-onwards: Building on the impact of projects with Gypsies,         Travellers and migrants,         Scullion et al.
were commissioned to work on the housing needs of Black         and minority         ethnic households (Dorset           and Poole, 2011) and Jewish communities in Greater         Manchester.
A 2010 study of Central and Eastern European migrants for         Tameside         Metropolitan Borough Council (Greater Manchester) led to the development         of a project         focusing on Greater Manchester's empty homes and how they might be used         to address         accommodation needs.
2013-2015: Scullion et al.
worked with         Tameside Council to         develop a successful application for a Knowledge           Transfer Partnership to address the         problem of empty homes; approaching empty home owners as another         hard-to-reach         community and better understanding the diverse needs of empty property         owners to         provide a range of solutions for returning their properties into use.
Strengthening the Voice of Excluded Groups in Planning and         Policy-Making Forums:            As a result of commissioned research into the needs and experiences of         migrant and         nomadic groups, Scullion has joined Europia, a community         organisation for Central and         Eastern European migrants in Greater Manchester with representatives         from migrant         communities, and Greater Manchester organisations.
Its purpose is to         promote         cooperation between migrant communities and local agencies to address: a         lack of         information and access to local services; complex rules on status and         entitlements;         limited availability of English classes; exploitation in the work-place         and accommodation;         increasing levels of homelessness and destitution; and inadequate links         with local         residents, voluntary agencies and other Greater Manchester networks.
Scullion has collaborated on two community-based research projects         with Europia and in         December 2011 she received a Beacon Recognition Award for         Community-University         Partnerships based on her partnership with Europia.
This Recognition         Award focused on         her engagement of community members in the research process,         particularly in relation to         providing training to community members as peer researchers.
