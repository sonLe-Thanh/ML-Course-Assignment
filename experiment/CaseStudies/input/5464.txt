     The outcomes of our research have provided the UK aerospace and defence       industry with an       improved process and useful scientific tools to support evidenced based       development decisions for       high value products for which reliability is a key business performance       measure.
The REMM process has been adopted in its entirety by Aero Engine Controls       (AEC), part of the       Rolls-Royce group.
The AEC Technical Manager with responsibility for New       Product Innovation       has stated (Source 1) that "due to the insights gained through REMM, my         company fundamentally         changed its reliability culture".
He further explains that: "we         have introduced a revised reliability         process, heavily based on the REMM principles, on every new product         introduction since 2008.
In-house         engineering procedures have been developed which specify the mandatory         use of the         REMM process with a design gate checklist..." Further, he comments       that: "A particularly important         role has been played by the methods developed by Strathclyde for         elicitation of engineering         judgement and a model to combine information gained from such         judgemental data together with         statistical mining of operational experience data to provide estimates         of reliability."
Our reliability growth modelling has had significant impact because,       firstly, it was aligned with the       needs of decision-makers and integrated with key stages in the product       development cycle and,       secondly, the model was generated from sound theory, but operationalized       to be populated with       available, relevant data so that it was meaningful to the users.
The value       of our research as an       innovation in reliability growth management has been recognised by the       professional community       through multiple awards.
AgustaWestland won the 2011 UK Safety and       Reliability Society prize for       a paper describing what the firm termed "a design influence process"       during the development of a       new helicopter.
The Principal Reliability Engineer explained that "The         basis for much of this         analysis was techniques developed during the ...Reliability Enhancement         Modelling Methodology         (REMM) project" (Source 2).
Our impact has extended beyond the companies involved in the original       REMM project.
To better       understand how they could improve product reliability and support       packages, Selex ES engaged       with us in 2009.
The Emerging Technologies Manager (Source 3) stated that       "The REMM         modelling process has now been put in place with the assistance of         Strathclyde to address the         necessary building blocks for reliability process improvement."
He       then explains that the model is       allowing Selex ES to "prioritise aspects of design to address for         reliability improvement" and       concludes that "the implementation of REMM has been recognised by         winning bronze at the 2010         Finmeccanica Innovation Award scheme".
Our modelling framework has also impacted the Reliability Case presented       by firms to the Ministry       of Defence (MoD).
Airborne Systems Ltd. (at the time called Irvine       Aerospace) used our modelling       for a novel reliability assessment allowing the MoD to better identify and       assess the risk associated       with procuring a high value aerospace product.
Source 4 is an invited       discussion piece in a       professional trade publication with a description of the application of       the methods to Airborne       Systems Ltd.
Acknowledging the impact of REMM on industry, the MoD's       Principal Reliability       Engineer (Source 5) stated that "the fuller impact of the research is         being observed in the evidence         of analysis presented in the Reliability Cases submitted to the MoD for         review."
Our process and methods also have more general applicability to other       high value manufacturing       industries beyond the aerospace and defence sector because our research is       one of three growth       models in the reliability standards produced by the International       Electrotechnical Committee (IEC).
The IEC is the international standards and conformity assessment body for       all fields of       electrotechnology.
International standards by their very nature have a       global impact since       standards are mandated or advised by customers within contracts and can be       transferred through       the supply-chain so that SMEs as well as multi-nationals benefit.
All       international reliability       standards are developed by the IEC, but are also distributed through       national agencies, such as       the British Standards Institute (BSI).
The current reliability growth       modelling standard, IEC 61164,       is dual numbered as BS EN 61164 by BSI (Source 6).
This issue of the       standard is the one used       by UK and international firms over the period 2008 to the present.
A       revision of the international       reliability growth management and modelling standard is under development;       Prof Walls is the UK       expert on the project team (Source 7).
Elements of our REMM research have       also been included in       an informative annex, called the `elicitation of Bayesian priors for       reliability modelling', of the 2013       edition of IEC 61710, a standard which covers general analysis of       reliability data from system test       and operation (Source 8).
The Chairman of the IEC Technical Committee (TC) with responsibility for       international reliability       standards (i.e.
TC 56), himself an experienced reliability practitioner       with a distinguished career in       Danish companies such as Nokia and Bang &amp; Olufson, has commented       (Source 9) that the       "academic research of Profs Walls and Quigley is fundamental not only         to providing industry with         sound, robust modelling mechanisms, but also making these models         accessible and         understandable through an exposition within the language of         standardisation."
