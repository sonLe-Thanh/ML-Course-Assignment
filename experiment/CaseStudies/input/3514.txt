     Functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders affect a significant       proportion of the population.
For instance gastro-oesophageal reflux       disease (GORD), the main symptom of which is heartburn, is experienced by       ~40% of the population in Western countries.
Chronic sufferers (10-15%)       can develop more serious conditions such as Barrett's oesophagus and       erosive oesophagitis.
GI disorders cost the UK economy &#163;7.2 billion/year       and the NHS &gt; &#163;2.2 billion/year [`Care of Patients with         Gastrointestinal Disorders in the United Kingdom', British Society       of Gastroenterology, March 2006].
Furthermore, the GI functional response       also modulates behavioural responses to food and, hence, is key to       designing meals and foodstuffs that increase satiation after a meal, which       can play a part in controlling the increasing rate of obesity in the       population.
Health problems associated with being overweight cost the NHS       more than &#163;5 billion/year [`Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A call to         action on obesity in England', HM Government, October 2011].
Despite       the importance of GI function in health and disease, until recently there       have been very few techniques available to investigate the physiology of       the GI tract repeatedly and non-invasively.
The fast MRI methods that we       describe in Section 2 overcome the effects of movement in the human       abdomen, allowing the direct measurement of GI function in vivo.
Our work has influenced wider society through two principal routes:       product development in the food and drug industry; and the commercial       development of an in vitro model of the gut.
In addition we have       contributed to television/online programmes related to public health and       nutrition.
We now consider knowledge transfer into these areas in turn:     &#8226; Product development in the food and drug industry     Our demonstration that gastrointestinal motility and flow, together with       a range of digestive processes, could be monitored directly in human       subjects attracted the interest of companies who were seeking to optimise       meal and drug formulations, and has led to funding from major       multinational companies including Proctor and Gamble, Mitsubishi       Chemicals, Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Glaxo and McNeil Nutritionals.
Detailed information about how the data obtained in many of these trials       were used by the companies in product development remains confidential (in       most cases even to the Nottingham researchers involved).
However, the       value of these studies to the relevant organisations can be gauged by the       rapid increase in the value of research contracts which they placed with       the Nottingham MRI group.
In the period up to 2008 the commercial       contracts averaged ~&#163;44.5k/annum; since 2008 this annual funding level has       more than trebled to &#163;135k/annum, totalling &#163;678k (2008-2013).
We consider two examples of how our research influenced companies and       products.
Firstly, an investigation funded by Reckitt and Colman (now       Reckitt Benckiser) [iii; 1999-2000] showed that `Gaviscon Advance'       was more efficacious at forming an alginate raft within the stomach,       preventing oesophageal reflux with only half the dose of normal Gaviscon.
The visual detail (Fig.
1), which is taken from our paper [6], was       reproduced by Reckitt Benckiser in their "Gaviscon Advance 2006         campaign" to promote the medicine by informing general       practitioners, and to substantiate claims regarding the health benefits of       Gaviscon Advance (GA) ([A]; see also [6]).
Figure 1: 3D MRI reconstruction of a Gaviscon Advance raft and underlying meal (NB: This figure is from [6] and is also used in [A]).
To quantify the on-going impact of the development of this product       through the assessment period (2008 onwards) we estimate that NHS patients       benefitted from 14.6M prescriptions of GA (2008-2012 [B]; these figures do       not include over-the-counter sales).
We present this as a prime example of       how our expertise and facilities are being used to understand and improve       the mode of action of products, and to substantiate claims about foods or       drugs, with the ultimate beneficiaries being patient groups world-wide.
Secondly, we highlight a long-term collaboration with Unilever aimed at       developing functional foods.
This collaboration was built on the       application of our methods to: studies of the fate of different components       of a meal in the GI tract; the testing of prototype Unilever products; and       an investigation of GI physiology relevant to Unilever's current and       future product range.
This relationship has led to support for 2 BBSRC       CASE studentship awards and contract research funding worth &#163;273k to our       group since 2008.
In describing this work, the Strategic Science Group       Director Advanced Measurement in Unilever has stated [C]:     "One particular example that was critical to a full product         development cycle included the collaboration with, Dr Harry Peters'         (R&amp;D Manager, Unilever, Vlaardingen) and included research findings         from a c&#163;250k Unilever commission project (2004-2007).
The quality of         the MRI data and expert interpretation greatly increased prototype         efficiency whilst reducing related costs.
The obvious benefit to the         company has been quicker time to market with reduced overheads, stronger         data package in support of claims and authority whilst maintaining         product quality and excellence for our customers.
This success catalysed 5 further studies with Nottingham between         2008-2013, including two CASE studentships.
It is worth noting new         mechanistic and hence scientific insights into gastric processing were         delivered in the stomach, and both the small and large colon as a result         of aspects of these studies.
In this particular field alone Dr Pip         Rayment (Unilever Colworth) has generated 6 patents.......".
These successes in MRI were instrumental in the decision by Unilever to       enter into a strategic partnership with the University of Nottingham       across all subject areas.
The relationship with Unilever provides clear       evidence of a multinational organisation making changes in its strategies       for research and product development as a consequence of our research.
&#8226; Commercial development of an in vitro model         of the gut     The costs, difficulties and lengthy time-scales associated with in         vivo studies of the gut have motivated the development of an in         vitro model.
Researchers from the Institute of Food Research (IFR)       in Norwich worked with us on a project funded by joint BBSRC grants       (2005-06) [i], in which our research provided comparative data for the       development and certification of the Dynamic Gut Model (DGM) [D].
This in         vitro model is a machine which replicates the grinding forces and       the slow rate of intra-gastric mixing of viscous meals that we measured in         vivo, which is important since it determines the rate at which a       product is exposed to the low pH of the gastric secretions.
Plant Bioscience Limited (PBL; a technology management company), the       owners of the DGM intellectual property, successfully patented the machine       in the EU (EP1907108B1), USA (US8092222) and Australia (AU2006271423).
The       role of Nottingham research, including in the protection of intellectual       property, is confirmed by the PBL Business Development Manager [E],     "Nottingham's MRI group provided world leading research facilities and         expertise that provided critical underpinning to the design and         development of the DGM, and played a significant role both in         establishing IP protection and marketing evidence."
The DGM has proven to be an ideal vehicle to study the dynamics of oral       drug release, and has been widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry       to help develop and refine new formulations without the risk and expense       of human trials.
PBL initially (Nov 2006) offered a fee-for-service from       their established business unit Model Gut.
More recently (Feb       2013) they have licenced the technology and contract research business to       Bioneer Farma, a Danish company.
In parallel, PBL have also secured over       &#163;900k follow-on funding from BBSRC for further development of the DGM [F].
&#8226;Public Health and Nutrition     Our research results have been used in health education television       programmes about human nutrition, "The Truth about Food" (BBC and       SBS (Australia)) [G].
This work was funded by the BBC (iv), and also       included in an associated book [H].
The programmes were first broadcast in       Jan 2007 and have been available online [G] throughout the assessment       period (2008 onwards).
The book was published in 2007 and is still       available.
Through their continuing availability, the programmes and book       provide information that is intended to educate and inform the public       about optimum food choices in an effort to combat obesity.
