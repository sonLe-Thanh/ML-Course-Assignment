     The process       Between 7 October and 18 November 2010, the Globe Theatre and the Goethe       Institute in London, "inspired by", as Madeline Knights of the Globe put       it in an e-mail, "and indebted to", R&#252;diger G&#246;rner's research into       Goethe's relationship with Shakespeare, and more broadly into the German       preoccupation with him (4, 5, and 6 above) staged a season of lectures,       performances, rehearsed readings and film showings under the overall title       `Shakespeare is German'.
This season, supported by the German Embassy and       the Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance Studies (IGRS), entailed an       exemplary collaboration between two of the major cultural institutions in       London.
It led to Globe Education devoting a whole season to the German       Shakespeare, which involved distinguished scholars, actors, translators       and directors from both Germany and the UK, and putting on staged readings       of other English plays with German connections.
At the same time, the       Goethe Institute devoted a film season to some of the less obvious, but       historically important, film adaptations of Shakespeare plays.
Preserving, conserving and presenting cultural heritage       As part of the season, the Globe Theatre put on staged readings of two       very rare plays associated with Shakespeare and Germany: George Chapman's       Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany, and Henry Glapthorne's Albertus         Wallenstein, which helped to inspire Schiller.
The Goethe Institute       screened equally rare and culturally significant filmic versions of       Shakespeare's plays, including The Jew of Mestri and Sven Gade's Hamlet.
This is a text-book instance of exhuming, preserving, conserving,       presenting and illuminating cultural heritage, since texts, both dramatic       and filmic, that are part of Britain's heritage and have become an       indispensable element in Germany's were dusted off and given a new lease       of life.
Creating, inspiring and supporting new forms of artistic expression       The season also featured an evening of clips by and discussions with       German artists and filmmakers Herbert Fritsch and Sabrina Zwach on their       ongoing project to re-envision Hamlet for our times (www.hamlet-x.de/beschreibung).
The season thus demonstrably supported new forms of artistic expression.
Enriching the lives, imaginations and sensibilities of individuals and         groups       A total of 2,279 people attended the various events of the season, and       many more will have had their attention drawn to the existence of texts of       which they had previously been unaware (cf.
e.g.
https://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/pkirwan/entry/alphonsus_emperor_of).
In a significant but not easily quantified way, therefore, the lives,       imaginations and sensibilities of very many individuals and groups were       enriched by this project.
Influencing the form and content of associations between groups to         illuminate cultural values       The collaboration between the Globe Education and the Goethe Institute       marked a major new departure.
Without G&#246;rner's research and his personal       engagement, the two may never have realized the breadth and depth of the       common ground between them.
An exemplary case of the embodiment of research in the wider cultural         community       The whole season had the effect of embodying the conclusions of Professor       G&#246;rner's research in publicly accessible events in two venues in the wider       cultural community.
And the fact that G&#246;rner's lecture has been adopted       world-wide by the Goethe Institute (6) corroborates the project's       exemplary importance.
Media resonance       Furthermore, many people have been led to rethink the cultural       relationship between Britain and Germany as a result of this series of       events.
The season aroused considerable interest in the media of the two       countries, including both high brow and less high brow national       newspapers, popular and high cultural radio stations.
It was also widely       discussed in both languages on the radio and on the internet.
From both       the German gratification and the British tolerant surprise, it is evident       that this media response is both symptomatic of, and helped to strengthen,       a significant shift in mutual perceptions.
Evidence of impact       The audience figures cited above have been supplied by the Globe and the       Goethe Institute.
The season featured as one of the `top stories' on the blog of the       Deutsche Welle (http://www.dw.de/londons-globe-theatre-honors-shakespeares-german-connection/a-6213792), but       was also reported on the bbc news (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11553359)       and in the Guardian theatreblog (http://www.theguardian.com/culture/theatreblog/2010/oct/06/german-william-shakespeare).
It       was listed in both The Stage and IndieLondon (http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/10/globe-launches-shakespeare-is-german-season/;       http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/shakespeare-is-german-listings-shakespeare-s-globe).
It       was picked up by other Universities, such as Aston, by the AGS and by the       BUFVC (http://germanataston.blogs.aston.ac.uk/2010/10/14/shakespeare-a-german-writer/;       http://germanstudiesblog.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/shakespeare-is-german/;       http://bufvc.ac.uk/2010/11/12/shakespeare-is-german-season).
It was also drawn to the attention of teachers in two entries on the       magazine inkpellet, and to expatriate Germans on Deutsche in London (http://www.inkpellet.co.uk/2010/10/shakespeare-is-german/       &amp; http://www.inkpellet.co.uk/2010/11/shakespeare-is-german-2/;       http://www.deutsche-in-london.net/forum/topic/37694-shakespeare-is-german/), and       is included on the fan web site of Sebastian Koch (http://www.sebastiankoch.net/index-events-details.php?id=2&amp;p=2).
Evidence of uptake of research is to be found in Patrick Spottiswoode's       follow-up radio feature Shakespeare is German on BBC Radio 4 from       December 2012 (www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pgnbk).
A lecture commissioned       for the season was also repeated in Germany (http://www.rheinische-art.de/cms/topics/dank-englischen-humor-shakespeare---ein-deutscher-dichter.php;       www.amazingdusseldorf.com/?id=851).
Building on the impact       An indirect sequel to the project is the invitation to the Bremer       Shakespeare company to take part in the Globe to Globe project as part of       the Cultural Olympiad in May 2012.
The inevitability of including German       as one of the 37 languages represented was cemented by the Shakespeare is       German project.
The Centre for Anglo-German Cultural Relations has       subsequently become involved in Global Shakespeare, run jointly by QMUL       and the University of Warwick.
And Karin Beier, Artistic Director of the       Schauspielhaus in Hamburg has been invited to give the Centre's 2015       Angermion lecture.
