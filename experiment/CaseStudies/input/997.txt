     Prior to the paradigm-shifting publications that were the result of       Benedetti's scholarship, readers       and students had to contend with inaccurate, misleading and       difficult-to-read English-language       versions based on early drafts of Stanislavski's writings, first published       in 1938.
Some of the       mistranslations had resulted in profound distortions in the way his system       has been interpreted and       taught.
Benedetti succeeded in translating Stanislavski's huge manual into       a lively, fascinating and       accurate text in English.
For the first time, the two books previously       known as An Actor         Prepares and Building A Character were restored to a single       volume, as had been Stanislavki's       original intentions.
This work has precipitated a major reconsideration of       the Stanislavski's theories       and `system'.
Professor Merlin's work has built on Benedetti's, creating       two manuals for actors that       distil Stanislavskian precepts into easily accessible instructions and       exercises: The Complete         Stanislavski Toolkit (Nick Hern Books 2007 amzn.to/1fNkohv) and Acting:         The Basics (Routledge       2010 amzn.to/1gn6LDa).
From its inception in 2007, the Centre has worked in the UK and abroad       with a range of       professional partners, in the performance industries and in Higher       Education to develop a portfolio       of outreach activities that cater for the needs of a wide international       public audience, from school-age       students to experienced professional practitioners.
It has been the       Centre's intention to ensure       that access to and knowledge of Stanislavski's work and legacy is as       widely disseminated as       possible.
Every event that the Centre produces or supports is open to a       public audience.
Whenever possible the events are offered either free of charge or at a       significantly reduced cost,       subsidised by the Centre.
Details of all events are publicised via the       Centre's website, Drama UK,       The Society for Theatre Research, and academic networks such as SCUDD.
The       majority of the       events are directly linked with specific research projects, and the Centre       offers a platform for the       sharing of research from both academic and non-academic sources.
Indicatively:     (a) Professional Development and training events designed for       practitioners, teachers and       academics, working with partners including Pushkin House, Globe Education       at Shakespeare's       Globe, The Arcola Theatre and Kingston University: study days on Sanford       Meisner (70       participants) (featuring William Esper, leading Meisner technique teacher,       http://esperstudio.com)       and Viewpoints (60 participants), a series of CPD workshops for educators,       public lectures and       master-classes and pre-performance talks, hosted at RBC and external       venues.
The Centre       frequently hosts lectures, master-classes and workshops by leading       international scholars and       practitioners, offering a platform for the wider public dissemination of       their research: recently       including Prof. Kelly Handerek (University of Regina) on Uta Hagen, Prof.       Charles Gilbert       (University of The Arts, Philadelphia) on Stanislavski and the singing       actor, and award-winning       director Ian Rickson, a master-class on Chekhov.
(b) The Stanislavski On Stage Exhibitions at The National Theatre       (2008) and Pushkin House       (2013), all open to the general public and accompanied by a series of       contextual lectures which       incorporated collaborative and complimentary research strands from       academic colleagues from the       UK, USA and Russia, and made them available to a public audience.
In 2008,       the exhibition was       funded by a personal donation from Yevgeny Lebedev (publisher of the       Evening Standard and the       Independent) and was located in the foyer to the Olivier Theatre, exposing       it to some 15,000       general public audience members.
In 2013, the exhibition expanded its       reach to a Russian-speaking       audience, through its presence at Pushkin House, which provided access to       approximately 1440 day-time visitors and 200 evening guests across the       four lecture       presentations.
Since the addition of the images to ArenaPal, they have       been exposed to web-traffic       amounting to more than 500 visits per month.
(c) The provision of specialist material to publicly available projects       (in print and on film).
The       Centre has supported two documentary film projects produced by Copernicus       Films, based in       Moscow.
As well as providing access to the collections, particularly the       photographic archive, the       Centre provided consultancy on materials and links to other sources of       material (e.g.
The Moscow       Art Theatre collection), assisted in the final editing of materials,       including the compilation of on-screen       captions, and hosted the premiere screening of the first film, Stanislavski         and The Russian         Theatre in April 2011.
The second film, Vakhtangov and the         Russian Theatre (November 2013).
See www.copernicusfilms.com.
In       addition to the dvd and online distribution of some 150 copies of       the film, excerpted material has received 19,490 views on Youtube.
(d) Open access research resources: The research collections       which form part of the Centre are       available to the broadest range of users.
The Centre has advised teachers,       GCSE students,       provided photographic material for theatre productions and for the       illustration of books and journal       articles; including The Independent, Pulse UK, Black         Snow (Walking Thoughts theatre company).
The Centre has hosted researchers (theatre practitioners and academics)       from the USA, Belgium,       The Czech Republic, Russia and Korea.
(e) The Centre has supported several performance events for       public audiences including       producing a double-bill of one-act pieces (Chekov's On the Harmfulness         of Tobacco, and       Pushkin's The Queen of Spades), performed by Philip Lowrie, and       staged at Pushkin House in       May 2013.
These staged performances reflect the Centre's interest not only       in Russian repertoire,       but also in different approaches to acting.
In this instance, the       solo-actor performance.
(f) Research on the Centre's photographic collection has resulted       in several lectures and       presentations given by PF: these have included illustrated presentations       for both public and       academic audiences, hosted by The Arcola Theatre, The University of East       London, DAMU       Theatre Academy in Prague, and The University of Malta.
Fryer also wrote       an article on the Centre       and its collection for the Summer 2013 edition of Theatre and         Performance, a magazine aimed at       the popular, non-specialist market, entitled "Happy Birthday Mr       Stanislavski"(g) Publications: The       Stanislavski Studies ejournal, launched in 2012, reaches a wide       international audience and has       now published three issues (issue #4 will appear in Spring 2014).
Since       its inception, in addition to       sales of the ebook editions the site has received 12,668 page views,       during 4808 visits to the       website by 3120 unique visitors, of which 78.33% were working in English       and 13.52% were       working in Russian.
38.56% of visitors were based in the UK, 21.15% were       based in the US and       11.29% were based in Russia.
The exhibition book, Stanislavski on           Stage, published by the       Centre in 2008, is still on sale via the Centre, the National Theatre       Bookshop and Amazon.com.
