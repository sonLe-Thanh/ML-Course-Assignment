             Impact 1: Economic impact new products: high durability           construction products (Outputs R1-4): Tata Steels Shotton Steel         works (employing 690 staff) premium product for construction is         now a 5% Aluminium containing galvanised steel for construction (18,000         tonnes per week) with a high-performance UV stable organic coating         underwritten by a full consequential loss warranty of up to 40 years.
These high performance products are only possible through understanding         of the critical links between microstructure and corrosion resistance         from underpinning mechanistic studies (R1-R3) and photodegradation         stability measurement (R5).
The new techniques to visualise and quantify         corrosion (R1 and R4) are now sold commercially by Swansea with         customers including General Electric, Tata and Tokyo Electric Power.
Partner             comment: "Our 40 year corrosion warranties are at the heart of or             premium products success.... this comes directly from an             understanding of corrosion and photodegradation led by Swansea"         (Technology and Innovation Director Tata)         Impact 2: Economic impact new products: chromium free corrosion           treatments Cogent Power manufacture 75,000 tonnes per annum of a         high quality grain oriented electrical steel used for devices such as         transformers, motors and other electrical devices.
Traditionally a         chromate wash was used to prevent corrosion; hexavalent chromium is now         banned from electrical goods in the European Union Waste Electrical and         Electronic Equipment Directive, which became European law in 2003, and         as such has to be removed.
After two years research with their suppliers         Cogent Power had not succeeded and prime production had dropped to 10%.
Using the techniques developed (R4) a method was developed to look at         the chemical species during the treatment (the research being carried         out by authors of refs R1 to R5).
In 2012, a &#163;250,000 investment in a         new coater resulted in an increase to 60% prime output (consistent with         the chromate performance).
This translates to a 37,500 tonne increase in         prime product annually which retails for &#163;1300 per tonne giving the         plant world leading productivity essential for business competitiveness.
Partner comment: "We had been unable to solve the chromium free             treatment of our electrical steels.
We invested &#163;250k on a new             coater solution and we are now producing ~60% grade 1 appearance             standard compared to ~10% prior to the work with SPECIFIC" (Technical           Manager, Cogent Power)         Impact 3: Economic impact Investment Induced from UK; the creation           of a national innovation centre The underpinning understanding of         coatings behaviour initiated by R1 directly led to the cluster of         research excellence at Swansea growing and the SPECIFIC Innovation and         Knowledge Centre has continued a successful partnership with Tata, NSG         and BASF to develop functional coatings.
New process technologies (e.g.
R6) have converted what was a batch process to a continuous process and         has resulted in a &#163;2.2m investment in production line capability in         Wales in 2013.
Typical lab methods are all based on typically 30 minute         oven heating that is inconsistent with line speeds of 100 m min-1.
The near infrared heating methods have solved the three main bottlenecks         in cell manufacture.
In 2013 an additional &#163;7m has been invested to         create a strategic project with Imperial College leading to a national         centre for scaling solar energy advanced manufacturing.
Partner             Comment: "New products in the construction require lifetime and             function; already work on pigmentation at Swansea has improved the             efficiency of our transpired solar collectors being fitted to             buildings in the UK.
This basic function is driving development work             of our next generation of coatings at the SPECIFIC IKC" (Innovation           Manager Tata Colors)         Impact 4: Economic Activity Jobs Created.
Continued support         from EPSRC and WG for the Engineering Doctorate programme has allowed         for both technical impacts detailed above but also critically provided a         talent flow from the university to industry.
The Swansea led EngD has         now produced 204 EngD graduates of whom 90% are working with or for         industry and two thirds with the metals sector in which their research         activity was initiated.
Specifically 26 of the doctorates work directly         on coatings development.
This provides a sustainable positive impact on         industrial partners as well as supporting a more diverse set of research         interactions.
Seven of the co-authors of the six outputs are EngD         graduates who took leading roles upon graduation and all remain working         closely with the industry sponsors to-date.
Partner comment: "The             graduates that come from our EngD partnership are the life blood of             our technical and management sections.
Their research outputs             directly affect our business competitiveness and the large number             that work in our supply chain continue to add value after they have             left the University.
I should know as I was one of the first batch             of graduates in 1996!"
