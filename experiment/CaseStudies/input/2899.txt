     Context     The impact of the research has been to make a substantial contribution to       changing the direction of innovation policy at a high level and in some       matters of detail in the UK, at EU level and in other OECD countries by       developing theoretical policy rationales and developing an empirical       evidence base that underpinned the design of demand-side innovation       policies.
Through an interactive process of conducting research and taking       part in advisory activities the Manchester group has delivered its results       to policymakers at ministerial and European Commissioner level (and in one       instance to national leaders of all EU members).
Pathways to Impact     Transfer of the ideas has taken place through:            Citation and acknowledgement in official documents of the research.
Including the 2008 UK `Innovation Nation' White paper (March 2008),         Parliamentary reports (House of Lords S&amp;T Committee [E] (May 2011)         following invited testimony), BIS Growth Strategy [F], ministerial         communication of the EU (European Council, 2006), and a 2011 OECD report         on `Demand-side innovation policies';       Direct in person briefings to ministers including four UK         business/science/industry ministers (Sainsbury, Pearson, Willetts,         Cable), Secretary of State DCLG (John Denham) on local government         innovation procurement, and to senior business representatives (eg EU         High level Business Forum, Poland 2010);       Authorship of several research-based public reports with wide         dissemination to policymakers e.g.
Aho Group report widely acknowledged         to have put demand-side deficiency on agenda for European leaders &#8212;         discussed at summits; Demanding Innovation &#8212; Lead Markets, Public         Procurement and Innovation &#8212; NESTA Provocation 02, February 2007;       Leading roles in UK and EU expert and advisory committees e.g.
Glover         Committee report to HM Treasury and BIS in which Georghiou had specific         responsibility for innovation procurement and also chaired the academic         sub-group.
Presentation to EU Competitiveness Council July 17, 2008 (27         ministers)       Regular contact and discussions with senior officials of Technology         Strategy Board (including CEO), BIS Innovation policy team and BIS         Economists       Three presentations of team members in the Committee for Scientific         and Technological Policy of the OECD in 2009 and 2010, the subsequent         OECD strategy document (OECD 2011) on demand side policies is entirely         structured after the team's conceptual framework.
Reach and Significance     Most significant innovation policy documents in the UK and European       Commission cite or quote the work of the team.
As the Deputy Director of       Corporate Tax at HM Treasury [H] states: "Manchester Business School         has published path-breaking work on demand side policy and public         procurement, and engaged intensively with policymakers in the UK and at         EU level.
This work has been influential in shaping policy under the         last and current governments, as well as within the European         Commission."
The design and evaluation of a new type of a novel innovation policy       initiative &#8212; the European Lead Market Initiative &#8212; was explicitly based on       our research.
The strongest element of these impacts has been upon the use       of public procurement to drive innovation.
The potential of the policy is       very high as procurement of goods and services accounts for 16-19% of GDP.
There are no official estimates of the proportion of public procurement       that is innovative, nor of changes in practice that could be attributed to       policy measures influenced by the research.
The full economic effects will       take many years to be manifested but impact at this stage is principally       measured in terms of changes in policy and practice.
UK effects include:            Implementation of Glover Committee recommendations [B] on access to         procurement for SMEs including move to exclusive use of electronic         portal, electronic documentation for tenders, use of Innovation         Procurement Plans (IPPs &#8212; one round implemented across all Government         departments) and of outcome based specifications.
Implementation of Innovation Nation [A] recommendations on intelligent         customer and IPPs          International effects include:            Design of EU Lead Market Initiative [D] based on Aho group report [2].
Subsequent evaluation using Edler conceptualisation (Edler 2010, working         paper version 2009, cited 3 times) and team evaluation design (cited 6         times).
Testimony from the Head of European Commission Innovation Policy         Unit DG Enterprise [G] states: "The Manchester Institute of           Innovation Research has played nothing less than a key role in shaping           the EU's demand side policies.
The Aho report, with Professor Luke           Georghiou as rapporteur, has brought the issue of rebalancing the EU's           research and innovation policy mix in favour of demand side measures           to the highest political level in the EU.
It resulted directly in the           EU's Lead Market Initiative."
Implementation of new Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) models within         the EU Horizon 2020, aiming to create procurement markets of &#8364;10 billion         a year, plus PCP as requirement in Smart Specialisation within &#8364;100         billion Structural Funds.
Further testimony from the Head of the Unit         [G] states: "The analysis of Edler shaped the concept of European           Innovation Partnerships launched in the Innovation Union Strategy as           well as procurement related commitments....This new policy is now           sustained at European level.....Moreover pre-commercial procurement           and innovation procurement are included as a requirement in Smart           Specialisation within the Structural Funds."
Contribution to German High Tech Strategy and Procurement Strategy of         the Ministries for Research and Education as well as the Ministry of         Economics;       3 small countries (Malta, Estonia and Iceland) enacted measures or         strategies to use these policy instruments as direct result of ERAPRISM         project which presented findings to Ministers in all cases.
Following visit of high level Swedish delegation to Manchester for         government enquiry to learn about the concept, new Swedish Law on         Innovation Procurement enacted in February 2010.
Contribution to OECD strategy and policy [C] as confirmed in a         statement from the executive secretary of the OECD Working Party [I] on         Innovation and Technology: "The OECD report Demand-Side Innovation           Policies is heavily influenced by their research.
The basic typology           and rationale for demand based measures has been largely shaped by the           Manchester work &#8212; as testified in many explicit references.....The           demand-side innovation policy work has also had influence beyond the           immediate remit of innovation policy.
For example, the OECD Green           Growth Strategy which included work on green technology has also           benefited from MBS research on linking supply and demand-side           innovation policies in order to transition towards more sustainable           growth models."
Local government effects included:            Research findings of NESTA-funded study used extensively as evidence         in report by DCLG on `Innovative Procurement' which was rolled out to         local authority officials, business and practitioner audiences.
