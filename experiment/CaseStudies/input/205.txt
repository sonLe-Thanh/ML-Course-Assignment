     NILT databases have had impact because their regular production and open       access has helped       frame policies around an unsteady peace.
This impact is significant       because the stakes       around a return to violent conflict are so high.
The Community Relations       Council referred to the       NILT time-series (see attached letter):     This aspect of the NILT survey is very valuable to our work given the         serious impact of a failure         to identify a change in attitudes that might herald a return to violent         conflict... and given the         highly charged political environment, it would be hard to overstate the         importance of factual         information and the role of long range research such as the NILT survey.
The impact is wide-reaching because NILT data have become       ubiquitous within debates and       reports within/from government, political parties, journalists, lobbyists       and NGOs.
The Research       Director of the Northern Ireland Peace Monitoring Report (see attached       letter) notes:     ...I cannot think of any serious analysis of Northern Ireland as a         post-conflict society that doesn't         make reference to its survey data.... Not to include NILT survey data         suggests a lack of concern         for the lived experience of the people of Northern Ireland.
That's how         central its research has         become.
The history to the specific impact presented in the case study begins In       March 2005 when the       Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) published       `A Shared Future:       The policy and strategic framework for good relations in Northern       Ireland'.
A total of forty six       NILT indicators were identified in this action plan.
In January 2007, a       baseline report was       produced which contained 96 citations of NILT data.
Subsequently reports       were produced in       2008, 2009, 2010 and 2013.
However it is the use of NILT data by non-governmental users that       evidences the reach of this       impact.
With the resumption of devolution in May 2007, OFMDFM initiated       the development of a       new programme on Cohesion, Sharing and Integration (CSI) but with       seemingly ever long       delays in its publication.
During spring 2010, discussions in the Northern       Ireland Assembly on       CSI (or the lack of it) where Life and Times data were cited featured on       18th Feb 2010; 2nd       March 2010 and 23rd June 2010.
The public consultation on (CSI) was launched on 27 July 2010 and       generated enormous       controversy.
Twelve of the responses to the consultation made mention of       ARK survey data       (Alliance Party, Worker's Party, Commission for Victims and Survivors,       Irish Peace Centre,       Integrated Education Fund, Chartered Institute of Housing, NI Federation       of Housing       Associations, Pubic Health Agency, Sharing Education Learning Forum,       Volunteer Now, Youth       Council for Northern Ireland) but of particular influence was the damning       response from the       Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust (by Jennifer Todd and Joseph Ruane).
This       analysis used       NILT data to evidence her criticism of the jettisoning of the goal of       `reconciliation' emphasised in       Shared Future.
She warned that CSI posed a practical danger and in       this context it is `easy to       revert to sectarian opposition'.
Alongside the CSI debate there was continuing demand for government       action in specific areas       of community relations.
Five Assembly questions were tabled citing NILT       data.
One particular       committee debate in October 2010 drew the comment:     If there is an academic case, if the Life and Times survey supports         it, if Bain indicates it, and if         the financial rationale is already known, what is really of interest is         why it is not happening.
(Basil McCrea, 20th October 2010)     In May 2012 the Alliance party pulled out of CSI talks while in July 2012       the Secretary of State       expressed his disappointment that there was still no publication of the       strategy.
The flags       dispute in late 2012 further increased demand for action and elicited the       comment from the       editor of one local paper:     All the political parties would do well, if they haven't already done         so, to study the research from         the University of Ulster/Queen's University's ARK project and from the         Institute of British and         Irish Studies in Dublin.
(Ed Curran, Belfast Telegraph 2nd October 2012)     In April 2013 the new Secretary of State Theresa Villiers again urged       progress on the new       strategy in a Commons debate and paid tribute to ARK and other       organisations helping people       to understand the past:     Yesterday I visited the University of Ulster to learn more about its         CAIN-ARK network...
I         encourage anyone who wants to understand Northern Ireland's past to         visit the website.
(Theresa Villiers April 23rd April 2013, Column 813)     By May 2013 the controversial CSI strategy had finally disappeared and       the Executive brought       forward its new policy Together-Building a United Community.
NILT       is cited a number of times       in this key policy document and the Director of the United Community       Division in OFMDFM       affirms that NILT will continue to be invaluable when monitoring the       impact of the new strategy       (see attached letter).
