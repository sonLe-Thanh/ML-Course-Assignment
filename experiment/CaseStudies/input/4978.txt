     Heart failure is a complex syndrome in which the heart is unable to pump       sufficient blood to meet       the demands of the body.
The incidence of heart failure increases with       age, and the condition       progressively leads to a significant debilitation of physical capacity and       quality of life.
Heart failure       is associated with high mortality and more than 50% of patients die within       5 years of diagnosis.
The condition represents a substantial economic burden to health services,       with nearly 17 million       people living with a heart failure diagnosis in the UK, USA and Europe.
In       2010/2011 the cost of       heart failure management in the NHS was in excess of &#163;2 billion;       approximately 70% of this       expenditure was due to hospitalisation costs.
Drugs can limit progression       of the disease and       patients are typically treated with multiple drugs that are prescribed for       the rest of their lives.
Impact on international and national heart failure clinical           guidelines       Key University of Glasgow studies (detailed in sections 2 and 3) have       provided the evidence-base       for current clinical recommendations made by the European Society of       Cardiology (ESC) and by       the American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart       Association (ACCF/AHA) for       the management of heart failure.
The ESC, ACCF and AHA are the most       prominent and influential       cardiovascular societies in the world, with estimated professional       memberships of 30,000, 43,000       and 73,000 respectively.
Owing to his internationally renowned reputation       and expertise in the       field, McMurray held the highly prestigious position of Chair of the 2012       ESC guideline committee       and the only European member of the writing committee for the 2013       ACCF/AHA guidelines.
The       2012 ESCaand 2013 ACCF/AHAb guidelines, through       rigorous peer-review, make the highest level       of recommendations, citing University of Glasgow studies in the key       evidence base for the       following drug therapies in patients with heart failure:            ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to be used in all patients with heart         failure (based on         evidence including the ATLAS2, CIBIS-21 and         CAPRICORN studies).
ARBs in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors or those who remain         symptomatic on         beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors (based on evidence including VALIANT4         and the CHARM3         trials).
MRAs as the third disease-modifying drug in patients who remain         symptomatic despite ACE         inhibitor (or ARB) and beta-blocker (based on evidence from EMPHASIS-HF5).
The landmark demonstration of the lifesaving benefits of the MRA       eplerenone in patients with heart       failure is the biggest breakthrough in the drug management of heart       failure since that of beta-blockers       and is the most recent change in these new international guidelines.
The ESC and ACCF/AHA guidelines dominate the evidence-based best practice       for treatment of       heart failure and their recommendations are mirrored in the majority of       current national guidelines.
Examples published since 2008 include the National Institute for Health       and Care Excellence       (NICE), in the UK (2010c), the Canadian Cardiovascular Society       (CCS, 2012d) and the National       Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New       Zealand (2011e).
Approval       of these therapies by NICE not only reflects their clinical efficacy but       their cost-effectiveness,       confirming they represent `good value for money' for the NHS.
The       influence of neutral or negative       trials which recommend the discontinuation of harmful drug therapies must       not be underestimated.
Evidence from the CORONA study led to removal of the statin therapy       recommendation in patients       with heart failure in the current NICE guidelines.c In summary,       the recommendations based on       University of Glasgow research outlined above affect the clinical       management of heart failure       worldwide.
These have contributed to the reduction in mortality and       hospitalisation rates (by       approximately 25% and 40% respectively) recorded in the past 2 decades,       with mortality rates       post-2008 continuing to follow this trend.
Dissemination and implementation of heart failure guideline           recommendations       A robust process of dissemination has ensured that the above guideline       recommendations form       the basis of current clinical heart failure treatment.
Since their       publication in May 2012, the ESC       guidelines on heart failure management have become the most downloaded       guideline in the 2012       ESC series (158,000 copies).f A further 28,500 pocket version       guidelines of the ESC heart failure       guideline have been accessed and French, Spanish, Chinese and       Polish-language editions       published.
Beyond Europe, users are located in South America, India and       China, thereby       demonstrating the global reach of these recommendations.f A       similar process of dissemination is       operated by the AHA through their `Get with the guidelines &#8212; heart failure       overview' programme.
Patients with heart failure are receiving the guideline recommended           first-line therapies       In the UK, implementation of these recommendations is assessed annually by       the National Heart       Failure audit.
The 2011/2012 audit reported that, of the patients       discharged from hospital in       England and Wales with heart failure, 84% were prescribed an ACE inhibitor       and/or an ARB, 78%       were prescribed a beta-blocker and 45% were prescribed an MRA thereby       indicating adherence to       the guideline recommendations based on University of Glasgow research.g       In a primary care       setting, financial incentives standardise delivery of front-line heart       failure drug therapies to patients       via the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) for all practices on the General       Medical Services       contract.h Two QOF indicators have been in existence since 2008       for the on-going management of       heart failure patients.
QOF data (April 2011-March 2012)       indicate that 83% of patients in England       with a current diagnosis of heart failure are being treated with an ACE       inhibitor or an ARB, 60% of       whom are additionally treated with a beta-blocker.i In the US,       the government Health and Human       Services department operates a standardised clinical quality measurement       for hospitals, on which       performance is rated and made publically available.
The current measure       (2012) stipulates that       patients with heart failure are discharged with a valid prescription for       ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and       directly cites the Glasgow evidence base (citing CHARM-Alternative and       VALIANT4).j       Approximately 77% of all US hospitals are accredited to this scheme,       administered by the       governmental agency The Joint Commission.
In 2012 The Joint Commission       annual report noted       that accredited hospitals reached an average 97% compliance with the heart       failure measure.k     An estimated 7 million people in the UK and US currently live with a       diagnosis of heart failure.
Taken together, the above figures indicate the widespread delivery of the       recommended first-line       therapies within this patient population.
Advances in diagnosis and community based management of patients           with heart failure       University of Glasgow clinical heart failure researchers were among the       first to show the potential       role of BNP as a diagnostic test for heart failure6, which is       now used universally to improve       accurate and earlier diagnosis of heart failurea, b.
A major       advancement in the day-to-day care of       heart failure patients has been achieved through Specialist Heart Failure       Nurses (SHFNs), the       concept and benefit behind which was pioneered in the UK in a 2001       Glasgow-led trial7 (alongside       two complementary trials conducted in US and Australia).
As a result of       the trial of specialist heart       failure nurses (SHFNs), there are now more than 400 SHFNs in the UK,       supported by the NHS and       the British Heart Foundation.
SHFNs help to reduce hospital admissions by       35% and save the       NHS approximately &#163;8 million per year.l
