     Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are among the greatest threats to global       biodiversity and appear to have been the most significant cause of       documented extinctions.
Global damage from IAS is estimated to cost US$1.4       trillion annually, and the threat is increasing with the continued growth       of global trade and tourism.
York research has provided:     A.
Widespread recognition of the enormity of the problem caused by         alien species for biodiversity and economies &#8212; generating political         motivation to act.
This has led to over 45 currently-operational       international instruments to control non-native species.
The Convention on       Biological Diversity (CBD) legally binds its 193 signatory countries to "prevent         the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species which         threaten ecosystems, habitats or species."
Williamson took a leading       part in the international process leading to this, working with the UK       Health and Safety Executive, the UK Dept of the Environment, European       Directorates, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and       Development.
He was on the SCOPE (Scientific Committee on Problems of the       Environment) Biological Invasions programme, and he and Perrings formed       the economic section of the Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP).
B.
The conceptual framework for understanding invasions that underpins         present-day national and global policies and strategies.
"Research         at the University of York" ... "influence[s] policies         throughout the world and [is] central to the practical assessment         of the risks, prevention and management of invasive alien species"       (IUCN 2013).
Impacts on UK policies.
The UK Department for Environment, Food       and Rural Affairs (Defra) policies stem directly from the York research.
Defra produced a "Review of non-native species policy" in 2003       which assessed the UK legislative framework concerning non-native species       and its ability to meet our international obligations.
Williamson       contributed heavily and his work is cited more than anyone else.
The       report draws on his 'tens' rule, on the York-developed thesis that it is       difficult to predict which species will invade, that the best predictor is       invasiveness elsewhere, on the Perrings and Williamson analysis of the       relative costs of dealing with different IAS, and on Williamson's work on       invasive plants in Britain.
The recommendations of this review have been       implemented and underpin all policy, strategy and action on IAS in the UK       in 2008-2013.
Key are:             Coordinated organisation.
Recommendation 1 of the 2003 Review         is: `The Government should designate or create a single lead           co-ordinating organisation [for] non-native species policies           across Government', adopting Perrings and Williamson's recognition         of the importance of coordination.
In response, the Non-Native Species         Secretariat (NNSS, at York) was set up, responsible to governments and         agencies in England, Scotland and Wales.
NNSS launched "The Invasive           Non-native Species Framework Strategy for GB" with an         implementation plan in 2008.
This Strategy aims to prevent and deal         rapidly with new arrivals, as suggested by York researchers, resulting         in the formation of The Rapid Response Working Group in 2008.
The NNSS         Strategy is the current framework for coordinating the actions of         government departments, related bodies and key stakeholders.
Risk assessment.
Recommendation 2 of the 2003 Review is to: "Develop           comprehensive risk assessment procedures to assess the risks posed by           non-native species", using criteria based on Williamson's three         stages of invasion.
They underpin subsequent animal and plant reports         and the Non-Native Species Audit conducted by English Nature in 2005.
The audit (citing York work) identified 2721 species and hybrids already         occurring in England, and their impacts, and has been used as the         baseline for defining and prioritising work during 2008-2013.
Natural         England undertook horizon scanning in 2008 to identify non-native         species likely to become invasive: reports on animals (2009) and plants         (2011) draw on the York framework, and the 2012 report of the GB         Non-Native Species Secretariat (Defra, Scot Govt, Welsh Govt) cites 7         Williamson/York publications.
The reports inform GB prioritisation and         targeting of resources.
Control releases into the wild.
Section 14 of The Wildlife         &amp; Countryside Act (1981) is the UK's main legislation covering         release into the wild of non-native species.
Species listed in schedule         9 'cannot legally be released, allowed to escape, planted or           otherwise caused to grow in the wild except under licence'.
The 2003 Review recommended 'regular review and updating of this           schedule...if it is to be effective'.
As a result, in 2010, 36         additional plant and 24 mammal species were added.
The criteria for         selection included species 'that have become invasive or damaging in           other countries' (Defra 2007 consultation); i.e., based on         Williamson and Fitter's key conclusion.
In 2011 The Non-Native         Species Information Portal (NNSIP) was launched, providing further         coordination.
The Wildlife &amp; Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011         (Commencement 4, Savings &amp; Trans Provisions) came into force in July         2012, the invasive species orders aiming to provide controls associated         with Williamson's three stages of invasion.
Economics of invasive species.
"The three-stage hierarchical           approach sets out that measures to prevent introduction of invasive           non-native species are generally far more cost-effective and           environmentally desirable than measures taken following introduction           and establishment" (Defra 2003), and Recommendation 5.2 states: "Consideration           should be given to identifying.. where responsibility for management           or.. costs should lie with those responsible for the illegal           introduction of the non-native species [and to provide] a legal           basis for imposing fines on the `polluter pays' principle".
Both         statements directly follow from York research.
Hence, Scottish         Government, Defra and Welsh Assembly together sponsored CABI (2010) to         analyse the economic costs of IAS.
The report concludes that IAS cost         the British economy &#163;1.7 billion/yr, citing 5 York papers, using         Williamson's estimates of the economic impact of alien plants in         Britain, and accepting his and Perrings' conclusion that costs of         invasives "are not generally incorporated... (Perrings et al.
2005),           meaning that the true economic costs of [IAS] are not reflected in the           economy."
The policy-relevant CABI conclusions (cost-effectiveness         of prevention, early control or eradication) reflect conclusions from         York papers.
Overall, York research is central to all UK strategies for IAS, successes       including near-eradication of American Mink in the Western Isles,       resulting in the dramatic recovery of waterbird populations.
Global         impacts.
Williamson's "insight has had wide impact in terms of         biosecurity strategies around the world" according to Philip Hulme,       Professor of Plant Biosecurity in New Zealand.
Piero Genovesi (Chair of       the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Invasive Species       Specialist Group; IUCN 2013) states "Williamson's .. stages of invasion       [are] incorporated within almost all risk assessment strategies carried         out by national governments across the world and international         structures, including the European Union and the Convention on         Biological Diversity".
The global Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted         twenty 'Aichi' Biodiversity Targets in October 2010 at its 10th         Conference of Parties (CoP10).
Target 9 is: "By 2020, invasive alien           species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species           are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage           pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment."
According to Genovesi (IUCN 2013), "This target was directly informed           by a 2012 CBD report, which drew heavily on Williamson's biological           research (stages of invasion and need to prioritize control of           recognised pests) and on his economics work with Perrings".
The         support documents for the CBD (2012) report cite Williamson (1998) and         Perrings et al.
(2000, 2002).
CoP11 (2012) launched the Global         IAS Information Partnership to facilitate this.
Impacts on European policies.
In 2011, the EU adopted a 2020         Biodiversity Strategy, directly adopting the York-influenced Aichi         Target wording for IAS (EC 2011).
The technical support for the         development of the Strategy was provided by IEEP (Institute for European         Environmental Policy) whose 2009 report cites Williamson.
The Strategy         recognises the York-based conclusion that prevention and early-control         are most cost-effective; specifically that IAS cause &#8364;12.5 billion         annual damage in the EU, whereas the estimated annual implementation         costs of the EU Strategy are &#8364;40 to 190 million.
To achieve         these strategic goals, the EC proposed a Regulation of the European           Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and management of the           introduction and spread of invasive alien species in 2013.
National and regional programmes.
The CBD, SCOPE and GISP         programmes have fed into numerous international, regional and national         programmes, many of which pre-date 2008 but are still in use.
For         example, Hulme states that Williamson's "finding that previous           history of invasion was an important explanatory variable in deciding           whether a species would become problematic ... is one of the key           components in the Australian Weed Risk Assessment Scheme which remains           the main screening tool in Australia for new introductions".
Other         programmes were established during 2008-2013.
Since CoP10, there has         been a surge in the number of countries (e.g.
Finnish Strategy and         Action Plan, 2012), intergovernmental groupings and NGOs developing IAS         legislation and strategies, reflecting principles originally developed         in York.
For example, the underlying principles of the "Guidelines           for Invasive Species Management in the Pacific" (Pacific Community         &amp; Regional Env Prog Secretariat, 2009) state: "Not all           introduced species are invasive, and action should be prioritised to           deal first with those currently causing, or with potential to cause,           the most harm...to maximise effectiveness and value for money,           invasive species risk assessment, prioritisation and management must           be based on good science", which is York-derived rationale.
In         Sept 2012, the EU announced backing for the BirdLife Pacific Partnership         for a four-year &#8364;1.5 million regional programme to address the threats         posed by invasive species, to improve the livelihoods of over ten         million people in Pacific communities.
Another example is the World         Organisation for Animal Health's "Guidelines for assessing the risk           of non-native animals becoming invasive" (OIE 2011).
Fig.
2 of         their risk assessment stems directly from Williamson's stages of         invasion, and additional text strongly reflects York research: "What           are the features ... that may affect the probability of establishment           and spread of the animals?
Examples of the kind of inputs that may be           required are: 1) history of invasiveness elsewhere; 2) number and size           of releases or escapes (propagule pressure)".
Internalisation of economic costs.
Perrings and Williamson's         call to transfer true economic costs of IAS to those responsible is         being heeded; in some countries prevention costs are transferred to the         private sector by legislation on imports and safety precautions.
In New         Zealand, the private sector spends ~ $407 million pa controlling         pests, compared to $299.6 by Government.
The Government imposes levies         to support IAS control on those (a) likely to benefit from the control         and (b) who create or exacerbate IAS problems (e.g.
through trade).
Overall, a succession of steps in the fight against invasive species have       stemmed from York work.
First, awareness of the problem of IAS was       recognised.
Second, understanding the processes of invasions led to       strategies and legislation to minimise arrivals and control those that do.
And most recently, understanding of the economic drivers of invasion       (trade) is leading to economic and legislative levers to disincentivize       those who might accidentally bring about new invasions.
