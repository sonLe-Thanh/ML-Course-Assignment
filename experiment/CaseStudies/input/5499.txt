     The impact of `Zanzibar Soccer Queens' does not primarily reside       in football.
Screenings at over 30 public exhibitions, festivals and other       events helped surface many issues relating to the role and status of       Muslim girls and women in Africa.
It has influenced practice and policy       and has helped professionals and organisations adapt to changing cultural       values.
For example, the `Women Fighters' took part in a       USAID-sponsored match to create Social awareness of HIV/AIDS through       Sports.
Spectators were encouraged to watch the film to see the wider       value of soccer in women's health, fitness and general well-being.
Impacts include:            Emancipation for the players and other women in Zanzibar;       Improved understanding of Muslim women through cultural exchange;       Raised sports profile for women in Zanzibar, including school sports         education;       Improved health and wellbeing for girls and women in Zanzibar.
In 2013 USW commissioned Ayisi to return to Zanzibar for further       fieldwork aimed at gathering Impact evidence.
The result is a 23 minute       film explaining `Zanzibar Soccer Queens' impacts through the       passionate voices of the players, coach and key stakeholders including       Zanzibar's Minister for Information, Culture and Sports.
The film affords       an important opportunity to understand the issues involved without a       Euro-centric lens and can be viewed using this weblink       [7].
`Zanzibar Soccer Queens' was screened in Zanzibar in 2007 to an       audience of over 1,000 including Vice Minister of Information, Tourism,       Sports and Culture and the Secretary General of the Zanzibar Football       Association.
The team benefitted immediately.
Their coach, Nassra Juma,       asserts that as a result of the film, society in Zanzibar has accepted       that football can be played by women (Juma in [7], 05:06).
One player states: "Before, when we told our parents that we go for         training they wouldn't permit it.
Your brother would follow you to the         pitch and beat you with a stick if he saw you there wearing shorts, or         wearing a jersey.
He would say that this game is for hooligans, girls do         not play it &#8212; they are supposed to stay at home.
But when they came to         see that film being shown everywhere our brothers now remind us `go for         training, `go on for training' " (Zubeida in [7] at       05:54).
Another player says: "now when a woman plays football her         parents are happy.
They want girls to play football.
We have come far         and we are now moving on to another era" (Khatima in [7],       15:09).
The effects reached well beyond individual women being allowed to play       football.
The team once marginalised as `soccer hooligans' are now valued       ambassadors for Zanzibar.
The film gave them the opportunity to travel and       to promote a positive view of Zanzibar and Muslim women in a series of       cultural exchanges.
Following a screening at the Globians Film Festival,       the Regional Officer for Education, Integration and Democracy Brandenburg,       invited them to Potsdam to promote links between Zanzibar and Germany (Mitawi       in [7], 06:37).
The team's transformed status was reflected in       their official send off by the Minister for Information, Culture and       Sports.
"He told us that we were going to Germany as mirrors of         Zanzibar" (Juma in [7], 08:17).
In fact the team did       more than merely reflect Zanzibar.
By hosting screenings of the film       followed by school Q&amp;A sessions they became beacons of cultural and       social reform.
They simultaneously improved the visibility and       understanding of the lives of female Zanzibaris and gained an       understanding of European culture [8], (Mitawi in [7],       11:52).
External parties also used the film to promote better       understanding.
Football Unites Racism Divides (FURD) included it in their       2012 Festival because "...it managed to raise so many issues around         gender, race, religion and sport, and because we wanted to show         something that focussed on particularly under-represented groups &#8212; in         this case African women, challenging many stereotypes in the process"       [9].
The trip generated significant media coverage in Zanzibar.
As a result       the team found that the numbers of women wanting to join the team       increased (Ferouz in [7], 14:45).
Increased participation       was not confined to the `Women Fighters', but was nationwide [10].
This was partly due to the government.
In 2012 Zanzibar implemented a new       Sports Education Policy promoting football for girls.
Abdulghani Msoma,       instructor for the Confederation of African Football, attributes this       change to Ayisi's film and the empowerment it gave Coach Juma to lobby the       Government (Msoma in [7], 04:44 and 19:07).
The policy has       found favour among school staff: Headteacher Fatma Abeia: `Our government       deems it right to teach this sport in schools.
Schools are factories that       produce good fruits' (Abeia in [7], 23:04).
`Zanzibar Soccer Queens' has begun the normalisation of women and       sport in Zanzibar.
The result has been increased uptake in soccer from an       early age with the social benefits that brings.
One of the team summed her       feelings up: "I feel that I too am just like everyone, like normal"       (Zubeida in [7] 16:53).
