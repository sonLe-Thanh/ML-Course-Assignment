     The CSG's work on carbon sequestration and storage and the links between       carbon conservation, biodiversity and other ecosystem services has       underpinned high-level guidance on improving the assessment and reporting       mechanisms that are necessary to ensure REDD+ programs are environmentally       and socially sustainable.
REDD assists developing countries prepare and       implement REDD strategies, and is central to two of the three `Rio       Conventions' adopted at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the UN Framework       Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the UN Convention on Biological       Diversity (UN CBD).
However, it depends on knowing where carbon is stored,       robust estimates of likely losses in the absence of REDD payments, and the       capacity to track carbon storage through time.
The research has also       therefore had impact on the work of the UNFCCC and the UN CBD, and on       international development in the countries in which it works, and beyond.
Impacts on international development: International agencies or         institutions have been influenced by research     With approximately 40% of its land covered by forest and woodland,       Tanzania is one of the UN's pilot countries for REDD implementation.
The       spatially explicit maps of carbon storage in Tanzania produced by the       CSG-led VTA project were used by the Tanzanian Government's       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) delegation at the 2009       Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC1.
This led       directly to the Norwegian Government granting $1.86 million to the World       Wildlife Fund to expand the carbon mapping project across all of Tanzania2,       with a significant local training component (see below).
Gardner et al.
's 2012 Framework (ref 6, section 3) was distributed as an       Official Information Document for the Sixteenth meeting of the Subsidiary       Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice for the UN CBD in       May 2012, ahead of the 11th COP to the CBD3.
The impact on the       CBD Secretariat has been stated by a number of third party stakeholders.
For example:            The World Wildlife Fund: `WWF welcomes that the CBD Secretariat           considered the findings [of Gardner et al.].
This approach does allow           the integration of biodiversity safeguards into national REDD+           programs allowing a step-wise approach which can be improved over time           regarding the strategic planning and assessment of biodiversity           safeguards on a national level.
COP should encourage REDD+ countries           to apply a gradual, phased approach for integrating biodiversity           concerns into REDD+ programs as proposed by Gardner, T.A.
et al.
'4           Impacts on international development: provision of international         financial support and training, impacting on quality of life     The training provided by both the VTA project (two Tanzanian       universities, the University of Dar es Salaam and Sokoine University of       Agriculture are project partners) and the follow-on country-wide mapping       project has significantly enhanced Tanzania's in-country capacity to       monitor the effectiveness of future REDD payments.
For example:     `The inception phase planned recruitment and trainings at village and         district level.
The project [is building] the capacity of 20 district         staff in respective districts, and 10 Tanzanian research and training         institutions, to carry out field carbon assessment, data analysis and         monitoring.
The pilot aimed to demonstrate that civil society         participation in REDD+ readiness contributes to an effective and         equitable national programme, and this has been achieved.
'5     VTA also underpinned the foundation of other investments in sustainable       development in Tanzania.
For example, in an address to Rio+20 (the UN       Conference on Sustainable Development, 2012), the Tanzanian Minister of       State in the Vice President's Office (Environment) stated: `these         results [from Valuing the Arc] gave us a better understanding of         ecosystems and natural capital, and are used for natural capital         management initiatives, such as the Southern Agricultural Growth         Corridor of Tanzania, which is a public-private partnership to benefit         domestic food supply, smallholder farmers, and local communities.
'6       SAGCOT covers approximately one third of mainland Tanzania, and is       fostering inclusive, commercially successful agribusinesses, whilst       improving food security, reducing rural poverty and ensuring environmental       sustainability.
The work of RAS has contributed directly, through Gardner's official       advisory capacity, to the development of the Brazilian state government of       Para's Green County (Municipio Verde) program.
This is a flagship       initiative to shift land-management strategies in the eastern Amazon to a       more sustainable trajectory and data and findings from RAS are       contributing towards guidance on the management of secondary forests, fire       management and the development of responsible agriculture programs.
Impacts on practitioners and services: practitioners/professional have         used research findings in conducting their work     Based on his research above, Gardner has published `Monitoring Forest       Biodiversity'7, which has become a primary reference guide for       the monitoring of forest degradation and biodiversity by international       forestry and REDD+ practitioners.
For example:            The UN-REDD `Annotated Guide to useful resources for monitoring the         impacts of REDD+ on biodiversity and ecosystem services'8         (p13): "a comprehensive `textbook' on monitoring forest biodiversity.
This book ... could therefore be of particular use for monitoring           biodiversity under REDD+."
UN Food and Agriculture Organisation9: "This book is a           timely and accessible guide for biodiversity researchers,           policy-makers and forest managers."
The IUFRO report that Gardner co-led (section 3, ref 7) has received       widespread and positive coverage from the conservation community10.
It was formally launched at COP 18 of the UNFCCC (December 2012) where a       senior figure at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) noted that it       provided a unique trans-disciplinary assessment of the environmental,       social, economic and policy issues associated with REDD+11.
Based on the strength of the report's reception, the lead editor was       invited to advise the GEF on the formulation of their 2014-2018       Sustainable Forest Management strategy, and to ensure that it reflects the       report's key conclusions11,12.
