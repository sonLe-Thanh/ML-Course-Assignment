     As a direct result of Curtis' research, HWWS is now a key strategy in the       international fight against       diarrhoeal disease, attracting both public and &#8212; increasingly &#8212; private       investment.
As a result of the       innovative public-private collaborative approach to public health       campaigning, designed and       evaluated in the course of her work, Curtis has spearheaded an effective       alliance of industry with       organisations like the World Bank, USAID and UNICEF to promote good       hygiene.
This means that       millions of people around the world have now been exposed to HWWS       promotion programmes.
In       the last decade, diarrhoea deaths in under 5s have steadily fallen from       1.2m to 0.85m per year,5.1       and while some of the credit must go to economic development and improved       clinical treatment,       some is undoubtedly due to the promotion of better hand hygiene based on       Curtis' research.
Global awareness     Curtis' Ghanaian research demonstrated the potential benefits of       private-public collaboration in       promoting good hygiene.
It was following the dissemination of this       research at a series of       presentations organised by the PPPHW and WHO (2006-2008) that Curtis'       proposal of an annual       GHD was adopted, and on 15 October 2008 the first ever GHD was celebrated.5.2       It has steadily       gained momentum since.
In 2012, 200m people participated in GHD in over 100 countries.
GHD       events included special TV       shows, school competitions, nationwide poster campaigns and media outreach       &#8212; a combination of       public and private strategies.
As part of GHD 2012, 6 million Nepalese       noodle packs carried the       GHD logo; 160,000 Haitian schoolchildren saw handwashing demonstrations;       98,000 people       participated in community events and rallies in Bangladesh; 16 million       Keralans received       handwashing messages alongside a mass de-worming programme; and in the UK,       LSHTM worked       with Radox, a Unilever brand, to put GHD stands in every Sainsbury's       supermarket.
In 2012 there were 40,000 visitors to www.globalhandwashingday.org,       48,000 hits on World Wash       Up Twitter game, and GHD had 96,000 fans on Facebook.
On 15 October,       #iwashmyhands       trended globally on Twitter.
The most recent estimate is that GHD has now       reached 1 billion       people.5.3 Google trends in searches for `handwashing' show a       peak in October every year after       GHD.
Secondary reach through media     GHD has grabbed media headlines since it began in 2008, and Curtis has       been extensively and       regularly interviewed about her research in association with the event       ever since.
Among her many       media appearances have been interviews in the New York Times       (13/7/2008); Radio 4's Woman's         Hour (28/2/2012); BBC World Service's Health Check, which       has tens of millions of listeners,       especially in Africa (19/10/2011); BBC News and News Online       (13/10/11 and again on 15/10/12);       Sky News (6/3/12); and NPR Radio's Science Friday       (23/10/09).
In 2012 Curtis was nominated and highly commended by The Society of       Biology's Science       Communication Awards for her work to raise awareness of HWWS.5.4     Policy change and private sector campaigns     Curtis' research demonstrated conclusively that HWWS is both an effective       and cost-effective way       for governments to promote health.
As a result, an increasing number of       countries have been       developing their own national policies since 2008.5.5     Curtis' research into behaviour change for handwashing also galvanised       industry to invest in its       own HWWS public health campaigns.
Chief among these is Unilever's       `Lifebuoy Way of Life' (LWL)       launched in 2008.
LWL targets mothers and schoolchildren across Asia and       much of Africa, aiming       at getting hands washed at five key times to reduce diarrhoeal illness.
LSHTM is now included       among Lifebuoy's global partners, and Curtis is listed as one of       Lifebuoy's experts.
In this capacity       she and her research continue to contribute to the evolution of the       company's strategy.5.6 Lifebuoy       says its campaign has already reached 48 million people in eight countries       in Asia and Africa.
The       goal is to reach a billion by 2015.5.7 LWL has given good       results for Unilever and as a result other       manufacturers have started investing in their own HWWS campaigns.
Examples       include Procter &amp;       Gamble's 2012 launch of the Safeguard `Doctors on Wheels' programme to       promote handwashing       in Nigeria,5.8 and GoJo Industries' sponsorship of Canada's       STOP!
Clean Your Hands Day in       2012.5.9     Partly as a result of Curtis' work over 300 organisations from civil       society, government and the       private sector espouse handwashing with soap.5.10
