     Through adoption of new technologies, UCL's research into USD       technologies has led to commercial benefits for companies developing new       drugs by reducing the time to take new products to manufacture, with         ensuing cost savings.
EPSRC-commissioned reviews of the IMRC       programmes have provided overall commentary on the impact of USD       technologies [a]; the following provides specific examples of some of the       industrial impacts achieved.
New technologies adopted by industry: in 2009 GSK established a       GSK-UCL Centre of Excellence in Bioprocessing: "in recognition of the         high value of USD technologies in facilitating bioprocess development,       GSK invested ~ &#163;1.03 million through UCL.
This         resulted in the successful development and integration of UCL USD         technologies at GSK where they are employed to complement and accelerate         in-house activities focused on (i) de-risking of lead molecules (ii)         improving process understanding and (iii) abbreviating the critical path         into full development.
The use of high throughput microscale         technologies for such purposes helps ensure only           industrialisable molecules are selected and accelerated         into development.
In turn this can mean the difference           between success and failure for a medicine through         clinical trial stages and beyond."
[b]     The independent use by industry of USD technologies is growing.
One       example is to aid pilot-scale process development.
The director of       biopharm development at MedImmune said: "A major benefit is the increased           predictability of cell line development that         results from the use of USD techniques at an early project stage.
Since         2010 USD techniques have led to more predictable and better cell line         performance when scaled up resulting in ~30% resource saving           on each development project and an increase in           project capacity of also ~30% per year, both at laboratory         and pilot (100-200L bioreactor) scale."
[c]     Similarly, Protherics' application of USD techniques in production of its       snake venom antidote in 2009 showed 20% savings in cost of goods       compared to the previous process, saving the company around &#163;200,000         since 2008.
Subsequently Protherics applied IMRC USD techniques in       the development of the process for CytoFab, a new product for sepsis       therapy, where USD techniques cut the development length in half       compared to traditional development techniques, saving around &#163;200,000.
The process as developed using USD methods was validated at pilot-plant       scale for use in 2009-2011 for clinical trials, having "triggered a           stage payment of &#163;10 m to Protherics in 2008."
[d]     Pfizer has adopted the use of USD techniques as part of the toolbox in         its process development activities to help improve liquid-solid       separation in cell culture processing.
In particular, the techniques were       used to help understand the flocculation behaviour of high cell density       lysates and develop an improved separation process using flocculation and       centrifugation [text removed for publication] [e].
In the area of       formulation processes for conjugated vaccines Pfizer have adopted USD       techniques, therefore avoiding large-scale evaluation studies, which         are costly and use industrial capacity for non-commercial production       [e].
As of 2013, savings associated with the non-utilization of facility       capacity are $280k/product transfer/site and the improved process       understanding via USD characterisation may also lead to better risk       mitigation with scale-up, technology transfer and rapid root-cause       analysis for process-related issues.
UCL's research has helped achieve a Quality by Design (QbD) agenda &#8212; a US       Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiative for the development of new       therapies.
This requires companies to work in new ways to achieve       regulatory approval and validation status for their products, and offers       major cost-saving potential.
One USD collaborator comments, "A       key feature of USD technologies is their role in helping           biopharmaceutical companies to deliver a Quality by Design agenda       via the early quantification of Critical Processing Parameters which         determine Critical Product Attributes, eg the early indication of the         impacts of process shear stress on the process streams involved in the         Protherics studies.
The FDA Quality by Design agenda is already valued         at more than US$20bn to the overall biopharmaceuticals sector eg through         a 25% reduction in time to market and delivery of more robust         processes."
[d]     Next generation products developed by industry: One major impact       has been via collaborative programmes focused on technology transfer into       new sectors such as next generation recombinant vaccines.
Over &#163;1m of       industrial funding has been gained to support studies in the supply of       novel vaccines and the use of USD to devise de novo bioprocesses eg in       2010-2011 for novel fusion proteins with ImmunoBiology, which the company       described as "extremely valuable" for its business activities [f].
In the       period 2004-2008 BioVex, a UK biotechnology discovery company, were able       to use USD to investigate the processing of a major vaccine candidate       therapy, a Herpes Simplex virus engineered to kill cancer cells       specifically.
This understanding of the manufacturability of the virus       product enabled BioVex to demonstrate and ultimately realise the value of       their product through an up to US$1bn acquisition in 2011 by the US         company Amgen.[g].
A second key emerging industrial sector has been the provision of         human cells for therapy via the development of USD technologies for       whole bioprocess design.
A &#163;1.8m company-TSB programme (2007-11) allowed       UCL to explore the role of USD in speeding the development of allogeneic       cell-based therapies.
For example, for one of the partners, ReNeuron, the       Chief Scientific Officer observed how USD tools helped them "identify         ways in which robustness and acceptable yields may be retained," and       that "The increased insight and understanding helps enhance           the quality of process information to be used by the         Contract Manufacturing Organisation (CMO) to inform scale up and also to       help inform regulatory bodies with respect to meeting Quality by           Design standards."
[h]     Creation of spin-out company: USD studies were an essential       research technique in the development of novel adsorbent materials for       bioprocessing, which UCL filed as a patent in 2013.
A UCL start-up,       Puridify, was established in 2013 to develop the new technology, which       offers a ten-fold increase in purification productivity over existing         reagents, with a lower lifetime cost.
This will broaden       patient access to drugs through reducing prices.
In May 2013, the company       won a &#163;100k OneStart award to take the venture forward with the       establishment of 25m2 of bioprocessing laboratories and the       engagement of 3 expert bioprocess scientists/engineers [i].
