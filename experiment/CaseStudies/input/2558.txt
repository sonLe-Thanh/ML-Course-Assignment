     Strategies to engage with relevant beneficiaries by both CRFR and       ChildLine have led to significant and far-reaching impacts on policy,       practice and the development of support for children and families.
For both projects, strategies to ensure wide uptake started with initial       discussions with practitioners to draw out policy and practice       implications which were then communicated alongside the research findings.
For project 1, uptake was facilitated through engagement with 164       policy-makers and practitioners, including:            discussion with children from the Children's Parliament to include         reflections on policy and practice solutions with the research findings       letters sent to Directors of Social Work and Education drawing out the         implications       findings presented to internal Scottish government meetings.
Press         coverage included TES, Scotsman, Sunday Herald, BBC TV and radio, and         local press.
For project 2, over 166 practitioners and policy-makers attended       discussion events and ChildLine worked with a group of young people who       communicated findings through drama performed at the launch conference,       and made into a short film.
Findings were:            presented to the Cross-Party Group on Sexual Health       sent to Directors of Education and Social Work in Scotland       covered in the Times, Herald and Scotsman newspapers.
ChildLine continued to draw on the findings from both projects in       responses to policy consultations on alcohol, the age of consent, and       sexual health policy.
Impacts from the research have been investigated       through an ESRC funded PhD project (2008-12).
[5.4] [5.5]     Project 1: impacts relate mainly to alcohol services and policy.
It was       seen particularly as a useful tool to raise awareness of the impact of       parental alcohol use on children:     "It was incredibly helpful ...
It highlighted alcohol as a `hidden' issue       in families.
.. there were many more families out there that our services       were not reaching" (Research Officer, Barnardos).
[5.1]     Significant impacts from project 1 include:            Change in funding policy of Lloyds TSB Foundation Partnership Drugs         Initiative to include children affected by alcohol from 2008, due to         influence of ChildLine Director on board of trustees [5.6] [5.9]       Development of further research on children and alcohol by Barnardos         and by Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems in 2009 and         policy-influencing activities which have raised the profile of children         affected by parental alcohol use in the policy process (testimonial from         Evelyn Gillan [5.8], document [5.3])       Contribution to change in Scottish policy on alcohol: the research was         referenced in key policy documents [5.2] as part of the SNP's new         approach to alcohol policy taking a `whole population approach' (2008         onwards).
The specific utility of the research is described by the lead         policy-officer: "Thinking about the &#8212; often hidden &#8212; impact on children         and families was a key part of the jigsaw...
The ChildLine work was         helpful in helping to expose some of the nature and extent of the         harmful effects of alcohol misuse on those other than the drinker"         (Alison Douglas, Former Head of Alcohol Policy, Scottish Government)         [5.2].
Project 2: the research contributed to changing attitudes among those       responsible for delivering sex education to children and young people.
The research became widely known and used in Health Board networks in         Glasgow due to the networking of ChildLine's policy officer.
It was also         taken up by a key Health Board employee with responsibility for the         implementation of the Sexual Health Strategy who presented the findings         to six health boards (2007-10).
The research increased practitioners'         confidence in presenting the needs of children and young people, as         described by one health promotion officer: "It made me much more         confident in presenting information as it was backed up by solid         evidence from children themselves who had phoned ChildLine.
You can't         dispute this" (Principal Health promotion Officer, NHS Greater Glasgow         and Clyde) [5.7]       A particularly significant development that has led to wide reach (see         below) of the findings was that they were made into a quiz to use in         training parents [5.1].
The parents in this programme commented that the         ChildLine data made them change their attitudes towards their role in         their child's sex education (Evaluation report published 2009).
The research was included in sexual health for parents, teachers,         health improvement staff, and youth workers in one area (2008-13),         impacting on all (more than 98,000) children of school age in this area         [5.1].
A review of call-taking on sexual health issues by ChildLine Scotland         resulted in an improved service for the thousands of children calling on         sexual health issues every year [5.1].
