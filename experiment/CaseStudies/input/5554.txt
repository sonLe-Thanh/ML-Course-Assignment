     The exhibitions Figures and Fictions and Distance and Desire       described in section 2 deepened a wide international public's       understanding of questions of race, identity and representation in the       works of contemporary African photographers, as well as the rich       historical holdings of SA photography at the Walther Collection.
The reach of this is demonstrated by the large number and types       of audiences attracted by the two exhibitions.
F&amp;F was the       first ambitious exhibition of contemporary SA photography in a major UK       museum and, as described below, attracted large audiences (over 35,000)       [1], generated multiple events and activities, affected museum exhibition,       educational and outreach programming, prompted acquisitions and was the       focus of public discussion and debate as well as extensive media       attention.
D&amp;D was the first exhibition in the US or Germany       to bring together archival photographs of Africans with contemporary       artists who critically engage with similar materials.
It stimulated       collaboration with a public museum, attracted a substantial audience       (5,000 in New York, Ulm still ongoing) diverse educational events, an       academic symposium, an expansion of a collection and huge critical       attention in the USA and Germany (receiving more than 100 reviews in       total) [2].
The significance of the two exhibitions is demonstrated, most       fundamentally, by the important role they played in bringing debates on       identity and representation, particularly in African photography, to an       international public.
This not only exposed the general public to these       issues, it also provided a pathway to broaden audiences at these cultural       institutions.
For F&amp;F, Garb worked in collaboration with the       Black Heritage and Culture initiative at the V&amp;A to organise a series       of evening tours and talks intended specifically to attract new         publics to the museum and gallery setting.
These included special       tours and events for African/Caribbean women (a group of 30), attendees       from ethnic minority backgrounds, and those interested in African art and       culture [3].
For example, the Afropolitans event on 24 June 2011 took its       cue from F&amp;F to offer over 500 attendees a free evening of       music, workshops and performance celebrating African photography, fashion,       and style, designed to introduce contemporary African culture and debates       to UK audiences.
The event received widespread coverage in       African-interest blogs, such as MsAfropolitan and African Art         in London [4].
Another special event, `Museums at Night &#8212; SA Figures       &amp; Fictions' (13 May 2011) had about 700 visitors, of whom at least 40%       were new to the V&amp;A (`with a strong South African presence') and       feedback forms describe the show and related events as `inspirational'       [3].
The exhibitions also consolidated existing viewers and provided         educational events for the general public and specialist audiences.
F&amp;F was accompanied by three lunchtime lectures, an artist's       panel and a two-day symposium entitled `Poetics and Politics of       Photographic Depictions of People'.
All were sold out, with 150 attendees       each.
There were also three curator-led walkabouts (50 attendees each).
In       New York, five gallery talks were held to accompany D&amp;D (all       sold out, 50 attendees each) in addition to a 2-day symposium at New York       University (NYU) entitled `Encounters with the African Archive' (175       attendees) chaired by Garb.
There were also class visits from NYU, Cooper       Union and the Fashion Institute of Technology (20 students per group) [2].
These events collectively exposed a wide range of attendees to SA and       African photography and the critical debates around colonial and       post-colonial representational practices that surround it.
Through the enormous media coverage they generated, both shows raised         awareness and critical discussion of African photography and related         issues of race and representation beyond the gallery walls.
Thus the       reach of the events was extended to far wider audiences than those who       visited the shows and related events.
For F&amp;F, Garb       collaborated on eight films for the V&amp;A TV channel with an estimated 4       million viewers [1].
These were combined into an hour-long documentary       which was shown, under a pre-existing agreement with British Airways, to       passengers on long-haul flights over three months (although exact viewing       figures are not available, about 3 million passengers a year have access       to inflight entertainment on the airline) [1].
The strong press response to both exhibitions demonstrates how vividly       the research contributed to wider public debate on the issues explored by       the research.
Critical media discussion immediately engaged with the major       themes of F&amp;F, bringing issues around pictorial genealogies,       documentary, ethnographic and portrait traditions, and post-apartheid       practices to public debate.
Examples include [5] coverage in the Guardian       (23/4/2011; 263k ABC print circulation, extended by the substantial web       presence) Observer (17/4/2011; 303k circulation), and the Independent         on Sunday (10/4/2011; 154k circulation).
Several media outlets       provided pictorial coverage, further extending the reach of the original       exhibitions, including the British Journal of Photography (April       2011), a 12-page spread in The Sunday Times Spectrum Mag (April       2011).
Coverage extended well beyond the UK; for example, the SA       contemporary web-based art magazine Artthrob (6-8,000 visitors per       month according to the website) reviewed it in depth [5].
TV and radio       coverage was similarly broad, reaching a combined total of over 78 million       people.
Programmes included BBC 3 Nightwaves (11/4/2011; 2.25m listeners       per week), BBC World Service, The Strand, (13/4/2013; 1.9m listeners per       week), BBC World News (20/6/2011), BBC4 News, and BBC World Television       (21/6/2011; 74m per week) [1].
This considerably extended the audience for       the show and all programmes contained substantive discussion of works,       photographers and themes connected to the show.
D&amp;D had a similarly vast reach.
The three New York exhibitions       were widely reviewed in both the mainstream press and in publications       targeting African American audiences.
These included its selection as New         York Times critics' pick (28/9/2012), and review (20/8/2012; 1.6m       print and digital circulation according to the Audit Bureau of       Circulations), New Yorker Photo Booth (March 2013) and the International         Herald Tribune, (13/8/2012; 44.2m online readers) [6].
Special       interest publications included reviews in the New York art and lifestyle Whitewall       magazine and Another Africa (later reprinted in the Guardian)       [6].
German press coverage included, for example, on TAZ.de (06/7/2013);       Deutsche Welle (22/7/2013) and the C&amp; Platform for International Art       from African Perspectives.
Many of these engaged directly with the       questions raised by Garb's research; TAZ pointed out, for example, that       the `extraordinary research enabled the exhibition to showcase pictorial       programs in ways that deconstructed the multiple strategies in which the       West has imagined Africa' [7].
Through extensive discussions and collaborations with colleagues in both       the V&amp;A and the Walther Collection, Garb's research transformed the       knowledge base of her curatorial, museum and academic partners, and impacted         on museum/ collection programming.
Working with her on F&amp;F       enabled the V&amp;A to redress an imbalance in its exhibition programming       which had not till then shown SA work in any depth [8].
This exhibition       prompted the invitation to collaborate with the Walther Collection: Artur       Walther invited her to curate D&amp;D after seeing F&amp;F       [9].
D&amp;D was also accompanied by a closed scholar's forum,       convened by Garb, for eight curators from the US, Europe and SA to discuss       the Walther Collection works.
These discussions culminated in the       published catalogue [see above, b].
Acquisition policy at both collaborating institutions was informed       by the shows, reflecting a new awareness of the shifting geographies of       art history and the impetus to extend collections beyond historic centres       and especially in the direction of Africa, and contributing to         national and international cultural heritage by ensuring that these       works are recognised and made available to the public through important       national and private collections.
For example, the V&amp;A expanded its SA       holdings and purchased 14 works first exhibited at F&amp;F [8].
The Walther Collection, which was already dedicated to collecting African       photography, acquired 20 contemporary works, 30 postcards and 8 albums       under advice from Garb for display in D&amp;D and as part of its       ongoing expansion of the collection [2].
At both the V&amp;A and Walther Collection, the collaboration stimulated         related exhibitions demonstrating its impact on an expanded interest in         African work.
Prompted by F&amp;F, in April-July 2011 the       V&amp;A hosted a separate and parallel exhibition of 120 vintage prints by       the SA photographer David Goldblatt, which were held in the collection but       had not been shown since 1987 [10].
Garb advised on this show, which       contributed new research and educational resources made publically       available on the museum website, and through a micro-site dedicated to       this photographer [10].
For the Goldblatt exhibition itself, Garb edited       the wall texts, captions and pamphlets, bringing her research expertise to       bear on contextualising Goldblatt's work.
In Neu-Ulm, Germany, D&amp;D       prompted the Walther Collection to collaborate with the Ulmer Museum on a       related exhibition entitled `Woven Identities', making links between       cultural artefacts and images and situating textiles from the museum in       dialogue with photographs from the Walther Collection featuring related       patterned fabrics [7].
To complement this, Garb provided a guided tour of       D&amp;D for the curators of `Woven Identities' and convened a       discussion of interrelated themes for curators and museum educators in Ulm       in June 2013.
