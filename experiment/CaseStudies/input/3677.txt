     DDN research has impacted on community organisations' and local       government working practices in relation to disaster and risk management       in Southern Africa and South Asia, and through this impacted upon the       lives of people residing in these disaster-prone regions.
The shift to       disaster prevention through community action has had clear impact in each       project country cited here:             Bangladesh: The research led to health being highlighted as         core to community-based disaster resilience, an approach adopted by         multiple organisations working in Bangladesh.
For example, the         International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR,B) directly         combines health security and community based disaster risk reduction         activities in its target communities [Corrob.
5.1] as a result         of the ESRC supported DDN project on Health Security for Disaster         Resilience [3.9].
Mozambique: The first of two concurrent DFID research projects         revamped a water and food monitoring laboratory in the second city,         Beira, and transferred pathogen monitoring technology from Bangladesh to         Mozambique, establishing regular south-south-north exchanges and         in-country capacity-building.
The emphasis on informing and establishing         monitoring and intervention systems brought establishment of a risk         management department within local government in Beira, Mozambique, for         cholera warning and monitoring.
State authorities recognised the         benefits of people-centred disaster risk reduction through the formation         of risk committees.
The impact of the research was that a sub-area of         Beira City under the influence of one of the most successful committees         was cleaned by local residents and diarrhoeal diseases declined from an         estimated several thousand cases per year to less than 50 in the year         following the implementation of this strategy [Corrob.
5.2].
Government departmental capacity was improved, a module was introduced         into the medical degree of the local university programme (2008 to         present) and the project attracted and informed an international cholera         vaccine trial and subsequent consortia studies on cholera there.
Incidence of cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases reduced significantly         in this area as a result of these actions.
Nepal: Following the research on disaster risk management in         Nepal, one risk committee in eastern Nepal instigated a road safety         programme and a zero-energy initiative using land fill sites.
In direct         response to the finding that risk committees are more effective when         integrated into local government, the committee was incorporated into         municipality structures.
This influenced the entire Government of Nepal         National Strategy for disaster risk reduction to adopt the risk and         resilience approaches advocated through this work [Corrob.
5.3].
The process of this research also established a disaster management and         sustainable development centre at Kathmandu University, Nepal and led         the Government of Nepal to jointly host with DDN two international         seminars on disaster risk reduction and the 2009 Dealing with Disasters         International Conference in Kathmandu.
This focused on "Resilience         through Local Governance", the focus subsequently being acknowledged in         Policy Platforms of the United Nations Hyogo Framework for Action.
Pakistan: The DDN research directly guided the establishment of         Pakistan's first disaster and development-focused centre at Peshawar         University [Corrob.
5.4].
Most significantly, DDN research led         to the establishment of a framework through which the Peshawar group,         supported by Government of Pakistan, now implements integrated social,         geophysical and fluvial studies of disaster reduction amongst local         communities in conflict and environmental hazard zones, such as nearby         Swat Valley.
Zimbabwe: The DDN instigated Zimbabwe's first disaster and         development programme of research and postgraduate studies at Bindura         University.
In collaboration with Basilwizi Trust it established         community advocacy groups in northern Zimbabwe.
Through community-based         groups in the Zambezi Valley Advocacy Project the research implemented         systems of learning for constitutional rights.
This was applied to         management of fisheries and wildlife resources.
The outcomes were         presented to three Government Ministers in the project's national level         workshop attended by traditional leaders, Ministers and the DFID         Zimbabwe Head.
As a result the Tonga people of northern Zimbabwe are         less harassed by corrupt officials, game poachers and illegal harvesting         techniques on Lake Kariba, one of their main sources of food [Corrob.
5.5].
International recognition of the work of DDN is demonstrated by the       policy development work DDN affiliates have undertaken with impact on a       range of organisations:            An indicative example can be accessed as the bulk of Chapter two of         the 2009 edition of the World Disasters Report produced by the         International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies         (IFRC 2009).
Integrated disaster, development and resilience research has supported         the global policy environment through inputs at the interim UN platforms         for disaster reduction of 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013 and additional DDN         organised sessions of the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk         Reduction [Corrob.
5.1].
The DDN was the only UK university research group accredited to         partnership in the process of the Hyogo Framework for Action launched in         2005 by the United Nations as its International Strategy for Disaster         Reduction.
DDN will input to its revision in 2015 [Corrob.
5.1].
The DDN has also been recognised in the UK for its influence on         Enhanced Learning and Research for Humanitarian Assistance (ELRHA), (&#163;16         million; HEFCE, DFID, Welcome, SIDA) for which Collins, DDN Director,         has been appointed to the Steering Group [Corrob.
5.6].
This research on community-centred and health-centred disaster risk         reduction (DRR) is also highlighted in events such as the Global Risk         Forum International Disaster Reduction Conference Series and One Health         Forum at Davos for which DDN is an on-going partner institution [Corrob.
5.7].
