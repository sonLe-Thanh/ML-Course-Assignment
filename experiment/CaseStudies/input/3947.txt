     The research outlined above has: (1) had major impacts relating to the UK       energy sector through the provision of policy advice to the UK       government e.g., through the committees of the House of Commons and the       House of Lords; (2) had global reach as evidenced by the group's       involvement in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (see       Mitchell et al.
2011), the Global Energy Assessment, and the Smart Energy       for Europe Platform; (3) has engaged with key stakeholders in the         energy industry e.g., the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets       (OFGEM) and The Consumer Association &#8212; Which?
; and (4) has informed         public debate.
Evidence of a major impact on UK energy policy is evident through       the following:       (1) Mitchell was one of only two academics to give evidence to the House       of Lords European Union Committee (April 21st 2008) as part of       its `The EU's Target for Renewable Energy' report.
The Committee's remit       was to critically examine the 2008 European Commission commitment by 2020,       to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and to deriving 20% of       final energy consumption from renewables.
The evidence provided was       influential with Mitchell cited on p. 24, 25, 31 and 34 of the final       report (House of Lords, 2008, Item #1).
(2) Evidence was provided to the House of Commons Energy and Climate       Change Committee (April 2009) as part of its `The Future of Britain's       Electricity Networks' report.
The report's remit was to help develop new       approaches to managing Britain's future energy needs.
Again, the evidence       provided was influential and is cited on p. 9, 24, 27, 34, 37, 43, 45, 46,       47, 52 and 53 of the final report (House of Commons, 2010, Item #2).
(3) Mitchell et al.
(2011) submitted a response to DECC on their       consultation on Electricity Market Reform (Item #3), as well as       contributing to a UKERC submission (Item #4).
(4) In 2011 evidence submitted by the EPG was used by Scottish and       Southern Energy (SSE) to shape policy and then as a basis for SSE's       `Energy White Paper' submission (Item #5).
(5) Mitchell was one of only three UK academics to give oral evidence to       the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee (June 19th       2012) as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the `Draft Energy Bill'       report (Item #6).
Subsequent supporting written evidence (Ev.221)       was provided on July 20th 2012, with the oral and written       evidence provided again influential and cited on p. 9, 17, 21, 39 and 60       of the final report (House of Commons, 2012) (Item #7).
Mitchell       was also one of only two academics who gave oral evidence to the Scrutiny       Committee for the Energy Bill in January 2013 (House of Commons 2013) (Item         #8).
(6) The Energy Policy Group were one of three UK academic groups       commissioned by OFGEM to review UK transmission charging arrangements (Item         #9).
In addition to shaping government policy, Mitchell and Woodman have       engaged with key stakeholders in the UK energy industries to influence         policies, procedures and practices.
Which?
commissioned reports from       2 academics, Mitchell being one of them (Hoggett et al., 2011, to provide       background to their ongoing campaign about the affordability of energy to       society.
Research reports have also been written for Greenpeace (Woodman,       2009) and Chatham House (Froggatt et al.
2012), whilst third sector       organisations have used EPG research in their policy briefings (Burke et       al., 2012; No2NuclearPower, 2009; see Items #10).
Finally, research has been directly used to inform and affect public         debate.
This has occurred through engagement with high-quality UK       national media.
Most notably, EPG research has been cited by: BBC website       (22/05/2012); The Daily Telegraph (12/07/2011) with the latter article       generating 249 comments; on Radio 4's `What the Papers Say'; the New       Statesman Centenary Issue (with Mitchell being the only energy academic to       critique the last 100 years of energy, and society's fitness for the next       100 years); and in The Daily Telegraph (21/01/2011), generating 70       comments (Items #11).
Additionally, Mitchell has her own Guardian       Online web-page (http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/catherine-mitchell) and       has had articles published in The Guardian: 03/05/2012 (22 comments);       28/02/2012 (68 comments); 11/03/2011 (110 comments); 13/12/2010 (57       comments); 08/10/2009 (62 comments); 27/02/2009 (46 comments) (Items         #12).
Both EPG and IGov have blog sites (the hits for IGov in 2013       being: March 934, April 419, May 571, with blogs widely re-blogged).
