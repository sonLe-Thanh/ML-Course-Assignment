     The theoretical mechanics base for the understanding of aerial movement       provides a framework for designing coaching progressions to learn twisting       somersaults.
Without this understanding of the mechanics coaches have       generated their own ideas on the basis of practical experience.
Such ideas       have wide variation, conflict with each other, and often have little       practical or theoretical basis.
With an understanding of the mechanics,       coaches have common ground and are better able to communicate with each       other to make sense of their practical experience of aerial movements.
Many of the top coaches are former competitors who were able to perform       the skills without understanding the mechanics.
Now with a mechanics base       they are able to coach to a high level, giving detailed technical       instruction to their athletes.
As a consequence there has been an impact       on (a) improved coaching leading to (b) improved performance by athletes       in the period January 2008 to July 2013.
In gymnastics and trampolining the tilt-twist concept has become       universal for advanced aerial skills and the International Gymnastics       Federation teach it in Gymnastics, Trampolining and Acrobatic Gymnastics       Academy Courses, referencing Dr Yeadon as the world expert in this area [5.1].
Most apparatus dismounts and the double somersaults with twist on floor in       Artistic Gymnastics are now learned consciously with tilt-twist techniques       whereas in the past this was more accidental than deliberate [5.1].
In 2009 Dr Yeadon received the Special Recognition Award from the Nik       Stuart Foundation for his contribution to gymnastics from his research       work.
In Canada gymnastics and trampoline coaches use the research of Dr Yeadon       as a basis for teaching twisting somersaults since it has been       incorporated into the coach education programmes [5.2].
This       knowledge is currently being incorporated [5.2] into the       gymnastics coach education materials of a number of countries (Norway,       Sweden, Portugal, Japan).
USA Diving developed coaching progressions based on the results of this       research that have led to international first performances of twisting       dives [5.3].
In the aerials event of freestyle skiing in which triple somersaults are       performed with twist the research results of Dr Yeadon currently form the       basis of coaching specific asymmetrical arm movements for producing and       removing tilt in the USA and Canada [5.4, 5.5].
Additionally tilt       twist is coached in Australia, China, Russia, Japan and Switzerland [5.5].
In summary there has been a significant impact with a Sea-change in       coaching and acrobatic performance and with a large current reach across       many countries (USA [5.3, 5.4], Canada [5.2, 5.5], China [5.5],       Russia [5.5], Japan [5.2, C5], Australia [5.5],       Norway [5.2], Sweden [5.2], Switzerland [5.5],       Portugal [5.2]) and many sports (gymnastics [5.1, 5.2],       trampolining [5.2], diving [5.3], freestyle skiing [5.4,         5.5]).
In addition to the improvements in coaching and performance       individual athletes have benefitted in terms of being able to train safely       and compete successfully and spectators have benefitted in terms of an       enhanced spectacle in competitive events [5.1].
Routes to Impact     The impact described above has been effected in a number of ways.
Dissemination of information arising from the under-pinning research has       comprised: (a) sport conference presentations (e.g.
Yeadon, 1999); (b)       presentations to national governing bodies of sport (c) a chapter for a       book commissioned by United States Diving (Yeadon, 2001); (d) general       interest publications such as Yeadon (2000); (e) lectures to 5000       university sport students; (f) the website of the Sports Biomechanics and       Motor Control Research Group; (g) the Loughborough University Library       publication repository.
Institutional support for dissemination has       comprised travel funds for international conference presentations and       presentations to sporting bodies.
