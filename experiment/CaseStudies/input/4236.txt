     The impact of the programme of research described above can be seen in       five key respects:     Impact A.
The impact of this work is improved respect for diversity,         improved awareness of own ethnic identity and that of others and reduced         racist and sectarian behaviour among preschool children in Northern         Ireland.
This was achieved through the development of an evidenced       based programme `Media Initiative for Children', the preschool education       programme that promoted respect for ethnic diversity.
Based on original       research, this was a resource for schools, teachers and children that was       designed to maximise impact of the findings of the research.
The Media       Initiative for Children combines cartoon media messages around diversity       with an early years curriculum.
Cartoons are set in a play park and       messages are reinforced with learning resources and interactive       activities.
Teachers and early years practitioners are given professional       development over two days on how to use the learning resource.
This has       had impact on staff from 1,200 preschool settings across Northern Ireland       and the Republic of Ireland who have been trained to deliver this       programme and over 40,000 preschool children who have undertaken the       programme since development in 2006.
This is approximately every       pre-school child in Northern Ireland since the development (allowing for       absence etc.).
This is saturation coverage in terms of `reach' in the       Northern Ireland context.
To put these numbers into context it is more       than one trained practitioner for every primary and pre-school setting in       Northern Ireland.
Figures indicate 946 Government run/maintained       pre-school and nursery class settings in Northern Ireland in the 2012-13       data.
The figure is also considerably greater than the `annual' intake       into pre-school and nursery class settings.
Figures indicate 14,613 pupils       are in Government run/maintained ante and pre-school year nursery class       settings in Northern Ireland in the 2012-13 data available, equating to an       intake of about 7,300 students per year.
The main cluster randomised trial       referred to above [6] has provided strong evidence that this       programme is having a measurable and positive impact on preschool       children's attitudes to respect for ethnic diversity with a strong basis       to claim generalizability to the whole population who have used the       programme.
Impact B.
The work has significantly shaped Government policy in         Northern Ireland and their approach to cross-community relations.
It       significantly influenced submissions to the Department of Education on its       consultation in 2010 regarding `Community Relations, Equality and       Diversity in Education' policy.
Connolly was invited to give oral evidence       to the UK Parliamentary Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in relation to       their investigation into hate crime in Northern Ireland specifically in       relation to `young people and the future' based on the findings of the       research.
There is also evidence of impact at policy level in the Republic       of Ireland (ROI).
The ROI Ombudsman for Children, noted the significant       impact that early years interventions had and how they were underpinned by       work that `originated in Northern Ireland following research by Dr Paul         Connolly of Queen's University, Belfast, which demonstrated that         children at an early age are sensitive to difference and diversity.'
Impact C. The work also had an impact on policy and practice of a         number of Non-Government Organisations.
The findings led to Northern       Ireland-based organisation `Early Years' in collaboration with the       `US-based Peace Initiatives Institute' (Pii) to use the approaches       suggested by Connolly towards respect for diversity as they developed the       `Media Initiative' programme.
It should be noted that these organisations       have excellent reputations.
Early Years is the umbrella organization for       preschool playgroups in Northern Ireland and has a strong reputation in       Northern Ireland and produces the majority of materials dealing on       diversity in this context.
Connolly was instrumental as a consultant in       helping this change in approach.
Evidence of the substantive impact of the       research and how it informed the materials and focus of the programme was       provided on the websites of both organisations.
Early Years state on their       website that `the development of the initiative was greatly influenced         by research `Too Young to Notice?'
carried out by Professor Paul         Connolly from Queen's University Belfast which showed that by the age of         six a significant proportion of children (1 in 6) in Northern Ireland         are making sectarian and racial remarks'.
Similar evidence is       available on Pii's website, with reference to the key impact of the       research on their work is made on their home page: `Children as young         as three understand differences between themselves and others and begin         to take on the attitudes and prejudices around them &#8212; which later can         lead to conflict-oriented behaviour'.
The impact that the research       had on policy and practice decisions made during developments influencing       the design, development and delivery of the programme is provided in the       article listed in research outputs above [2].
Impact D. The impact on the general populations of education         professionals in terms of improved professional practice and children in         terms of reduced racist attitudes and increased respect for ethnic         diversity.
Outcomes and impact of the research through the Media       Initiative for Children programme was assessed through rigorous trial       methodology.
As with earlier iterations, impact on young children was seen       in large-scale trials.
This gives good validity to claims of impact to the       general population now it runs throughout Northern Ireland.
There has been       impact with wider reach.
The impact of the research on practice is       evidenced by prominent references made to the research on both the Early       Years and Pii websites.
One of the main funders of the programme, The       Atlantic Philanthropies, makes significant reference to the research and       explains that, `As a result of the evaluation findings, Early Years is         taking this programme to scale across its network of 1200 members in         Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with support from the         government and the European Union.'
The beneficiaries have been the       1200 members and the children they teach and look after in the pre-school       settings.
As noted above this is saturation in terms of numbers of trained       staffs for pre-school and nursery settings in Northern Ireland.
Another impact of the research has been that it also provided the       evidence base that enabled US-based Sesame Workshop to collaborate with       the BBC to produce a local production of Sesame Street for Northern       Ireland &#8212; named Sesame Tree &#8212; that promoted respect for ethnic       diversity.
Two series of Sesame Tree have been produced so far and they       have now also been broadcast UK-wide on the BBC's CBeebies channel.
The       methods developed to evaluate the pilot of the Media Initiative for       Children were subsequently employed to undertake an impact evaluation of       Sesame Tree, commissioned by Sesame Workshop and conducted in 2008       (&#163;100,000, led by Connolly).
The ability of the TV series to impact on       children was provided in publicity material produced by Sesame Workshop.
In addition the impact of the research in shaping Sesame Workshop's       approach to increasing respect for ethnic diversity can be evidenced by a       short video clip interview of Connolly by `Hilda the Hare' (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g71eekNt844       ).
Two series have been aired.
Series One ran in Northern Ireland (Aug       2008), the whole of the UK (Oct 2008), Series Two ran in the whole of the       UK in Nov 2010.
Connolly's work also led to him becoming an international       adviser to Sesame Workshop in the field of promoting respect for ethnic       diversity.
Impact E: International impact of the programme of research on the         development of early childhood programmes in other countries.
The       Media Initiative for Children programme was funded to go to scale (i.e.
be       available to all schools as a package) on the island of Ireland.
Pilot       studies have been undertaken in several other countries including Colombia       and Serbia.
The Atlantic Philanthropies, state on their website that: `The         [Media Initiative] programme has also generated considerable interest         from post conflict societies and Early Years will roll out the programme         in Serbia, to complement its work in Albania and the Ukraine.
In         addition, Early Years has received $15 million in funding to collaborate         with a partner in Turkey to roll out the media programme there, among         other work.'
The collaborative approach to research and practice modeled through the       evaluations of Media Initiative for Children led to the funding of an       international initiative: Una: A Global Learning Initiative on Children       and Ethnic Diversity.
Led by Connolly and Gallagher (both QUB), the       initiative represents a network of over 80 practitioners from 33 different       countries and facilitates knowledge exchange between professional workers       with children and academics.
Professionals share good practice and promote       the development of new early childhood programmes that promote respect for       diversity in areas divided along ethnic and racial lines.
Three `Una       Associate Projects' have been initiated in Colombia, Kenya and Indonesia.
This shows impact within a framework of knowledge exchange and the ability       of university researchers and education professionals to work effectively       in this area.
