     Addressing the lack of CBT for chronic insomnia     Long-term medication is not recommended for chronic insomnia due to the       risk of dependence and eventual tolerance, thus the optimal treatment of       choice for sleep disorder patients is CBT.
This practice is recommended       within clinical guidelines such those of the National Institute for Health       and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network       (SIGN), but access to treatment has typically been limited by the low       numbers of expert CBT practitioners, resulting in long waiting times.
The University of Glasgow Sleep Centre has led the field of CBT for       chronic insomnia and in improving access to such therapies through       multimedia formats.
This work has led to the following impacts:            the creation of a five-week online CBT for insomnia programme (later         named `Sleepio', and made available through its website since 2010)         providing substantial improvements to patient outcomes and quality of         life       the adoption and distribution of the Sleepio programme by health and         well-being providers, including Boots and the NHS (as part of the         best-selling `Overcoming' series, the `books on prescription' scheme and         in the Health Choices Apps library       raised public awareness of insomnia through public surveys and media         campaigns such as the year-long `Sleep Matters' campaign by the Mental         Health Foundation (MHF) in 2011          These impacts are discussed in more detail below.
Establishment of Sleepio     Sleepio is an online CBT course       designed to treat chronic insomnia and sleep disorders.
The course was       conceptualised by Peter Hames (an independent entrepreneur) who was aware       of the inadequacies of CBT provision in primary healthcare and approached       Espie after benefiting himself from the techniques developed by Espie and       the Glasgow Sleep Centre.a Espie designed clinical controlled       trials and refined the programme, which was branded and launched in 2010       as a for- profit course designed to lead the user through a series of       personalised CBT sessions and provide them with access to an online       support community.
Users fill out a questionnaire detailing their       particular sleep problems and patterns, receive weekly automated sessions       with the online `Prof' that are tailored to the information they provide       throughout the course; their progress is tracked and suggestions and other       resources (e.g.
relaxation audios) are provided to help them gain full       benefit from the treatment.
Glasgow's 2012 study3 revealed that       more than 70% of insomniacs using Sleepio have found lasting benefits from       the course, experiencing an average 50% reduction in time taken to fall       asleep and a 60% reduction in sleeplessness during the night.
Sleepio       users also rated their quality of sleep as having more than doubled and       reported an average increase in energy and daytime wellbeing levels of       58%.
Examples of the changes in quality of life experienced by users are       as follows:b     `I am a practicing GP, and have personally experienced sleep         difficulties for many years.
GP training is woefully inadequate when it         comes to managing insomnia, and I was poorly equipped to help myself.
As         a result of discovering Sleepio and completing the course, I'm not only         a much better sleeper but have a much greater ability to assess my         patients' sleep difficulties.
I am much better placed to give         constructive advice'.
&#8212; Sleepio User Review     `Before Sleepio I felt so down and just couldn't see an end to my         sleep problems...
I'm now actually living my life again.
I have even         managed to go back to work full-time'.&#8212; Sleepio User Review     Adoption by health and well-being service providers     In 2011, researchers from the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre       collaborated with the MHF to run a year-long campaign (`Sleep Matters') to       raise awareness of and help to address sleep disorders across the UK.
The       MHF produced a 16-page pocket guide entitled `Sleep Well'.d The       MHF guide was produced with the assistance of Professor Espie, and the       information and advice it provides states clearly that it is based on the       research carried out at the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre; the guide       also refers users to Espie's 2006 publication, Overcoming Insomnia and         Sleep Problems.d `Sleep Well' explains how mental health       is adversely affected by poor sleep, with a much higher chance of       sufferers developing depression or anxiety, and emphasises how poor sleep       is a significant factor in poor general health.
The guide calls for       increased attention to sleep problems by the Royal College of GPs,       advocating training for all GPs in recognising and treating sleep       problems, as well as the development of NICE guidelines on prescribing CBT       for insomnia.
It also incorporates a number of elements of the commercial       Sleepio course, such as offering a template of its Sleep Diary, and tips       for improving sleep quality.
The MHF materials also include, among other       support recommendations, both the Sleepio course and Espie's `Overcoming       Sleep and Sleep Problems'.
In addition, the `Sleep Matters' campaign incorporated data from the       Great British Sleep Surveye,f, and online, public-access study       launched in 2010 by the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre and Sleepio,       and adopted/promoted by Boots Plc.
in 2013.
One of the MHF campaign       objectives was to raise public awareness of the problems and available       solutions for chronic sleep disorders, and the Foundation's 2011 Annual       Review reported that the campaign had generated 300 media articles with a       combined coverage of 145 million people.c     Sleepio has been sold from its website (www.sleepio.com)       since 2010.
Since September 2012 it has also been available from Boots.com.i       In late March 2013, the NHS launched the first version of its NHS Choices       Health Apps Library offering patients and practitioners access to health       management apps that have been reviewed and approved by a clinical       assurance board.
Sleepio was among the first group of apps offered on this       site, and averages a five-star (highest) rating among users.g       In April 2013, Sleepio was selected as one of only 10 apps for integration       with the UP&#8482; by Jawbone.j The UP&#8482; is one of three top-selling       wrist-worn fitness monitors (similar to the Fitbit&#8482; and Nike FuelBand&#8482;) in       what is expected to be a &#163;400 million market by 2016 (global business       analysts IHS estimate that the number of wearable fitness sensors sold       will rise from 43.8 million units in 2013 to 56.2 million in 2017).
These       are particularly popular in the US and Canada, which extends the reach of       Sleepio's CBT therapy beyond the UK to a worldwide market.
The following       month (May 2013) Sleepio was also integrated into the BodyMedia FIT&#8482;       armband health monitor.k     Additional impact     Overcoming Insomnia and Sleep Problems : A Self-Help Guide Using         Cognitive Behavioral Techniques, written by Espie based on the Sleep       Centre work and published in 2006 (ISBN: 978-1-84529-070-2), continues to       be a bestseller on Amazon.co.uk.
As of July 2013 it ranked #1 bestseller       in the category `Specific Disorders and Categories', #3 in `Sleep       Disorders' and #4,021 of all books sold on Amazon (approx.
1.7 million       total).
In the book's preface, Espie acknowledges the contribution of the       University of Glasgow Sleep Centre research team and describes the book as       `pretty much a complete CBT treatment guide for insomnia; the way I would       present it to you if you came to my clinic in Glasgow'.
The average user       rating is 4.4 out of 5 stars, with users' reviews testifying that reading       the book helped them to overcome their insomnia.
An introductory version       of the book has also been published as part of the `Overcoming' series'       recommended by the UK Department of Health and offered as part of the NHS       `Books on Prescription' programme.h
