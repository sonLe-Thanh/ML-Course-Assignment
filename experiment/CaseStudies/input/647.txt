     The contribution of Davies's work outside academia is most obvious in       three areas: in improving       the public understanding of Welsh history, enhancing the presentation of       Welsh heritage, and the       revision of undergraduate education in history.
The public understanding of Welsh history       Davies's concern to interest a wide public in history, particularly in       Wales, is a theme of several of       the obituaries: he was `unquestionably the finest and most influential       historian of medieval Britain       of his generation [...] he put the history of the Welsh nation into a       wider British and Irish context in       books that were both scholarly and inspiringly thought-provoking.
One of       the most significant       developments in recent decades in the writing and teaching of history in       British universities has       been the move away from an Anglocentric version of "our island story" &#8212; in       effect, the discovery that       the Irish, Welsh and Scots had cultures and histories of their own which       interlocked with, but were       also far more than simply responses to, English influence and invasion.'
(Daily Telegraph, 25 May       2005) [i-iii ]; Brynley Roberts remarks on his ability to connect with `y       darllenydd cyffredin' (the       common reader) and notes the immense success of the Glyn D&#373;r books in       reaching that audience       [iii].
In Huw Edwards' recent BBC TV series on The Story of Wales       (2011), Davies's research       underpinned the second episode, `Power Struggles', and especially the       segment on Glyn D&#373;r [iv].
At lectures across Wales in the year after the publication of the Glyn D&#373;r       book, at eisteddfodau,       and at sessions of the Hon.
Soc.
of Cymmrodorion, a club for Welsh       speakers in London, Davies       drew on his research to explain to public audiences how it had been       possible for a Welsh identity       to survive the Edwardian conquest, and what that might imply for the       re-creation of Welshness in a       new era of multiculturalism and Assembly government.
The impact of       Davies's ideas is recorded in       Roberts's obituary [iii] and also in the work of leading analysts of       modern Welsh politics.
Richard       Wyn Jones's concept of a `colonial legacy' shaping today's Wales, for       instance, rests on Davies's       `definitive account' of Glyn D&#373;r's revolt, and on the `brilliant short       study of political power in the       medieval British Isles' in Davies's The First English Empire more       generally [v].
Some senior civil       servants in Wales, including the leading constitutional adviser to the       First Minister, are familiar with       Davies's notions of the `English Empire' and his work on Glyn D&#373;r and       Welsh History more       generally: `R. R. Davies's books, The Age of Conquest: Wales,         1063-1415 and The Revolt of         Owain Glyn D&#373;r, are now standard works on the period and have been       widely read in Wales,       shaping the way in which popular contemporary Welsh senses of history post       devolution are       constructed [...].
Davies has in addition an influence among senior       political circles in Wales by       informing contemporary analysis of devolution from the Welsh perspective'       [1].
The presentation of Welsh heritage       As chairman of the now-defunct Ancient Monuments Board for Wales       (1995-2005) and an adviser       to Cadw, its successor, Davies `was instrumental in establishing annual       themes [...] drawing on the       unrivalled knowledge of the historic environment which underpinned his       scholarly writings' [2].
Since his death, Davies's work has led Cadw to seek advice on presenting       eight of its north- and       mid-Wales sites as locations associated with the revolt of Owain Glyn D&#373;r.       A 2010 report from       Si&#226;n Shakespear Associates, which quotes Davies in ten places, recommends       this policy as a way       to `maximise the economic value of heritage' and improve public       understanding of Glyn D&#373;r and       Welsh history [vi].
The report has been adopted as one of Cadw's       `interpretation plans'.
Undergraduate education       Noting the near-universal replacement of `English history' with `British       History' and the new       readiness of historians of Wales, Ireland, and Scotland to locate their       analyses in an       British/archipelagic context, the author of the Daily Telegraph's       obituary remarks that `This       breaking down of barriers owes more to Rees Davies than to anyone else'       [i].
A high proportion of       UK and Irish university history departments offer one or more courses on       British history in the       Davies period of c.1050-1400, and some make their debt to his ideas very       clear &#8212; for example by       citing the concept of an `English Empire', as at Bristol or St Andrews       [vii-viii].
Dr Steve Boardman at       Edinburgh University remarks of Davies's course on `Kings and Kindreds:       Scotland, Wales and       Ireland in the Later Middle Ages': `large parts of the Kings and Kindreds       course engage with       Rees's work, particularly the First English Empire volume, even if       occasionally to disagree with       some of the ideas!'
