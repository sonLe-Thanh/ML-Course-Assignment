     Guidelines and adoption      The research on non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) contributed to a       report from the PHG Foundation in 2009, giving a service-based overview of       the implications for the NHS of implementing this technology [a].
We also produced a opinion paper on NIPD using cell free fetal DNA in       maternal blood for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists       (RCOG) in 2009 which was supported by their scientific advisory committee       [b].
We then led the Gene Dossier submission to the UKGTN which was       approved formally in April 2011 [c].
Furthermore from 2012 the       approval of Gene Dossiers for Achondroplasia and Thanatophoric dysplasia       was gained [d, e].
Chitty has also co-led the FP7 work package of       Eurogentest 2, which has developed and published guidelines for service       delivery in Europe [f].
The technology has attracted further       interest from policy makers, including a report on genomic technology in       healthcare by the Human Genomics Strategy Group for the Department of       Health [g].
&#160;Service provision and patient benefit      NIPD for fetal sex determination is now the recognised standard of       practice in UK genetic services allowing equity of access for all women in       the UK at high risk of sex-linked disorders.
The service at Great Ormond       Street Hospital (GOSH) performs &gt;100 tests per annum (Table 1) and,       using samples in the RAPID sample bank, has helped other laboratories       establish this as a standard of care, with Manchester offering this test       from 2010, Birmingham from 2011 and Cambridge, Edinburgh and Salisbury       from 2013.
Fetal sex determination using NIPD is now the most common       prenatal molecular test performed in the UK [h] and has reduced       the invasive testing rate by nearly50% for women at high risk of       sex-linked disorders.
We have established a large unique/comprehensive bank of samples that is       a resource for academic and commercial collaborators, which has already       helped establish NIPD for sex determination in four other UK laboratories,       and is being used to develop NIPD for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,       Tuberous Sclerosis and Huntingdon Disease in Birmingham, Cambridge and       Edinburgh regional genetics centres, as well as developing non-invasive       prenatal testing for aneuploidy and other chromosomal rearrangements.
We       are the only public service laboratory offering a clinical service for       NIPD for single gene disorders - not just in UK, but beyond, and we       receive referrals from Europe, Canada and North America (Table 1).

Details of clinical NIPD tests performed by our Regional         Genetics Laboratory (figures given by financial year).
Note the steady         increase in numbers of tests done over time, with the trend to decreased         invasive testing following gene dossier approval in 2012 [i].
These tests can be offered earlier in pregnancy further relieving       parental anxiety.
The benefits are summed up by the supporting statement       one patient gave us when we submitted our application for an NIHR       programme grant to further develop this work and has been further       supported in our work with patients who have undergone NIPD [reference 4       in section 3 above]:       "It is only three weeks since the termination, though the experience         is stil raw I wanted to share with you that the pain is very much mixed         with a great sense of gratitude for the opportunity of having early         non-invasive testing.
Having experienced both procedures, I am         enormously appreciative of developments in cffDNA diagnosis.
Even with         its unfortunate outcome, my second testing experience was a         significantly less distressing process than the CVS with extended         waiting period and associated risks.
I would sincerely love to see the         service and support I experienced expanded as far as possible, so that         others can benefit as I did" [j].
Patient and Practitioner Engagement     &#160;Our third impact is the engagement with practitioners and       patients, particularly through our website www.rapid.nhs.uk         which provides an information resource required to implement this       safer approach to prenatal testing whilst maintaining the informed patient       consent.
In partnership with the National Genetics Education and       Development Centre, Birmingham (RAPID co-applicants) and lay organisations       such as Genetic Al iance UK, Sickle Cell Association and Antenatal Results       and Choices (ARC) using information acquired from patient interviews and       surveys, we have developed health information packages, including       e-learning modules [k].
We have also contributed to       practitioner-facing journals [l].
