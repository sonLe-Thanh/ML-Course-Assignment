     Although Campbell and Rudan's work with CHERG showed that pneumonia was       the largest single       cause of global child mortality in 2008 [3.1], it was receiving       considerably less global investment       and attention than other conditions such HIV and malaria.
Clearly,       effective action on global child       pneumonia mortality was an essential part of reaching the United Nations       Millennium Development       Goal 4 set in 2005 by 170 Heads of State to reduce global child mortality       by two thirds from 1990-2015.
This has been triggered as a direct consequence of Campbell and Rudan's       work     The CHERG committee, including Campbell and Rudan as pneumonia technical       advisers [5.1] met       every 6 months from 2000-2013. WHO and UNICEF attended all meetings; other       international       agencies (e.g., Save the Children Fund, Global Alliance on Vaccines and       Immunisations (GAVI),       US Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill and Melinda Gates       Foundation) attended       when appropriate.
Impact on public policy     Campbell and Rudan have regularly acted as advisers / working group       chairs on child pneumonia       to WHO (30 occasions since 1993) [5.2], the UK government (All-Party       Parliamentary Group for       Global Action Against Childhood Pneumonia), UNICEF [5.3] and other       international agencies.
CHERG's pneumonia disease estimates were adopted not only by WHO and       UNICEF [5.2-5.5] but       also by major international agencies (including GAVI, Save the Children       Fund and the Bill and       Melinda Gates Foundation).
Lancet editor Richard Horton (#richardhorton1)       tweeted on 24/5/2013       "CHERG has made stellar contributions to our understanding of child       health."
This recognition has       led directly to increased emphasis and priority given by international       agencies and national health       systems to tackling this problem.
Examples include:            Impact on WHO and UNICEF policy, leading to the establishment in 2009         of a Global Action         Plan on Pneumonia (GAPP).
Campbell and Rudan led the pneumonia overview,         published in a         Bulletin WHO supplement, which assisted in preparation of the GAPP         document [5.6].
This         ongoing action plan gives renewed emphasis to pneumonia control.
It has         led to increased         coverage of effective pneumonia interventions, for example through the         initiation of community         case-management programmes (by community health workers) and the         investment in new         pneumonia vaccines (see point 2 and [5.7]).
Impact on GAVI to give priority to the accelerated global         implementation of pneumonia vaccines         (Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines).
There was a steep         acceleration in uptake of Hib         conjugate vaccine by low- and middle-income countries from 2007/8 with         50 countries introducing         Hib conjugate vaccine into their national vaccination schedules over the         period 2008-13.
Similarly,         the uptake of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, from its introduction in         2004, accelerated from         2007/8, with more than 50 countries introducing this vaccine from 2008         onwards.
Impact on the &gt;190 member states of the World Health Assembly (WHA)         (2010).
Campbell         initiated a UK action to lead a WHA pneumonia resolution (WHA63.24 -         Accelerated progress         towards achievement of MDG4 to reduce child mortality: prevention and         treatment of pneumonia).
Campbell met Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Sir Liam Donaldson to propose         and help draft the         resolution, and was technical consultant to the UK delegation in Geneva         in 2010.
Ministers of         Health, CMOs and other senior health officials from the 170 Member         States constituting the WHA         endorsed the resolution on the Control of Pneumonia, committing them to         adoption of pneumonia         control policies and actions and to giving increased priority to this         problem [5.8].
Impact on health and welfare     One of the major success stories in international health has been the       substantial progress made       since 2000 in the reduction of global child mortality.
This has fallen       from 11 million deaths per year       in 2000 to 6.9 million per year in 2012.
The largest single cause of death       over this period, and the       disease showing the largest relative and absolute rate of mortality       reduction over the period of       REF2014, is child pneumonia [3.1].
There have been approximately 1M fewer       child pneumonia       deaths over the period 2008-12 than if 2008 mortality levels has       persisted.
These falls in mortality       have occurred in &gt;170 countries, with the main impact in low- and       middle-income countries.
These       estimates have been endorsed in WHO and UNICEF documents [5.4 a &amp; b,       5.5].
WHO and       UNICEF consider that the direct action to prevent and treat child       pneumonia that has been taken       by national governments and international agencies, driven by the clear       need and imperative       demonstrated by the work of Campbell, Rudan and CHERG, is the major cause       of the mortality       reduction.
Impact on society     Campbell spoke at the global launch (in New York) of the World Pneumonia       Day movement in       2007, which has since grown worldwide [5.9].
In 2011, it included       activities in 25 countries       worldwide to support pneumonia control efforts.
This led to the creation       of a Global Coalition       Against Child Pneumonia in 2009 comprising over 140 non-governmental       organisations, civil       society organisations, academic institutions (including UoE) and       government agencies [5.9].
