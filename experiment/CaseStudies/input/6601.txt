     Since 2009, GCU's research within the A-FOOTPRINT project has       demonstrated innovative       collaboration with SMEs and large industry.
Its research and knowledge       transfer outcomes have       made their primary impact on commercial partners, specifically the       adoption of 3D printing as a       new manufacturing technology for custom foot orthoses by Peacocks Medical       Group (PMG), a       SME project partner based in the North of England (between 2012-present).
GCU supplied PMG       with evidence, through a number of clinical trials, that 3D printed       orthoses are safe and effective       and provide an enhanced patient experience.
This process of product       verification within the       additive manufacturing value chain was critical to technology       implementation and       commercialisation [Source (S) 1].
Consequently, PMG is the first       European-based orthotic SME to       adopt additive manufacturing technology for custom orthotics production       [S2] (between 2010-present).
New foot orthotic products developed and verified in clinical       trials are in phased       production, and commercialisation began in September 2013 (www.podfo.com).
GCU is supporting       commercialisation activities through a dedicated training programme on       additive manufacturing for       prescribing clinicians (www.podfo.com/education)       [S2].
PMG Research and Development Manager states:     "Through the A-FOOTPRINT project, the research collaboration with GCU         has given us confidence         that we can develop radically innovative orthotic products which are         safe and effective.
GCU's         clinical trial research in particular has provided invaluable data on         our new 3D printed orthotics         mode of action as well as showing improved outcomes and enhanced patient         experience.
As a         company we will be differentiate ourselves from the competition by         adopting additive         manufacturing with a strong scientific knowledge, engineering and         evidence-base for its products         and services."
[S3]     GCU's research has also created commercial benefits for A-FOOTPRINT       partner SME companies       in the area of enabling technologies that support the design and       functional optimisation of 3D       printed orthoses.
One specific example is the Glasgow-Maastricht Foot         Model by SME AnyBody       Technology (Aalborg, Denmark) [S4,5].
The software, for mainstream desktop       application, has       been commercialised (March 2013) as an advanced biomechanical model within       the AnyBody       Modelling Repository.
The company has targeted global markets in       large-industry orthopaedic       devices, SME-based Orthotics, and industry-based assisted-living       rehabilitation research and       development.
This product enables companies to improve product design       optimisation through       musculoskeletal simulations that complement experimental and clinical test       protocols [S6].
AnyBody Technology CEO states:     "The cooperation with GCU has helped AnyBody Technology with both the         data necessary and         insight needed to build the most complex and comprehensive foot model         currently available in any         computer simulation software.
This has given us specific consultancy         opportunities with orthopedic         companies across the world and opens up for new opportunities at         specific potential customers         segments in e.g.
the sports industry which would not have been otherwise         possible."
GCU-led dissemination and demonstration activities in the A-FOOTPRINT       project have raised       global awareness of the capabilities of additive manufacturing for the       orthotic sector.
Targeting       multiple stakeholders in the scientific, technical and industry sectors       through multimedia,       conference, scientific paper publication and targeted demonstration events       has enabled the project       to reach approximately 25,000 key stakeholders across Europe, e.g., `ORTHOPAEDIE         + REHA-TECHNIK 2012` 		exhibition in Leipzig Germany.
Globally, a further       8,400 stakeholders from 104       countries have engaged with a dedicated project website (www.afootprint.eu),       media and press       releases (1,048 project newsletter downloads), and secondary dissemination       across the additive       manufacturing technology sector [S1,7].
Prototype orthotic products       emerging from this research       collaboration feature in an exhibition of 3D printing (3D:Printing the         Future) at the London Science       Museum attended by approximately 78,000 visitors since the event opened       09/10/2013 (Science       Museum audience research team).

Dissemination activities led by GCU have significantly changed attitudes, knowledge, and       acceptance towards 3D printing in the International orthotic sector.
A       targeted and sector-wide       survey (clinical, industrial, and SME) revealed that the A-FOOTPRINT       project had led to positive       changes in attitudes towards 3D printing in 62.9% of responders,       improved knowledge in 66.7%       and that 32.3% believed it would fundamentally change the sector       within the next three years.
88.9% of responders indicated that A-FOOTPRINT had given       them the belief that they would be       investing in or using 3D printing within the next three years [S8].
As A-FOOTPRINT Coordinator, Woodburn has successfully contributed       to EC policy successes       and future visions in Horizon2020.
He has achieved this by:            Contributing as a `success demonstrator' at key EC events including `Industrial        Technologies 2012' [S9],       Successful participation in EC-level technology forums including the Footwear           European           Technology Platform and prosumer.net [S10],       Successful collaboration in a global Intelligent Manufacturing           Systems `MiGOODs' project         [S10].
These initiatives have enabled the project and its results to reach key       stakeholders in the EC       industrial technologies sector and important end-users, validating the       benefits of the project at the       European level and leading to the award of `Flagship Project' status.
