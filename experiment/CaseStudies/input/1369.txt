     Through public lectures, consultancy and collaborations with York Art       Gallery and Yorkshire Museum Gardens, Hardie's research has led to       enhanced public understanding of Chinese attitudes to gardens and the       complex religious and philosophical symbolism that is fundamental to their       gardening practice.
The research has had a substantial impact on gallery       and museum professionals and members of the public, highlighting regional       variations, the importance of the garden in Chinese history and culture,       and the ways in which Chinese gardens offer illuminating insights into       Chinese culture and cultural difference.
The research has been highly significant for the public and professional       understanding of China and its history of garden culture through public       engagement activities and specific collaborations:     i.
Popular publications and public lectures     Hardie's research has reached national and international audiences       through public lectures and publications:            Her keynote speech `Chinese Gardens &#8212; New Views and New Directions' at         the `Infinite Worlds' conference celebrating the 10th         anniversary of Lan Su Yuan Chinese Garden in Portland, Oregon, April         2010, was attended by landscape professionals and members of the local         Chinese community who are donors to or volunteers in the garden, as well         as by academics; her presentation on the making of Chinese gardens, as a         Senior Fellow in Garden and Landscape Studies at Dumbarton Oaks in         Washington D.C. (affiliated to Harvard) at the annual Garden and         Landscape Studies symposium in May 2011, was attended by professional         garden and landscape designers, artists and members of the public       The new edition (January 2012) of her translation of Ji Cheng's 17th         century treatise The Craft of Gardens (Yuanye) (1,034         copies sold to date from a print run of 1,500), the success of which led         the publishers to commission Hardie to produce a small illustrated         volume, Chinese Garden Pleasures: An Appreciation (Shanghai:         Better Link Press), with a print-run of 3,200; this consists of an         introductory essay and translations (mostly by Hardie herself) of prose         and poetry on traditional garden activities.
It is aimed primarily at         the international tourist market in China.
[A]          Through this public engagement, Hardie has exposed Western       non-specialists to the Chinese garden tradition, and enabled them to place       it within the context of the development of garden culture as a whole.
By       understanding the nature of Chinese gardens, they develop an awareness of       the commonalities of the Eastern and Western garden traditions, thus       fostering a deeper cross-cultural understanding.
This activity has also       led to significant collaborations.

Consultancy and collaborations leading to enhanced public         understanding     In 2010, Hardie was invited by the York Museums Trust (YMT) to deliver a       public talk and act as consultant for the creation of a `Chinese Garden       Trail', in order to extend and complement the British Museum touring       exhibition `China &#8212; Journey to the East' at York Art Gallery.
The talk was       well attended and reported in the York Gallery Newsletter: `a       fascinating illustrated summer evening lecture to a sizeable audience' [B],       and the planning of the Chinese Garden was incorporated into the Museum         Gardens Plan: A Garden for York 2010-2015.
[C]     The Chinese Garden Trail consisted of a series of placards to be       displayed in the Museum Gardens, adjacent to the Gallery, highlighting       Chinese plants: `The gardens are used by many thousands of people every       day.
(...) We wanted interesting delightful facts and insights that       illuminated the overall role that gardens play in Chinese society.'
[D]       Hardie advised on the choice of plants and wrote the text for all the       information placards and trail leaflet.
The placards, on display from June to October 2010 and giving the English       and Chinese names of the plants and information on their significance in       Chinese culture, were seen by over 800,000 visitors to the Gardens [E],       who either in part or in its entirety followed the Chinese garden plants       trail guided by the leaflet (F: print run: 10,000+ and distributed       to tourist information centres, hotels, guest houses and city       attractions,[D]) giving the visitors to the Garden some       understanding of the cultural significance of Chinese garden plants, and       making them aware of the importance of plants from China in British       horticulture.
The success of the Chinese Garden Trail led to further changes: `The       China Garden trail was so successful that we thought it would be good to       have a permanent one' [G].
Hardie was consulted on how to design       the garden in such a way that would attract visitors of all ages and       encourage activity and interaction, especially with young people, [to] get       them involved and doing something in the garden.
York Museums Trust       decided to install a permanent Chinese-inspired garden area, with       permanent placards, and also to include an activity for families.` [C]       At Hardie's suggestion this included a `meander' or qushui, a       watercourse found in traditional Chinese gardens (a feature that evolved       from a 4th century Chinese pastime involving the floating of       wine-cups down the stream whilst participants composed poetry) [E].
Her recommendation of specific plants was also incorporated into YMT's       plans for this Chinese-inspired garden, leading to the expansion of this       area of the garden and informed changes to its content [H].

Consultancy and collaborations leading to changes in professional         practice     Thanks to Hardie's work, YMT had for the first time experimented with       high quality, focused interpretation in the Gardens.
[J]     `Dr Hardie's knowledge shared with the Head Gardener and garden guides       has added to their own professional knowledge and helped them give       visitors more information on the plants in the gardens by drawing       attention to the impact of Chinese garden design on UK gardening and the       significance of certain trees and shrubs in Chinese gardening.
Dr Hardie's       advice also changed YMT's original plans for an Oriental Border by       highlighting plants that must be included.
As a result this area of the       garden became larger than originally planned and significantly changed in       content.'
[J]     `It is fair to say that much of the success of these projects has been       down to the knowledge of and help from the university.
Without expert       knowledge, the trail would never have happened, the garden interpretation       has hugely benefitted and the idea for the meander would never have       crossed our minds.'
[D]     The impact has therefore been to increase public use and enjoyment of the       Yorkshire Museum Gardens, thus contributing to quality of life and health,       while providing cultural benefits though public awareness and       understanding of Chinese garden history and culture.
In shedding light on       the importance of Chinese garden plants to the British horticultural       tradition, this work has also informed professional practice for gardeners       and curators alike.
