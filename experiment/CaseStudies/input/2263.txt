     The reach and significance of Wynn's research is evident through its       local, national and international dissemination, in books, dictionaries,       articles, radio broadcasts, film and presentations to different audiences       ranging from school teachers and pupils, local historians, librarians,       film and radio producers, interested members of local communities and the       general public.
His work has encouraged a greater understanding of Black       History in the US and Britain, has enhanced educational resources, and has       aided the development of racial awareness and understanding.
The African American Experience during World War II (2010) has       sold over 2,240 copies in hardback, paperback, and e-book editions       to-date.
Following its publication, Wynn was invited to speak as one of 12       contributors at the annual Roosevelt Reading Festival, Roosevelt Library       and Centre, Hyde Park, NY, 18 June 2011.
An aspect of Wynn's work, on Black GIs and their impact in Britain, led       to the nomination for the Bryan Jerrard Award for the best article       published on local history in Gloucestershire for `"Race War": Black       American GIs in Bristol and Gloucestershire During World War II', in The         Regional Historian, no.
14, Autumn/Winter, 2005-6, re-printed in the       Bristol Radical Pamphleteer series, no.
7 (Bristol Radical History       Group) in 2008.
Over 400 copies of this have been distributed locally and       also in the USA.
The significance of this research was evidenced by Wynn's       participation as advisor and contributor on both American and British       aspects in the making of a documentary film, Choc'late Soldiers from         the USA, produced by Gregory Cooke and Noel Izon.
Cooke states: Wynn       made a `significant contribution to my documentary...' and `his       participation in the documentary...[helped] toward moving African American       participation in World War II from the margins of history to its main       pages'.
The film was shown at the Society of Historians of American       Foreign Relations in Virginia in 2009, at the 60th Anniversary       Celebrations of Truman's Desegregation of the Armed Forces at Morgan State       University in 2008, and to over 300 politicians, educators and war       veterans in an official premiere at the Smithsonian Hirshhorn Gallery,       Washington, DC, on 10 November 2009, the GI film Festival, Washington, DC,       6-12 May 2013, and in various locations in Britain to schools and members       of the public, including the Bamber Bridge Commemoration event at UCLAN,       Preston, 21-23 June 2013, where Wynn gave a keynote lecture to an audience       including members of the Preston Black History Group and representatives       of the Department of Justice.
Wynn contributed to BBC Radio 4's two-part series `GI Britain' broadcast       3 November 2012.
The series was `warmly received' by the estimated       audience of 1.5 million and nominated by Radio 4 for a Sony award.
This       led to two contributions to Paul Moss in conversation on BBC Radio       Gloucestershire, 2 and 9 December 2012, and participation in Tiger         Brides, a film made by Dr. Valerie Jackson, Fulbright scholar at       Cardiff University, on GI war brides, shown to a sizeable audience from       the mainly black local community on 20 July 2013.
Dr Jackson commented:       `Wynn's book The African American Experience During World War II       provided critical understanding, a barrage of credible research, and deep       insight into the US military culture that defined the segregationists       practices of the Black GIs who served in the United Kingdom during the mid       to late 1940s' and `the impact of Dr. Wynn's support cannot be       understated'.
This expertise was further applied when Wynn provided the       programme notes on African American airmen and WWII for Much Ado About         Nothing at the Old Vic, London, September-November 2013.
He has also       been consulted about two proposed TV programmes, and periodically receives       communications about the black American presence in the UK during WWII       from individuals with a personal interest, local historians and film/radio       researchers.
Wynn presented findings on the cultural impact of his research to       audiences of students, academics and educators from the UK, USA and Europe       at: the Maastricht (later Middleburg) Centre for Transatlantic Studies at       bi-annual academic conferences, two of which (2002, 2009) Wynn       co-organised; the conference he organised on European Perspectives on       African American Music, University of Gloucestershire, 23-26 July 2004,       (the resulting publication `Cross the Water Blues': African American         Music in Europe was awarded a Certificate of Merit in 2008 by the       Association for Recorded Sound Collections Award for Excellence in         Historical Recorded Sound Research); and a similar conference       organized with Dr. Jill Terry at Worcester University in September 2009       led to Transatlantic Roots Music: Folk, Blues and National Identities.
These activities added to the growing awareness of historical/cultural       continuities and racial interchange in local, national and transatlantic       contexts.
The broad scope of Wynn's public engagement is evidenced by the diversity       of invited public and other lectures given since 1998 on his own research       and related subjects, including: several talks on the black American       presence in Britain and the Civil Rights Movement at Cirencester FE       College (audiences 30 to 40+) in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 (where, according       to the History lecturer, the lectures were `hugely beneficial in       contextualising race relations, and related controversies, for students       and adding extra depth to their subject knowledge which they can then       directly apply in examinations'); to branches of the Historical       Association (Cheltenham and Gloucester 2008/2010 to 24+, and Coventry and       Warwick 2011 to 24+); Tewkesbury Historical Society 2008 (40+) (`a       splendid talk appreciated by non-professional historians as well'); the       inaugural lecture of the Middleburg Centre for Transatlantic Studies,       Roosevelt Academy, 2008 (40+), Cheltenham College 2009/2009 (50+), Newent       Community School (2010), Cheltenham Ladies' College 2011/2012 (30+), the       American Museum in Bath (2013), and over 12 radio broadcasts or       discussions since 2008.
