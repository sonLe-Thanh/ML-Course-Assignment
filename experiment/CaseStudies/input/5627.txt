     What follows chronicles the recent impacts of three distinct themes in       Nickel's research, spanning       1) the bronze casting methods of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties (1600-1046       BC and 1046-256       BC), 2) recently-excavated 6th-century AD Buddha and       bodhisattva figures, and 3) the possible       influence of Hellenistic figurative representation on the Terracotta         Warriors.
1) "Imperfect Symmetry" (output a) has elicited much discussion in China       and beyond, initiating       renewed scrutiny of the techniques used to adorn ancient bronze vessels       with often complex relief       decoration.
The Museum of Ezhou, in Hubei, commissioned a series of       experiments to test Nickel's       theories concerning casting techniques.
Although the results of the       experiments did not fully       support Nickel's theory relating to "tube lining," they supported his       suggestion that ornaments were       made on inner faces of moulds.
His theories were intriguing enough to       motivate the Museum's       experimentation and subsequent publication of its findings (1, below).
The       Vice-Director of the       Ezhou Museum, and himself an expert caster, Dong Yawei, said (2):     "We think the theory of Lukas is very unique and interesting.
His         method is a Western         interpretation of Chinese bronze.
His method is quite different from our         traditional theory, but         diverse academic opinions are good for our studies, therefore we need to         do experiments to find         the truth... As the experiment demonstrated, Lukas's method does not         work, but this outcome does         not mean his opinion is wrong.
The technology that enabled ornament         needs to be further explored         in the future, his argument may be right."
*     The Museum published a report with photographs on the initial experiment       in Nanfang Wenwu in       2008 (3).
In November 2011 Dong invited Lukas Nickel to participate in       further experiments in       Ezhou that resulted in the casting of four vessels using Nickel's method.
Both agreed that       ornaments can be applied to the outer moulds.
2) In 1996, workers clearing ground 400 miles south of Beijing discovered       a large burial pit       containing hundreds of fragments of 6th century Buddhist       figures.
Eventually, more than 200 torsos,       144 heads of the Buddha and 50 heads of bodhisattva figures, many       retaining traces of coloured       pigments and gilding, were unearthed, representing one of China's most       significant recent       archaeological finds (7).
Nickel's pioneering catalogue of many of the pieces (output c of 2001)       has since become the       seminal source on which all later exhibitions of the same material (Sydney       2008; Singapore, 2008;       Paris, 2009) have strongly relied (4).
Gilles B&#233;guin, Director of the       Mus&#233;e Cernuschi in Paris wrote       in the preface to that exhibition's 2009 catalogue (5):     "ll convient ici de rendre hommage &#224; l`&#233;tude remarquable du professeur         Lukas Nickel et de ses         assistants, &#224; l`occasion de la premi&#232;re venue en Europe de sculptures du         Longxingsi en 2001-         2002.
Sans leur travail fondamental, le pr&#233;sent catalogue n'aurait pu         voir le jour."
(It is appropriate       here to pay homage to the remarkable scholarship of Professor Lukas Nickel       and his assistants, on       the occasion of the first showing in Europe of the Longxingsi sculptures       in 2001-02 [Return of the         Buddha].
Without their foundational work, the present catalogue       would not have seen the light of       day.)
As a direct result of Nickel's research and excavation of the second       Buddhist temple in Shandong,       archaeologists he has collaborated with (notably Li Zhengguang of the       state-sponsored Shandong       Province Archaeological Institute) have begun a large-scale survey of all       early Buddhist sites in the       province.
3) Nickel's recent research on the transmission of style and individual       motifs eastward along the       Silk Road from the eastern Mediterranean through the Middle East and       Central Asia to China has       attracted much controversy as an explicit questioning of mainstream       interpretations that refute the       possibility of external influence on Chinese art.
Outputs d, e, and f       analyse art historical and       archaeological evidence and argue for a re-evaluation of the dynamics of       stylistic influence in       Chinese history.
The theories advanced in output f in particular were       highlighted in the New York         Times in June 2012 by the well-known critic Soren Melikian (8a), and       in a full-page feature in       Mitteldeutsche Zeitung in July 2012 (8b and d).
This research was also mobilised in the making of a 50-minute documentary       film in the popular       German /French "Terra X" series (9).
Beginning in 2011, Story House Media       Group for Terra X       worked on the documentary investigating discoveries of early links between       China and the West,       mainly focussing on well-known evidence of the Buddhist period.
After       contacting Nickel for an       interview and reading outputs e and f, the producers radically changed the       script and broadened       the scope of the film to include substantial discussion of Nickel's       theories both in relation to the       influence of Persian styles on Chinese silver and Hellenistic influence on       the Terracotta Warriors.
They travelled with Nickel to two sites in China in December 2012,       ultimately adopting Nickel's       contributions as the framing device for the whole the film.
The       documentary aired on both French       and German primetime television in September 2013.
