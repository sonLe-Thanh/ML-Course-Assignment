     The Director of the UK's ISIS Neutron Facility has said: `While the         term `world leading' is over-used         ... the OU-ISIS technique developments have been leading the world.
And         within the resulting         research outcomes there continue to be numerous examples that have         significant technical and         financial impact on industry' [5.1].
The ability for industry to undertake reliable, accurate and speedy       non-destructive residual stress       measurements has two essential requirements suitable hardware       (instrumentation) and effective       experimental methods.
Open University research has delivered solutions       that satisfy both of these       requirements.
The OU led the consortium to design and build the &#163;3.5m ENGIN-X       instrument [3.1] at ISIS which       was the world's first dedicated engineering neutron diffractometer.
It was       designed to measure       large, intact, industrial components so that companies would have directly       relevant data for the       solution of their problems.
Since 2011, the impact of this instrument on       industry has increased, with       beamtime being awarded directly to UK-based companies through the       ICR&amp;D (Industrial       Collaborative R&amp;D) scheme for projects demonstrating economic benefit.
Companies that have       benefited from this scheme include Rolls-Royce, EDF Energy, TWI, the Train       Consortium (RSSB,       ATOC, Lucchini, Siemens), AREVA, BorgWarner, Tata Steel, and Airbus [5.2].
We continue to advance both hardware and experimental methods for       residual stress       measurement; for example our recent work on new methodologies and       instrumentation for       combining imaging and diffraction techniques [3.4].
The Director of ISIS       has written: `This work has         made major contributions that underpin both the machine design and the         experimental         methodology for the &#163;10M IMAT instrument currently under construction at         ISIS' [5.3].
The impact of the OU's SScanSS optimisation and control methodology in       terms of improving       accuracy, reducing set-up times, enabling otherwise impractical       measurements and offering QA to       safety critical industrial users, such as the nuclear sector, is attested       by its use at (currently) eight       international facilities:     2005: The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL, USA) provides financial       support for further       development     2007: Installed at ORNL     2010: Modified and installed at the ANSTO (Australian Nuclear Science and       Technology       Organisation) OPAL research reactor     2011: Modified and installed at the DIAMOND synchrotron source (UK)     2012: Modified and installed at the Spallation Neutron Source (USA)     2012: Modified and installed at the FRM-II research reactor (Germany)     2012: Modified and installed at Chalk River Laboratories research reactor       (Canada).
2013: Modified and installed at NECSA research reactor (South Africa).
In summary, `It has changed the way that residual stress measurements         using neutron diffraction         are made worldwide.'
[5.1].
For example, the Head of the Bragg Institute, (ANSTO, Australia) writes:       `The SScanSS software         and associated methods are routinely used on our strain scanner         (KOWARI), where they are an         invaluable tool, enabling engineering residual stress measurements on         large and complex shape         samples from academic and industrial users such as, TWI Ltd., Pacific         Rail Engineering Ltd.,         Hardchrome Ltd, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research         Organisation (CSIRO),         the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and the Institute         of Railway         Technology.'
[5.4].
By improving the capacity for measuring residual stress at most of the       world's major facilities our       research has impacted on a large number of industrial development       programs.
For example, the       Group Leader of the Diffraction and Thermophysical Properties Group at Oak       Ridge National       Laboratory describes how major industrial users such as John Deere and       General Motors referred       to SScanSS at a recent User meeting at Oak Ridge: `The use of the data         and the accuracy in         position were critical for John Deere to achieve major improvement and         replace very expensive         `build and test' research programs with validated computer modelling';       and General Motors attest       that `the use of the metrology equipment and SScanSS software were         critical in their study [of         hydrogen storage tubes intended for hydrogen storage in vehicle]'.
[5.5].
Further, referring to a multi-year study of the dissimilar metal welds       joining the pressure vessel and       primary coolant piping in nuclear power plant conducted by the US Electric       Power Research       Institute (EPRI): `without this capability [in accuracy of measurement         location] that your code         provided, the uncertainty in location and hence accuracy in stress would         have been at least         doubled and hence likely of little value.
The neutron residual stress         maps were critical to providing         confidence limits on the best FEA models that enable EPRI and NRC to         then predict the probability         of failure at the critical dissimilar metal weld region.
These advances         will enable the USA nuclear         industry to predict the likelihood of surviving any of multiple possible         events that potentially could         lead to catastrophic failure of an operating nuclear plant' [5.5].
