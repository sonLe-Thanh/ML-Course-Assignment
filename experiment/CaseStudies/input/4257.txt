     Impact on Policy and Educational Practice     A reduction of teenage pregnancies rates is a policy priority of all       western developed nations.
It is increasingly recognised that educating       young men must be part of the solution.
Currently, young men are much less       likely to receive school-based education on teenage pregnancy and parents       are much less likely to speak to their sons than their daughters about       teenage pregnancy.
We worked in partnership with government departments to deliver a       research informed resource within the state-supported RSE curricula of NI       and IRL which also supports parent-child communication.
RSE teachers began       attending state-supported annual training days (since November 2012) on       have been using `If I were Jack' in the classroom during 2013.
This partnership ensures universal access to the resource for all       adolescents attending schools (N= 216) in Northern Ireland at Key Stage 4       of the curriculum, (100% of schools and approximately 2,400 pupils) and in       Ireland (N= 582 schools who have a transition year programme, 81% of       schools and approximately 3,200 pupils) (Corroborators 6 &amp; 9).
Leading civil servants in a variety of government departments and       agencies in NI have identified the importance of the resource in meeting       key government health policy targets (Reference 1 &amp; Corroborators       6-9).
For example:     The DHSSPS considers that this project is supportive of the aims and         objectives of the Sexual Health Promotion Strategy and Action Plan         2008-2013.
The Department is particularly supportive of this research as         it is relevant towards delivery of the objective of providing         opportunities for young people in school and youth settings to develop         the skills they need to appropriately manage their relationships.
Dr Michael McBride, Chief Medical Officer (Northern Ireland), 18/04/2013     An Australian version of the educational resource developed from our       joint research is already being used in 86% of State schools (117 schools       with approximately 6,300 pupils at age 15 years) in South Australia.
This       was achieved in 2012 by working alongside research collaborators at       Flinders Unversity through whom we developed a partnership with SHINE, the       primary provider of RSE education to state schools.
(Reference 4 and       corroborator 10).
Impact on End-Users (Adolescents)     The results of a research study conducted with a stratified random sample       of male adolescent users of the educational resource in Ireland (N= 360)       and South Australia (N= 386) demonstrates that the resource is achieving       key educational and health promotion effects, especially in achieving       greater awareness of unintended pregnancy amongst young men and in       increasing young men's intention to avoid an unintended pregnancy       (References 2 and 3).
79% of the representative sample of male users in Ireland and 70%           of the representative sample of male users in Australia agreed or           strongly agreed with the statement that it `made me think about issues           I hadn't thought about before';       79% of users in Ireland and 69% in Australia agreed or strongly agreed         that the resource `made me realise that I should never get myself in         that situation';       85% of users in Ireland and 72% in Australia agreed or strongly           agreed with the statement that it `helped me understand the effect an           unplanned pregnancy would have on a guy like me';        84% of users in Ireland agreed or strongly agreed with the           statement that `If I were Jack' `made me aware that I could           talk to a counselling service if I were in Jack's situation.'
Impact On End Users (Teachers)     Case-study research of teachers using the resource in the classroom       reported the positive impact of the resource on young people especially in       gaining a deeper understanding of teenage pregnancy (Reference 2).
For       example, teachers said:     "I found the interactive DVD engaged with my students in a way that         they could relate to.
It offered an experience that no book could match.
I found they were better able to walk a mile in Jack's shoes and their         feedback indicated that not only did they feel empathy for his situation         but they could imagine themselves in that same situation and faced with         the same choices.
The resource was appropriate and realistic and it led         to some great discussions in the class."
"Most pupils said the parent survey homework was 'awkward' but they         agreed it was not as difficult to talk to their parents about pregnancy         as they thought."
Further podcasts of the experiences of teachers using the resource are       available on: http://www.qub.ac.uk/IfIWereJack     Secondary Impact     The Department of Education (IRL) and the Council for the Curriculum       Education and Assessment (CCEA) NI are, for the first time, working       together on RSE curricula alongside the research team.
This co-operation       which is being sponsored by the researchers' ESRC grant is leading to       shared learning between specialists and supporting the implementation of       the Belfast Agreement (Corroborators 6-9).
