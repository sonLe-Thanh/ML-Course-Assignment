     The narrative is presented chronologically, in order to demonstrate how       the impact has built over time, expanding to exert international       influence.
Example 1.
Use of research findings by non-governmental           organization and members of the public to lobby government and           other stakeholders       In 2008 Kneafsey (PI), in a joint bid with Dowler (Warwick       University) was awarded &#163;54,778 to design a local foodwebs `Action Pack'       for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).
The contract was       won through competitive process and feedback from the CPRE at the time       indicated that the track record of the applicants in the arena of local       food networks was a decisive factor in the decision to award the contract.
Drawing on funding secured from the Big Lottery Local Food Fund, the CPRE       commissioned the Coventry-led team to develop a toolkit which would enable       community `action groups' to map the social, environmental and economic       impacts of local foodwebs.
Kneafsey's team developed and piloted a       prototype action pack and provided training sessions and supporting       materials to CPRE personnel who would use the pack.
The pack was further       tested in six locations by the CPRE before being rolled out to an       additional 13 areas.
The mapping reports for all of these 19 locations, as       well as a major National Report have been published online (see below).
The National Report was launched at the Houses of Parliament on 12 June       2012, attended by 23 peers and MPs.
The CPRE's Senior Policy Campaigner       stated that "Kneafsey's work significantly informed the         CPRE's National Report" and her and colleagues' contribution is       acknowledged in the all of the 19 location reports, plus the National       Report.
Text provided by Kneafsey et al in a literature review       (defining the concepts of `local food' and `foodwebs') was reproduced in       the National Report [a].
In addition, the tools which Kneafsey et       al designed in the original toolkit [b] have been further developed and       adapted for online access (see below).
The toolkit has been translated       into French and was downloaded over 200 times within the UK and Europe.
The CPRE's Senior Rural Policy Campaigner stated that "they wouldn't         have had the time or expertise to develop these tools alone" and in       addition, Kneafsey's involvement was essential as "it is         important for the presentation of the research that they had the support         of an independent University".
This, in his words, gave "credibility"       to the results from the Action Pack and "strengthened" the       activities of the CPRE as "the stamp of the University made sure we         were asking sensible questions and that the research was rigorous".
He acknowledged that follow-on impacts from the Action Pack had their "genesis         in Kneafsey's initial work" and stated that "Kneafsey         helped bring the importance of foodwebs into the public consciousness".
The Action Pack has continued to have utility for a number of community       groups including "local authorities, community groups and primary         schools."
(For example http://tinyurl.com/nt7awt2).
The CPRE used data generated through use of the Action Pack to support       their successful campaign to stop the construction of a large supermarket       in Ledbury, Herefordshire.
Using the results generated by local volunteers       using the Action Pack, campaigners presented a report to the Herefordshire       Council Planning Committee on 22 February 2012, which demonstrated the       potential damaging effect of a proposed supermarket on local foodwebs.
The       successful case put forward by the CPRE and supported by results obtained       through use of the Action Pack and training materials designed by Kneafsey's       team is referenced in the minutes of Herefordshire Council Planning       Committee [c].
In addition, the recent 2013 UK Labour Policy Review       `Feeding the Nation' [d] references the CPRE's National Report (Kneafsey's       contribution to which has already been detailed).
In summary, this case       demonstrates existing and continuing impact from Kneafsey's work,       primarily through her leadership of design of research tools and training       materials which have facilitated successful lobbying activities of the       CPRE which are, in turn, influencing local and national policy       developments.
Example 2.
Use of research findings by           non-governmental organisation to achieve programme expansion           and hence increased delivery of health and well-being and social benefits.
Research completed and still ongoing for Garden Organic (formerly       the Henry Doubleday Research Association), the UK's leading charity       promoting organic gardening and growing, has contributed to the success of       the organization in achieving significant additional funding.
After       competitive tender, Coventry University (PI Kneafsey) was       commissioned to undertaken an evaluation of the impact of Garden Organic's       `Master Gardener' programme, which is funded by the Big Lottery's Local       Food Fund [f, h].
Through the programme, Garden Organic has recruited,       trained and supported more than 400 volunteers who in turn have mentored       4000 households in London, Warwickshire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire to grow       their own food.
The evaluation [e] published online (2012) provided       independent and rigorous evidence of the wide range of socio-economic,       environmental and health benefits of the Master Gardener initiative for       the volunteers and the households involved.
According to the Master       Gardener Programme Manager at Garden Organic, the added benefit of       contracting Coventry University and especially Kneafsey was that       it allowed them to state that on the basis of "independent'"       research that the programme "makes a difference".
The evidence       revealed in Kneafsey's research has already been used by Garden       Organic to support a successful bid to secure &#163;200,000 of further funding       for the programme, including a commission from Lincolnshire Public Health       [g].
The Lincolnshire volunteer co-ordinator confirmed that without being       able to evidence the impact of the Master Gardener programme through Kneafsey's       evaluation, "without a doubt that Master Gardener programme wouldn't         have happened".
The Programme Manager also confirmed that "it was         a rare opportunity for us [to apply for this funding] and Coventry         University allowed us to capitalize on this opportunity".
Additional       long term funding has also been secured from Medway Public Health, and Rye       Hill Prison with bids again being supported by the evidence provided from       the evaluation.
Kneafsey's research has supported the Unit's agenda for       co-creation and co-delivery, working alongside end-users.
For example, Kneafsey       and her team delivered basic research and ethics training to the volunteer       coordinators, in order to increase the data collection capacity of the       Master Gardener programme and enhance its long term sustainability.
The       Programme Manager believes that the Coventry research has impacted upon       the charity's ability to develop the business model.
He commented that the       evaluation had moved from being an `additional' activity to a `central'       component of the programme and stated that the research "is fundamental         to the charity's business strategy".
He went on to comment that "Coventry         University findings have also benefited Garden Organic by inspiring and         motivating our volunteer Master Gardeners.
First, when researchers Moya       Kneafsey and Elizabeth Cheese presented the findings at         our national conference with 200 food growing mentors.
Next,         when I have presented findings during training for new and experienced         volunteers.
And most recently, through national and local press exposure         in print, radio, and television."
He added that "Coventry         University's research team have taken personal interest in designing a         bespoke approach to suit the needs of Garden Organic.
As well as         increase the scope and quality of the research by training the Master         Gardener Programme team to take part in data collection."
Example.
3 Use of research to inform European agricultural policy       The third example of impact derives from research completed for the European         Commission, which investigated the state of play of Short Food       Supply Chains and Local Food Systems in the European Union [i, j, k, l].
This contract was won after a competitive process to which Kneafsey       was invited to apply after the research commissioner identified Kneafsey       due to her international reputation for research in `short food chains'       and having been aware of her work for the CPRE.
Whilst there has been a       political will to develop policies to support small-scale farmers in the       EU, there was a lack of evidence regarding the social and economic       benefits of short food chains and local food systems.
The Project Officer       at the Joint Research Centre in Seville, responsible for commissioning the       research on behalf of the Directorate General for Agriculture, noted that       he was "more than satisfied" with the report and specifically that       the Commission felt that Kneafsey had delivered "more value         than the money we offered".
Kneafsey was invited to Brussels       in April 2012 and February 2013 to present the research to stakeholders       including DG Agriculture's Advisory Group in Product Quality and was also       invited to the European Rural Development Network's Mediterranean Cluster       conference on short food chains in October 2012.
The Project Officer       stressed that the policy implications of the report were "starting to         happen now" and it is currently being used as a "key element"       in drafting of a policy report for the European Parliament which will be       debated in January 2014.
In addition, a conference (`Food From Here') was       hosted at Coventry on 3rd July 2013, featuring international       speakers and a special address from a representative of the European       Commission, attracting international delegates from local and community       food sectors [m].
Conclusion     This case study demonstrates that Kneafsey's research has had impact         on practitioners and professional services, influencing CPRE's work       on local food and Garden Organic's work on community organic food       production.
In addition, the research has had an impact on public         policy and services providing evidence to the European Commission on       the social and economic benefits of short food chains and local food       systems to inform future policy.
