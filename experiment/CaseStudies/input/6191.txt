     As summarised in section 1, HSP research has had two types of impact:     Benefits to CBW expert and policy communities:     HSP researchers work continually with governments, international       organisations and NGOs in the CBW field, providing wide-ranging benefits       to CBW debates and policy.
This work `has provided solid evidence-based       information and argument that has helped sustain UK work in negotiating       and implementing the CWC, maintaining the effectiveness of the BWC and       sustaining the overall efficacy of the international regime against the       misuse of biology and chemistry.
HSP's work over the last twenty years and       more has helped shape UK perceptions of the issues in hand, the challenges       faced and possible steps that could be taken to address them' [C1].
This       work includes:            Information gathering and dissemination, including: maintaining the         Sussex Harvard Information Bank, considered the world's largest open         archive of published and unpublished material on CBW, which is used         regularly by CBW researchers and policymakers; maintaining a CBW events         database, recording 15,000 CBW events since 1987; and editing the CBW         Convention's Bulletin, the journal of record in the field from         1993-2011.
Advisory work, including with actors involved in the CBW Conventions,         the UN, the G8 Global Partnership, the WHO, the ICRC, the UK National         Authority for the Chemical Weapons Convention, the European Commission,         Human Rights Watch, the Bioweapons Prevention Project, the UK Royal         Society and committees of the US National Academies, and most recently         an amicus curia brief for the US Supreme Court in the Bond         case [C2].
Outreach events, including the organisation or hosting of more than 30         expert seminars (many of which have been in coordination with other         institutions, including governments).
Direct support for policy processes via briefings and reviews,         including several hundred page guides for the CWC and BWC Review         Conferences, commissioned and funded by state parties including the UK         [C3].
Illustrative of the value of these documents, HSP's 2011 Briefing         Book for the BWC was publicly commended by the US State Department's         Deputy Director of Chemical/Biological Weapons Policy as `a survival         guide for delegates and interested parties' [C4].
This Briefing Book was         presented to the President of the Review Conference by the UK's         Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, and orally commended by him.
Sustained single-issue advocacy and/or policy innovation, including:         on-going development and promotion of HSP's draft treaty on         international criminalisation of individuals' involvement in CBW         development and use, including through evidence presented to the UK         Foreign Affairs Select Committee [C5]; and proposals for building Dual         Use education into higher education curricula, referenced by, inter         alia, the WHO and the US National Academies of Science [C6].
Issue-specific impacts:     In addition, HSP research has had issue-specific impacts, illustrated       here in relation to the three areas of research discussed in section 2:     (1) Yellow rain: The yellow rain controversy continues to this       day.
The US government maintains its initial case, but most other       governments and experts support HSP's bee defecation explanation [C7].
Critical lessons for the practice of investigating alleged use have been       widely drawn from this research.
For example, a 2008 article co-authored       by Sir David Omand, former UK Security and Intelligence Coordinator, and       published in a CIA journal, describes this as `a well-documented case that       illustrates the pitfalls' of verifying allegations of CBW use,       specifically acknowledging the role of HSP research [C8].
Partly as a       result of the yellow rain controversy, improved methods have now been       introduced for dealing with such allegations: a senior governmental       representative has stated that HSP's work `on yellow rain helped       underscore the need for effective international mechanisms for       investigating allegations of CBW use, which has been a long-term UK       objective' [C1].
Indeed, the yellow rain incident has become viewed as       paradigmatic of the complexities involved in attributing responsibility       for (real or alleged) chemical weapons use.
For example, it has been       widely revisited in expert and public discussions over the August 2013 use       of chemical weapons in Syria [C9].
(2) Incapacitating agents: HSP has collaborated widely with civil       society organisations and scientific communities in developing       recommendations and pressuring governments on this issue.
Robinson served,       for example, on the committee of the Royal Society's influential Brain       Waves project, and is extensively cited in its final report [C10], and HSP       has also worked on the issue through Pugwash and the ICRC.
A major HSP       objective has been to strengthen the position of those in government who       argue for constraints and are in a position to inhibit backsliding from       existing policies.
Traces of impact can be gleaned from the contributions       of HSP to the UK Foreign Affairs Committee's 2009 Report on       non-proliferation [C5]; and from instructions provided to the US       delegation to the CWC, published by Wikileaks: these state that `a growing       interest among British NGOs in discussing' incapacitating agents may place       the UK `under considerably more pressure to demonstrate increased       flexibility in entertaining discussions and possibly even report language'       [C11].
A senior government official has stated that HSPs work on       incapacitating agents `has contributed to UK policy formulation and led       indirectly to the statement made by Alastair Burt at the Third CWC Review       Conference in 2013', where he clarified UK policy on the issue [C1].
Civil       society pressure has resulted in the UK, US, Germany and Switzerland all       clarifying or amending their positions on this issue since 2008 [C12].
(3) Science and Technology reviews: This research has fed       directly into international policy discussions.
A range of policy options       for reform of review procedures were developed by HSP researchers, and       were communicated via, inter alia, a series of specially designed policy       briefing papers; tailored presentations to government officials; and       presentations at the UN including one that led a senior Indian diplomat to       call the project a `model means of engaging policy makers' [C13].
The       research has been extensively cited, including by the UK National       Academies of Science, and in US government-authored national papers       submitted to the BWC [C14].
Building in part upon the reform options       identified by HSP, the process by which Science and Technology is reviewed       under the BWC was changed at the Seventh Review Conference [C15].
HSP       research on this issue continues to have impact, being raised two years       later in discussions about how best to accommodate and review Science and       Technology advances relevant to the CWC [C16].
