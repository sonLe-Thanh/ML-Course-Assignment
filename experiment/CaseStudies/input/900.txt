     Innovative and Profitable Coated Products     MacDermid Autotype Ltd is a global industrial manufacturer of high       quality precision coated films and blended liquids for use in the       printing, automotive and electronics industries.
Statement [A]       corroborates that MacDermid Autotype have exploited the Leeds flow models       of coating manufacturing processes, including roll [2] and in screen       printing [3], to develop several new highly profitable products.

Statement [A] describes how the company applies the findings from the       Leeds models to upstream operations (designing and manufacturing products)       and in downstream activities such as explaining the technical benefits of       new products.
Statement [A] also confirms that MacDermid Autotype       collaborated with Leeds to publish an eBook How to be a great screen         printer in 2011 [B] and that this resource has been used extensively       by other practitioners of screen printing to develop a range of high-tech       screen-printed products, including solar cells, printed electronics and       touch panel displays.
An award-winning crankcase droplet filter &#8212; the Super Impactor     Statement [C] confirms that the Leeds flow optimisation research funded       by Yorkshire Forward [6] provided Parker Hannifin with a new product       optimisation software design tool, which the company used successfully to       design jet pump components of their droplet filters which were 20% more       energy-efficient.
The new Super Impactor crankcase ventilator, the       engineering solution developed as a result of the Leeds modelling, reduces       engine emissions in line with Euro 6 requirements, and boosts fuel       efficiency.
Statement [C] confirms that the new component, found in       droplet filtration systems in diesel engines, was awarded the prestigious       Grand Prix prize (in addition to the Green Product of the Year) at the       2012 British Engineering Excellence Awards: "An inventive engineering         solution that solves a significant environmental problem and which has         strong commercial drivers to a large potential market."

Knowledge transfer to industry       This UoA's coating research has had a major impact of the academic and       industrial coating and printing communities.
In 1995 Gaskell and Summers       organised the first biennial European Coating Symposium (ECS).
The ECS       event is still thriving (see e.g.
http://www.european-coating-symposium.eu/ecs2013.html;       in 2009 the 8th ECS had 146 participants from across the world [E]).
It is       now supported through the worldwide International Society of Coating       Science and Technology (www.iscst.org).
Staff at Leeds have used their coating research in several industrial       training courses.
Summers, Kapur and Thompson have       taught the subject of Web Coating and Drying on the AIMCAL (Association of       Industrial Mettalizers, Coaters and Laminators) European Converting       Schools in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 [F].
On these courses       industrialists have used the Leeds models to explore process operating       limits and optimise changes in production and quality control.
Statement       [G] corroborates the effectiveness of our AIMCAL courses and that the       knowledge transfer to the worldwide coating industry from this UoA's       research has: (i) significantly improved the education and training of       coating engineers and (ii) enabled staff to improve the productivity and       sustainability of their coating processes.
