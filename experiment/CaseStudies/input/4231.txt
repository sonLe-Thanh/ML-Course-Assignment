     Since 1996 the World Health Organisation has advised that research is a       key component of suicide prevention strategies.
The `Trouble with Suicide'       was the first attempt in the Northern Ireland context to review the       international evidence of the relationship between violent conflict and       mental health.
The report is available from the DHSSPS         Suicide Prevention resource site (218 downloads since August 2010).
It is also available for download from Youthnet       (the Network for the Voluntary Youth Sector) and from the National         Documentation Centre on Drug Use.
The report is referred to on the       website of the US Suicide Prevention Resource Center in a       discussion of the Director's blog (posted         16 March 2012) and is discussed in a review of the needs of victims       and survivors carried out for the Commission         for Victims and Survivors in 2010.
The author featured in a radio       documentary, `Before         Their Time' presented by Gerry Anderson (Falling Tree Productions,       broadcast by NewsTalk, Dublin, 16 April 2011).

The Northern Ireland Assembly's Committee for Health, Social Services and       Public Safety took oral evidence from the author (31st January 2008) as       part of its Inquiry into the Prevention of Suicide and Self-harm       (Volume 1, paragraphs 953-1012, May 2008).
The discovery of a cohort effect linking suicide trends to the conflict       attracted widespread publicity in print and electronic media.
Over one       hundred media outlets used a press release (July 2012) based on the `War,       peace and suicide' journal article.
TV and radio interviews were carried       out for the BBC (Radio 4, Radio 5, Radio Ulster), for Radio Telefis       &#201;ireann, Ulster Television and for several commercial radio stations.
Print and web-based coverage included The Guardian, The Mirror, Irish       Independent, Irish Times, Irish Examiner, News Letter, and Belfast       Telegraph.
Internationally the research was followed up with interviews for Deutsche       Welle, the World Service and the US-based ScienceNews.
Web-based       media that have carried the research include IrishCentral (US),       Freshties.com, thedetail.tv, thejournal.ie, eamonnmallie.com, the LSE's         politics and policy blog, and Slugger         O'Toole.
Another strand to the impact is that the research has been referred to       during parliamentary debates.
On World Suicide Prevention Day 10th       September 2012, the main findings were discussed in the Northern Ireland       Assembly.
Suicide prevention was debated in the Assembly on 15th April       2013 and members across the Unionist/Nationalist divide quoted from the       research.
The debate was on a motion proposed by the Chair of the       Assembly's Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee, calling on       the Executive to prioritise suicide prevention as a cross-departmental       concern.
A seminar delivered by the author in Parliament Buildings on 11th       April 2013 was referred to.
This had pointed out the exceptional nature of       Northern Ireland's recent suicide trends and presented six possible       explanations.
The Knowledge Exchange Seminar Series is hosted by the       Research and Information Service which makes video recordings of the       proceedings and distributes the briefing papers and presentation slides       (see Dealing         with suicide).
(In feedback, 100% of respondents found the       presentation `relevant to the development of policy and law').
William McCrea (Democratic Unionist Party MP) led the House of Commons       Opposition Day debate on suicide prevention, held on 6th February 2013.
He       relied heavily on the suicide research, naming the author and quoting       statistics and argument (House of Commons Debates, 6th February 2013, col.       326).
Similarly, Nigel Dodds (DUP) contributed to the debate by reading       out the main conclusions from the International Sociology article       (House of Commons Debates, 6th February 2013, col. 349).
A range of professional groups involved in suicide prevention have       engaged with the research:            The author addressed 270 mental health professionals at a conference         on suicide prevention       (22nd November 2012, organised by ContactNI &#8212; http://contactni.com/),         sharing a platform with the World Health Organisation's leader on         international suicide prevention strategy, Professor Annette Beautrais,         and with David Covington, the chair of the US National Suicide         Prevention Lifeline.
The Children of           Conflict conference (March 2012) attracted 250 international         delegates working with children and young people.
The author's         presentation on `Young people and the legacy of conflict' included a         discussion of suicide (see The             Guardian 26 March 2012).
The British Medical Association responded to the publication of `War,         Peace and Suicide' with a press release calling for measures to control         alcohol consumption.
The author was invited to present to the Victims and Survivors' Forum         of the Commission for Victims and Survivors, 15th January 2013.
The author was asked to discuss the suicide research with         psychiatrists working in the Belfast Trust area (1st March 2013 &#8212; 45         attendees).
Belfast Samaritans invited the author to present the findings at its         Annual General Meeting (14th May 2013).
