     The research has had significant and broad impact on commerce, as       evidenced by: i) commercial adoption of a new process &#8212; the       set-shifting task has been used by pharmaceutical companies in preclinical       drug development and has been included in the revised NIMH-sponsored       guidelines for schizophrenia clinical trials; and ii) demonstrable         collaborations with industry, including research contracts to       academic intermediaries in both the UK and USA.
i) Commercial adoption of a new process and change of practice within         the pharmaceutical industry The rodent attentional set-shifting task       is now used globally in the pharmaceutical industry to test drugs with       putative cognitive enhancement properties.
Evidence of significance         and breadth of impact is provided by: a) direct confirmation         from the pharmaceutical companies that the task is used in-house for       drug development and published data showing broad use of the task       across the industry, and b) inclusion of the task in clinical         guidelines for schizophrenia.
a) Use of task by pharmaceutical companies We have direct       confirmation that the Birrell and Brown (2000) set-shifting task has been       used in-house by several pharmaceutical companies during the REF period.
For example, a Head of Department in Lundbeck confirms that the       Birrell and Brown task has been used as part of their preclinical drug       development since 2009:     `our company has employed the Birrell and Brown (2000) attentional         set-shifting taskas part of our ongoing research aiming at developing         new drugs for treatment of CNS diseases.
The Birrell and Brown task is one           of our central assays when the executive domain of cognition is         among the target domains in question, and I can confirm that positive         data from this task have supported decisions to progress several of           our drug discovery projects' (S1).
The Head of Department also states that the Birrell and Brown (2000)       task:     `has made a significant contribution to drug discovery in our           company.
The back-translatability of your set-shifting task has         provided us with a crucial new methodology for addressing         cognition in a drug research setting.'
(S1)     Organon (which was taken over by Merck in 2007) also made       extensive use of the Birrell and Brown (2000) set-shifting task, and data       from the task were included in the preclinical development of asenapine,       a second generation anti-psychotic that has been marketed by Merck since       2009 as a treatment for mania in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
As       evidence, data from the attention set-shifting task are referred to in the       European Medicines Agency (EMA) submission for approval of       asenapine (S6); asenapine has also been approved by the US Food         and Drug Administration (S6).
In addition, a previous       employee of Organon has confirmed that the Birrell and Brown (2000) task       was:     `a key behavioural assay used by Organon during the         development of asenapine.
The task was specifically used during         preclinical testing of this compound' (S2).
A contact within the pharmaceutical industry, currently employed at TPP       Global Development and with access to industry databases, confirmed that       data from the Birrell and Brown (2000) task have also been used in the       preclinical drug development stages for other compounds that have reached       phase I and phase II clinical trials, and stated that the Birrell and       Brown (2000) task:     `is by far the most practical, validated, and translatable rodent           task currently available for exploring executive function within a         drug discovery setting and therefore forms a critical part of           behavioural test batteries across the whole pharmaceutical industry'       (S2).
A literature search of published articles provides further evidence for       extensive use of the task within industry.
During the REF period, employees         of 12 major pharmaceutical companies are listed as co-authors on       articles that include data from the Birrell and Brown (2000) task;       including GlaxoSmith-Klein, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lundbeck, Lilly, Pfizer       and Schering-Plough (S7).
b) Inclusion of the task in CNTRICS guidelines The Measurement         and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia       (MATRICS) initiative, funded by the US National Institute of Mental         Health (NIMH) in 2008, resulted in a set of criteria by which the       cognitive deficits of schizophrenia could be objectively evaluated for the       first time.
On the back of MATRICS, a group of pharmaceutical industry       scientists and academics engaged in the NIMH-sponsored Cognitive         Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia       (CNTRICS) initiative, which devised guidelines for assessing these       cognitive deficits in preclinical trials.
The attentional set-shifting       task was one of the core tasks adopted in new CNTRICS guidelines for       clinical trials in schizophrenia.
Brown was an invited speaker at the 2011       CNTRICS workshop on `Selecting translational animal model paradigms'       (S8) and inclusion of appropriate animal models of schizophrenia       was key to the development of the guidelines.
A CNTRICS steering group       member has confirmed that selection for inclusion is evidence that the       task:     `has set the standard for translational research practice in         psychiatry' and that inclusion of the task in the guidelines `will         assure new higher standards for the measurement of executive function         in both preclinical research and clinical trials' (S3).
ii) Demonstrable collaborations with industry The impact has       resulted from sustained and significant collaboration with industry,       including a Royal Society Industry Fellowship to Brown, research       funding to Brown's research laboratory, and research contracts to other       academic intermediaries in the UK and USA.
Evidence of significance         and breadth of impact:           a) Royal Society funding and support for collaborations with           industry Brown was awarded a Royal Society Industry           Fellowship, sponsored by Organon in 2006, which was extended       until 2012 via Merck sponsorship.
The outcome of the fellowship included       training scientists within Merck both specifically on the set-shifting       task, as well as more generally in interactions in a knowledge transfer       partnership.
Brown organised a 2011 Royal Society International         Scientific Seminar meeting on `Novel approaches to drug         development in the 21st Century' at the       Kavli Centre to which researchers from both academic and industrial       settings contributed.
This meeting resulted in a short article in Nature,       written by the attendees (Insel, T., Sahakian, B., Voon, V., Nye, J.,       Brown, V. J., et al.
2012.
Drug research: a plan for mental illness.
Nature       483: 269).
b) Provision of research contracts and funding to Brown       During the REF period, Brown's laboratory has received research contracts       totalling &#163;707k from 5 pharmaceutical companies (Lundbeck, Merck,       Organon, Schering Plough and TPP) and from the Scottish           Universities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA) (S9).
These       funds have supported postdoctoral researcher salary, CASE PhD studentships       and research costs.
In addition, Lilly has sent investigational compounds       (e.g., mGLUR5s) to Brown, in order for the efficacy to be assessed on the       set-shifting task.
c) Provision of research contracts to contract research           organisations and other academics The Birrell and Brown (2000)       task is offered by international contract research organisations (e.g,       WuXi Apptec, China; S10), and academic researchers in the UK and       abroad have been awarded research contracts to conduct the set-shifting       task on behalf of pharmaceutical companies.
For example, industry       contracts have been awarded to academic colleagues at the University of       Manchester, U.K. (S4) and the University of Texas, San Antonio,       U.S.A. (S5) to run the Birrell and Brown (2000) rodent attentional       set-shifting task.
