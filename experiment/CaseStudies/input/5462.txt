     Process from research to impact:     ESP-r has been made available under the GNU General Public License since       the late-90s and has       an international community of around 50 developers.
The freely available       modelling tool can be       used for the simulation of the thermal, visual and air quality performance       of buildings, and the       energy use and gaseous emissions associated with associated environmental       control systems.
This open availability has resulted in myriad `downstream' impacts by       government, industry and       research groups within and outwith the UK [Source A].
Since this time       companies have been       supported in their attempts to embed the simulation-assisted design       approach within their       businesses and apply it in practice [Source B].
Research outcomes have       been promoted through       innovative knowledge exchange.
One major project assisted 250 UK       Architectural Practices and       Energy Consultancies (mostly SMEs) to embed energy simulation within their       business as a means       to address the emerging opportunities relating to a low carbon built       environment.
Individuals within       these organisations were assisted in applying building performance       simulation to schemes that       achieved energy use reductions of the order of 75-90% as quantified by the       industry and confirmed       by independent audit [Source B].
Types of impact:     The impacts in the REF period stem from (a) application of the program by       practitioners and ESRU       academic staff to substantially improve building performance and (b) from       business process       changes resulting from the embedding of ESP-r in construction sector       companies.
Improving building standards and performance:     By facilitating a detailed appraisal of low energy/carbon options prior       to deployment, the application       of the software enhances energy performance and reduces emissions.
Ventilation efficiency and indoor air quality: ESP-r has been         applied in over 20 projects to         establish innovative approaches to wind/solar induced hybrid ventilation         schemes most         notably within the Navan Credit Union Headquarters Building in Ireland,         which won the 2010         Local Authority Members Association Award for best eco-friendly building         [Source C].
Occurrence of mould growth: Approximately 250,000 Scottish         dwellings have a mould         infestation problem and previous research commissioned by Scottish Homes         to identify non-biocidal         approaches to the control of condensation and mould growth influenced         emerging         policy in the area: e.g.
the published mould isopleths were used in 2008         by University         College London to inform UK Building Regulations [Source D].
Sizing and operational appraisal of hybrid community energy           schemes: a simulation-based         capability has been established in several companies, most notably SSE's         Home         Services Group, which has applied the technology to design zero carbon         solutions (e.g.
in         their Greenwatt Way development of 2010 in Slough, Berkshire) [Source         E].
Smart grid features appraisal: during the period 2009-13, ESP-r         was established as the         basis of aggregate energy demand forecasts as part of active network         control applied to the         Shetland Islands electricity grid.
These 48-hour-ahead forecasts allow         the Utility (Scottish         and Southern Energy) to schedule domestic space and water heaters as a         means to         prioritise renewable generation [Source F].
Validation and operational risk assessment: tests based on         ESP-r simulations, as         embodied in CIBSE TM33 [Source G], have been incorporated in procedures         for program         accreditation.
These tests must be passed by dynamic simulation programs         before they can         be used in compliance calculations addressing Part L of the building         regulations or for the         generation of energy performance certificates.
Incorporation of software into third party products:     Another significant application of the research was the encapsulation of       ESP-r's computational       engine, through commissioned projects, within third party products as a       means to enhance their       rigour, application scope and future extensibility.
Examples include            a project (2009-10) for the Carbon Trust to develop a biomass heating         system design tool         (200 current users with an estimated &#163;4M capital and &#163;1M running cost         saving per annum         (0.5 MtC) [Source H]       a project with the Building Research Establishment (BRE) from 2009-11         relating to the UK         Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for housing [Source I];       a project for Honeywell (2010-13) to develop a method for the         assessment of the energy         saving and carbon reduction benefits of advanced domestic heating         control systems, this has         allowed the company to refine their range of zone-based control systems         and gain         recognition for these in the context of pending legislation.
[Source J];       and a project for Natural Resources Canada (2007-9) to develop a         residential energy         analysis and rating tool which has a user base approaching 25,000 people         in 150 countries         and has been used to rate the performance of approximately 650,000 homes         for Canada's         ecoENERGY Retrofit Programme [Source K].
Training and consultancy:     ESRU operated an industrial consultancy service, which applied ESP-r to       projects on behalf of       clients.
Income from this activity was around &#163;100K per year over ~20       projects.
The energy/carbon       eductions to result were significant.
For example, the analysis of       retrofit options for New Gorbals       Housing Association, Glasgow (2010) resulting in an energy saving in       excess of 20% per annum       over the estate.
To support the growing use of ESP-r, ESRU delivered advanced training       courses to around 100       participants per year and seconded researchers to assist industry with       in-house simulation: a       notable example in the latter category was the one year (2010) secondment       of Dr Jon Hand, an       ESRU Senior Research Fellow, to Samsung Korea resulting in the application       of ESP-r to in-house       projects with substantial energy saving impact (e.g.
a 20% reduction in       chiller plant capacity in one       case).
Reach and significance:     From January 2008 to July 2013, ESP-r has been applied to evaluate and       improve over 150       building designs incorporating energy demand reduction and/or low carbon       technologies.
Additionally, the tool has been employed by other organisations,       including: Samsung and SK       Telecom in Korea; The Government of Canada (Natural Resources Canada and       Canadian       National Research Council); National Renewable Energy Laboratory and       Department of Energy in       the USA, Owens Corning in China; and the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.
In the UK, the       Building Research Establishment, Scottish and Southern Energy,       ScottishPower, Atkins, Alstom       and around 200 construction sector SMEs have all been beneficiaries.
Other confirmed impacts (average per year over the REF review period)       include: 360 practitioners       given innovation assistance; 12 new jobs created and 22 current jobs       safeguarded; 10 major       deployments of simulation tools within supported companies; assistance       given during 40 in-house       tool applications; &#163;0.7M increase in sales by assisted businesses; &#163;0.64M       increase in company       investment in innovation and RTD; introduction of new services in10 SMEs;       and 3 licensing deals       between SMEs and the science base (Source B).
