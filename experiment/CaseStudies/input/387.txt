     `Adding value' to environmental campaigning     The experiments conducted by Maio's team showed that environmental       campaigns that seek to       encourage greener behaviour by appealing to self-interest run the risk of       backfiring, and that they       are more likely to be effective if they appeal to altruistic values.
The findings of Maio's research were brought to the attention of campaign       professionals at WWF       by an American psychologist (Prof. Tim Kasser, Knox College).
Maio was       then invited to explain       his work to NGOs (esp.
WWF and Scope), campaign professionals and       practitioners through       contributions to key publications, workshops and blog contributions, the       most important of which       are highlighted below.
Establishment of Common Cause     Perhaps most significantly, the research helped to provide impetus for a       project called Common         Cause for Nature, which is now a network comprising people around       the globe (in excess of 1100       Twitter followers, 600 Facebook likes), organisations in seven principal       nations (Australia, Austria,       Belgium, Brazil, South Africa, Sweden, UK), three sponsor NGOs (Oxfam,       Public Interest       Research Centre, and WWF-UK), and many other NGOs that have contributed       financially or in kind       (e.g., Friends of the Earth, Scope).
With help from Maio and other       academics, Common Cause       produced a guide to disseminate the evidence of values-based communication       to diverse public,       commercial, and third-sector groups; the Cardiff evidence is cited       frequently in the section "How       We Use Values",5.1 and this guide has been downloaded more than       7000 times.5.2     The influence of the Cardiff research is also documented in the full       report, Common Cause: The         case for working with our cultural values.5.3 Section 2.4       of this publication describes the Cardiff       experiments in detail and cites the research as evidence that it may be       counter-productive to       attempt to motivate behaviour that addresses societal problems by using       strategies that activate       values related to self-interest (p. 34).
New campaigning focus     Through Common Cause, NGOs and environmental organisations have       re-configured their       environmental campaigns.
The Change Strategist for WWF-UK says that the       Cardiff research has       "directly informed WWF's work on Earthbook, and [led to] a change in the       way that Waste Watch       campaigns on recycling.
In the case of Waste Watch's work on recycling,       for example, it has led to       a move away from a focus on information provision, and towards the       engagement of audiences       through appeal to self-transcendence values (through, for example, making       concerns about       community more salient)... it has also led to the initiation of a wide       range of enquiries that are likely       to influence future campaigns and communications.
"5.4 An       extended discussion of the implications       of the Cardiff research, written by the same commentator, can be found in       an article in Nature         Climate Change.5.5     Global policy re-think     These ideas have also stimulated policy debates on the environment with       government (especially       the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies), diverse NGOs and the general public       through a number of       practice and policy workshops, many of which are documented in an       independent impact       assessment by PIER Logistics.5.6 This assessment involved       interviewing 10 prominent       stakeholders, including the Welsh and Scottish Assemblies, environmental       NGOs, and       independent research and strategy consultancies.
The interviews yielded       ample evidence that       Maio's research has influenced approaches to government policy and to       campaigning.
For       example, with respect to policy, a Senior Policy Officer for WWF Scotland       noted that Maio's       research has "gone into the Scottish government's strategy for meeting its       climate change targets."
With respect to campaigning, a Principal Research Officer with the       Scottish Government stated       that Maio's research has had "a profound effect on Scottish government ...       the way we       communicate about climate-change behaviours," while the Director of Waste       Watch noted that the       research "had proven powerful in getting NGOs to rethink the       market/consumer approach to       consciousness raising."
Public debate     According to the Director of the Public Interest Research Centre, Maio's       participation in Common         Cause workshops across the UK has helped to make campaigners in the       third sector and in the       public sector more mindful of the role of values: "It's clear that       delegates are more persuaded by       hearing the evidence first-hand from scientists than through an       intermediary.
As a result,       campaigners and professionals in the third sector and public sector have       become much more       mindful of the values that they engage in their campaigns and projects.
"5.7     The Common Cause website,5.2 set up by the sponsoring       NGOs in July 2011, also plays a       prominent role as a public discussion forum on the topic of values-led       communication.
It contains       relevant readings, audio and video (including a Tedx talk citing Maio's       research and a brief       illustration of the evidence by Maio).
As documented by the PIER Logistics       report,5.6 the Common       Cause organisation has become a key independent vehicle for the       international impact of Maio's       research "in for instance, Sweden, Australia, South Africa, Brazil,       Brussels" (p. 7).
Its international       footprint is evident with over 4484 visits per month to its website in the       past year, and 40% from       overseas.5.7 The report also notes that, through Common         Cause, the implications of Maio's       research for environmental campaigning have stimulated public debate via       national media interest       in the UK, in newspapers such as The Guardian and Wired.
For       example, a feature article by       George Monbiot drew directly on research conducted by Maio and others and       in doing so       referenced the Common Cause report.5.8
