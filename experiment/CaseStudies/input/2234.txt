            Both consumer opinion and legislation increasingly propose reduction         in the use of hydro-carbons and other low boiling point propellants for         consumer aerosols.
The annual production of more than 12 billion         consumer aerosol cans powered by VOCs may have replaced CFCs, but may         still present a significant and growing source of greenhouse gas         emissions.
A revolutionary new eco-valve has been developed by         University of Salford researchers; the Salford Eco-valve, working         together with the UK, European and US aerosol industry, which         demonstrates:            Replacing butane or other liquefied hydrocarbon gas with air, nitrogen         or other non-flammable gas propellant;       Customer acceptable spray quality and consistency during can lifetime;       Using conventional cans and filling technology.
Low-carbon flashing propellants replacements which reduce VOCs and         greenhouse gases have been developed but have not achieved widespread         adoption.
A more practical approach for the total replacement of VOCs         and greenhouse gases has been found to be compressed gas (e.g.
air or         nitrogen) propellants.
However, aerosols using compressed gas propellant with an outlet valve         derived from conventional designs typically have poor spray         characteristics (large droplet size) and a noticeable deterioration in         performance during the life of the can as the product is used.
Nasr demonstrates that atomisation can be improved by gas bubbles and         turbulence inside the atomiser insert of the actuator, ensuring that         compressed gas aerosols fitted with the eco-valve provided consistent         pressure through life of the can and delivered the fine droplet spray         qualities required by consumers.
The main beneficiaries of the new development are global consumer         goods companies who manufacture products such deodorants (the biggest         single annual user of aerosol technology); hairsprays; air fresheners;         polish; insecticide; disinfectant; shaving foam; food products (such as         whipped cream, olive oil and cooking oil) and pharmaceutical application         such as medical inhalers, and their customers.
Nasr worked in partnership with multi-national manufacturers involved         in the production and use of aerosols to collaborate on and take up the         development.
Key to this collaboration is working in partnership with         advisors from the aerosol industry's manufacturing association who gave         insights and guidance on the product to encourage take up.
A portfolio of five patents protect the technological solutions that         were developed to overcome long-standing problems of gradual loss of         power and poor spray consistency that have hindered the previous         adoption of the compressed air aerosol.
The Salford Eco-valve works by         inducing a `bubbly' flow within the stem of the aerosol valve by         injecting compressed gas into the passing flow, generating turbulence,         thus creating an effect equal in look, feel and spray with current VOC         (Volatile Organic Compound) powered systems.

Pilot production of 100,000 consumer aerosols is currently being         arranged in collaboration with a UK consultancy and a European aerosol         packaging company.
See confidential information for details.
An assignment of the eco-valve technology is being negotiated with a         preferred partner for exclusive global manufacture, sales and         distribution of the valves.
See confidential information for details.
The technology is already being evaluated for take up by a major         commercial aerosol filling partner which is looking to invest in the         next phase development of the valve.
Numerous other major companies have also expressed interest in Salford         eco-valve technology and constructive dialogue has progressed.
Many of         these companies have entered into formal evaluation and/or testing under         appropriate non-disclosure agreements and material transfer agreements.
See confidential information for details.
The eco-valve technology will be presented to multinational aerosol         companies during the FEA Exhibition in Sept 2013.
