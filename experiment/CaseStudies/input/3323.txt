     Pathway to impact: regulatory approval of Crestor (rosuvastatin)     Newcastle demonstrated strong interactions in vitro between       gemfibrozil and rosuvastatin, and       between cyclosporine and rosuvastatin, at the transporter OATP1B1.
Those       findings were passed       to AstraZeneca (Ev a) and considered during the drug development process.
This eventually led to       two clinical trials that confirmed drug-drug interactions in patients.
In       August 2003, rosuvastatin       was approved for marketing in the United States, accompanied by an       FDA-approved drug       medication guide that referred specifically to the safety implications of       the drug-drug interactions.
The current rosuvastatin medication guide states:     "Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins         including the hepatic uptake transporter         organic anion-transporting polyprotein 1B1 (OATP1B1)"     "Concomitant administration of CRESTOR [rosuvastatin] with         medications that are inhibitors of         these transporter proteins (e.g.
cyclosporine, certain HIV protease         inhibitors) may result in         increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of         myopathy" (Ev b).
Rosuvastatin is now commonly prescribed in Europe and the United States       for those at risk of       cardiovascular disease.
In 2012, 1.9 million prescriptions of rosuvastatin       were written by the NHS       in England, and it was the third most prescribed drug by sales value in       the US (prior to 2008 it was       outside the top 20 &#8212; see NHS Information Centre and drugs.com).
As a       result of Newcastle work,       the dosing guidelines for rosuvastatin were changed to minimise the risk       of dangerous co-administration       of rosuvastatin with either gemfibrozil or cyclosporine.
Since the effect       of       cyclosporine on rosuvastatin clearance was so large (leading to a 7.1 fold       increase in drug       exposure), it can be confidently asserted that serious morbidity,       including breakdown of skeletal       muscle, will have been avoided in some patients.
For example, 60-80% of       organ transplant       recipients suffer from abnormally high lipid levels in blood at some       point, and are therefore       potentially indicated for statins and cyclosporine.
The information given on drug-drug interactions in the FDA-approved       rosuvastatin medication       guide is mirrored in the current British National Formulary entry on the       drug (Ev c).
Worldwide impact on the regulation and activity of the pharmaceutical       industry     Investigation of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is becoming an increasingly       important issue for the       pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, in part because       populations are ageing and       older people are much more likely to be suffering from multiple medical       conditions (co-morbidities),       thus taking more than one drug at the same time.
The transporter OATP1B1       is a main target for       investigation because it has broad substrate specificity and plays a major       role in the clearance of       many drugs by the liver, including the antibiotic rifampicin, the       anti-cancer drug paclitaxel and       some statins.
In March 2010 the International Transporter Consortium, which comprises       representatives from       academia, industry and regulatory authorities, published a white paper       that contains a section       about the investigation of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions at       OATP1B1.
It refers to the       rosuvastatin-cyclosporine interaction and cites R4 (Ev d).
In March 2012,       at the second workshop       of the International Transporter Consortium, a presentation about       OATP-mediated drug       interactions also referred explicitly to data from R4:     "Rosuvastatin (Crestor&#174;) as a case study to study OATP1B1 inhibition         and the risk of DDI.
Simonson SG et al" (Ev e).
Through the International Transporter Consortium's white paper, Newcastle       research has       influenced thinking within the FDA.
In February 2012, the FDA published Guidance         for Industry         Drug Interaction Studies &#8212; Study Design, Data Analysis, Implications for         Dosing, and Labeling         Recommendations.
It includes two decision trees that should be used       during the development       phase of new compounds and help determine (our underlining):     "whether an investigational drug is a substrate for OATP1B1       or OATP1B3 and when an in vivo         clinical study is needed" and "whether an investigational drug         is an inhibitor of OATP1B1" (Ev f).
As justification for this guidance, the document refers to studies,       including R4, that have shown       clinically significant OATP1B1-mediated drug-drug interactions (our       underlining highlights the data       from R4):     "For example, co-administration of cyclosporine increases           the area under the plasma           concentration-time curve (AUC) of pravastatin, rosuvastatin,         and pitavastatin by 10-fold, 7-fold, and         5-fold, respectively... Because these statins are not significantly         metabolized, the interactions           appear to result from inhibition of transporters, including OATP1B1."
(Ev f).
The European equivalent of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency,       published its final guideline       on investigating drug-drug interactions in July 2012.
It states:     "[the] nhibition of OATPs has been reported to result in marked         increases in the systemic         exposure of drugs subject to hepatic uptake transport ... the possible         involvement of OATP1B1         and 1B3 uptake transport should be investigated in vitro for drugs         estimated to have &#8805; 25% hepatic         elimination" (Ev g).
Since adherence to guidelines is mandatory for pharmaceutical companies       for the US and       European markets, Newcastle research has had worldwide impact on the       pharmaceutical industry.
A representative of one of the major international pharmaceutical       companies who is also a member       of the International Transporter Consortium has agreed:     "- that Colin's [Dr Brown's] in vitro work showed that the         rosu/cycl DDI [rosuvastatin/cyclosporine       drug-drug interaction] was in part mediated by the OATP1B1 transporter         (published with the clinical         trial in the Simonson paper);     - that this in vitro data was used to inform the development of         regulatory guidelines and influential         papers (e.g.
ITC white paper) on transporter-mediated DDIs;     - that these guidelines have influenced the operations of the         pharmaceutical industry (for example,         testing for DDIs if NCE's [new chemical entities] are likely to         be cleared hepatically [by the liver]       and be OATP1B1 substrates)."
(Ev h)     Commercial impact     Several companies, such as Solvo Biotechnology (Ev i) and Qualyst       Transporter Solutions (Ev j),       now offer products and services that have been designed for the study of       transporter-mediated       drug-drug interactions.
Qualyst Transporter Solutions is a global provider       of hepatic drug       transporter products and contract research services, and it has sold kits       or undertaken research       projects (typical contracts range in value from $65 to $250k) for major       pharmaceutical companies       including Pfizer, Novartis, Merck and Eli Lilly.
One of their products &#8212;       B-CLEAR &#8212; has been       designed in response to 2012 FDA guidance on drug transporter       interactions.
The company has       stated:     "One of the transporters that are [sic] extremely important for       drug interactions and required by       both the FDA and EMA for any drug being developed is OATP1B1.
Colin       Brown's group did work,       for the first time, showing OATP1B1 drug-drug interactions between       rosuvastatin and cyclosporine,       as well as rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil.
We can confirm that in the last       few years, particularly since       the initial International Transporter Consortium report in 2010, this work       has directly led to a       significant impact on regulation and activity of the pharmaceutical       industry.
Indeed this is now a       routine part of every transporter drug interaction study Qualyst performs       for its pharmaceutical       clients" (Ev j).
