     Impact has been created from the original idea and research on the       feasibility of the system.
Knowledge transfer to industry involved Surrey       working closely with industry in R&amp;D projects.
These were first funded       by the EU and then funded by private venture funds by industry itself as       system definition and products emerged.
In this way Surrey was involved in       further research which accelerated the movement to a real system.
Knowledge transfer from the University occurred in the following       areas;            Convincing industry of the viability of the system,         including-satellite operators, satellite manufacturers, terminal         manufacturers and service providers.
Demonstrating a working system with prototype equipment.
Convincing EU and ESA to invest &#8364;50m in R&amp;D.       Working with industry to convince DVB/ETSI to develop a new standard         for the system.
Assisting industry to lobby the EU to create a new and harmonised         license regime for the system.
Formation of a new company SolarisMobile with circa &#8364;100m         capitalisation to run the system.
Launch of a new satellite and operation of services in Europe.
Thus, from the first research idea created at Surrey in 1999, a system       was actually built and launched within 11 years which included the       R&amp;D, standards for the industry and agreements on spectrum within       Europe.
Internationally, Korea launched a similar system in 2008 in       partnership with Japan.
In the US there have been trials of a similar       system and two satellites launched but no commercial service is yet       operating.
Impact can be demonstrated in the followings ways:     Economic impact has been created by the ensuing formation of a new       business and a new company.
Circa 100 jobs and R&amp;D plus satellite       rollout of &#8364;200m have been created in the sector by just the upstream       activity.
The potential for downstream wealth creation in terminal sales       and services is estimated at around &#8364;1B.
Policy impact was created by a completely new intervention by the       EU to harmonise the spectrum across Europe.
This was the first time that       the EU had intervened to operate a `beauty parade' and to offer pan       European licenses.
Societal Impact has been created as the system has enabled       multimedia broadcast to reach regions of Europe that wouldn't have been       economic with purely terrestrial infrastructure.
This has and will       continue to contribute to more digital inclusion within Europe and help to       mitigate the digital divide that would otherwise exist for the rural and       remote areas.
Current plans are to extend services to personal protection       and disaster warning systems thus adding to the societal impacts.
In recognition the achievement the following statements have been made:     CEO of Solaris says;     `Surrey's role in the formation of this new business area was           crucial and was an exemplar of cooperation between academia and           industry'     The Chair of ETSI SCN says;     `The SDMB area was unique in rapidly creating new standards and           regulations for operation of the system in Europe.
Surrey besides           being the originator played a key role in the process.'
EU satellite projects coordinator says;     `This is an excellent example of how funding via a series of EU           projects can create a new business area.
Surrey have played a pivotal           role in all of the R&amp;D innovations.'
