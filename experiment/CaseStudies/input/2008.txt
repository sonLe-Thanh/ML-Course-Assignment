     The impact is on society through public interest and engagement with       science and the stimulation of public discourse.
The questions of the       `origin of the universe', `what happened before the big bang?
', and `how       space-time might emerge from a more fundamental theory' are some of the       most frequently addressed issues in popular science and stimulate wide       interest (and controversy).
Roger Penrose's writings have opened up new       avenues in this debate that have led to much interest outside academia.
The beneficiaries since 2008 have been the general public who gain an       understanding of current models for the evolution of the universe.
The research of Paul Tod demonstrated rigorously that the Weyl curvature       hypothesis gave mathematical sense to the question of whether the       conformal geometry whose existence is demonstrated mathematically has any       physical meaning.
This underpinned Penrose's Conformally Cyclic Cosmology       proposal.
His recent broad audience book Cycles of Time: An         Extraordinary New View of the Universe (published in 2010) explains       the conformal cyclic cosmology which is underpinned by the research       described in Section 2.
Cycles of Time has been hugely successful.
More than 95,000 copies       have been sold worldwide since 2010 [A], it has been translated into       German, Polish, Italian and Russian, and released as an audio book.
The         Nature of Space and Time has sold 10,502 copies in the period [B]       and the Road to Reality, another pre-cursor building on the themes       in the Nature of Space and Time, has sold nearly 120,000 copies since 2004       including 45,400 in the REF period [A].
The books are also promoted with       accompanying public presentations at large book fairs (e.g., 25/11/10 at       Toppings, The Paragon, Bath, Somerset or 26/3/12 Sunday Times Literary       Festival, Oxford).
A new book by Penrose is an automatic choice for review       in quality media of all kinds.
Penrose's books are highly unusual among popular science books in       celebrating rather than obscuring the mathematical equations and       geometrical pictures that underlie the physical ideas.
They take the       audience seriously as intellectuals and do not oversimplify.
Readers       engage directly with Penrose's writing, as evidenced by a 2008 reader       review [C] of The Road to Reality on Amazon: "If you         assiduously go through every sentence until you understand its meaning,         if you consult outside references as necessary, if you really absorb         this material- it is phenomenal.
Penrose will equip you with a visual         and intuitive comprehension of the advanced math necessary to really         understand the big theories of physics.
[...] In terms of the         breadth and scope, I could compare this to the Feynman lectures.
[...] This is a book to live in for a long time.
There is nothing else         quite like it.
The rewards justify the large amount of reader time and         effort that will need to be committed.
Five stars, absolutely".
Professional and reader reviews of Cycles of Time also attest to       Penrose's success in engaging with the wider public:     "The most influential person to develop the general theory of         relativity since Einstein" [D]     "A gifted popularizer of science [...] Roger Penrose has         attracted a popular audience with thought- provoking books on physics,         consciousness and the theory of computation" [E]     "Doing what most find impossible has long been Penrose's stock in         trade in mathematics and physics, even when it comes to publishing"       [F]     "One of the world's best science writers" [G]     "As usual, one gets a clear, simply, but new view of physics from         Penrose.
The depth is much greater than many popular science books, but         I find I can grasp the ideas.
I have wondered for a long time how to get         an understanding of metrics which seem all important in modern physics.
I looked at a collection of math books which would provide the knowledge         but felt that it would take the rest of my life to get there.
Penrose         gave me as much knowledge of the ideas and usage of the methods as I         need in one page" [H]     This approach makes his contributions to the public engagement with       science particularly important as it allows the public to see scientific       debate as a rigorous evaluation of mathematical argument and empirical       data rather than as `anything-goes' speculation with one person's theory       being on a democratic footing with anyone else's.
Another unusual feature of Penrose's public engagement is that he is       rarely reviews other people's ideas except to counterpoint them against       his own.
He engages people directly with his own research and that of his       close associates following the programmes that he has initiated.
The       public engagement described in this study arises directly from the       research described here and not from that of others or older ideas.
This       point is reinforced by his use of hand-drawn diagrams which have attracted       much favourable comment from readers of his books and online viewers of       his lectures, for example "He's probably the only world famous speaker         that draws his own slides with color marker pens!
Not just a brilliant         mind but also a talented illustrator!"
comments one YouTube watcher       in 2011 [I].
The wide impact of these ideas and Penrose's presentational style is       evidenced by regular invitations to give distinguished public lectures and       to appear on the media the world over.
Penrose featured prominently in a       2010 BBC Horizon programme which attracted more than 1.8 million       viewers [J].
His public lectures typically pack out the largest available       auditoria, sometimes with overflow rooms equipped with video-links.
For       example, a capacity audience of 477 saw him at the Royal Institution in       2010 [K], while an audience of more than 700 saw him lecture after       receiving the 2011 Fonseca prize.
Of those who filled in a feedback       questionnaire following the Royal Institution lecture, 94% had come `to       find out more' and 82% wanted `to find out more following the event' [K].
He gave the Tagore, Bose and Chandrasekhar memorial lectures in Kolkata,       the Chandrasekhar lecture Delhi, the Neils Bohr lecture in Copenhagen, the       Trotter Public lecture after receipt of the Trotter prize at Texas       A&amp;M, and the Copernicus Institute Lecture in Warsaw among many others       around the world.
The impact of Penrose's public lectures is not limited to the few hundred       people that attend each of them, as they are often filmed and posted       online.
For example, YouTube lists 344 videos in response to a search for       `Roger Penrose'; not all of these feature him directly, but total views of       those that do, and were posted since 2008, number well over 500,000 [L].
A       good example is his 2009 Christmas Lecture Aeons before the Big Bang       with more than 52,000 views [M]; another is his 2010 TEDx lecture aimed at       encouraging young people to engage with STEM subjects, with more than       32,000 views [N]; and a third is a public lecture on Twistors and         Quantum non-locality, broadcast on TV in Ontario in 2011, with more       than 40,000 views [O].
Many of the posted videos generate comments       numbering in the hundreds and often stimulate online dialogues about the       content of the lectures.
These are outstanding impacts on a world stage.
As can be seen, Penrose       is in great demand and has a worldwide following.
