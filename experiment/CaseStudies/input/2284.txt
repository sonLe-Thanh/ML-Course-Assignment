     The research described above provided an evidence base to continue the       rollout of ART in sub-Saharan Africa without diverting resources for ART       to measures of viral load &#8212; a policy which had come under question in       previous years.
It was seen as critical to understand whether the       consequences of roll out of ART without viral load monitoring were so       severe (due to concerns over transmission of HIV drug resistance) as to       mean that introduction of such testing should be prioritised over       continued ART expansion by ART programmes.
Our findings provided support       for continued roll out in settings where viral load monitoring was not       available.
A comment paper written by colleagues from the Global Fund for       HIV, TB and Malaria (the body which, along with U.S. President's Emergency       Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), provided most funds for the ART roll-out)       concluded that "Phillips and colleagues' findings strengthen the policy         consensus and WHO recommendation &#8212; so far based on individual patient         outcomes and cost-effectiveness in the shorter term &#8212; that resource-poor         countries need not delay ART roll-out because of limitations in         laboratory capacity" [a].
The Director/Coordinator of Treatment and Prevention Scale-up at the WHO       HIV Department at that time reports that "the work... adapting the HIV         synthesis to model the outcome of ART in low-income settings under         different monitoring practices helped shape global ART roll-out policy         and practice.
Furthermore, because of its unique utility and approach,         the modelling work and synthesis adaptations continue to be used to         inform global policy development" [b].
Since 2008, the trajectory of the number of people on ART has increased,       with 9.7 million people now on ART [c].
Almost all countries in       sub-Saharan Africa (with the exceptions of South Africa and Botswana) have       been providing ART without regular viral load monitoring.
Point of care       tests for viral load are now close to coming to market and WHO has started       to encourage use of viral load testing in patient monitoring as resources       allow, so long as this does not inhibit roll-out.
Our publications in 2008 and 2011 were written jointly with colleagues at       WHO responsible for the public health approach [d], and influenced       their policy as described &#8212; i.e.
to prioritise the continued expansion of       roll-out of ART over introduction of viral load monitoring, but to       encourage research and development of implementable viral load measurement       technology.
The two publications are officially approved WHO publications       and our work has been cited in WHO guidelines.
The 2008 WHO progress       report "Towards Universal access: Scaling up priority HIV/AIDS       interventions in the health sector" cites our publication from the       previous year as providing support for WHO's recommendations on scaling up       ART provision [e].
Furthermore, there were 11 references in total       to the wider work of the HIV Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics Group of the       Research Department of Infection &amp; Population Health in the key WHO       guideline "Antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection in adults and       adolescents.
Recommendations for a public health approach" [f].
Our model has also been used by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in       their assessment of CD4 investment options, and was influential in them       deciding to support development of a new point of care test.
A program       officer at the Foundation writes that: "I have used your modeling         analysis several times when we have been evaluating our options for CD4         investment.
The impact of the Zyomyx test is a critical component of our         decision making and we are constantly re-evaluating our decisions as we         move forward, so your results have been considered again and again"       [g].
