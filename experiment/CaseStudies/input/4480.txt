     Copies of the original research publication were disseminated directly to       a wide range of public, private and governmental organisations working       within the field of health and safety regulation.
At the same time, a       series of presentations was given to industry audiences via organisations       such as the British Safety Council and the Institution of Occupational       Safety and Health (IOSH) between 2009 and 2012, thereby enabling the       research findings to percolate through a wider policy and user-group       audience (Corroborating Sources 3 and 4).
This process of research       transfer was facilitated by a network of existing contacts that Almond had       cultivated with policy users and those in industry over a number of years.
These talks proved highly effective in getting the research across to a       large number of users who were then in a position to utilise the findings       as a means of underpinning attempts to redirect and inform public and       governmental policy-making discussions about health and safety regulation.
In addition, the research results were disseminated to a wider public       audience through coverage in a series of media articles (Corroborating         Sources 1 and 2).
The core impact of the research derives from its       problematising and reframing of the issue of media stories about health       and safety as `regulatory myths', something which has       facilitated a better understanding among a wide range of public and       private bodies of the social impacts of such coverage.
This understanding       has been utilised by IOSH in their submissions (Corroborating Sources 5         and 6) to the Young Review of Health and Safety (`Health and         Safety: Reducing the Burdens', 2010) as a basis for their criticisms       of the review process, and to strengthen their argument for a more       developed public engagement with health and safety regulation.
Their       advocacy of "better education, so that we have a `risk intelligent'         society in which people operate effectively and happily in a risk-based         system", draws upon the research as evidence to support this       conclusion, employing the notion of regulatory myths as a way of       characterising the scale and the damaging implications of the problem of       public misperception.
It was also utilised by the British Safety Council       in their submission to this process, again influencing their calls for an       evidence-led approach to regulation (Corroborating Source 4).
Additionally, Almond himself submitted the research to the Young Review       consultation process (Corroborating Source 7) in order to inform       the review.
As such, the research findings played a role in holding to       account and public scrutiny the Young Review's public policy-making       process.
Subsequent to this, the Government-commissioned L&#246;fstedt Review made some       key recommendations about the future of health and safety regulation.
This       report (Reclaiming health and safety for all, 2011) sought input       from various stakeholders on a range of issues concerning regulatory law       and practices, and regulation's public profile.
The research output was       cited by IOSH in their submission (Corroborating Source 8),       responding critically to a request for information about "examples         where health and safety regulations have led to unreasonable outcomes,         or to inappropriate litigation and compensation" It was also       utilised by the British Safety Council in responding to this process (Corroborating         Source 4).
Crucially, the research was cited by the L&#246;fstedt Review       itself in its discussion of the public perception of regulation, as "a         helpful discussion of this issue," which established the troubling       political and legitimatory effects of these cases (Corroborating Source         9), as well as underpinning arguments in favour of a reframing of       the public standing of safety regulation.
The importance of Almond's       research was cited by Professor L&#246;fstedt and others in public discussion       at the time of the review's publication (Corroborating Source 10).
The close and sustained nature of this engagement with a policy-making       process demonstrates the considerable significance of the impact       that the research has had via the conceptual reframing of the issue of       regulatory myths and the creation of an informed policy debate around       these issues.
In the best traditions of socio-legal scholarship, the       evidence it provides has scrutinised the public process of law- and       policy-making (in the form of the L&#246;fstedt Review), and held it       accountable to an informed evidence base and a broader range of interests       and insights.
The substantial scope of the impact produced can be       seen in its role in prompting a nascent reframing of wider debates about       health and safety regulation and the establishment of a more informed       understanding of risk issues.
The research was cited in a number of       popular media sources (Corroborating Sources 1 and 2), and was also       influential in informing and shaping some core elements of the British       Safety Council's organisational manifesto, relating to the promotion and       creation of sensible regulation (Corroborating Source 4).
