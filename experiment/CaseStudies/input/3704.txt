     The AC+erm research has achieved impact through its findings       (issues, solutions to adopt, and       strategic ERM framework), its participative methodology and its innovative       technology-enabled       dissemination strategy.
From 2007-2010 website visits tripled       annually indicating continued and       growing interest with direct links from major organisations indicating       endorsement of quality,       significance and use; the custom Google search engine of ERM       resources attracted 2500+       queries; the blog attracted 6000+ unique and 1600+ (27%) returning       visitors from 30+ countries       (Source 1).
The impact has been to change, influence and shape the         behaviour of practitioners         and academics in the following ways:             Influencing the development of policy, practice and service             provision: The United Nations         Secretariat's Archives and Records Management Service (ARMS), based in         New York, sets         policy for its eight duty stations and 30,000 staff.
ARMS' Chief notes         that AC+erm's global and         diverse operational scope "make it particularly valuable" to the         organisation's operational         environment.
"Bottom line, AC+erm           jump-started our strategic planning, we're using it now to           flesh out an ERM roadmap.
The research is evidence-based, trustworthy,           and gives the           stakeholder perspective we need.
Quite simply, an invaluable resource"         (Source 2).
Influencing methods, new ways of thinking and economic impact:         AC+erm led to a         different approach to decision-making and solution selection in the UN's         ARMS.
The proposed         solution for a system to support a high-level, short-term panel         investigating a politically         sensitive incident was upgraded, despite a significant cost increase,         after ARMS applied         AC+erm's proportionate, risk-based paradigm in its assessment         of the proposal (Source 2).
AC+erm enabled ARMS to "redefine the bottom line" and         determine that reputation.
Member         States' interests and long term access to records required the upgraded         solution.
Conversely,         the same paradigm resulted in ARMS' decision not to invest in a         digital preservation system for         records of a "high visibility", "historic" UN commission,         but instead to recommend "disposal of           the dataset on [its] closure" and preserve duplicates in         file-based applications/paper.
This         enabled ARMS "to realize cost avoidance to the organization in the           order of $300k."
The         proportionate approach was accepted because AC+erm's risk         management is "explicitly           positive and constructive (rather than just risk mitigation) [and]         supports strategic and           appropriate levels of resource allocation".
This validation of AC+erm         led to the issuance of         practical guidance for UN staff on ERM risk: https://archives.un.org         (Source 2).
Shaping continuing professional development in the records             management discipline:         AC+erm led to the UN ARMS Chief's three-month sabbatical at         Northumbria (2013) - the first         awarded by the UN in records management.
She extended her research         knowledge, evaluated         the new ERM strategic framework and is now implementing a phased         adoption in the         Secretariat.
The sabbatical programme is limited, competitive and         prestigious and aims to         expose staff to "state-of-the-art research and practices on issues on         the international agenda."
She used AC+erm outputs to develop a week-long development         programme in May 2013 for         UN staff in Bangkok: "Content, activities, even training techniques           drew heavily on the           vignettes, Cynefin synthesis, and Delphi studies.
Really great           response" (Source 2).
AC+erm         also led to practitioners engaging in research.
Elizabeth Lomas, then         Records Manager at the         Royal Household, applied to study a PhD full-time with McLeod because of         her interest in         AC+erm (Nov 2007).
Subsequently two of her 30 UK participants         in the doctoral study actively         discussed "the benefits they perceived would come out of ... [the]           AC+erm project and stated           that this had made them want to actively take part in their `own'           research" (Source 3).
Influencing CPD, education and research internationally and             reframing debates:         Academics in the UK, China, Canada, New Zealand and Scandinavia have         used AC+erm since         2011 to inform the content of modules and lectures for continuing         professional development         (CPD) with practitioners and for undergraduate/postgraduate students.
For example: "I've used           those particular key findings statements [the importance of taking           into account the people           dimension, and also the role played by records managers (i.e.
being           part of the problem)] as           scene setters, to establish why we need to talk about and investigate           these factors" (Source 4,         Respondent 5).
"[The final project report] is an excellent tool to           discuss the complexity of RM           environments in an effective and relatively simple way" (Source 4,         Respondent 2).
Benefits are         that "Students understand the interconnectedness of the three           perspectives [people,         processes, technology] and their future role as mediators between           often conflicting interests"         (Source 4, Respondent 2) and "the findings highlight the importance of         organizational and         human behavioural issues as challenges in implementing ERM systems         (Source 4,         Respondent 3).
"It is incredibly useful to be able to go beyond all           the anecdotal evidence that is           characteristic of records management" (Source 4, Respondent 5).
"The           findings informed me,           as a teacher, substantively; they changed the content of my teaching           of change management           in that more evidence-based data and examples were available"         (Source 4, Respondent 6).
AC+erm has "made a very important contribution to           scholarly research in the discipline through           its development of an 'electronic' Delphi Technique"; its "innovative           research methodology" has         been used annually since 2011 in two postgraduate research modules           "when preparing           students to approach their own research projects.
It has opened the           way to go beyond the           limitations of surveys and focus groups" (Source 4, Respondent 9).
The same (international)         respondent commented that the AC+erm research was "especially           important because so little           real research has been done within organisations about records           management" (Source 4,         Respondent 9).
AC+erm has also influenced a book co-authored by academics         in Canada and New Zealand         which "opens with a quotation from the Final Project Report"         (Source 5).
"The findings from           AC+erm influenced the book from the outset, i.e.
from the initial           proposal stage in mid-2012           (and influence has been ongoing).
Findings provided a solid foundation           for the development of           our ideas, and from the publisher's perspective I think were           instrumental in the proposal being           accepted &#8212; i.e.
they provided the necessary credibility and authority".
The book's focus "has           been strongly influenced by one of the most relevant findings of the           project, that is, the           centrality of `people issues'"; "key findings have provided a very           effective frame for [it]" (Source         5).
The key readership of the book will be LIM and records         management professionals as well         as students of this discipline.
The impact has reached information, records and archives         practitioners/academics globally, in a         range of organisations in different sectors &#8212; public, private,         international.
It is significant because it         is changing how a professional sector thinks and operates: "The fact           that these findings represent           empirical data from an international study provides the necessary           weight and authority to very           effectively influence ideas" (Source 4, Respondent 5).
