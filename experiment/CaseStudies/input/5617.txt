     Through extensive research into African film, combined with her founding,       organizing and curating of African film festivals over the past twelve       years, Dovey has developed a keen appreciation of the difficulties faced       by African filmmakers given Hollywood's dominance in the international       film market.
Dovey's academic and non-academic work is preoccupied with       how such an imbalance can be rectified and how African filmmakers might be       assisted in garnering wider audiences.
Dovey has sought to address these concerns primarily through founding and       curating two of the UK's leading African film festivals: the Cambridge       African film festival, the longest-running annual African film festival in       the UK, launched in 2002, and Film Africa in London, which has grown to be       the UK's largest annual celebration of African cinema and culture (1).
In       addition to co-founding Film Africa in 2008, Dovey acted as Co-Director       (with Namvula Rennie) and Film Programme Director in 2011 and 2012,       devoting six months each year to its planning, programming, and delivery       alongside her academic role at SOAS.
Her in-depth knowledge of filmmaking       across Africa enabled the design of a diverse programme that brought       African cinematic achievements to an international audience.
In 2011,       Dovey brought 51 African films and 10 African filmmakers to Film Africa;       in 2012, the programme expanded to include over 70 African films and 30       filmmakers, as well as education and arts workshops.
Through her contacts       in the film industry developed over a decade of work, Dovey secured       substantial funding as well as high-profile London venues for the       festival, such as the BFI Southbank and the Ritzy in Brixton.
Box office       figures reveal that audience numbers increased by 90%, from 2000 people in       2011 to 3800 in 2012.
Film Africa has garnered much media attention, with reports and reviews       in, for example, The Guardian (2), Time Out, Metro       and on CNN International (3, 4) and the BBC World Service; Dovey has been       interviewed, for example, on CNN, Radio 4, BBC London News (5) and BBC       Network Africa.
The festival has had extremely positive impacts on African filmmakers,       affording them significant international publicity and enabling them to       broker deals for mainstream distribution (e.g.
the films The Athlete       and Otelo Burning secured distribution thanks to the festival).
The winner of the festival's 2011 Silver Baobab Award for Best Short Film,       believes that the press attention attracted by the award led to her BAFTA       nomination, while the &#163;2,000 prize money allowed her to work on her next       script (6):     "It's the first time I got to take part in a real press junket.
In the         end it got me a spot on CNN and BBC World radio and I couldn't have         asked for more publicity and I think this helped considerably -         especially leading up to the BAFTA votes!"
South African director of the documentary Surfing Soweto, said       (7):     "I have travelled around the world extensively with my film       Surfing Soweto last year but I have to say my experience at Film Africa         was by far the best.
Lindiwe and Namvula really catered to our needs as         African filmmakers and had a really deep understanding of the problems         we face when we try and get our films distributed abroad.
The         discussions, workshops, presentations and networking opportunities were         really right on point and tackled these issues head on (...).
In actual         fact they also do seem to be paying off because my film will be screened         in the UK later in the year.
And this is in no small part thanks to the         contacts I made while there (...).
I honestly cannot speak more highly         of my experience in London."
Feedback from a Nigerian director, who participated in Film Africa 2012,       was equally positive (8):     "I went away from Film Africa 2012 with great hope and optimism for         African cinema, particularly the role Nigeria is destined to play in a         couple of years...
The festival gave my Maami the needed         exposure to new and old audiences of African cinema...
The results are         beginning to manifest as acquisition contacts are already showing         interest in my film.
I am happy I did not miss Film Africa 2012, which         has further inspired me and fuelled my desire to make greater films".
Dovey's work with Film Africa constitutes a significant contribution to       promoting African culture in the UK, thereby enhancing international       public awareness and engagement with African film.
Her path-breaking       research has greatly informed her conceptualisation of Film Africa,       shaping programmes that showcase the complexity of African film and       alternative narratives about Africa, by Africans.
