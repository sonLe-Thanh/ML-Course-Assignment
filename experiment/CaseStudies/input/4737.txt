     In Bali, the first cases of rabies in humans and dogs were reported in       2008.
The initial response of       local authorities to the emerging epidemic was a combination of mass dog       culling and low-coverage       (&lt;25%) canine vaccination.
The outbreak, however, was not controlled,       and rabies       spread quickly through the dog population, reaching all nine regencies of       the island by 2010.
In the       3 years between the beginning of the outbreak and June 2011, (the month       following completion of       the first island wide dog vaccination), 130 human deaths from rabies had       been reported and more       than 130,000 doses of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) &#8212; a course of       vaccination which is given       as a treatment &#8212; delivered to bite victims.
In total, these control       measures cost around US$17       million.
In 2009, the University of Glasgow research team was approached by the       World Society for the       Protection of Animals (WSPA), which had been supporting a local       non-government organisation       (NGO) called the Bali Animal Welfare Association (BAWA).
The aim was to       demonstrate the       feasibility of mass canine vaccination in Bali, by initiating a       small-scale, but high-coverage, pilot       vaccination programme between December 2009 and June 2010.a       Between 2010 and 2013, the       University of Glasgow team advised WSPA, BAWA and other NGOs, successfully       drawing upon       their research to:            Add significant scientific weight to the design of control strategies,         which was needed by         WSPA and BAWA to successfully lobby the local government to abandon         canine culling and         adopt mass vaccination as the official control policy       Influence the design, implementation and evaluation of measures to         direct island-wide         vaccination strategies, to control the spread of rabies and to reduce         the human death toll.
Achieving control of a rabies epidemic       The involvement of University of Glasgow researchers was key to developing       Balinese government       confidence and support for the Memorandum of Understanding between the       Governor of Bali and       BAWA in 2010, which ensured that the first island-wide mass canine       vaccination project would not       be de-railed by continued dog culling.b,c     `Glasgow's involvement provided credibility to the concept of mass         vaccination as being         sufficient for rabies control without the need to cull apparently         healthy dogs &#8212; such a concept         coming from animal welfarists alone would not necessarily have been         believed.'
&#8212; Scientific       Advisor, WSPA.b     In August 2010, WSPA invited Haydon, Townsend and Hampson to Bali to help       guide strategic       choices in planning Bali's first island-wide mass vaccination campaign       (which took place from       October 2010 to March 2011).
Townsend trained members of the Bali       provincial government and       BAWA in data collection, including mapping vaccination delivery points,       statistics and rabies       epidemiology; Townsend then worked with local government scientists to       analyse the data.
Using       data from the pilot vaccination campaign on Bali, the model was used to       define the parameters of a       successful campaign and address logistical questions raised by the       campaign funders (WSPA) and       operators (BAWA and local government staff) about a mass vaccination       strategy.
`Under severe pressure from the regional mayors and head of animal         husbandry [a Bali         government office] we really needed some scientific back up.
The Glasgow         team was exactly         what we needed...I believe we succeeded to run our program on time and         on budget because         we had Glasgow's experts to back us up.
It also gave us the courage to         continue with our plan         even under extreme stress.'
&#8212; Director, BAWA.d     In the first mass vaccination campaign, 249,429 dogs were vaccinated, a       coverage of 70% at the       village level.2 The result was a 70% decrease in the number of       human deaths (from 82 cases in       2010 to 24 cases in 2011) and a 75% reduction in the number of observed       canine rabies cases (36       cases per month in 2010 to about 7 cases per month in 2011).2       Convinced by these outcomes, the       Indonesian Directorate of Animal Health reached out to the Food and       Agriculture Organization       (FAO) of the United Nations for technical support with continued control       strategies.
The University       of Glasgow team described their findings in a report to the FAO.c       Mass vaccination significantly       reduced the number of canine rabies cases in villages where culling had       previously had no effect;       mass vaccination protected dogs in villages from re-infection for an       average of 6 months; and the       size of outbreaks in villages decreased with increasing vaccination       coverage within the village.
This       report concluded with recommendations for a second mass vaccination.c     `The contributions provided by Glasgow University through Dr.
Sunny         Townsend's consultancy         and subsequent collaboration with Dr. Townsend and Dr. Katie Hampson         have been integral to         the progress made in rapidly improving rabies control on Bali Island.'
&#8212; Chief Technical Advisor,       FAO Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD), Indonesia.e     A second mass vaccination campaign was conducted (June 2011 to August       2011), and the FAO       contracted the University of Glasgow team as consultants to analyse the       impact of this campaign.
The Bali model was thus used to provide recommendations for future rabies       control strategies in       Bali.f In February 2012, these scenarios were formally       presented by Townsend in discussions with       Indonesian Government officials in Jakarta, as well as provincial       government and campaign       implementers in Bali.
Subsequently, a third island-wide mass vaccination       campaign was conducted       (March 2012 to February 2013) followed by a fourth (April 2013 to June       2013); these were       organised with continued consultancy from the University of Glasgow team.e       Following the third       round of vaccination, the incidence of human rabies cases (deaths)       decreased by over 90%       compared with the incidence before mass canine vaccination started, in       late 2010.
As of July 2013,       Bali has gone 11 months without a human case of rabies.e     Contributing to advocacy       After the first mass vaccination campaign in Bali, the model was used to       evaluate the       epidemiological and economic consequences of a range of vaccination       scenarios in Bali.c,f Working       with researchers from the Royal Veterinary College (London) on a report       commissioned by WSPA,       the Glasgow team used the Bali model to predict the outcome for Bali under       different vaccination       control scenarios.g This was used to calculate the economic       costs of these outcomes over a 10-year       period.
Continued culling would lead to rabies becoming endemic, as it did       on the       neighbouring island of Flores following introduction of the disease in       1997.
Rabies eradication can       be achieved by vaccination strategies, and despite the costs involved       these save the estimated       US$4.25 million per year cost associated with providing rabies PEP       treatment if it were endemic.f       This helped WSPA develop a high profile evidence base for policy       formulation and advocacy both       within Bali and elsewhere.
`The predictive modeling provided by Glasgow was particularly         effective in convincing Bali local         government to continue with island-wide dog vaccination and the         importance of achieving even         coverage across all villages on the island.'
&#8212; Chief Technical       Advisor, FAO ECTAD, Indonesia.e     Aiding global control (Wise Monkey Portal)       While the Glasgow team was undertaking research in Bali, it also       collaborated with `Wise Monkey       Foundation' &#8212; a Seattle-based not-for-profit organisation &#8212; to produce the       Wise Monkey Portal.h       Established in 2012, Wise Monkey provides software support for NGOs and       government offices       that need ways to collect validated and structured data that are crucial       for the surveillance of rabies       and large-scale rabies control measures, such as mass vaccination       programmes.
The software       allows data to be entered (or viewed) in any location, allowing cases to       be detected and responded       to in real time and allowing impact to be monitored and sustained.
In 2012, Townsend and Hampson were instrumental in driving the structure       of this database and       trained members of the Nias provincial government in Indonesia and       government officers in       several municipalities in the Philippines (Sorsogon, Illocos Norte and       Manila) to use Wise Monkey       for data management.
In 2013, Hampson, Townsend and Haydon implemented       Wise Monkey as a       data management tool (recording rabies vaccinations, population, bite       cases, etc.)
supporting       rabies-control demonstration projects with the charity Global Alliance for       Rabies Control (GARC) in       the Indian city of Jamshedpur, and likewise with GARC and Philippines       government in Bohol       province and Region VI (Western Visayas).h
