     (a) Changing health service commissioning:     Durham research had a significant impact on the decisions of the PCT in       designing, commissioning, managing, adapting  &#8212;  and ultimately       de-commissioning  &#8212;  a County Durham wide case management service for IB       patients [source 10].
In response to our initial research findings (about       recruitment and referrals), the PCT `adapted the service specification'       so that a financial incentive could be given to GPs to increase patient       referrals.
Our interim findings (around mental health) `underpinned our         [PCT] subsequent decision to change the service specification' so       that the commissioned service would have to prioritise those with mental       health conditions in their recruitment and thereby `increase patient         uptake and the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the service'       [source 10].
Our final research findings (about limited effectiveness       [research 1 and 2]) `were critical to our [PCT] decision not to         re-commission or roll-out the service at the end of the contract in         2012' [source 10].
This service affected 400 individual benefit       recipients across County Durham.
The PCT had intended to roll the service       out to 2000 additional benefit recipients if it had been shown to be more       effective     (b) Influencing NHS funding policy by generating Parliamentary debate:       Durham's research [research 4] into the Secretary of State for Health's       suggestion that the role of age in NHS funding allocations should be       increased and the role of deprivation decreased (`age-based'       allocation)[source 1], provoked a national political debate about the       allocation of NHS resources in May 2012.
There was widespread regional and       national media dissemination of our research including interviews with ITV       and BBC 1 regional news, national BBC Radio Five Live, significant Twitter       traffic (including tweets by Members of Parliament [MPs]) as well as       detailed coverage in the Guardian [source 2] and Independent       newspapers [source 3].
The newspaper reports included comments from the       Shadow Secretary of State for Health (Andy Burnham) and the Department of       Health on Durham's research [research 4].
Our research was also press       released by Labour Party Shadow Health team [source 11].
This prompted a       series of questions in the House of Commons by the Labour MPs Paul       Blomfield, Nicholas Brown, and Chi Onwurah to the Conservative Secretary       of State for Health (Andrew Lansley) and Minister of State for Health       (Simon Burns) in `Health Questions' [source 4].
The subsequent formula       devised by ACRA (which would have removed the health inequalities element       in NHS funding) was rejected in December 2012 by the NHS Commissioning       Board and a new (and on-going as of November 2013) `fundamental' review of       the allocation formula commissioned instead [source 5].
Media reports by       the Health Service Journal [source 5] suggested this decision may       have been as a result of political concerns  &#8212;  to which our research       contributed [source 4]  &#8212;  about the resulting geographical funding shifts.
The Chair of the NHS Commissioning Board stated the decision was from       concern for preventing the movement of "resources from areas where         people sadly have worse health outcomes to those where people have much         better outcomes" [source 5]  &#8212;  as demonstrated by our research       [research 4].
(c) Contributing to the development of the new public health system in         England (as part of the Marmot Review): The coalition       Government's 2011 White Paper Healthy Lives, Healthy People set       out a new public health system for England which included the transfer of       public health responsibilities from the NHS to local authorities, the       establishment of Health and Wellbeing Boards and the creation of a new       organisation  &#8212;  Public Health England [source 6].
In 2012, the government       created the 2013-16 Public Health Outcomes Framework  &#8212;  a set of       indicators to monitor the new system [source 7].
The White Paper [source       6] and the Outcomes Framework [source 7] were both based on the Department       of Health commissioned Marmot Review [source 8].
For example, the       White Paper states that: "This White Paper is the Government's         response to Fair Society, Healthy Lives  &#8212;  the Marmot Review" [source       6, p.32)] and the Public Health Outcomes Framework document states that: "These         indicators are in line with those recommended by Sir Michael Marmot in         his report Fair Society, Healthy Lives in 2010" [source 7, p.12].
The Marmot Review therefore had a significant impact on the       development of national public health policy and was itself based on nine       commissioned research reviews.
The task group section of the Marmot         Review website clearly states the importance of the task groups'       work [source 9]: "In February 2010, we published the Marmot Review  &#8212;          'Fair Society Healthy Lives.
This was based, in large part, on         commissioned task group reports in several key areas".
Durham led       the research and Delphi review for one of these Task Groups  &#8212;  Task Group Priority         Public Health Conditions [research 5 and 6].
Five of the fifteen       evidence based policy recommendations resulting from this Durham-led work       were used in the final Marmot Review underpinning four of the       report's twenty recommendations and our underpinning research [research 5       and 6] was cited extensively in support (source 8, pages 45, 54, 57, 59,       141, 143-46, 157).
Our recommendation 10 `increase use of contingency       management within drug treatment programs' became the Marmot Review's       Policy Recommendation F2.2(i) [source 8, page 143].
Our recommendation 1       `reduce smoking in the most hard to reach groups by focusing on price and       availability, while providing stop smoking services to help the poorest       groups quit' and recommendation 4 `introduce of a minimum price per unit       for alcohol' became the Marmot Review's Policy Recommendation F2.2(ii)       [source 8; page 144-145].
Our recommendation 2 `improve availability of       and access to healthier food choices amongst low income groups' became the       Marmot Review's Policy Recommendation F2.2(iii) [source 8; page 145-146].
Our recommendation number 15  &#8212;  `implement a minimum income for healthy       living in older people' became the Marmot Review's Policy Recommendation       D2.1 [source 8, page 120].
Durham-led research [research 5 and 6] is       therefore a key part of the evidence base that underpinned the Marmot         Review [source 8], which itself was cited as the underpinning       evidence behind national-wide (England) policy changes as outlined in the       2011 White Paper Healthy Lives, Healthy People [source 6] and the       Public Health Outcomes Framework [source 7].
