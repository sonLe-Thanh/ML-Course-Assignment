     The research summarised in Section 2 has had substantial impact on: i) society         and culture, through public engagement with live science in         action, where beneficiaries have included ~250,000 public visitors       each year since the opening of Living Links in 2008; ii) practitioners         in secondary school science education, where the users and       beneficiaries have been teachers and school children; and iii)         commercial income through enhanced Zoo ticket sales.
i) Impact on society and culture Multiple strands of       engagement based on the research have been built up since 2008: these       include the public being encouraged to view all research done in         Living Links live, over the shoulders of the scientists, through       this and other activities thus learning about both our scientific       discoveries including those outlined in Section 2, and the scientific       methods used to obtain them; involvement of parents and teachers in         comparative child research; a central Science Exploration Zone       including numerous hands-on electronic and physical activities; public         talks and discussions in the Budongo Trail lecture theatre (e.g.,       `Living Links to Human Health, Mind and Medicine', 2011; `Twenty-first       Century research associated with twenty-first Century zoos', 2012;       supporting evidence S6); and displays and murals.
For       example, one interactive challenge that visitors are invited to engage       with includes the `panpipes' foraging tasks that require tool use for       their solution and replicate those used in the original chimpanzee         research (Whiten et al., Nature 2005, listed in Section 3).
Each task is accompanied by video showing chimps using their local       cultural technique; visitors are invited to solve the task themselves to       gain an artificial grape (see photo).
They are then directed to a second       panpipes device where they see the alternative cultural approach, and       through this are led to understand more about both our scientific         methods and our scientific discoveries themselves.
Examples of other       activities directly based on research outlined in Sections 2/3 include       hands-on displays and video clips illustrating Zuberb&#252;hlers' research on       primates' referential vocalisations.
Together, over 20 such elements       constitute a substantial legacy resource of cultural artefacts         supporting public and high-school engagement with science.
Evidence of significance and breadth of impact:     a) Scale of visits Samples of direct counts of       Living Links visitors together with calibrated broken-beam automatic entry       counters, in conjunction with known Zoo entry gate numbers, allowed       calculation that approximately 40% of visitors to the Zoo visit Living       Links, thus amounting to approximately ~250,000 per year, or over       1.5 million since 2008 (S1).
b) Sustained funding Funding agencies have       expressed confidence in our impact by awarding a series of public       engagement grants, supporting a full-time Public Engagement Officer       (2009-2013).
A Scottish Government engagement grant (S7) was       followed by two from the Wellcome Trust (S8), the       second necessarily awarded only on the basis of the Trust's judgment         that our public engagement work has had the impacts it was designed to         have.
One of the public engagement exhibits (`My Primate Family       Tree': see photo) was inaugurated by Prof. Anne Glover, Chief Scientific       Adviser to the Scottish Government at the time and now Chief Scientific       Adviser to the EU Presidency, indexing continued governmental support for       Living Links.
c) Direct evaluation of engagement The Public       Engagement Officer's quantitative data (S2) demonstrated that visitors         engaged with the materials in Living Links longer as more activities         have been incorporated during the REF period, and were engaged         the longest when active viewable research work was underway.
Unusually for these kinds of data, the quality of the exercise was such       that results were published in a well-respected, peer-reviewed journal       (Bowler MT, Buchanan-Smith HM and Whiten A.
(2012).
Assessing public       engagement with science in a university primate research centre in a       national zoo.
PLoS One 7, e34505).
For periods when the active research is       not underway, video streams of research demonstrations are projected in       the research rooms.
ii) Impact on practitioners in secondary school science education       Under the sponsorship of a Wellcome Trust public engagement grant (S8)       the Public Engagement Officer has created a series of teacher packs       and made them available in 2012-2013 to secondary school teachers of         Scottish Highers in Biology (Highers recently came to include       primatology and animal behaviour) via the Living Links website, Living       Links YouTube channel, and Times Higher Education Supplement websites.
Three of the four teacher packs build directly upon the research described       in Section 2; for example, the pack on `Primate communication' draws         directly on the chimpanzee vocal playback experiments described above       (Slocombe and Zuberb&#252;hler 2005, listed in Section 3), guiding students to       understand the underlying principles of the science and learn about         primate cognition.
The `Measuring behaviour' and `Working         with scientific literature' packs each include video clips made at       Living Links for teachers to use in classes and a powerpoint presentation       about the topic concerned.
A teacher described the packs as `highly         engaging, relevant and current', and stated that `teachers and         pupils will be greatly enthused' (S3).
Evidence of significance and breadth of impact:     a) Teacher pack downloads Providing a direct measure         of change in practice of teachers, data from the Living Links       website, the Living Links YouTube channel and the Times Higher Education       Supplement website record over 2,600 views and over 1,500         downloads of the packs to the end of July, 2013 (S4).
Downloads have reached beyond Scotland to many countries (e.g.
18%       USA).
Thus, these materials are being adopted by a substantial and         diverse group of practitioners.
The Living Links YouTube Channel has       139 subscribers and 109,166 views (31/07/2013), and the total views of the       primate education resources are 29,550 (combined Youtube and Vimeo to       31/7/13) (S4).
Living Links also has a Twitter account for       disseminating research and advertising events.
b) Teacher and class visits Complementing this outreach, approximately         3,700 students per year take part in organised educational activities         involving Living Links (S4).
In collaboration with the RZSS       Education team, the Public Engagement Officer also conducts summer         science schools, which have attracted ~50 children per year       (2008-present) (S4).
In 2012, a one-day Global Classroom         conference for secondary school students, which included a       chimpanzee communication workshop, attracted 220 students from 13       secondary schools, and a similar event in 2013 attracted 240 students (S4).
Adult students have engaged with the research presented at Living Links       via the RZSS adult class (72 students in 2012) and visits from the       University of the Third Age (77 participants in 2013) (S4).
Living       Links is involved in the Zoo's Continued Professional Development events       for science teachers, which attracted 23 science teachers from 15 schools       across Scotland in 2013 (S4).
iii) Impact on commercial income benefits More people       (661,763) visited the Zoo in the year that Living Links opened (2008) than       in the previous year (607,763; 2007), equalling an increased gate         intake of approximately &#163;750,000 at present prices (S5).
The       CEO stated that the RZSS `has benefitted enormously from the Public         Engagement achievements of University of St Andrews researchers',       that `Living Links is one of the most popular and educational of the         exhibits in the Zoo' and that the `exceptionally high quality of         the Public Engagement in Living Links has inspired our own Education         Department to emulate and build upon these achievements' (S5).
