     Elster Metering have been producing rotating piston meters incorporating       compounds developed with Professor Tarverdi's support since 2003.
During       this time approximately 32 million meters have been produced incorporating       these results that have an excellent track record of successful operation.
Of these 16 million were produced since 2008.
Elster report that the research supporting the replacement of a       hermetically sealed glass lens with a polymer version has been very useful       in establishing a long term vision for their product development.
In       particular, meters incorporating this feature are now being manufactured       in the Far East and Elster are currently considering incorporating this       feature into meters manufactured in the UK.
The research identifying the acetal polymer as a factor in the reduction       of degradation in the bodies of water meters has had a significant impact.
Elster used the results to decide to accelerate the brass to polymer       change-out program and to revise the compound choice for meters       manufactured for use in Europe and the Middle East.
The research was also       used to revise the network application guidelines for their customer's       installers.
Elster report that Brunel research enabled them to "maintain a       strongly competitive position from our UK manufacturing base based on       lower costs, reduced embodied CO2 and reduced theft risks       compared with the equivalent brass meter".
The findings from this research were incorporated in the wide scale roll       out of polymer water meter bodies in a range of demanding applications,       including approximately 1.2 million units in the UK, 500 thousand in       northern Europe and 100 thousand in the Middle East.
In the Middle East,       the problem of degradation is much more acute, and therefore the benefits       of this development are much more significant.
