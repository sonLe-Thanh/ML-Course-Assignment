     The project's rationale was, firstly, that the best and most gripping       contemporary philosophical puzzles require no prior knowledge of       philosophy (if explained clearly and concisely enough); secondly, that       there is a growing demand for academic podcasts among laypersons, with the       internet providing a user-friendly and easily-accessed platform for       distribution.
`Lotteries' and `Lotteries II' Podcast Episodes     In `Lotteries' and `Lotteries II', the lottery puzzle was presented in       the form of a dilemma: can you know that your lottery ticket has lost,       after the draw but prior to the announcement?
If you can, then it is hard       to explain why you bought it in the first place, why you are unwilling to       sell it for 1p, or why it's improper for you to assert `I know my ticket       has lost'.
If you cannot, then any explanation of this knowledge failure       seems to generalize to many other propositions that you ordinarily think       you do know, e.g.
that your car is now parked where you left it, or that       you will go to work tomorrow.
The podcast considers some of the standard       responses to this puzzle and outlines their advantages and the problems       that beset them.
The debate on issues raised by Dodd's 2012 paper is       traced in some detail.

`Faultless Disagreement' Podcast Episode     In `Faultless Disagreement', the debate over whether and how faultless       disagreement ought to be accommodated is presented.
The driving question       of this debate is: is it possible for two people to genuinely disagree       about some gustatory, aesthetic, or moral matter without either party       being somehow mistaken?
The podcast considers the contextualist, realist       and relativist replies, and explains the limits of these responses       observed in the current literature.
Work on this episode began in early       November 2011, with weekly Relativism and Rational Tolerance       project seminars providing a fertile backdrop.

And a *heap* of fun to listen to and       consider!'
`Your show is what I was looking for.
I have a passion for Philosophy and       for puzzles like the ones you talk about.
I don't have much free time, so       I'm glad your podcasts are short.'
`I have very little knowledge of contemporary philosophy - the podcasts       have been very good at laying out the information in a way I can       understand and remaining interesting.'
`Thank you for the great podcast!'
`Keep up the good work!'
`Good stuff!'
