     The research trial described in Section 2 led to the World Health       Organisation (WHO) carrying out further studies across sub-Saharan Africa       which confirmed the results, demonstrating that using insecticide-treated       nets (ITNs) resulted in a 20% fall in mortality in children under five       years old [7].
Today treated nets are the major tool used for reducing       malaria in Africa and many parts of the tropics [8].
They are cheap and       cost only US$1.39 per person per year of protection (www.rbm.who.int/keyfacts.html,       accessed 25th April 2013).
It is estimated that 294 million       nets were purchased for malaria control between 2008 and 2010, enough to       cover 73% of the 800 million people living at risk of malaria [8].
As a       consequence the percentage of households with at least one ITN in       sub-Saharan Africa has risen from 3% in 2000 to 53% in 2012 [9].
It is       estimated that the massive roll-out of ITNs and, to a lesser extent,       indoor residual spraying, has saved 1.1 million lives [9].
Over the last 10 years Lindsay's teams carried out 3 of the 4 major       recent trials of microbial larvicides in Africa: in Kenya[3],       Tanzania[10] and The Gambia [11].
The results from this trial       provided WHO with much needed information on the protective efficacy of       this intervention and led to larval source management being recognised by       WHO in an `Interim Position Statement on the role of larviciding for       malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa' that references this work [12].
For       the first time Larval Source Management was included in the World Malaria       Report in 2012, which is a statement of support for this intervention.
In recent years the interest in larval control for malaria control has       grown and there are presently 27 malaria endemic countries using larval       control for malaria control, including 9 in Africa, 5 in the Americas, 3       in the Eastern Mediterranean, 6 in Europe, 2 in South-East Asia and 2 in       the Western Pacific [9].
Since these countries look to WHO for advice on       malaria control, the work done by Lindsay and colleagues has significantly       influenced the uptake of this intervention, providing the evidence that       larval control is an effective intervention against malaria.
Lindsay is presently the Chair of the Larval Source Management workstream       for the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, a global framework for coordinated       action against malaria that informs international policy.
This workstream       provides the technical support for WHO and national malaria control       managers around the world by providing the evidence required for decision       making.
Lindsay and his team, supported by WHO, have (1) carried out the       analysis and written the Cochrane review on Larval Source Management       [1], which provides the evidence that this intervention is       protective and (2) led and written the WHO manual on larval source       management that shows national control managers how to implement this       intervention[13].
Thus the work of this team has contributed       to larval source management being supported by WHO and have provided       material that assists national malaria control programme managers around       the world.
The team also demonstrated for the first time that Musca sorbens,       the face fly of humans, transmits trachoma, the second cause of       preventative blindness in the world.
This is recognised by WHO (http://www.who.int/topics/trachoma/en/)       and the International Coalition for Trachoma Control       (http://www.trachomacoalition.org/about-trachoma/transmission-routes).
The       Carter Center had planned to construct 10,000 latrines in rural Ethiopia       to improve sanitation by reducing face fly breeding in surface faeces.
The       program was so successful more than 90,000 latrines were ultimately       constructed.
This activity was directly related to our demonstration that       face flies transmit trachoma (http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc2198.html).
Latrines reduce fly numbers because these flies do not enter latrines to       breed.
Because of Prof Lindsay's expertise in the development of new tools for       vector control he has been invited to participate and chair several       meetings helping to shape WHO's policy on IVM and contributed to the       'Report of the WHO consultation on integrated vector management (IVM)'       [14] and `Development of a global action plan for integrated vector       management (IVM) Report of a WHO Consultation' [15] which led to WHO       adopting this policy [16] and producing a handbook on IVM [17] which       references some of his team's research.
He also provides support to the       Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, advising on funding vector control       research and has recently joined WHO's Vector Control Advisory Group       (VCAG) on New Tools.
His work on health and development also influences       policy at the highest international level and his work [1] is referenced       repeatedly in the recent policy document produced by Roll Back       Malaria/UNDP entitled `Multisectoral Action Framework for Malaria' [18]       which represents a new approach to global malaria control.
