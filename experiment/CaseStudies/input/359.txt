     The health impacts of our research have been improvements in genetic       counselling, genetic testing and bowel cancer prevention in familial       colorectal cancer.
These impacts have been international, bringing       benefits to patients and families affected by or at risk of familial       colorectal cancer.
Bowel cancer screening services have benefited through       more efficient targeting of colonoscopic screening to patients at very       high risk.
The commercial impact has been through increased economic       activity in genetic diagnostic services internationally.
In addition       Cardiff University has benefited through associated licence and royalty       income.
By showing for the first time that predisposition to colorectal cancer       could be transmitted as a recessive trait (MUTYH-associated polyposis,       MAP) our findings impacted directly upon genetic counselling for familial       colorectal cancer and the investigation and treatment of affected patients       and their families.
By identifying the causative MUTYH mutations for this       recessive disorder and methods for their detection our research resulted       in diagnostic and predictive genetic tests for MAP.
These tests have       enabled both definitive diagnosis for patients affected by MAP and bowel       cancer prevention for members of their families.
Specifically,       asymptomatic family members who test positive for MAP have an       approximately 80% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (Lubbe et al.
J Clin       Oncol 2009 vol.
27 no.
24 3975-3980) but this risk can now be averted by       prophylactic polypectomy and/or colectomy.
By contrast, family members       who, upon gene testing are at low risk can be reassured.
Since 2008 over       1500 individuals have had diagnostic or predictive tests of MUTYH gene       status in the NHS to guide clinical and genetic management5.1.
Across Europe the tests have been adopted progressively throughout the       assessment period and they are now provided by at least 84 state and       private sector diagnostic laboratories that are listed at Orphanet5.2.
MUTYH gene testing is also carried out by at least three centres in       Australasia.5.3     In North America, we protected our intellectual property on       MAP-associated MUTYH mutations and methods for their detection       through US patents 7,393,940 and 7,405,283 that were granted on 01.07.2008       and 29.07.2008 respectively.
With assistance from the Wales Gene Park at       Cardiff University we licenced this intellectual property to Myriad       Genetics Inc.
Between 2008 and 2011 Myriad undertook over 11,000 MUTYH       tests in North America, generating a gross income of $1,381,427 for MUTYH       testing alone and a further $3,485,574 through the Colaris AP test of the       MUTYH and APC genes together5.4.
Cardiff University has       received &#163;331,947 in royalties and licence fees.
The changes in clinical genetic, bowel screening and treatment practice       consequent on our research have been incorporated into guidelines for the       investigation and management of familial colorectal cancer published by       specialist societies and expert groups in the UK (2010)5.5,       Europe (2008)5.6, North America (2008)5.7 and       Australasia (2011)5.8.
The work contributed to the award of a Queen's Anniversary Prize to       Cardiff University in February 2008.
