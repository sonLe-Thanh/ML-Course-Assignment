     Gurnah's research has brought about a reimagining of the British empire       and its subjects through his portrayal of a network of Indian Ocean       cultures that preceded and survived the colonial encounter.
His work has       had impact upon cultural providers, upon curricula and the visions of       educators, including those with policymaking capability, and upon reading       publics worldwide.
Collaborating with cultural providers     The reach and significance of Gurnah's research can be seen in       invitations from cultural providers addressing mass audiences to present       his research on the Indian Ocean, Islam, slavery, and migration in the UK       and abroad.
For example, Gurnah presented a highly successful programme in       the BBC Radio 4-British Museum series `The History of the World in 100       Objects' (16/12/2009), reported by the Museum's Director Neil MacGregor as       heard `by millions of people both in the UK and around the world'.
[5.1]       Gurnah was also invited by Independent columnist and presenter       Yasmin Alibhai-Brown to deliver a programme on slavery in Islam in the       series `Heart and Soul' on BBC Radio 4 (17/07/2009) (BBC 4 audiences are       10.8m), and by Joy Keys to appear on internet radio out of Atlanta,       Georgia (06/08/2011).
Gurnah's `The Father Instinct', exploring       postcolonial African creativity and fatherhood for BBC Radio 3's `Essay'       programme (27/04/2011) (BBC 3 audiences are 2m), presented by Lou Stein,       was so successful in audience response that it was chosen for Pick of the       Week on Radio 4.
[5.2] The success of these programmes led to an invitation       from RichMix, a UK arts and culture outreach organization, for Gurnah to       launch the third issue of `SCARF' magazine, speaking on immigration and       African-ness in the 21st century (22/05/2013) to an audience of       380.
[5.3] Concrete international reach is shown by a recent interview in       Nigeria in which Gurnah is described as `Zanzibar's most famous native       son'.
[5.3]     Changing educational content and influencing policy-minded educators         internationally     Although Gurnah downplays comparisons with the Nigerian writer Chinua       Achebe [5.3], his novel Paradise has begun to replace Achebe's Things         Fall Apart on postcolonial curricula, such as the Open University's       `Twentieth-Century Literature: Texts and Debates' module [5.4] and       Birmingham's postgraduate module `African Fiction and Its Critics'.
That       his work is changing the content of education in postcolonial studies       internationally is evidenced by his novel Paradise being taught in       Paris's Lyc&#233;e Balzac, English section, as part of their International       Baccalaureate.
[5.5] Further international reach is demonstrated by the       teaching of Paradise or Desertion in the USA at Oklahoma,       in San Francisco State's `Contemporary Culture' module (blog http://analepsis.org/2013/03/16/paradise-hum415/),       Northwestern's African Studies program, and Rhodes University's       `Transnational Literature' module.
In Africa his novels are taught in the       Congo, Zanzibar, and in South Africa at Cape Town and the University of       Stellenbosch (`The Immigrant Genre' module).
Gurnah's educational policy       advice has been solicited by educators and education ministers in       Zanzibar, including at a special conference at the National Library on the       reading and use of literary texts, attended by educational policymakers,       teachers and school children, and then televised in full on Zanzibar's       Star TV (14/04/2011).
[5.6]     Because Gurnah has significantly led a paradigmatic shift in       understandings of post-empire geography and history, in which `Indian       Ocean Imaginaries' have been made newly visible, his work serves as the       central reference point in the major German research project, with policy       applications beyond the academy, the Goethe University's `Africa's Asian       Options: Frankfurt Inter- Centre Programme on New African-Asian       Interactions' (AFRASO).
The project is intended to set the agenda for `the       reconceptualization of Area Studies in a globalised world' and for `policy       advice with regard to Germany's interactions with Africa.'
It has been       specifically funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and       Research (BMBF) because of its public outreach and relevance to policy       design; these are preconditions for all BMBF funding.
The project started       in February 2013 with an overall sum of &#8364;3.9m.
Aimed at analysing       `transnational, transcultural and transregional dynamics' in order to       `provide policy advice with regard to German-African relations in an       increasingly multipolar world', it promises significant post-REF impacts.
Gurnah, who was first invited to read at the Goethe University 15/05/2004,       and gave a keynote and reading 22- 25/02/2011, has been `of prime       importance in the formulation of [the] research programme and continues to       be a major focus of [the project's] ongoing research' because social and       cultural transformations are taken to be central to a full assessment of       these relations.
By the Sea, for example, provides an `invaluable       perspective' for `targeting Africa's role in a multipolar world' because       of its `dual focus on African migration to Europe and Arab migration to       Africa' and `"decentred" vision of an Indian Ocean World that has for       centuries produced intricate (and often conflicting) interactions' with       `the legacies of Europe's colonial past'.
The `research design of the       AFRASO project' is thus a direct `impact of Prof. Gurnah's fictional and       academic work'.
[5.7] Gurnah has changed the content of what is understood,       taught, and used to formulate policy on the part of educators and       policy-minded researchers as well as students.
Enriching the understandings of reading publics worldwide     Gurnah receives many unsolicited testimonials in the blogosphere; for       example, `Melissa' reported on goodreads how her understanding of the       world changed after reading Desertion: the novel `gave me another       view of the world, different from the European one; and it made me rethink       concepts and things that we western people think as common and usual but       may not be usual and common to other cultures'.
[5.8] Gurnah's       international reach is also shown by his work appearing in translation in       11 languages, including Turkish and Bahasa-Indonesian, and by frequent       invitations to give readings, lectures, and interviews to widely mixed       audiences at international literary festivals; for example in Paris (Mus&#233;e       Quai Branly [19/11/2011]),[5.5] Palestine (PalFestival of Literature       [22-29/05/2009]), and the Congo (Etonnants-Voyageurs in Brazzaville, the       Congo Republic [13-17/02/2013]).
[5.8] At Brazzaville, Gurnah participated       in what the Independent reported as `high-quality debates that       forged a rare bridge between literary stars of the English-speaking       continent (such as Helon Habila, Andre Brink and Abdulrazak Gurnah) and       their Francophone peers'.
[5.8] His global significance is shown by his       being selected to present at one of the world's largest literary       festivals, the Melbourne Writers Festival, Australia (25-29/08/2011),       delivering a 1-hour event `In Conversation' as well as panel discussions       to audiences of 250.
At the another of the world's largest, the Brisbane       Writers Festival, Australia (07-11/09/2011), Gurnah was interviewed by       Australian Broadcasting Corporation's `The Book Show' (08/09/2011;       broadcast on 23/09/2011); he presented another 1-hour event, also entitled       `In Conversation', which was filmed by ABC TV [5.8].
The impacts of Gurnah's research are demonstrably international in that       his novels have affected and influenced the views of cultural providers,       educators, festival audiences, and reading publics in the UK and abroad.
His work's significance can be measured by its changing of the       postcolonial curriculum in the UK, USA, Europe, Africa, and beyond.
Gurnah's work has provoked reconsiderations of the legacies of empire, and       informed and enriched people's cultural understanding of difference,       diversity, and Indian Ocean and Muslim imaginaries on a global scale.
