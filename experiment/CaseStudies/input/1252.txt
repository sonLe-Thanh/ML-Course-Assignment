     The Bible Society, whose founders included William Wilberforce, was       established in 1804 with the       aim of providing wider circulation of the Bible.
Today it is a global       organisation with over 140       international Bible Societies.
It is a non-denominational organisation       which seeks to promote       understanding of the Bible not only in churches but also in the arts,       education, media, and politics.
It is therefore an obvious public engagement partner for the Department of       Biblical Studies (see       REF3a).
Since spring 2010, the Department has been collaborating with the Bible       Society and its Dean of       Studies.
After initial and ongoing collaboration on dissertation awards       for undergraduates, it was       clear that this partnership could be developed as part of the departmental       research strategy, with       the Bible Society providing national and international networks for       dissemination and impact (see       below) of research carried out at Sheffield.
The issue of Jesus'       `Jewishness' was deemed to be       particularly pressing for contemporary churches as high-profile scholarly       debates had failed to       make any significant impact among church audiences.
This issue has been       highlighted by Jewish       scholars working in Jewish-Christian relations (e.g.
A.J.
Levine, The         Misunderstood Jew: The         Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus [2006]), so it was deemed       to be of some urgency to       get contemporary research on Jesus and his Jewish context directly through       to a lay church       audience.
In addition, the Bible Society's own investigation has shown       that there was a perception       that church leaders might be `protecting' congregations from latest       developments in scholarship       when in fact their study `has shown us that most of the time the church         probably underestimates         the openness and capacity of its people to learn and thrive on new (to         them) approaches' [S1].
This collaboration meant that research at Sheffield could directly       influence the ideas about Jesus       and Judaism held by lay audiences so that they in turn could analyse and       discuss the religious and       ethnic identity of the `founder' of the Christian faith.
The ongoing collaboration between the Department of Biblical Studies and       the Bible Society       provided an ideal opportunity to address this issue, initially in English       and Welsh churches.
Biblical       Studies at Sheffield was able to provide leading research on the       historical, political and ideological       interpretation of scholarship and biblical texts whilst the Bible Society       has extensive networks       outside academia, both nationally and internationally through its       connections with church groups       and international membership in over 140 international societies.
In 2011       Crossley and agreed to       collaborate on a booklet called Jesus the Jew.
The collaboration       initially involved the Dean of       Studies at the Bible Society reading through Crossley's main monographs       and articles on the       historical Jesus in his first-century cultural contexts as well as his       published research on       contemporary scholarship and its uses of terms such as `Jew',       `Jewishness', `Judaism' and so on.
Crossley and the Dean co-wrote and completed Jesus the Jew in       August 2012 which was explicitly       designed for lay audiences with little, if any, knowledge of academic       research.
Not every issue       raised in Crossley's research could be covered, and so the Dean and his       colleagues in the Bible       Society identified those areas of most relevance and interest for lay       church groups.
Three main       aims developed from Crossley's research were outlined at the beginning of       the booklet:            to understand Jesus as a historical figure in the context of         first-century Judaism       to provide assistance in interpretation of both the Gospels and         ancient Jewish texts       to avoid problematic stereotypes, whether from the Gospels or from         contemporary contexts,         particularly where they have led to Christian anti-Semitism          To achieve these aims, six topics were taken directly from Crossley's       research, including:            An overview of Jewish history, groups and literature       Jesus and the Law, with a case study on divorce       Jesus and the Law, with a case study on wealth       Jesus and prayer, with a case study on the `Lord's Prayer'       How Jesus' teachings might have been perceived by other Jewish groups       How Jesus might have perceived his own views in relation to other         Jewish groups          Within each of these six topics a series of questions were raised       relating to the ways in which the       participants viewed given Gospel passages in light of Jewish materials.
The range and reach of the booklet was both national and international.
The Bible Society's       networks made Jesus the Jew available to 19,000 clergy in England       and Wales for use in       discussion groups for the laity (10-15 participants would be deemed       typical).
To provide access       beyond church groups in England and Wales, the booklet was made available       on the website of       the Bible Society for &#163;3 to national and international audiences.
By July       2013, over 2000 copies       had been sold.
In terms of changing perceptions, the Dean reflected on the       collaboration and the       publication of Jesus the Jew, by pointing out that `making         accessible the research of James         Crossley and others on the Jewishness of Jesus and the way that his own         culture illuminates a         more accurate and incisive understanding of Jesus' teaching and         identity...The church in the west         is under the temptation to read Jesus inaccurately because we tend to         see him through our cultural         lens.
The detailed work of scholars, like James, provides the material         to counter this effectively'       [S1].
In order to assess changing perceptions further, the views of church       educationalists and a       discussion leader were sought.
The Canon theologian of Birmingham and       Guilford cathedrals (also       preacher at Canterbury Cathedral, member of the General Synod, and       Vice-President of the Bible       Society) claimed of the booklet that `This valuable course will help         Bible study groups to enter the         world of Jesus the Jew and by doing so to see the gospels with fresh         eyes.'
A Baptist minister and       former principal of London Bible College, claimed that 'This guide         will lead us into understanding         Jesus in his original setting.
It does so competently, clearly and         creatively and is a gift for any         group who wants to really understand Jesus.'
[S8]     A specific test case was focused on the use of the booklet by an       experienced group discussion       leader and curate of St Michael le Belfrey, York [S4], whose discussion       groups average around 15       participants.
To get a greater indication of changing perceptions,       feedback questions including the       following were asked: `On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is poor and 5 is       excellent, how did this booklet       help your understanding of Jesus in relation to his Jewish context?'
The       group leader assessed       this as 5.
A further question was asked requiring written feedback in       relation to reassessing Jesus       in relation to Jewish legal and scriptural sources raised in the booklet.
The response to this was       that the booklet helps groups to `understand Jesus' words and deeds in         a fresh way' and that it       particularly aids the `study of the scriptures by looking at Jesus in         his own context' and facilitates       `an encounter with Jesus...for today'.
Further evidence of the significance of the impact of Crossley's research       on the Jewishness of       Jesus comes from the departmental blog 'Sheffield Biblical Studies', where       the material was also       published.
Between 2010 and 2013, as the collaboration over the booklet       was developing and       being completed, the Jewishness of Jesus was one of the most popular       topics on the blog,       attracting over 1000 visitors, with most of the audience coming from North       America.
The       conclusions made by Crossley on one blog post were also used by Zev Garber       in his Op-Ed for the       popular American website, Bible and Interpretation [S6,S7]       (approximately 600,000 hits per month       and 1700 unique visitors daily) as an example of ways in which       preconceptions have successfully       been challenged.
Garber claimed the post was an `insightful essay' and       that the overview of key       works `suggest a rejection of Jewish stereotypes and a proper depiction         of Judaism in the molding         of the scriptural Jesus' (November 2011).
