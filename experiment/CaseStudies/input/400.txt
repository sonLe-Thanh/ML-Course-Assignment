     While lean as a concept has become embedded within the field of logistics       and operations management on a worldwide scale, LERC's research provided       evidence that in many instances, approaches to lean change were inherently       unsustainable and failed to deliver long-term competitive benefits.
This       insight has influenced the way in which organisations approach lean       change, leading to a much higher return on investment.
Since the first       publication of Staying Lean in 2008, CBS research has directly       enabled over 200 organisations to embark on a sustainable lean       transformation strategy.
A key aspect of this impact strategy has been the       delivery of both structured training via the Lean Competency         System (LCS), a set of professional vocational qualifications which       focus upon all areas of the Lean Iceberg Model, and tailored lean         solutions via Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs).
Lean Competency System (LCS) &#8212; The LCS comprises three main levels       &#8212; Fundamental, Technical and Strategic, each with two or three sublevels,       making a total of seven levels in all.
The level of lean competence       achieved by trained staff varies according to the level of accreditation       attained, from a simple awareness and understanding of lean principles       (Level 1a), up to an advanced ability to design, implement and lead a lean       strategy (Level 3b).
Similarly, the method of assessment varies by level       but includes both a knowledge based test and a practical element.
This LCS       system has been used by over 30 organisations since its launch in 2008 and       has been integrated into many organisational `lean academies', including       Lloyds Banking Group, Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs, Virgin Media       Group, Diageo, Ministry of Justice, Mars Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland and       Homeloan Management Limited (HML)5.1.
These organisations,       along with several specialist training providers, some of which are based       overseas, e.g.
RevereAB (Sweden), Vlerick Management School (Belgium), are       amongst 22 organisations which have been approved by LERC to award LCS       accreditation.
Through the LCS, LERC research has instigated change in       companies at a range of levels from individual factories or units, to       entire multinational operations.
The LCS has also been effectively       translated from the private to the public sector.
In 2013, a licensed       company was set up to deliver the LCS (http://www.leancompetency.org/).
The private sector has found considerable value in adopting the       LCS.
Examples include:             Lloyds Banking Group (2009 onwards): The Lloyds Banking Group         has 30 million customers and around 100,000 employees in the UK.
The         purpose of introducing lean in this case was "to improve the customer           experience, as well as to deliver cost reductions and improved           productivity.
While the early stages of the lean journey focused on           process management, the establishment of a Lean Sigma Academy within           the Group provided the means to build internal lean capability for           self-sustainability and to provide lean leaders for the organisation.
The Academy was approved by LERC to accredit employees in 2009.
Around           100 people per year receive LCS accreditation, with an average           tangible benefit of &#163;100,000 per accreditation project"5.2.
Diageo (2012 onwards): Diageo is a leading international         premium drinks business which has embarked on a major global training         initiative in order to "embed lean tools and techniques" into         their ways of working.
Their aim is for all operators to undergo a one         day lean awareness training course (accredited to LCS Level 1a) and all         managers to undergo four days lean training (accredited to Level 1b).
The training so far has been highly valued, with the accreditation         element bringing the programme "rigour [because] all sites           (there are 97 globally across Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and           Europe) undergo exactly the same training and the assessment at the           end ensures learning is effective and applied"5.3.
Management also believe the training "has created a pull from the           population as the certificate is something that is valuable to them as           individuals"5.3.
LERC have further extended their impact on companies by playing the         role of academic partner in Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs),         partnering with several companies to help them to improve their         competitiveness, productivity and performance through sustainable lean         transformations tailored specifically to the organisations concerned.
Examples include:        Yeo Valley Farms Ltd. (2010-2012): Yeo Valley is a manufacturer         of dairy products with a turnover in excess of &#163;270m per annum and 1,500         staff.
This KTP focused on the strategy and alignment, leadership and         behaviour aspects of the Iceberg Model and addressed specific issues         associated with the manufacture of fast-moving consumer goods which had         not been previously dealt with in the lean literature.
A new training         system was developed for the company and the number of manufacturing         procedures reduced from over 13,000 to 120, greatly improving the         effectiveness of workplace practices.
Four new staff members have been         employed to provide lean leadership in the business during the roll out         of lean across other sites, sustaining the changes, while the KTP has         enabled &#163;1million of annual repeatable savings to be achieved.
The value         of this KTP was acknowledged by Steve Welch, Group Continuous         Improvement and Yogurt Manufacturing Manager at Yeo Valley in an         interview for the Lean Management Journal (2012): "Our beliefs have           been strongly influenced by the work of Dr Pauline Found from LERC and           others, whereby the `below the waterline' enabling factors from the           Lean Iceberg Model....have to be firmly in place before improvement           can be considered"5.4.
Johnson &amp; Johnson &#8212; DePuy (2010-2012): This project looked         to implement a sustainable lean culture within DePuy, a manufacturer of         orthopaedics.
At the outset, the DePuy orthopaedic cement works in         Blackpool had only just started its lean transformation and an internal         assessment by J&amp;J, using their Lean Maturity Assessment model, was         very low.
The KTP focused on the behaviours and engagement element of         the Iceberg Model and, following the work with LERC, the plant was         assessed again in December 2011, by external J&amp;J personnel, and         awarded the highest level of lean maturity, the first plant to achieve         this in its initial formal assessment.
By its conclusion, the KTP         project had returned a cost reduction of $165,000 through validated         improvement projects5.5.
In addition, since 2009 the J&amp;J         Group (OCD, DePuy and Lifescan) has supported 12 of their senior         managers on the CBS MSc Lean Operations, the benefit from each student         being a ten-fold return on investment.
As a result of the need to improve efficiency in the face of public         sector spending restrictions, Lean and the LCS have been embedded in         many national UK government bodies5.6, including:        Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) (2008 onwards): HMRC         became an accredited partner with LERC in 20095.7.
Head of         Practitioner Profession at HMRC, states: "The LCS accreditation           programme within HMRC is primarily targeted at our 300 PaceSetter           (Lean) Practitioners with 91% of them having started accreditation.
The programme has given us a cornerstone on which to build the           existing lean capability into a Profession within HMRC.
The PaceSetter           Practitioner Profession is now recognised as one of the 21 Professions           within HMRC and gives us a more robust platform on which to operate           from.
The HMRC Practitioner learning programme which is completely           aligned to the LCS has been a product much in demand by other           government departments so allowing us to build capability across           Government"5.8.
Ministry of Justice (2008 onwards): The Ministry established         their Continuous Improvement Academy in 2008 and whilst they quickly saw         benefits in efficiency savings and staff engagement, they "struggled           to sustain these improvements"5.9.
In a revised         approach, they "prioritised some of the less visible and foundation           elements of Lean; on the creation and alignment of strategy and the           leadership needed to support a continuous improvement culture"5.9.
One of the biggest applications has been in Her Majesty's Courts and         Tribunals Service1 (HMCTS) &#8212; 558 people have been trained to LCS           Level 2a or 2b, and lean has been implemented in all 500 courts in the           UK.
The Continuous Improvement Academy has trained experts to lead           Lean activity within HMCTS, both in their business areas and across           internal boundaries.
Through standard operating procedures and other           lean changes, a monthly saving of over 66,500 hours of staff time has           been achieved and sustained5.10.
In addition to the           financial benefits of Lean, HMCTS has yielded a range of qualitative           benefits such as "improved productivity" and staff who are "more             engaged and empowered by having the chance to shape decisions about             the way they work"5.6.
