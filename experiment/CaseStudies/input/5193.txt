     As a result of the underpinning research described above, scale-up of       participatory women's groups has begun in various parts of India.
Our work       has also begun to influence policy in other low and middle-income       countries.
The results of our meta-analysis influenced WHO's decision to       develop a training module on the intervention for global dissemination.
From 2008-13, UCL and Ekjut worked to scale up the intervention in the       high-mortality eastern Indian states of Jharkhand and Odisha.
In total,       the project led to work with 4,676 women's groups across 17 districts in       four states, covering a population of over two million people [a].
In 2012, the Department of Health and Family Welfare in Jharkhand       incorporated the intervention into the curriculum of the Accredited Social       Health Activist, a cadre of community health volunteers working in the       country's poorest areas, and rolled out the intervention across the state       [b].
In 2013, the intervention was rolled out in the state of       Odisha in a collaboration between the Departments of Health, Women and       Child Development, and Rural Development, together with the UK Department       for International Development (DFID).
DFID India made the decision to       promote the women's group intervention as a cost-effective strategy to       improve maternal and newborn health and to test its application to other       health issues, including maternal and child under-nutrition [c].
The roll-out in Odisha covers a population of over one million women [d].
The results of our work have received vast media coverage in India and       internationally.
An article in The Hindu in 2010 interviewed       mothers who had benefited from the programme.
One described the impact of       the programme as follows: "Earlier, we didn't clean our hands before         cooking and eating.
We'd just leave the baby and go off to work.
Now we         clean and grow vegetables ourselves.
We keep the water clean in the         house.
Women in the village help one another and sometimes pool money to         transport someone to hospital for delivery and visits to the doctor."
Another said: "Earlier, when a problem arose, we would pray.
Now, I go         to a doctor at the slightest problem.
I ate spinach, fish and vegetables         during and after my recent pregnancy.
I breast-fed for six months from         the first day" [e].
This story was also covered by the Guardian       and Time, as well as on Indian national television [f].
The New York Times also reported favourably on the publication of       our first Mumbai trial, where the results were less successful, reflecting       on the use of evidence in global policy and the political pressure to show       only positive findings [g].
In Malawi, the intervention has been adopted as a model for improving       maternal and newborn health by the Ministry of Health, UNFPA and the       Uchembere Network.
Project team members participated in the development of       the Government of Malawi's plan for community interventions, part of the       Health Sector Strategic Plan (2011-6) and the Malawi Road Map for       Accelerating the Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Mortality [h].
Further media coverage for MaiKhanda included an interview with Voice of       America in June 2013 [i].
Through the non-governmental organisation Women and Children First, we       are supporting further uptake of the women's group intervention in       Bangladesh, Malawi, Ethiopia and Uganda, using an implementation guide       developed jointly with UCL, the Perinatal Care Project of the Diabetic       Society of Bangladesh and Ekjut India [j].
The organisation aims       to extend the thematic content of the women's groups model to test its       effectiveness for addressing other maternal and child health issues,       including family planning, prevention of mother to child transmission of       HIV, and under- five's health and nutrition.
In December 2012, Costello and Prost participated in a World Health       Organisation (WHO) workshop to design a module on community mobilisation       with women's groups for maternal and newborn health, which will supplement       WHO's existing guidance on Caring for Newborns and Children in the       Community [k].
The results of our meta-analysis were also       presented to WHO in early 2013 and influenced their decision to develop a       training module for community health workers intended for global       dissemination; this will have an impact on developing country health       systems around the world [l].
The meta-analysis results were also       launched at a large event in the Houses of Parliament and at the Women       Deliver International Conference, both in May 2013.
