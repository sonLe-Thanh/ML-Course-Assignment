     Creating accessible cultural capital to enrich the lives of local         audiences in Derbyshire       Two volumes co-produced by Riden and groups of volunteer local historians       in Derbyshire as part       of the EPE initiative broke new ground in their scope by providing       authoritative but accessible       accounts of the mining community of Bolsover and the Hardwick estates of       the Dukes of       Devonshire (3.1 &amp; 3.2).
The books reflect new knowledge and         analysis and represent a         contribution to the cultural capital of the area.
No general history       of Bolsover had appeared       since the 1890s and, although much has been written about Hardwick Hall,       there had hitherto been       no history of the parishes on the estate.
The two proved highly-popular       locally: A total print-run of       1,016 copies of the Bolsover book and 1,568 copies of the Hardwick Hall       book were produced,       figures which the publishers consider to be `excellent', making the titles       amongst the best sellers in       the EPE series, with the publishers `keen for reprints to be made'.
(5.1)       The figures demonstrate a       widening of the audience-base for research that has previously only         attracted scholarly         audiences.
The books reached a more generalist audience than local       history publications often do       through their availability in local supermarkets and newsagents.
The       publishers view is that the       books, being linked directly to well-known historical places, reached a       wide audience and were       purchased sometimes in lieu of more traditional guidebooks, allowing       Riden's scholarly work to       enrich both the tourist experience at Bolsover and Hardwick (see below),       whilst also providing       members of the local community with scholarly information about their       locality and its history in a       readable format.
The public who engaged with the material found it       enriching: `Discovering the past       leads to greater understanding of the present and is a life enhancing       experience.
Knowing about         the lives of those who lived in our town is enriching for us, who live         here now'.
(5.2)     Transforming the skills base of local historians       As part of the research and writing process that underpinned these       publications, the volunteer       communities developed new skills and competencies.
For some       participants this has been       transformative, giving them the skills and confidence to go on to       lead their own local history       groups, and in two cases, to publish their own research.
At regular       meetings (which began in 2006       and continued into 2009), volunteers received skills training in the use       of source materials,       including census enumerators' books, probate records and glebe terriers,       designed to be       transformative in terms of their own research competencies and       understanding.
One volunteer       commented, "My involvement with the VCH and EPE has enabled me to acquire       a number of       transferrable skills, useful to me both as an amateur local historian         and in other spheres".
Another said that media training he had received through the EPE project       `proved extremely useful       with VCH but also included transferrable skills used in both my local       history interest and at       work...My involvement with VCH has challenged me to adopt different       writing styles for different       audiences'.
He added that the support he had received during his       participation in the project had       given him the skills and confidence to publish his own material.
On       the basis of her       participation in the project, another volunteer compiled an illustrated       book `Challenge and Change       in Bolsover 1983-2008' (2009), and accompanying CD, which was made       publicly available through       Chesterfield Library.
Although listed as references in section 3, these       books represent part of the       outcomes and impact of the EPE initiative too, reflecting grass roots       community involvement in the       co-production of historical knowledge.
The skills developed by the       volunteers who participated       transformed their ability to undertake and manage their own research, and       to communicate it to       new audiences.
(5.2)     Contributing resources to local libraries to further their local         history education work       The value of this work to the libraries involved is measured through the       increased uptake of library       resources.
A Local Studies Librarian for Derbyshire County Council       comments: "Through these       meetings the volunteers have acquired research skills and also gained         extensive knowledge of         source material, several of the volunteers having returned to           the library inspired to use         these skills in furthering their own research.
She also attests to       the impact of the research on       the richness of the library's own resources: `Many of the project's       research notes, including notes       from other archives and repositories, are stored at Chesterfield Library       and have been consulted         by other library users, thus providing a useful resource to the wider         public.
The Hardwick       and Bolsover volumes are also a valuable addition to library stock       throughout the county, being       authoritative, accessible, and attractively presented.
'(5.3)     Enhancing the quality of the tourist experience at two heritage venues       Riden was invited to give talks to volunteers at both Hardwick Hall and       Chatsworth which ultimately       improved the quality of the visitor experience.
Through a series of talks,       Riden provided insights       and findings from his research that helped to improve the accuracy and         contribute to the         richness of the information they shared with visitors.
A volunteer       leader from Hardwick who       engaged Riden to undertake one such talks attests to his success in       delivering reliable and sound       research that effectively allowed volunteers who attended to confidently       pass on the new       knowledge they gained to the visitors (5.4) thus improving the quality and       richness of the visitor       experience.
Other talks based at venues including Derby and Chesterfield       Libraries, the Scarsdale       Local History Fair and Chatsworth House and Hardwick Hall and Bolsover       (based on the EPE       publications [3.1-3.4]) have further engaged local audiences with         their regional history.
Contributing to local children's knowledge about, and skills for         researching, their         community's history       Research material from EPE publications was translated into information       packs for KS 2 &amp; 3       teachers by the education consultant of Derbyshire County Council working       closely with a local       History Advanced Skills Teacher in 2008-2009.
The education consultant       said "The project       has...supported the development of knowledge and skills....It will       promote better         partnerships between schools and with other partners such as the library         and archives, as         well as historical organisations/ sites.
"(5.5) Pupils from both       Bolsover Secondary School and       New Bolsover Primary School were involved in the project which explored       the life of people in New       Bolsover mining community in the 1900s through visits to the National Coal       Mining Museum and       census research sessions with support from their local librarian.
Through       IT training from       Derbyshire County Council, the pupils developed their own webpages with       information about the       local history they had learned through this project, developing resources       which are available for       future use by the schools and Derbyshire County Council.
