     4.1 Coaching and mentoring are of widespread interest across the world in       a wide range of different types of organisations.
In 2006, Fillery-Travis       &amp; Lane stated that coaching was a $2billion market globally.
Clearly       this has increased since then as, each year, the cipd's surveys of       Learning and Development activity among UK organisations indicate an       average of 70% of all UK businesses using coaching in one form or another       and the recent (2013) Barometer Report highlights coaching as a key       activity in management development, talent management and performance       improvement.
4.2 Mentoring activity is also widespread and found in most business       sectors (Alred &amp; Garvey 2010).
The 2010 BIS analysis of the Small       Business Survey showed that 51% of SMEs who used mentors either expected       to attain, or had actually attained growth in their business.
This       compares with 32% expecting or attaining growth in their business without       mentoring support.
4.3 Garvey is one of the few established researchers and commentators on       mentoring and coaching.
The impact of his research is widespread and is       found in a variety of national and international settings.
For example,       his research based practitioner book on mentoring, The Mentoring Pocket         Book, has total sales of 80,000 copies (Publisher data).
First       published in 1998, it is now in its 3rd edition and has been       reprinted four times since 2010.
Copies have been, and are being,       purchased by many organisations, including Lloyds Banking Group, the NHS,       the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music, Stantec, Novachem and       the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta       (APEGA) in Canada.
4.4 Since 2011 Garvey's notion of the `coaching and mentoring way' has       been employed as the basis for leadership development within APEGA .
This       professional body has 66,000 members.
Garvey has delivered six keynotes       and six workshops for APEGA with an approximate total of 900 people       participating.
This has resulted in a further series of workshops with       APEGA during 2013 and additional mentoring scheme design and development       work with the Chemical Company Novachem.
4.5 Garvey's research has impacted on the education and training of       coach/mentors.
For example, training design for 105 staff to date at Wood       Mackenzie Research and Consulting in four different countries &#8212; the USA,       Singapore, Australia and the UK.
His research is also the basis of the       on-going online support for teachers implementing the Diploma for 14-19       year olds in UK schools.
4.6 Garvey has developed a very deliberate dissemination strategy whereby       he has positioned himself to be regularly invited to provide keynote       lectures at professional conferences.
During 2012/13 Garvey presented to       over 400 business people in Khartoum, Sudan, via the delivery of a British       Council Management Lecture titled `Whose Performance is it?'
This lecture       drew on his research published in Garvey, B.
(2011a) A Very Short,         Slightly Interesting and Reasonably Cheap Book about Coaching and         Mentoring.
London: Sage.
This lecture was followed by two business       workshops for a total of 30 CEOs of Sudanese businesses.
He also gave the       keynote and provided a workshop at the International Coaching Federation       (ICF) Conference in Lithuania for over 100 coaching professionals and       provided a master-class on `Line managers as coaches' for the Latvian ICF       with 80 people attending.
Prior to this he delivered a coaching workshop       for 80 managers in the Latvian Ministry of Finance.
4.7 Coaching and mentoring professional bodies have been debating       definitional statements for coaching and mentoring for many years.
Garvey's research has had a significant impact on their deliberations,       which makes him among the first to have established a new and critical       approach to defining coaching and mentoring through discourse analysis.
This work is distributed through European Mentoring and Coaching Council       Networks (EMCC) and published in four different publications which appeal       to different sectors as follows:            Garvey, B. Stokes, P. and Megginson, D. (2009) Coaching and           Mentoring: Theory and Practice, London: Sage       Garvey, B.

4.8 Garvey is regularly featured in the press and called upon as an       `expert' to comment on issues relating to coaching and mentoring in the       media.
He regularly contributes to the Professional Journal Coaching         at Work where he provides critical commentary on coaching and       mentoring practice.
