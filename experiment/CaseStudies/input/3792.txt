     i1) Literary heritage of a major British author is adapted and         interpreted for the reading         public, simultaneously contributing to the economic prosperity of the         creative industries in         a remote region of the UK.
Sellers' Vanessa and Virginia was published in June 2008 by Two       Ravens Press, a small Scottish       independent literary publishing company.
Founded in 2006 near Ullapool in       the Highlands, Two       Ravens has since relocated to Uig on the Isle of Lewis.
Vanessa and         Virginia retails for &#163;8.99 and       at the end of assessment period had sold around 2,100 copies and around 50       e-books in the UK,       most orders being taken directly through Two Ravens' website.
[S1]       According to the Director of       Two Ravens: `This makes it our bestselling work of fiction, and Two         Ravens Press' bestselling         book ever.
It is unusual for a small literary press to sell more than         1000 copies of a work of literary         fiction, especially by a first-time novelist, and so the fact that         Vanessa and Virginia has done so         well (and, on the strength of our UK publication, been sold on to the         USA and several other         countries) has meant that we have been able to use this success story as         inspiration to other         authors we publish.
It also gave us credibility when applying for a         block funding grant from the         Scottish Arts Council, which we obtained in 2009.'
[S1] Clearly,       then, Sellers' work was significant       in helping to establish the viability of this independent, entrepreneurial       business in its early years.
i2) UK Cultural heritage is exported, creating wealth in the         international publishing industry.
Vanessa and Virginia was picked up and marketed intensively by       international publishers, first in       North America by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who published it in hardback       in 2009 ($23).
A US       paperback followed in 2010 (Mariner, $13.95).
An         audio book accompanies these editions.
Moreover, that Vanessa and Virginia was selected for the Barnes         and Noble Discover Great New         Writing awards 2009 [S7] and was picked by The           New York Times in May 2010 as editor's choice,       [S8] are indications of the significance of its impact in the US       publishing industry.
Translation       enabled penetration of global markets, with the novel published in France,       the Netherlands, Spain,       Sweden, Turkey, Brazil and China.
[S6] The Chinese version was made by       Professor Yang Lixin       (Nanjing University), a visiting Research Fellow at St Andrews from       2010-2011, during which time       she collaborated with Sellers on the project.
Translations into Finnish,       Italian, Japanese, Korean,       Lithuanian, Polish and Russian are in press.
That the novel has been       translated into over a dozen       languages so far is a measure of its unusually wide international reach.
i3) Other arts practitioners adapt Sellers' novel, interpreting her         work to enrich the         imagination of new audiences, and providing employment in the creative         industries and         generating revenue for a theatre company and several theatres.
During 2009 Vanessa and Virginia was adapted for the stage by a       practising playwright.
This       attracted interest from a freelance director who set up a company, Moving       Stories, specifically to       tour the play, opening in September 2010 and running until April 2013.
Plans made during the       period of assessment will result in its revival for the New York stage in       2014.
Moving Stories       secured AHRC funding to launch the play (Knowledge Catalyst Transfer       scheme AH/I500618/1,       &#163;26,220).
Tour dates have included around a dozen venues in the UK and the       play has also been       staged at Aix-en-Provence, Krakow and Regensburg.
Total audience for the       play at its various       performances to the end of July 2013 was over 3,600 people, with almost       1200 of those seeing the       play at the Riverside Studios in London, where it ran from 26 March to 14       April 2013.
[S3] A British       Sign Language-signed performance of the play was given on 13 April, and       while at the Riverside it       received five nominations for the 2013         Off West-End Theatre Awards.
[S9] Sellers gave a talk at       the Riverside to coincide with the production.
Over the the play's       performance-span the staging of       Vanessa and Virginia provided work for a total of fourteen people,       including producers, a designer,       lighting engineers, and three actors (launching the professional careers       of two), an image company       (Artswork media), and a musical director for approximately 32 months.
[S3]       The Artistic Director of       Moving Stories reports `owing to the success of V&amp;V [their first         ever production] we have been         invited by the Riverside Studios to become an affiliate company, and         they have commissioned both         our next play [...] and invited us to take the `Stop-Look-Listen'         project to the Edinburgh Festival         next summer under their banner [...] The success of Vanessa and Virginia         at the Riverside has         significantly enhanced our company profile and reputation and given us a         foundation on which to         build.'
[S3] The actors called Sellers `our greatest research         resource' and reported that `regular         feedback from audience members [...] was that the play had made them         want to go and find out         more about the sisters themselves, to read more Woolf, [...] the play         brought Professor Sellers'         novel, research on Woolf and Bloomsbury to a new audience'.
[S4]       Sellers is currently       collaborating with New York based theatre company Shakespeare's Sister,       preparing for their       upcoming production of the play with `pump-prime' funding of c. &#163;1000 from       the Carnegie Trust.
i4) Public cultural life at home and abroad is enriched as a result of         Sellers' research and         programming content is created for the arts and broadcasting media         industries.
Sellers worked to ensure that Vanessa and Virginia has been at       the centre of a wide range of       public events both in the UK and abroad.
A sample of these includes       readings and/or public talks       and lectures at: Essex Book Festival; Heffers bookshop to launch Cambridge       Wordfest, plus three       other events at this festival; Welborne Arts Festival; Tramway Theatre       Glasgow; Sunday Times       Oxford Literary Festival.
Sellers also spoke at Aix-en-Provence and       Regensburg (both to coincide       with the local premiere of the play); the University of Oslo; the       International Culture Centre,       Krakow, Poland and the Lincoln Centre, New York.
The Director of her       British publishing press has       remarked that this intense promotional activity makes Sellers `by far         Two Ravens Press' most         active author', also noting that she has `raised the profile of         Two Ravens Press considerably'.
[S1]       This strongly indicates that the economic benefit to the independent press       mentioned at (i1) is in       part a direct result of the public engagement detailed here in (i4).
As a result of the success of Vanessa and Virginia, and a mark of       its ongoing impact, Sellers was       invited to serve as literary advisor to the steering committee for `To the       Lighthouse Festival: For       Readers and Writers' (24/09/11 - 7/10/11, Cambridgeshire).
The festival       aimed to help reading       groups engage with and discuss Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse,       offering web materials, talks,       workshops and tours.
Ten libraries across Cambridgeshire took part,       hosting displays, and       approximately 700 members of the public took part in the reading groups       and library workshops set       up to promote knowledge and understanding of Woolf's novel.
A competition       for schools was       included, and a performance of the play was preceded by a talk for local       schools and members of       `The Phoenix', a NHS tier 4 specialist inpatient unit for young women with       eating disorders.
The       former County Literature Officer for Cambridgeshire has remarked that the       Festival `had a huge         impact on The Phoenix' and the families of the women there.
[S5]     Radio broadcasts provide further evidence of the increasing reach and       significance of Sellers'       work: Vanessa and Virginia was chosen for BBC Radio       Cambridgeshire's `Book a Day in May', and       an interview with Sellers was subsequently broadcast (25/05/09, weekly       listening figure 136,000);       Sellers was also interviewed about her novel for WNYC Public Radio's Leonard           Lopate Show       (05/06/09, monthly listening figures of 11.5M in 2012, data unavailable       for 2009) [S10, S11];       Sellers was a major contributor to a special 45-minute edition of Woman's         Hour, BBC Radio 4 on       Virginia Woolf (22/10/09, reach of 9,841,000 listeners), [S12] and was       also interviewed for Radio      Cambridge 105 (08/10/11, reach of 108,000 listeners) [S13].
Podcasts of these       radio broadcasts       continue to provide legacy resources.
Sellers' work was also taken up,       cited and discussed on the       website of Freshties,       a non-profit rights organisation not normally concerned with literature.
Legacy         Resources for this case study will be curated at the School's       webpage to provide       continuing benefit to our users beyond the end of this REF cycle.
