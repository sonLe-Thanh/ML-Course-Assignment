     Cranfield's research on osteomics and biominerals has enhanced the use of       biomaterials in health applications and forensic analysis, and improved       industrial standards in the manufacture of medical prosthetics.
The research has resulted in robust quality assurance protocols for         biomimetic coatings that have been adopted across Europe.
These         protocols are used by Biomet, an international medical device         manufacturer, and are essential for the reliable supply of many M&#8364; worth         of prosthetic products, [C1].
A unique approach to structural tomography developed by Cranfield to         derive depth resolved physicochemical information is now employed by         Biomet, amongst others, as a biomimetic method for chemical modification         of endoprosthetic surfaces.
This has become a commercial coating, being         produced in five factories across Europe, [C1].
A spinout company from Cranfield, in collaboration with Nottingham         Trent University, (Halo X-ray Technologies, registered in 2012) has been         formed based on the unique methods developed for data acquisition from         our analytical techniques.
Rogers is a Director (Chief Scientific         Officer) and the company has attracted further funding &#8212; from EPSRC and         TSB in partnership with other UK companies &#8212; to develop novel sensors         for XRD-crystallography in-situ and in-vivo.
The company was awarded a         grant for $3.5M from the US Department of Homeland Security in July 2013         which enabled it to recruit an additional 4 members of staff, [C2].
New methods based on our work on the characterisation of natural bone         have led to the development of species discrimination techniques.
These         have been applied in the casework of forensic providers where human         identification is required (Cellmark Forensic Sciences), [C3].
