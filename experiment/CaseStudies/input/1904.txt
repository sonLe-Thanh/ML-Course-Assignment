     Guiding practice, strategic decision-making and organisational change         in partnership with local authorities and voluntary sector         organisations, resulting in positive outcomes for children and families:            The 4-year           longitudinal evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions for           neglected children commissioned by Action           for Children has supported the development of effective         measurement tools to guide assessment and review, and also established         links between presenting circumstances, interventions and outcomes for         children.
Clear explanation of the factors resulting in reduction of         risk to the level of universal services has proved valuable to the         national charity and to other organisations across the UK.
Long et al's         research established that for some children, referred too late for         effective early intervention, proceeding into care could be accelerated         as a result of the rigour of the assessment process which was found         convincing in court.
The Evaluation           of the Springboard Project in Blackpool developed a range of         findings, applicable in a range of settings to the extent that they         influenced the development of similar projects in local authorities in         the UK, based on the compelling conclusions of the Evaluation that; "the           sum of this sustained partnership effort had left Blackpool, as an           local strategic partnership, with a far stronger collaborative agenda           in commissioning, organisational development and practice than it           enjoyed before the Springboard process began."
For example, Three           Rivers District Council used the Evaluation to structure its         `Think Family' Project: "The Springboard project in Blackpool is one           of the most advanced Think Family projects in the country and the           University of Salford's published research into Springboard states the           many benefits that the `Think Family' approach can bring across a wide           range of performance indicators from smoking cessation through to the           reduction in repeat incidents of domestic violence."
The Evaluation of the Springboard Project has been shown the         approaches taken in the Project to be effectively applicable         internationally: An           exploration of the effective use of intensive family support services           to address child abuse and neglect:"The success of the project           to date has been captured by the external evaluation undertaken by           Salford University over two years.
It identified the huge culture           change that had taken place across services; "...A mindset has been           established of sharing information and problems, then sharing           solutions."
It is evident from the evaluation that this initiative has           had a significant impact on the quality of the lives of families and a           systemic change in the way services are delivered.....The Springboard           model of family preservation should be trialled across Queensland with           a full commitment across government to promote its success" (Boyle         2012).
Influencing national policy development in relation to improvements in         health and social care services resulting in reduced dependence on         services:            The Northern Ireland Assembly has noted the impact of the 4-year           longitudinal evaluation of           the effectiveness of interventions for neglected children study:         "It is rewarding to see the positive impact that the Clooney Family           Centre is having on the lives of the families it engages with and I           commend the work carried out by Action for Children through its many           life-changing projects which span all areas of Northern Ireland,"         said Junior Minister Bell after           a visit of Northern Ireland Executive Ministers to a family         centre in Derry/Londonderry: "The Ministers were there to see,           first-hand, the centre's involvement in the UK wide Child Neglect           Intervention Pilot.
Action for Children has developed the UK           neglect intervention project to identify effective and timely           interventions with children and families.
This project is the subject           of a longitudinal evaluation by the University of Salford."
Long et al worked in close partnership with health and social care         professionals to evaluate, learn from and make recommendations for         improved approaches to lead to improved outcomes.
Models resulting from         Long et al's research have informed central government policy and         strategy for interagency working: 		       The innovative research approach led to the development of new ways of         working and cultural change in workforce attitude often referred to as         the "no wrong door" approach.
Professional and support workers have come         to recognise the needs of whole families and to work across traditional         professional boundaries to the benefit of children and families,         evidenced in the All Party Parliamentary Local Government Group         report "Primary           Justice".
The research contributed to the development of the UK government's         Troubled Families Programme, which has turned around the lives of 14,000         of England's toughest to tackle households in 15 months, with 50,000         families being worked with by mid-2013.
Working             with Troubled Families: A guide to the evidence and good practice             DCLG 2012 identified the importance the skills of individual         workers, in family intervention work both in building an honest and         productive relationship with a family and influencing the actions of         other agencies around that family identified in Long et al's research: "Family           intervention workers are dedicated to the families and provide an           antidote to the fragmented activity from many different agencies that           usually surrounds a troubled family.
They `grip' the family, their           problems and the surrounding agencies and are seen to be standing           alongside the families, their difficulties and the process being put           in place, which can lead to new approaches to dealing with long           standing problems."
Developing the workforce and guiding training:             "This approach will have a major influence on how we progress the           social care professional framework and moves the emphasis away from a           large number of individual learning routes to a more simplified model.
The framework should empower employers and learners to make informed           decisions about the most appropriate training that best suits their           needs by providing relevant and timely information."
