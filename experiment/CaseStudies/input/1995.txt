     MacCulloch's `rare combination of encyclopaedic learning and lucid       writing' (Sir Ian Blair in The         Mail on Sunday, 6/12/09) has been the major factor facilitating the       impact of his research on       Britain's media production, its cultural and intellectual life, and in       particular its public discourse       about the religious and cultural heritage of Christianity in today's       world.
In the specific case of       History of Christianity this quality attracted BBC filmmakers who       approached MacCulloch during       the early phase of his work on the book with the proposal for a TV series       on its basis.
The result       was an inhouse BBC Religion and Ethics production, with the Executive       Director Jean-Claude       Bragard.
In the course of their collaboration, MacCulloch's original       research project became closely       aligned with the production of the accompanying TV series [i].
The       process of interleaving filming       with writing the book resulted in the growth (with editorial       encouragement) from a third of a million       to half a million words.
MacCulloch's book has enjoyed an unusually wide and diverse readership;       up until now well over       120,000 copies have been sold worldwide [1].
In addition an audio       version is available in the US       and the book has been translated into Dutch, Korean, Romanian, and Spanish       with planned       versions in German, Italian, Mandarin, and Russian.
Gordon Brown, whilst       Prime Minister, listed       the book as his bedtime reading [ii].
Adam Gopnik, contributor to       the New Yorker and jury member       for the Cundill History Prize, commented that `If any book could truly       fulfill the charge of the Cundill       Prize &#8212; to make first class history more potent to a wide reading public,       and above all to remind us       that history, even three thousand years worth, matters &#8212; this one does' [iii].
That MacCulloch's       ideas have provoked extensive discussion in the British and American       public is further evidenced       by the large number of his speaking engagements directly relating to the       book, such as literary       festivals (Woodstock Literary Festival; Hay on Wye); individual lectures       and public events (LSE       Forum on Religion; Politics and Prose Bookshop, Washington DC; PEN Trust,       London Book Fair);       public events in church settings (in Oxford, San Francisco, Pasadena, CA,       and Dallas, Texas); and       events geared to schools.
Before an invited audience of Scotland's faith       leaders, including the       Moderator of the General Assembly of the Kirk, Archbishop Mario Conti and       the Episcopal Primus,       and BBC staff, MacCulloch held a conversation with Prof. Mona Siddiqui at       Pacific Quay, Glasgow,       on 17 May 2010: `Interpreting Christianity through its history: how the       religious past shapes the       religious present', organised by BBC Scotland.
The TV series has further served to disseminate the fundamental ideas       contained in MacCulloch's       research and to secure their impact on the public understanding of       Christianity.
Responses       emphasized the innovative take on the subject.
Richard Klein, Controller,       BBC Four, says: "A         History Of Christianity is engaging, stimulating and, above all,       informative, offering the ultimate       guide to the origins of the biggest religion in the world.
It also       demonstrates the BBC's commitment       to offering landmark religious programming".
Executive Producer Jean       Claude Bragard adds: "It's a       privilege working with Diarmaid MacCulloch &#8212; he is the leading       international authority in the history       of the Church."
[iv] Reviewing the first episode, the Guardian       wrote, `MacCulloch's fresh way of       thinking and thorough research upturns long-held views on how we typically       view the major religion       of the west.'
[v] Many viewers' reactions simply acknowledged the       need for a novel, historically       ambitious presentation of Christian history and expressed their       appreciation for the way this was       achieved: `The presenter made me fascinated with a subject that I hadn't       really thought a lot about       before &#8212; excellently done.'
`Absolutely brilliant &#8212; informative and       interesting &#8212; it       really helps people to       understand the background and meaning and history of Christianity.'
`Top-notch &#8212; intelligent,       beautifully presented &amp; with great visuals, even witty on a very       erudite subject' [v].
The series won       Best TV/DVD documentary at the Christian Broadcasting Council Media Awards       (`documentary       television at its very, very best') [vi] and the Radio Times       Readers' Award [vii].
The series has also had economic impact as it contributed to the BBC's       success as a worldwide       leader in the production of documentaries.
The series was watched by a       total of roughly 1.5 million       UK viewers (BBC TWO and BBC4 figures combined).
In terms of audience       profile (figures are for       the BBC4 screening):,            Age Group: 10% were 16-34, as compared to 7% for the genre average;         20% 35-54         compared to 18%; 66% 55+ compared to 72%;       Social Grade: from AB group 41% as opposed to genre average of 28%; c1         23% cf 25%;         c2 15% cf 20%; de 22% cf 27%       Gender: 46% male cf 43% genre average; 54% female cf 58%.
The documentary has since been marketed on DVD (last sales figures from       the BBC are roughly       &#163;200,000 gross) [2].
On 13 November and 11 December 2009, MacCulloch undertook two four-hour       sessions on a       dedicated message board, discussing the series with viewers at the       beginning and end of its run.
Questions and comments covered a remarkable range of issues raised by the       programmes, from       the presenter's own religious stance to discussion on the future direction       of Christianity, Biblical       authority, the dark side of Christian misuse of power in history, and the       question of Christian       complicity in the Nazis' exercise of power in the Holocaust [viii].
During its original broadcasting, History of Christianity       elicited considerable and regular reporting in       the print media (all national daily and Sunday broadsheets reviewed every       single episode) [ix] and       considerable viewer feedback to the producers and to MacCulloch       personally, demonstrating the       value of the series to the lives of a wide ranging audience:            `Now I have a better understanding for religious people in general,         and thanks to your         series [...] I have a deeper understanding for the role of religion in         the lives of people.'

`I'm teaching a new survey of Christianity this semester [...], and         plan to use your BBC         series liberally.
It's really terrific, and unique in actually having         someone as presenter AND         writer who knows what he's doing.'
(Professor of European History,         Brigham Young         University) [3].
`The youth association of the two congregations of the Assyrian Church         of the East in         Melbourne decided to view an instalment of your documentary each week         over the next few         weeks as part of our bible studies and history programme' (Student,         Assyrian Church of the         East residing in Melbourne, Australia).
`It is two years since I first saw your television series on the         history of Christianity.
I hadn't         appreciated how much I had taken in of your presentation until I found         myself quoting you         in a recent essay for my lay ministry training' (Student Lay Minister,         Staffordshire) [4].
`I've just watched your BBC-4 documentary The History of           Christianity for the 2nd time.
I         want to thank you very much for such wonderful work.
I [...] have         recommended your         documentary to all of my students.
Those who have watched it are equally         impressed by         your even-handed approach to the subject.'
(Lecturer in Classical         Languages and         Literature, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in         Beijing) [5].
`I am not a Christian, and find myself generally hostile to all forms         of organised religion.
[...]         In light of my feelings about religion, I appreciate your impartiality         and balance all the more.
For me, and for many others, it is easy to approach the subject of         religion form a default         position of hostility.
However you [...] tread the line perfectly         between faith and critique.'
