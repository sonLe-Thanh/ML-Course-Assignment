     Impacts on practitioners and on the environment: Callen-Lenz       Associates Ltd is a leading aviation consultancy and operations company       with significant experience in the operation of Unmanned Aerial Systems       (UAS) in civilian airspace.
Environment Systems Ltd. is a leading       environmental and geographic intelligence consultancy, and is at the       forefront of developments in mapping and modelling of remotely sensed       space and airborne data.
These two SMEs jointly developed Project URSULA       (supported by the Welsh Assembly Government) which involved unmanned       aerial systems (UAS).
URSULA (UAS Remote Sensing for Use in Land       Applications) was a 2-year research and development programme to explore       the potential for advanced remote sensing in land applications, primarily       in high input arable farming [5.1].
As a result the UAS technology       combined with multi-spectral aerial cameras is being used to drive       improvements in managing agricultural practices such as the use of       fertilisers, pesticides, invasive weed mapping and crop disease and stress       detection.
The Aberystwyth developed low-cost, low-mass, robust and       reliable multispectral aerial camera has undergone UAS deployment trials       with Environment Systems Ltd. and Callen-Lenz Associates Ltd., and       returned outstanding results that are a step-change in spatial and       spectral resolution when compared to commercially available camera systems       [5.2], [5.3].
Economic Impact: There is no UAS deployable multispectral aerial       camera on the market with a performance equivalent to the Aberystwyth       system.
So much so that Environment Systems and Callen-Lenz Associates       have worked with the Aberystwyth unit to commercialise and exploit the       Aberystwyth multispectral aerial camera technology.
The two companies have       in March 2013 spun out URSULA Agriculture Ltd., a joint venture company,       to take the Project URSULA R&amp;D to market and to commercially exploit       the opportunities presented by UAS and imaging technologies within       precision agriculture both in the UK and overseas export [5.4].
URSULA       Agriculture Ltd. is responsible for marketing the Aberystwyth       multispectral aerial camera [5.4].
Environment Systems, Callen-Lenz       Associates, and URSULA Agriculture Ltd. are well positioned to understand       the potential world-wide UAS multispectral camera market, and recent       activities have led to new investment funding being sought in 2013 from       the agriculture and investment communities, together with further support       from Welsh Government (via a Smart grant).
This venture capital and       R&amp;D funding of &#163;1-2m is sought to deliver rapid growth and new       jobs in the UK, and progress towards this goal has been achieved via a       Welsh Government Academic Expertise For Business (A4B) grant being awarded       [5.2], [5.3], [5.4].
Impacts on society, culture and creativity: The developed       Aberystwyth PanCam instrument emulator together with the EADS Astrium Ltd.       ExoMars development rover was selected via competitive proposal submission       to be show-cased at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition from       30/06/2008 to 04/07/2008.
The stand was entitled "Exploring the Solar       System: mankind or machine?
", and over four thousand visitors attended the       exhibition [5.5], [5.6].
The event provided a unique opportunity for       members of the public to interact with Aberystwyth scientists, the Bridget       rover and the Aberystwyth PanCam emulator, and to ask questions about our       work.
Our PanCam instrument emulator together with the EADS Astrium       ExoMars development rover was filmed by the BBC undergoing Mars mission       operations trials at Clarach Bay, Wales, UK.
The filming was for the BBC       Coast Programme, Series 6, Episode 5 entitled "Wales &#8212; Border to Border",       which was first shown on BBC2 on 10/07/2011 with an audience of 2.27       million viewers [5.7].
The program has been repeated a total of six times       on BBC2 including 12/07/2011 with an audience of 2.34 million viewers       [5.7], and on 10/06/2012 with 1.99 million viewers [5.7].
