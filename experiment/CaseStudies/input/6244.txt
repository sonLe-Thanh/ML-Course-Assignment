     Kuti's work has brought eighteenth-century plays, largely unknown outside       a specialist field within       the academy, and new plays about this period, to general audiences.
Through completing and       dramatising little known writing of the period, staging productions of       rarely performed plays, and       acting as a consultant on the artistic policy of a National Trust theatre,       she has restored the       repertoire of eighteenth-century drama and enlivened public interest in an       under-represented       period in the history of English theatre.
She has fostered public interest       in the period in       collaboration with three major cultural institutions: BBC Radio, the       National Portrait Gallery, and the       Theatre Royal in Bury St. Edmunds.
Theatre Royal, Bury St. Edmunds: The Theatre Royal is the only       surviving Regency theatre in       this country, and a National Trust property.
It is a unique venue for       authentic performances of       theatre written in the late eighteenth-century.
Kuti's knowledge of this       period, together with her       talents in playwriting, placed her in an ideal position to be commissioned       as a consultant by the       Theatre in the development of their `Restoring the Repertoire' artistic       policy.
The Repertoire aims       to rediscover and revive drama from the period.
In her capacity as a       consultant, Kuti has worked       closely with the Theatre's Board and Artistic Director.
In 2009 she       attended an English Heritage       meeting to advise on how the Theatre might extend its heritage offer while       maintaining its high       artistic standards.
Kuti subsequently submitted a Potential Initiatives       Proforma to the Theatre's       Artistic Director, Colin Blumenau [corroborating source 1].
This document       detailed her suggestions       for workshops and events for the `Restoring the Repertoire' initiative and       was accepted in full by       the Theatre.
She continues to consult with the Theatre Royal on a regular       basis [corroborating       source 2].
Kuti's work has also informed a number of public events and performances       held by the Theatre       Royal to contribute to their Restoring the Repertoire project [all Theatre       Royal impact has been       corroborated by their Head of Participation, corroborating source 2]:            This includes Kuti's own playwriting.
On 3 February 2009 the Theatre         staged a rehearsed         public reading of The Whisperers, based on Frances Sheridan's A           Trip to Bath (1764) of which         only three acts survived.
Kuti completed this comedy by furnishing the         missing fourth and fifth         acts, thus giving a voice to a little-known eighteenth-century         playwright.
The play was         accompanied by her public lecture on Sheridan in the Guildhall in Bury         St. Edmunds.
Kuti         commissioned and produced Lichtenstein's The Requiem for a         joint-production with Inchbald's         The Massacre at the Theatre Royal, and wrote a programme note for         the latter.
The         performances were followed by a talk-back session with playwright         Timberlake Wertenbaker         and Marina Warner.
Lichtenstein's play, Kuti's programme note, and         Warner's public         discussion informed the audience of the contemporary resonance of         Inchbald's largely         forgotten work.
Kuti has also contributed to the Restoring the Repertoire project         through consulting on their         selection of plays and in securing academic funding for a production.
In         June 2010 the Theatre         Royal staged a production of Hannah Cowley's A Day in Turkey         (1792) as part of the public         conference Staging the East.
She suggested and funded the         performance through a British         Academy conference grant she obtained with Warner (&#163;8,281).
The overall impact of Kuti's work on the Theatre Royal's activities was       summarised as follows by       the Head of Participation, Bury St. Edmunds Theatre Royal:     `Through Liz, the work of this theatre has been enhanced by contact with       the academy, and       academics working and publishing in the field worldwide have been brought       in person to the       Theatre.
In all the ways discussed above, Liz's knowledge and expertise in       the field has       contributed significantly to our Restoring the Repertoire policy, and       through all these projects       and events, her work has had a significant impact on audiences and on the       work and life of the       Theatre'.
Head of Participation, Bury St. Edmunds Theatre Royal     BBC Radio: Kuti's dramatisation of essays from The Spectator       (1711) was broadcast in the drama       slot for Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.
She wrote two series of Dear         Mr Spectator, the first       broadcast twice daily between 12 and 16 January 2009, the second broadcast       twice daily between       16 and 20 August 2010.
Dear Mr Spectator revealed the historical       context and contemporary       relevance of the The Spectator magazine to a national audience.
Typical listening figures for       Woman's Hour dramas are between 800,000 and 3 million       [corroborating source 3].
The success       and the effect of the broadcast on its listeners has been confirmed by the       producer of Woman's         Hour: `[the series] highlighted and played with contemporary       resonances and ironies for a twenty-first       century audience...[and communicated] the eighteenth-century context in a       way that ensured it       would be relevant, entertaining and informative for its audience.
Indeed       the first series was       incredibly successful and was very much enjoyed by the R[adio] 4 drama       commissioner and Radio       4 listeners which led to a second series being commissioned' [source 4].
National Portrait Gallery: Kuti's play Enter a Gentleman       was commissioned by the National       Portrait Gallery (NPG) to support their exhibition The First         Actresses: Nell Gwynn to Sarah         Siddons, which ran from October 2011 to January 2012.
The play was       performed at a public       conference organised as part of the NPG exhibition.
The performance was       attended by 132       delegates [source 5].
Focussing on the lives of Restoration figures Aphra       Behn and Elizabeth       Barry, the performance of the play informed public attendees of these       women's roles in the world       of Restoration theatre.
The Curator for the NPG eighteenth-century       collection confirmed that `a       number of colleagues and other delegates mentioned how much they enjoyed       the play which was       a fascinating and fitting conclusion to a day of studious enquiry into       [Elizabeth Barry]'.
She added       that `Events such as these are really important to the Gallery's       reputation as a research institution       [and] help demonstrate and extend the scholarship that underpins...an       exhibition'.
The success of       Enter a Gentleman prompted the University of California LA to       invite Kuti to present an eighteenth-century       play at their William Andrews Clark Memorial Library in California.
This       is due for       performance in 2014 [source 6].
The script of the play has been published       in the volume Fishskin         Trousers by Nick Hern Books (2013).
Kuti's own creative writing and her research into a neglected period of       theatre has thus changed       public awareness of eighteenth-century drama and helped to restore the       significance of the period       in the eyes of public theatre-goers.
With contributions from colleagues in       her Department at Essex       her research and playwriting has also contributed to the Artistic Policy       of the country's only       surviving Regency Theatre.
