     &#8226; The first impact of this very widely reviewed [see Section 5, C1]       research was to stimulate and       enrich public discussion and understanding of the importance of sound as       an aspect of history       and of contemporary social relations.
The radio series brought the       research to a wide audience.
RAJAR figures for Q1 of 2013 indicate that, in a typical week, programmes       in this slot (i.e.
1.45-2       pm weekdays) got 2.4 million adult listeners (9.8 per cent of the       available national audience).
Programmes from the Noise series were listened to online at the       BBC website 312,000 times, and       downloaded as podcasts 41,000 times during the first two weeks alone.
In       March, the series was       in the top 12 podcasts on iTunes in the UK.
The series was a `featured'       item on BBC iPlayer and       trailed on BBC national television channels at peak time between 21 and 28       April.
One episode       was re-broadcast on the New York radio station WNYC (the country's `most       listened to public       radio station' with a weekly reach of over 1 million listeners), and       extracts twice re-broadcast on       BBC Radio 4's Pick of the Week.
From May 2013 it was made       available as a commercial       download via ITunes and AudioGo &#8212; becoming, in its first week of sales,       AudioGo's 4th most       popular download in the UK [C2, C6 &#8212; Hutchings, BBC].
The book was also       sold prominently in       high-street bookshops, through newspapers and via iTunes, selling       approximately 4,000 copies in       the first two months.
It was selected by the national `Prison Reading       Group' in May 2013, with       copies distributed to inmates of HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire, as part of       a scheme to       `encourage links between formal and informal education' within prisons       [C3].
Hendy's research led       to interviews on the historical role of sound in BBC History Magazine       and The Wire (an online       music magazine with a large international reach).
He was also commissioned       to write an article for       The Scotsman (on how his research suggests histories focused on       sound create a more       `decentred' narrative than those produced by traditional political       studies) and for the Independent       (20 March), in which he drew on fieldwork in Greece and Ghana to argue for       the potential       restorative effects of sound for travellers.
Hendy also presented his       research at the Brighton       Science Festival, the Bath Literature Festival, Field Day in London, the       Bristol Festival of Ideas,       and the Dartington Ways With Words Festival, as well as on many local,       national and international       radio programmes (e.g.
RTE's, Arena programme, the World Service's       Newshour, BBC Five Live,       BBC London, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Ulster, BBC Sussex, BBC       Newcastle, WNYC in       New York and News Talk Ireland) [C1, C4].
Radio interviews frequently acted as a stimulus for public comments and       interaction.
For Newshour       on BBC World Service, Hendy drew on his research to discuss sound and       memories of place, while       listeners in Asia and Africa emailed/tweeted on the role of sound in their       own memories.
Hendy's       interview on BBC Radio Scotland's flagship arts show, The Culture         Studio, centred on his research       on the class-based soundscapes of Edinburgh in the 18th       century, with listeners invited to submit       sonic impressions of the city.
His appearance on WNYC in New York framed a       week-long sequence       of items about urban sound pollution, with New Yorkers invited to describe       their own experiences       and the Mayor's Environment Committee invited to respond: the station       website noted that it had       `received an overwhelming response to our segment on the effects of urban       noise' [C4].
Influential       blogs from around the world reflected on the implications of Hendy's       research for their own special       interests.
For example, the blog of the Council of Ex-Muslims discussed       Hendy's argument about       the role of rhythm in ecstatic religions; a cycling blog drew on Hendy's       explorations of Dutch urban       noise-reduction strategies to argue for a rebalancing of the rights of       cyclists and motorists within       British cities, concluding that `noise and danger go together' and       prompting one commentator to       claim `It gave me an entirely new way of thinking about cycle helmets'.
Phil Evans, a Music       Therapist blogging at the Huffington Post, wrote about how the       series had prompted his       reconsideration of the relationship between music and silence in music       therapy [C4].
A sample of       over 900 references to the series on Twitter includes a large number of       references to it being a       culturally enriching and, at times, personally inspiring experience [C3].
The main research theme amplified in public discussion was Hendy's       contention that the process       of defining what is `noise' and what is not has frequently represented the       play of unequal power       relations in society.
This was the focus of an article commissioned by the       main BBC News Online       website (18 March 2013: `The Dark Side of Silence'), where Hendy presented       evidence in support       of his argument.
This included a film on how sounds get amplified in city       environments, links to       articles about noise abatement and an invitation for public comments.
The       article was the third       most `shared' BBC news item on social media that day, with 1.2k of       `shares'.
It was also translated       for the BBC's Mundo website serving Latin America [C1].
The same research       theme was also       aired when the Big Issue published `Is Silence a Virtue?
', a       centre-page spread in its 25-31 March       2013 issue, to discuss the relative merits of silence and of noise in       forging sociality, and in a       similar discussion for BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday morning religious       programme.
The Daily         Telegraph devoted an editorial/leading article to the subject of       `Sounds and silence', using       Hendy's work as a prompt, and posing the question `Is it noisier in our       lives than in past       centuries?'
(Daily Telegraph, 6 April 2013).
Several newspapers       suggested that Noise had       encouraged a subtle change in attitude towards sound.
A reviewer in the Irish         Times said the       book was `opening our ears and our minds to the sound worlds of other       lives and times, and       perhaps encouraging us to listen to our own familiar soundscapes with       fresh ears' (6 April 2013);       a reviewer for the Daily Express concluded that: `[t]he aural       soundscape connects us to our       ancestors in much the same way as the physical landscape does.
`Noise:         A Human History' made       me feel quite silly for not having thought about this much before.
I       expect many other listeners felt       the same' (24 March 2013) [C1, C4].
&#8226; The second major impact of the research was the creation of new       artistic artefacts and national       cultural resources as a result of Hendy's work, stimulating further       creative commissions in sound       and in bequeathing to the British Library a new permanent collection of       field-recordings.
This is       particularly evidenced in three instances:     &#8226; First, field-recordings and sound archives, featured in the programme       and selected under the       guidance of Hendy's research, were used in the creation of new musical       works.
Jo Acheson of       the Hidden Orchestra received a &#163;2,000 commission to compose 30 different       signature tunes       for the series, each based directly on the content.
The musician and Head       of the New       Radiophonic Workshop, Matthew Herbert, received a &#163;2,500 commission to       create a 14-minute       musical work, based on the Noise series and following the overall       narrative structure       and themes established by Hendy's research.
Hendy's notes and       field-recordings in Edinburgh       were also used by American composer, Tod Machover, to assist in the       creation of a new `city       symphony' inspired by soundscapes of the city (premiered at the Edinburgh       International       Festival in August 2013, but composed April-June).
Machover wrote to Hendy       on 5 May       saying, `If I manage to convey anything useful about Edinburgh through       this new piece, much       of that will be because of what I have learned from you and your work'       [C5, C6 &#8212; Machover].
&#8226; Second, in May 2013, by agreement made in 2012, the first of a series       of recordings for the       series was handed to the British Library, to be part of a new permanent       holding accessible to       the public and future researchers.
Hendy's research on Noise has therefore       led to an       enhancement in the national corpus of sound archives [C6 &#8212; Thompson]     &#8226; Third, Noise has contributed towards the goal of two national       institutions &#8212; the BBC and the       British Library &#8212; to enhance, as the BBC puts it, `the art of listening'.
At the BL on 20 May, in a       joint event organised by the University of Sussex and the Library, `Sound       Archives and the       Listening Public', the Library's Chief Executive Roly Keating said the       series had been `one of       the most fruitful encounters between the Library and the BBC' in his time       at the BL.
In noting its       creation of a strong narrative framework for archive recordings, he said,       one could `begin to       find new forms of broadcasting' [C6 &#8212; Keating, BL].
The Commissioning       Editor for Arts and       Documentaries, BBC Radio 4 and World Service, Tony Phillips, stated that,       in providing       listeners with a `sensorial and global experience that emerges organically       from the thesis of the       narrator', Noise provided `a big gauntlet that's been thrown down       to other producers in radio'.
Specifically, it helped to `reinforce and draw attention to the unstated       intention of the network       [Radio 4]: to encourage the art of listening' [C6 &#8212; Phillips, BBC].
The       BBC's Head of History,       Robert Seatter, said that Hendy's work offered `a model' for       academic-broadcast partnerships       and `a paradigm that can be replicated in other ways' [C5 &#8212; Seatter, BBC].
The BBC's website for the series also reflected this broader cultural       agenda, by linking to a range       of other sites related to listening &#8212; e.g.
a permanent link on the series'       homepage to other major       BBC series, such as Open Air (a series of audio interventions by       five artists) and The Listening         Project (a series `to capture the nation in conversation' produced       in collaboration with the BL) and       a rotating menu of other programmes such as In Our Time.
A section       of `Related Links' allowed       users to link directly to the BL's Sounds collections and its `Sounds'       blog.
The BBC also       commissioned a series of 6 special blogs written by curators at the BL,       discussing the radio       programmes in the broader context of other archives of relevance (see, for       example:       http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/posts/Noise-A-Human-History-Week-3-The-Bells).
Additionally, BBC webpages devoted to each individual episode included       links to archives and       resources of particular relevance to that day's broadcast.
BBC data record       312,000 online       requests related to the series [C4].
The BL's curator, Janet Topp-Fargion,       states that during the       series the BL `clearly noticed some spikes in the use of our online sound       collections'.
She argues       that the sheer scale and duration of the series was a factor in       stimulating public interest: `it       becomes part of the discourse' [C5 &#8212; Topp Fargion, BL].
