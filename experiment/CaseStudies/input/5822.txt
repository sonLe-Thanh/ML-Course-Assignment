     Various parties from the Republic of Palau and the United States have       been attempting to protect       the integrity and status of the Peleliu battlefields for some years.
Following the survey in 2010, a       series of meetings took place in Washington, Guam and Palau in 2011       towards achieving this       objective.
The contribution of the research principally lies in its       thorough documentation and       description of the battlefield site that supports and underpins the       application for inclusion into the       U.S. National Park system, and in that way has assisted with the goal of       achieving protected area       status as an NPS site for the battlefields.
The survey report to the BAC       has been used as evidence       to the Palauan Government, U.S. National Park Service and to the U.S.       Congress to support a       Special Resource Study authorized by Congress and approved by the       President of the Republic of       Palau in 2013.
These developments have also generated a five-year Sister       Park agreement       between the Peleliu Battlefield National Historic Landmark and the War in       the Pacific National       Historical Park in Guam [1].
The report has also been well received by the officials of National Park       Service of the USA (based       in Guam) who not only cite the work in evidence of their own ongoing       commitments to support       Palau in its efforts to preserve and promote the site, but also in their       own reflections on future       management of similar sites elsewhere in the Pacific arena.
Steve Cypra of       the Peleliu Historical       Society, sponsor of the research, has advised the research team that the       research report was read       by Barbara Alberti, Superintendent of the War in the Pacific National       Historic Park (NHP) in Guam       and of the American Memorial Park, Saipan, and that it influenced the       discussion and her reports       on the matter immensely.

Our work has established a useful       methodological model in terms of       incorporating local knowledge, integrating archival sources, standards of       site recording, and in       dealing with unexploded ordinance.
The research has also provided the existing National Historic Landmark       (and associated cultural       organs including the museum) with the means to better preserve, monitor       and maintain the site,       especially to protect the site more rigorously from souvenir hunters and       looters.
Site location and       condition assessments provided by our survey report are now in the hands       of local authorities as       an essential tool for monitoring and enforcement.
The Speaker of the       Peleliu State Legislature,       Des Matsutaro, advised in a communication to the US National Park Service       in March 2012:     "The Peleliu Battlefield National Historic Landmark was designated in         1985.
We the people         of Peleliu were honored to be given the opportunity to express our         gratitude to the U.S. and         profound respect for the battlefield which took place on our land.
As         people unaccustomed         to the responsibilities this recognition was to entail, we trusted in         the United States to assist         us in protecting this obligation.
As seen in the ensuing years,         significant efforts were         undertaken by the U.S. to further recognize the importance of Peleliu,         however we the         people of Peleliu found ourselves having to rely on own resources to         address the day to day         challenges presented by this recognition, [...].
Seen in this light the         people of Peleliu take         enormous pride in what today is being recognized in the work of the         University of Aberdeen's         Peleliu survey of military sites to preserve this Landmark" [3].
The Impact of the research in the immediate term has been to provide this       evidence, but also to       bring back to prominence in the consciousness of the United States, Palau,       and to a lesser extent       Japan and the wider world, the nature of WW2 in the South Pacific, and in       particular in the conflict       on Peleliu itself.
Literally exorcising the ghosts of the past (see JCA       paper 2013), the research has       been well received by the people of Peleliu and the Government of Palau,       in particular with respect       to the traditional belief systems of the local populace, and their       relationship with the site as a place       of imagination, evocation, spirituality and death.
In the words of the       Peleliu State Cultural &amp;       Historical Preservation Commission: "The Commission is deeply gratified         and indebted by the         efforts of the University of Aberdeen to document Peleliu's historical         artifacts and willingness to         assist the State of Peleliu in future preservation efforts.
Your         efforts, particularly the 2012 WWII         Battlefield Survey of Peleliu Island completed for the U.S. National         Park Service, is now recognized         as a milestone in its enormous contribution to our understanding of this         U.S. National Historic         Landmark" [4].
Ultimately the main objective of the sponsors of the research is to       achieve National Park status as       a means of providing a lasting, protected memorial to the Peleliu       battlefield, and the heritage of the       Republic of Palau.
Substantial achievements along these lines have been       obtained as the results       of the research have passed into the hands of the relevant authorities       both in Palau and the United       States.
Along with the newly authorized Special Resource Study, a       five-year sister Park agreement       between the Peleliu Battlefield National Historic Landmark and the War in       the Pacific National       Historical Park in Guam was signed in 2012.
The research also provides       comprehensive       documentation of the events of the battle for Peleliu, its causes and its       aftermath, which in itself       provides closure for those affected: the local population, the veterans       and families of those who       fought, died and survived [5].
The importance and impact of the results of       the research is       summarised in a communication from Steve Cypra to US Senator James       Bingaman [6]:     "[...] the Republic of Palau and State of Peleliu have complied with         requirements for a         determination of feasibility as outlined in the Special Resource Study         of the Peleliu National         Historic Landmark of 2003.
Further underscoring this affirmation, a 2012         summary of the         Battlefield Survey of Peleliu Island funded by the National Park Service         and conducted by the         University of Aberdeen states, "In the 2010 survey we were able to         confirm what other         scholars have long suspected; that Peleliu is by far the best preserved         battlefield in the         Pacific.
As the nature of the resources (of Peleliu) has begun to reach         academic audiences         further afield, the emerging consensus is that Peleliu may in fact be         one of the best         preserved battlefields left to us in any WWII theatre.
The historic         significance of the Peleliu         battlefield is hard to overstate.
The sheer quantity of artifacts and         their evocative         preservation on Peleliu are unique in their capacity to convey the         nature of the Pacific War."
Whilst it is acknowledged that academic impact is not a consideration of       the Research Excellence       Framework, it would be remiss not to reflect on the potential impact of       this research on the wider       field of Conflict Archaeology, particularly in a contemporary context.
The       journal in which the       papers are published has, in each case, provided the outputs from the       research with lead and       extended article status and in discussing our work the editors say "its       scope and scale may set a       benchmark for future studies".
It is anticipated the research will form a       reference body of work for       future related study in the field, increasing Reach and Significance.
It       is anticipated the success of       the project will allow further substantive funding to be secured for       further detailed research in       Peleliu from 2013.
