     Evidence for the impact of the Student as Producer action research and       case studies is manifest at three interconnected levels: in institutional       strategies, where institution-wide initiatives are developed and       implemented; national HE teaching development agencies, who have embraced       initiatives and provided funding for individual institutions based on       student as producer principles; and a range of changed practices involving       students at the centre of their studies in different HE environments.
Examples from the research undertaken through action research       interventions were presented at conferences; academic papers were       published and further disseminated, including through the Student as       Producer website, to the wider community; case studies were used in       consultancy in institutions, and national teaching development agencies       were involved as the research evolved and developed in a feedback loop to       further shape the research.
The following are examples of the real impact       of the Student as Producer research:     Institutional Strategies     Student as Producer has impacted on the strategic decisions of a number       of higher education institutions in the UK and internationally, including:             Vanderbilt University, in the USA, which has developed its own         version of Student as Producer, based on the Lincoln model.
The impact         at Vanderbilt is manifest in the way in which students take on the role         of producers within curriculum; development (cft.vanderbilt.edu/2013/09/students-as-producers-an-introduction/);        Nottingham Trent University, where the direct institutional         level impact of Student as Producer is evidenced by the creation of the         Scholarship Project for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) initiative, which         links undergraduates with university research teams (see sources);        The University of Warwick, which has established a Student as         Producer fund to promote undergraduate research as central to the         academic culture and project of the university (www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/funding/students/).
National HE Teaching Development Agencies     Student as Producer has affected curriculum design and practice and has       been taken up by the Higher Education Academy, JISC, and in different       higher education settings, including:             HEA &#8212; The key area of impact is the contribution Student as         Producer has made to the concept of Student as Partners, both         intellectually and practically.
In support of the concept of student         partnerships, Student as Producer research has provided sound working         examples of its practical application across a whole institution, and a         framework for a critical debate about student engagement in higher         education (see sources);        JISC &#8212; `The Summer of Student Innovation' (2013), which is         based on undergraduate students' capacities to produce technological         innovations for teaching and learning, was based on the framework         developed by the Student as Producer initiative.
JISC also adopted the         concept of student as producer in thinking about their approach to Open         Educational Resources (www.jisc.ac.uk/inform/inform37/StudentsAsProducers.html#.UnYnT8xFCM8).
Changed HE Practices in Institutions             Mary Washington University, in the USA, has used Student as         Producer principles as the basis of a university on-line programme, `A         Domain of One's Own' (umwdomains.com/),         where students create web pages for publication and dissemination of         their work;        Macquarie University, in Australia, where the recent         establishment of 'The Education Studio' was influenced by Student as         Producer, and the imperative to have students working alongside         academics to solve complex education problems (see sources);        The University of Hertfordshire is using Student as Producer as         an exemplary case study for its HEA funded Change Academy Project.
Student as Producer provided the university with a clear institutional         model for delivering enquiry based learning across their Business School         (see sources);        The University of Liverpool, where The Interchange Project,         a charity based in the Department of Sociology, Social Policy and         Criminology, supports undergraduate students as researchers within         voluntary organisations.
Student as Producer is used as the pedagogical         theory to underpin practice (see sources).
