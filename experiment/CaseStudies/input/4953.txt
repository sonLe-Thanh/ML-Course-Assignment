     Coronary heart disease is the narrowing of the coronary arteries as a       result of deposition of atherosclerotic plaque (hardening of the       arteries), accounting for nearly 125,000 deaths per year.
As a result of       pre-clinical and initiation of trials in the area of stent technology, the       work of the Leicester team, together with others' global efforts, has       resulted in the recurrence after stenting being reduced from 35% to 5%.
The first drug-eluting stent (releasing agents that inhibit the       inflammatory over repair response) deployed in the UK was by Gershlick at       UHL, as was the first drug-eluting absorbable stent.
Underpinning guidance on management of heart attack patients       Translational and clinical research based in Leicester has contributed to       angioplasty and coronary stenting becoming a mainstream standard clinical       procedure.
The Unit's research has allowed stenting to evolve into an       effective and safe procedure by testing the efficacy, safety and       cost-efficiencies of stent designs and the drugs on them.
The REACT trial was the first definitive study to show the absolute       clinical benefit of angioplasty in the 35% of patients whose occluded       artery had failed to be re-opened following the use of clot-busting drugs       (thrombolysis).
Across the world, patients are now managed according to a       protocol that states that, if they receive thrombolysis, the ECG should be       reviewed after 90 minutes and if the changes due to the heart attack have       not resolved then they should have rescue angioplasty.
The following national and international guidelines, underpinned by the       Unit's research, directly influence how patients with heart disease are       treated in the UK, Europe and the US:            In July 2008, NICE updated its guidance on drug-eluding stents.
The         Unit's research is cited in the assessment report for the appraisal         prepared by University of Liverpool (Drug-eluting stents: a systematic         review and economic evaluation, November 2005), the literature review         which underpins the 2008 guidance (Technology Appraisal 152).
(1)         Gershlick represented the British Cardiovascular Society (BCS) as         Medical Expert presenting data to NICE.
In 2008 and 2012, European Society of Cardiology published guidelines         for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting         with ST-segment elevation.
Gershlick was co-author on the European         Guideline Writing Committee on STEMI.
(2)       In 2008, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart         Association issued a "focused update" of their 2004 guidelines for the         management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
(3)          The results of the STREAM trial were presented at the late-breaking       session at The American College of Cardiology meeting in April 2013, with       simultaneous publication in New England Journal of Medicine, and had an       immediate impact on clinical practice, particularly in parts of the world       with geographical challenges to delivery of angioplasty for heart attacks.
Editorial accompanying the NEJM article stated: "The findings of this       trial could have a major effect on clinical practice.''
(4)     Influencing national service provision       The UK Government's National Service Framework (NSF) for coronary heart       disease was a 10-year strategy launched in 2000 to reduce coronary heart       disease and stroke-related deaths by 40% by March 2010.
The original NSF       proposal was inter-hospital transfer of patients for PCI, with the journey       time between hospitals should not exceed 30 minutes.
(5.5) Work on stents       and representations to NICE, underpinned by the Unit's research into       angioplasty and stenting and Gershlick's representation on the British       Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS), has resulted in the       development of network systems and also the devolution of stenting to all       hospitals judged as angioplasty capable (BCIS visits).
The driving force behind the roll-out of angioplasty as standard care was       a joint project launched in 2005 between the Department of Health and the       British Cardiac Society.
The National Infarct Angioplasty Project (NIAP)       was set up to test the feasibility of implementing a countrywide       angioplasty service for heart attack victims.
Gershlick was a founder       member of the NIAP Academic Group.
The final report was used to inform       commissioners, cardiac networks and service providers in their discussions       on the configuration of acute services and to feed into the development of       primary care trust (PCT) annual operating plans.
A recent Department of       Health report indicates that &gt;90% patients in the UK now receive       primary PCI.
Charting the change, the report shows that in the third       quarter of 2008, just 46% of those STEMI patients in England who received       reperfusion treatment were being treated by primary angioplasty while the       remaining 54% were treated with thrombolysis.
By the second quarter of       2011, 94% of patients were treated with primary angioplasty.
(6)     Guiding the development of new pharmaceutical therapies and         drug-eluting stents       Since the 1990s, Gershlick has worked with medical device and drug       manufacturers to guide the design of drug-eluding stents.
He has been       involved in comparative trials of different drug-eluting stents including       steering and Data and Safety Monitoring Board committees which have       assessed the efficacy of stents and drug treatments for heart patients.
Such studies were precedents in the development of drug-eluting stents       which are used in over two million patients worldwide.
