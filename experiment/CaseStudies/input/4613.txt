     EtxB is a first in class disease-modifying therapy, with potential       utility across a range of human       diseases in which there is a unmet need: 125 million people suffer from       psoriasis worldwide[a];       approximately 5.5 million people in the UK are being treated for       asthma;[b] and rheumatoid arthritis       affects approximately 0.5-1.0% of the population.
[c] These and other       inflammatory diseases are       currently treated with chronically administered non-specific drugs, which       primarily control damage       rather than impacting on the underlying drivers of disease.
In contrast, a       short course of EtxB can       turn off these processes for long periods,[1,4,6] resetting the balance       between inflammation and       normal physiology.
[4,5] This is a novel and exciting new paradigm for       treatment.
Williams spun out the EtxB patent portfolio (1999), subsequently rolled       into the formation of Trident       Pharmaceuticals Inc,[d] established in 2006 to bring EtxB (company code       HF1020) through Phase       II trials before seeking a large pharmaceutical partner.
Williams remains       an integral part of the       team and KWS (see below) has performed all the preclinical work on EtxB.
All 11 substantiating       papers cited on the Trident website were published by Williams.
Trident       generated GMP material       (2008-2011) and tested this in formal GLP acute and repeat dose toxicology       studies in rodents and       primates (completed in 2011).
It was found to be safe and in 2011 the MHRA       approved a clinical       trials application (CTA) for a Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers.
Following completion of Phase       Ia, in 2013 the MHRA approved a CTA for a Phase II study [text removed         for publication].
As with       all new drugs, the process of getting them to market takes years, but EtxB       has already passed       many of the major hurdles.
Press coverage of its potential impact included       articles in international       newspapers, television and radio.
[e] Other companies including Hunter       Immunology are       developing approaches to mimic the effects of EtxB using novel peptides       that target the same       receptor.
[f]     The underlying research and the experience gained by Williams of       developing EtxB directly gave       rise to the formation of KWS BioTest Ltd. Coverage of his work on EtxB       established him as a       leader in disease efficacy and mechanism of action studies, and repeated       requests for work came       in from companies wanting to access these models:            Williams formed KWS BioTest in 2004,[g] with Professor Day (veterinary         pathology).
KWS received &#163;200k of investment from a Government Challenge Fund[h]         to employ         scientists and commercial management and respond to these requests.
KWS is now a leading partner for high quality drug discovery and         efficacy in Europe, an         achievement that was recognised by the award of the 2012 South West         Biomedical iNet         award for outstanding business achievement.
[i] KWS runs validated in           vitro and in vivo         models of human disease in inflammation, autoimmunity, pain and         infection, all of which are         founded on the academic work of the Williams laboratory and other groups         within Bristol.
The success of KWS is based on offering in-depth scientific expertise and       analysis of the sort that       is lacking in large contract research organisations, while providing       service and data quality that are       lacking from academia (ISO9001 accredited, GLP led).
These activities have       generated substantial       commercial impact directly within KWS and for partner companies, and have       contributed to the       discovery of new drugs now in clinical trials and development (details of       which are confidential).
Since 2004, KWS has carried out experimental studies for more than 75       different companies (39%       UK, 44% EU, 12% US, 5% rest-of-the-world; 57% small, 24% medium and 19%       large pharma).
[j]       In the case of small companies, this work has been absolutely critical as       they typically lack       expertise and facilities to carry out pharmacology testing.
In the case of       medium and large pharma,       partners want the expertise that it can offer, recognising that       outsourcing is a more cost-effective       and ethical approach to drug discovery.
[k]     Dr Sean Mason (Senior Group Leader at UCB) stated "KWS have provided         excellent, high quality         scientific support for several projects, covering a range of diverse         activities including complex         immune cell-based assays and imaging studies, which together with their         prompt and detailed         feedback has benefited several of our projects".
The ability of KWS       to provide in vivo efficacy       models that are validated with control drugs, and which are run regularly,       has a clear 3Rs impact.
Since its formation, KWS has expanded and grown as evidenced by:            Increased turnover from [text removed for publication].[j].
Profits have grown from [text removed for publication].
KWS employs [text removed for publication], and during 2012         contributed [text removed for           publication] of income to the University of Bristol.
KWS has become a significant exporter (over [text removed for           publication] in the last three         years).
Strategic partnership with Quotient Bioresearch facilitating further         exports from these         companies.
