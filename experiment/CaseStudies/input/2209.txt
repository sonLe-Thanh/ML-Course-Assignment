     Newcastle research into low-energy waste treatment technologies has       transformed waste       treatment practices in the personal care product industry (PCP), which led       to the construction of an       AASB treatment plant in China and design/construction of similar new       plants at factories in France,       China and Indonesia.
The Suzhou (China) plant has reduced sludge       production by 20%, CO2       emissions by 28%, and chemical use by 30% since start-up in 2012.
The       research has expanded       the implementation of novel reduced-energy treatment methodologies into       the UK water industry.
a) Change in policy &amp; practice in wastewater treatment for the         global PCP industry     Newcastle's work has achieved a policy and practice change in biological       wastewater treatment       within the PCP industry, which resulted from the development of new       treatment technologies for       the industry and a changed perception of "wastes" to "resources" in the       minds of industry decision-       makers (E1, E2).
L'Oreal, a world-leader in the beauty industry has more than 70,000       employees, 41 plants, 600       patents per year and sales exceeding &#8364;22.5 billion in 2012.
The company's       water consumption is       equally large, reaching 3 billion m3 (an equivalent to a city       of 130,000 people), and ~10% of all the       energy used in a typical factory goes to waste treatment when traditional       treatment processes are       used.
The scale of these problems prompted L'Oreal to perform joint       research with Newcastle       University in ENERMIN, which was aimed at reducing energy consumption in       PCP wastewater       treatment (E1).
This work was consistent with L'Oreal's commitment       to improving environmental       systems and reducing their carbon footprint, which is consistent with       long-term goals for their       industry.
The Global Environment, Health &amp; Safety Director of L'Oreal       stated that (E2):     "Work with colleagues at Newcastle has helped fuel our own efforts at         changing the way wastes         are viewed and handled in the PCP industry, hopefully making sustainable         energy production from         wastes a central tenet in waste management across the company and         industry.
L'Oreal are         committed to an eco-responsible approach as regards the impact of its         activity and aim for         excellence in terms of environmental performance.
As part of its 10-year         strategy (2005-2015) to         reduce its ecological footprint, L'Oreal has set itself an ambitious         goal for its plants to halve         greenhouse gas emissions.
The implementation of novel technologies from         joint work with         Newcastle will significantly contribute to this goal."
Following joint research, the optimal solution was AASB, which combined       anaerobic and aerobic       processes and had never been used in the PCP industry (E1).
L'Oreal       stated (E2):     "...research conducted with Newcastle between 2008 and 2012 developed         a variety of innovative         waste treatment options, including anaerobic-aerobic sequence reactors.
Newcastle laboratory         studies showed that it can reduce energy consumption by almost 70%         relative to traditional aerobic         treatment systems and still meet discharge standards.
This basic reactor         configuration has now         been implemented at full-scale in the factory within L'Oreal Asia at         Suzhou, China".
The Suzhou wastewater plant treats approximately 82,000m3 of       wastewater per year and employs       400 people.
This new treatment system is designed to ultimately save       greater than 20% energy,       80% use of chemicals, reduce sludge by 70% and improve the effluent       quality by 50%.
Since mid-2012,       L'Oreal has thus far reduced sludge by 20%, CO2 emissions by       28%, and the use of       chemicals by 30% (E3).
Based on this success, AASB plants are under       development for other       factories elsewhere in China (E2), Indonesia and France (E3, E4),       and are being considered for all       41 L'Oreal factories around the world.
The Suzhou AASB plant was awarded       the Industrial Water       Stewardship Award at the April 2013 Global Water Summit held in Seville,       Spain (E3, E4), an       event attended by 450-500 industrial world leaders and highlighted AASB to       289 different global       companies (E5).
Looking ahead to meet the company's continued global sustainable       development targets, L'Oreal       declared (E2):     "It is anticipated that the joint work with Newcastle University will         promote the use of novel-energy-efficient 		technologies across industry and a positive significant impact         in sustainable industrial         treatment at a global level.
This will help us towards our goals of         reduced greenhouse gas         emission, and responsible and sustainable growth."
b) Introduction of novel reduced-energy treatment technologies into         the UK water industry     Northumbrian Water Limited (NWL) provides water and sewerage services to       2.7 million people in       the northeast of England and water services to 1.8 million people in the       southeast of England.
NWL's collaboration with Newcastle University is central to their policy       of reducing energy       consumption and carbon emissions by developing a new generation of       low-energy wastewater       treatment processes.
The Research &amp; Development Manager at NWL       stresses the importance of       Newcastle's research [E7]:     "We value the research conducted at Newcastle which is rooted in         understanding wastewater         treatment systems at a deep and fundamental level, yet in doing so         provides solutions and         innovations at which are practical to industry.
Over the last decade we         have collaborated with         Newcastle University in a number of research areas....including low         temperature anaerobic         digestion, microbial fuel cells and low energy nitrification.
There has         been many successful         outcomes to this research including the first example of hydrogen         generation in a pilot scale         microbial electrolysis cell powered by domestic wastewater operational         between 2011-12."
Their commitment to establish a pilot plant facility at one of their       operational sites for use in the       Newcastle research is supported by NWL Chief Executive [E6]:     "We propose to make available a waste water pilot plant test-bed         facility, which we will design and         build according to your requirements, for parameterising and testing         your models; we will provide         access to operational sites, personnel and information.
We estimate the         in-kind value of this         support to be &#163;524,000 over the life of the project."
