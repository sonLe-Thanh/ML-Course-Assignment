     The classification techniques developed at Reading [5-8] became essential       components of the Eprocurement system, SpendInsight, which was launched in       February 2010 by @UK plc.
The system uses artificial intelligence       techniques to enable e-procurers to analyse their purchases and identify       potentially significant savings.
@UK plc subsequently launched the       GreenInsight system, which again incorporated the artificial intelligence       techniques developed by Reading.
GreenInsight estimates the carbon       footprint of products and procurement activities in order to help       businesses develop environmentally friendly procurement policies.
@UK PLC benefits from the launch of SpendInsight and GreenInsight     SpendInsight immediately increased @UK plc's analysing capacity; within       the first two months of launching the SpendInsight website, @UK plc had       analysed over &#163;35 billion in spend, which was an increase from the &#163;16       billion it had analysed the previous year [a].
SpendInsight also       significantly improved @UK plc's efficiency, producing results faster, at       less cost and with better results than previous systems.
@UK plc was       working with the NHS London Procurement Partnership (LPP) and using the       leading spend analysis system at the time, they had taken 2 years to       analyse less than 25% of all of London's spend, costing around &#163;500,000       [a].
In 2010, they implemented SpendInsight and in 6 months had analysed       London's entire spend, with better results, for significantly less cost       [a].
On September 4th, 2013, @UK plc announced that they had agreed       a &#163;3.4 million conditional licensing agreement with Tungsten Corporation       plc for SpendInsight [b].Tungsten will market the software to its 122       global clients as TungstenAnalytics and @UK will receive up front       establishment fees and installation costs of around half a million pounds       [b].
The @UK Chairman has stated that; "SpendInsight and GreenInsight have       revolutionised our business.
SpendInsight is recognised as still being       globally unique 3 years after development, and we just won a &#163; 3.4m       contract where the customer is licencing SpendInsight.
This is 1.5x our       current turnover.
Additionally the SpendInsight capablity has been a major       factor in our relationship with Visa and the global roll out of our       marketplace technology where SpendInsight delivers an instant business       case for buying organisations."
[c]     Taxpayers and NHS benefit from savings identified through SpendInsight     SpendInsight was used to identify considerable savings for the NHS London       Procurement Partnership (LPP) - both soft process savings and hard       cashable savings - and provided impetus to standardise and centralise       their e-procurement across the Trusts' back office.
SpendInsight also       identified which were the key suppliers and key commodities, a process       that had the effect of driving both user and supplier acceptance of the       change to e-procurement.
Over the course of the project the researchers       obtained and processed NHS procurement data for 73 NHS trusts in the UK,       the majority centred in London.
The SpendInsight system was used to       analyse the purchase orders, invoices and contracts of the different       organisations, identify equivalent purchases and benchmark the best       possible prices for each product, and identify savings.
The analysis found that significant savings could be made within the NHS       with relatively simple changes in procurement behaviour.
For example, the       amalgamation of small ad-hoc orders into larger, less frequent orders       could standardise product choices and facilitate lower-costs for       guaranteed high-volume deals.
One NHS Trust saved &#163;320,000 in 2011 alone       by switching to one supplier of examination gloves and ordering 2 choices       of glove rather than 20 [d].
@UK PLC provided analysis services to the National Audit Office (NAO) to       assist them in the preparation of their 2011 report on the procurement of       consumables by NHS hospital trusts.
The National Audit Office (NAO)       included @UK plc's SpendInsight analysis in their 2011 analysis of the NHS       Trust's procurement and spending on consumables [e].
The NAO concluded       that if the procurement system was utilised across all NHS Trusts in       England, they could "make overall savings of at least &#163;500 million, around       10% of the total NHS consumables expenditure of &#163;4.6 billion" [c].
After the initial analysis using SpendInsight in 2012, the Royal       Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust decided to continue using the system to       analyse their quarterly spend for 2013.
The Principal Procurement Manager       stated that "with an addressable spend of &#163; 60 million, to be able to save       even one percent of that is a benefit".
The Trust has received data from       their spending review and they "appear to have clawed back &#163;100,000 as a       result of actions taken from [their] first pass" [f].
Businesses, governments, academic institutions and others benefit from         SpendInsight and GreenInsight analyses     @UK plc works with organisations all over the world and has now used       SpendInsight to analyse "over &#163;67 billion in spend, and millions of       products from 100's of thousands of companies" [i].
The following is a       confidential list provided by @UK of users of SpendInsight and       GreenInsight, which shows that governments, health authorities,       multi-national companies and academic institutions have all benefitted       from the use of SpendInsight and GreenInsight.
