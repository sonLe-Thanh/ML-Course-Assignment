     Miller is a prolific writer, poet and essayist who contributes to public       dialogue in and between countries, inspires the professional development       of emerging writers, and is committed to enhancing the international       profile of Caribbean literature and culture.

Miller was shortlisted for the 2008 Dylan Thomas Prize; received the       Institute of Jamaica's Silver Musgrave Award in 2009; and was appointed as       one of the six judges for the 2012 Commonwealth Book Prize.
His novel The         Same Earth won the 2008 Una Marson Prize for Literature and was       shortlisted for the Scottish Arts Council's Book of the Year Award in       2009.
His third poetry collection, A Light Song of Light, was       shortlisted for the 2010 Jonathan Llewelyn Rhys Prize and the 2010 Bocas       Prize for Caribbean Literature.
Two of his poems were selected as Poem of       the Week for The Times and The Guardian respectively       (10.8.2010 and 8.8.2011).
In 2010 Miller served as Poet in Residence for the British Poetry Archive       and for the StAnza International Poetry Festival in St Andrews.
Between       2011 and 2013 he was invited to speak at 26 festivals and literary events       in 18 countries.
International activities in the REF period built on his       established position as an enabler and speaker with UNESCO, for whom he       delivered writers' workshops and public talks throughout the Caribbean       between 2003 and 2005, addressing and teaching around 1000 people       altogether.
In 2012 Miller was commissioned by the Manchester Literature       Festival to write a suite of poems in response to the exhibition `Hockney       to Hogarth: A Rake's Progress' at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester       (October 2012 to February 2013).
He gave a reading of the poems to an       audience of 50 at the Whitworth Gallery in September 2012.
Since then the       poems have been available on the Manchester         Literature Festival website, and downloaded over 750 times.
Miller hosted seven programmes on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Scotland in       association with the Scottish Poetry Library and their `Poetry 2012:       Written World' project, which sought to broadcast a poem from every       country participating in the London 2012 Olympic Games.
These shows were       also released as podcasts and received a total of 26,607 iPlayer download       requests.
In 2013 Miller was commissioned to work with the composer Cheryl       Frances-Hoad on the libretto for a new work for soprano, mezzo soprano,       baritone and piano to celebrate the centenary of Benjamin Britten's birth.
The work will be premiered at the Wigmore Hall in November 2013 by the       Prince Consort.
It was co-commissioned by the Prince Consort and Wigmore       Hall, with the support of Andr&#233; Hoffmann, president of the Fondation         Hoffmann, a Swiss organization dedicated to promoting sustainable       development, international governance, education and culture.
Impact on professional development of emerging writers       Miller has contributed to the professional development of writers through       a range of formal creative writing programmes, leading workshops in       Singapore as part of the British Council-supported 2011         World Voices Series, at the Wordsworth Trust in Cumbria (February       2012), and at the Bocas         Festival in Trinidad (May 2012).
He was also an invited speaker at       the Emerging         Writers' Festival in Melbourne (2011).
Numbers of participants at       these events varied widely, from c.15 at the Singapore workshop to over       1,000 at the final reading in Sydney.
He has participated in several cultural exchanges run by the       International Writing Program (IWP) at Iowa State University, which is       supported by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, US State       Department.
The purpose of the IWP is to bring emerging American writers       into contact with other cultures through residencies, writing workshops,       performance tours and other events.
Following his appointment as Writer         in Residence at Iowa from September to December 2007, in May 2008       Miller was given an IWP leadership role in the third New         Symposium, held on the island of Paros, Greece, for which the IWP       convened a group of international writers to engage in a week of dialogue       and debate.
In April 2011 he was one of eight international writers       invited to participate in Writers         in Motion, an IWP tour of the Mid-Atlantic and the American South       where historical crises and upheavals (both natural and social) had taken       place, and to contribute a reflective travel essay on `Grief Spaces',       which is to be published as part of his forthcoming essay collection, Writing         Down the Vision.
Also in 2011 he co-taught an IWP creative writing       course online.
Most recently he was appointed Artist-in-Residence at the University of       the West Indies at Mona (2013).
Impact on Caribbean literature and culture       In 2007 Miller edited the Carcanet New Caribbean Poetry: An Anthology,       which showcases the writing of both newly established and emerging poets,       making some of these internationally available for the first time.
His       editing skills were highly praised in the Caribbean Review of Books       for May 2008: `a thoughtful compiler is a creator.
Pride and tradition,       hard-won, prepared the way for Miller's companionability and ease'.
Since       its publication the new poets included in it have achieved notable       success.
Christian Campbell's debut title Running the Dusk (2010)       won the Aldeburgh First Collection Prize; Loretta Collins Klobah won the       2012 Bocas prize for Poetry after publishing her first collection, The         Twelve Foot Neon Woman (2011); and Tanya Shirley's first collection       She Who Sleeps with Bones (2009) was named a Jamaican bestseller in       the year of its publication.
Interviews and articles on all three of these       poets, as well of others in the anthology, point up the significance of       their inclusion in Miller's book.
Miller has a direct impact on the delivery of curricula in schools in the       English-speaking Caribbean through his role as editor (since 2011) of the       Heinemann         Caribbean Writers' Series.
The Heinemann series currently offers 29       titles, many of which are prescribed texts for the Caribbean Secondary       Education Certificate, Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE)       and GCSE.
The syllabus for these qualifications is formulated by `Panels       of subject specialists drawn from those groups responsible for the design       and the implementation of curriculum &#8212; classroom teachers, members of       regional universities and other tertiary institutions' (CAPE         website).
Approximately 4,000-6,000 candidates across the region sit       the CAPE exams each year.
Popular choices from the Heinemann list on the       syllabus include Curdella Forbes' Songs of Silence, Earl       Lovelace's The Wine of Astonishment, and Paulette Ramsay's Aunt         Jem.
In 2012 Miller became a founder member of the Caribbean Literature Action       Group (CALAG), which met in Trinidad in March 2012, hosted by the British       Council and the Commonwealth Foundation, to address the state of Caribbean       Publishing today.
In April 2013, CALAG developed and launched CaribLit (www.cariblit.org) a new website for       writers and publishers offering practical advice and industry updates on       publishing, marketing, distribution and bookselling in the Caribbean.
