     Process from research to impact     Tobramycin guidelines: In 1991 Dr Thomson held an NHS post in Glasgow       that included responsibility for producing drug therapy guidelines; at       this time she introduced a computer-based data analysis service to help       individualise tobramycin therapy for patients treated by the Glasgow       Cystic Fibrosis Unit (GCFU).
Dosage guidelines, based on 12 hourly dosing,       were generated from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the data       produced by this service (Reference 5) and were adopted for routine       clinical use by the GCFU in 1999.
In the Edinburgh Cystic Fibrosis Unit,       traditional 8-hourly dosing regimens continued to be used.
However, an       audit of tobramycin therapy in this unit during 2008-10 identified major       problems with this approach, and it was decided that a pilot study using       the Glasgow guidelines should be conducted.
The success of this pilot       resulted in the GCFU guidelines being adopted for routine use in the       Edinburgh Unit in 2011.
Vancomycin guidelines: NHS changes to target vancomycin concentration       ranges prompted the adult vancomycin research, the results of which were       incorporated into the 2008-9 "Prescribing Guidance" booklet used within       NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GGC) and edited by Dr Thomson.
Around       the same time, a national audit (Reference 1) demonstrated that the       vancomycin guidelines used throughout Scotland were unfit for purpose.
Following publication of the research in early 2009 (Reference 2), Dr       Thomson was invited to present the rationale behind the NHS GGC vancomycin       and gentamicin guidelines at the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group       (SAPG) Antimicrobial Management Team Networking Event in June 2009.
At       that meeting, it was agreed to adopt the adult vancomycin guidelines for       use throughout NHS Scotland and the gentamicin guidelines (also developed       by Dr Thomson) as one of two options.
These guidelines, together with       online calculators created by Dr Thomson to facilitate accurate       calculation of antibiotic doses, were published on the SAPG website in       October 2009 (Source A).
Dr Thomson and Professor Marion Bennie were awarded a grant in 2010 from       the Scottish Healthcare Acquired Infections (HAI) Task Force to evaluate       the implementation of these national guidelines.
Further grants were       awarded in 2011 and 2012 to create new resources and educational material       to support guideline implementation.
These resources comprised specialised       documentation for prescribing and monitoring gentamicin therapy, which was       introduced within NHSGGC in 2012 and made available nationally in June       2013.
New online dose "calculators" were created and released nationally       in June 2013 and e-learning material was developed for use nationally       through the "LearnProf6da" platform.
The earlier neonatal vancomycin research (Reference 3) formed the basis       of vancomycin guidelines previously used by neonatal intensive care units       (NICUs) within Glasgow.
In May 2009, Dr Thomson was asked by Professor       Craig Williams, a consultant microbiologist from the Royal Hospital for       Sick Children, Glasgow, to develop new, continuous infusion dosage       regimens to solve underdosing and practical problems that were being       experienced with the traditional, intermittent infusions.
The new       guidelines developed by Dr Thomson were tested in a pilot study in June       2011 and then adopted into routine clinical practice.
Oral presentation of       this work at the Neonatal Paediatric Pharmacists Group Meeting in 2011       prompted interest from other NICUs in the UK.
Types of Impact            The research has had an impact on government (NHS) policy through the         introduction of national guidelines for antibiotic use.
The new guidelines improve the quality of patient care by decreasing         the time to achieve therapeutic antibiotic concentrations, reducing         patient trauma and reducing staff workload.
Quality improvement studies identified barriers to effective         implementation of therapeutic guidelines and developed resources to         overcome these barriers.
The research has principally influenced healthcare in Scotland.
Through       publication of the work, the findings have also been implemented in other       parts of the UK and attracted interest from healthcare practitioners in       Europe and the USA.
Changes to NHS guidelines and resources for staff     There have been changes to antibiotic dose and monitoring guidelines used       within the NHS.
New vancomycin dosage guidelines for adult patients have been adopted         throughout Scotland (Source A) and implemented locally in other parts of         the UK (Sources B, C and D).
Resources and guidelines developed through the Quality Improvement         projects are recommended for use throughout NHS Scotland and can be         accessed by NHS and other healthcare staff from outside Scotland to         support the development of their local guidelines (Source A).
Guidelines for vancomycin administration by continuous infusion in         neonates won the "Best Innovation" prize at the UK Neonatal and         Paediatric Pharmacists Group meeting in 2011.
They have been adopted by         NICUs in Glasgow and Cambridge (Source E and Source F).
Guidelines for tobramycin administration have been adopted by the         Edinburgh Cystic Fibrosis Unit, (Source G), and have been in use in the         Glasgow unit prior to and since 2008.
These two units cover the major         population of Scotland.
Improvements to patient care     There has been an improvement in the quality of patient care through more       efficient achievement of target concentrations.
The adult vancomycin dosage guidelines increased the likelihood of         achieving safe and effective concentrations within the first 4 days of         therapy from 22% to 71% (Reference 2).
The neonatal continuous vancomycin infusion guidelines increased the         percentage of concentrations within target ranges from 46% to 82%         (Source E and reference 4).
Satisfactory peak concentrations of tobramycin in the Edinburgh Cystic         Fibrosis Unit increased from 31% to 74% and satisfactory predose         concentrations from 93% to 100% (Source G).
Patient trauma caused by repeated venepuncture and the workload of       doctors, nurses and pharmacists have been reduced.
The neonatal vancomycin guidelines reduced the need for additional         venepuncture from 54% to 7% of blood samples and made the concentration         measurements easier to interpret (Source E and Ref 4).
The tobramycin guidelines reduced the mean number of dose adjustments         per patient in Edinburgh from 1.4 to 0.45 and sets of blood samples per         patient from 2.5 to 1.5 (Source G).
