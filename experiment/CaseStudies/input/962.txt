     The distinctive impact of the research is its challenge to conventional       wisdom, which accords market freedoms' primacy over social guarantees, by       illuminating the potentially negative consequences for economic and social       sustainability.
The research demonstrates the need for institutions and       resources capable of addressing the negative externalities of continued       marketization, and identifies indicative examples of these.
The overall findings on labour market flexibility have enhanced policy       maker and practitioner understanding of the relationship between policies       promoting marketization and the often negative outcomes in terms of       uncertainty and insecurity in labour markets This is attested to by the       Director of the Research Department, European Trade Union Institute       (ETUI), "ETUI provides evidence based research to the trade union movement       in the European Union, and the results from the GUSTO project are a vital       part of the documentation we today use to inform trade unions about       trends, consequences and ways forward".
The research was communicated to a broad audience through a range of       activities led by Crouch, including:            The production of European Policy Briefs distilling the key policy         messages of GUSTO's overall analysis and findings, and on collective         bargaining and immigration, as required by the European Commission,         including 3 (co)authored by Crouch, 3 (co)authored by Marginson and 6         (co)authored by Meardi.
The Briefs are available from the project's         website (www.gusto-project.eu).
Two         Briefs (one by Crouch, the other by Marginson and Meardi) have         subsequently been published by DG Research of the European Commission on         its website:         http://ec.europa.eu/research/social-sciences/projects/398_en.html.
Crouch has been invited to present relevant findings from GUSTO as an         opening keynote speech at the conference on inequality being organized         by the European Commission to mark the start of the Greek Presidency in         Athens 20 June 2014.
Organising a high-level practitioner conference, together with the         ETUI, in Brussels in February, 2012.
The 118 participants were drawn         from the European Commission, other EU bodies, national administrations,         trade unions, employers' organisations and academia.
Key findings,         including immigration and the economics of migrant flows, and the         possible gains of collective bargaining, were presented.
Debate focused         on the need to move beyond the previous pre-occupation with         `flexicurity' and to frame EU- and national level policies and         interventions responding to the effects of intensified insecurity in the         labour market.
Marginson's findings on the responses of collective bargaining and social       dialogue to the financial crisis, engaged European and national-level       policy makers and practitioners and stimulated debate and informed       understanding through activities, which included two high-level       roundtables in the UK organised by WBS's Industrial Relations Research       Unit: (i) `Employment relations through and beyond recession' March 29th,       2010; (ii) `Challenges facing employment relations in the public sector'       March 20th, 2012.
Discussions involved senior officials from       Acas, CIPD, EEF, TUC and other employment relations professionals.
Marginson's research underpinned two chapters (2 and 3) of the European       Commission's report `Industrial Relations in Europe Report, 2010'       (http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=575&amp;langId=en),       and its finding on the key role of social dialogue and collective       bargaining has influenced the thinking of European policy makers, as cited       by the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion       in a speech, 3 March 2011.
Key findings were also presented at a launch       conference organised by the European Commission on 17-18th       March 2011, in Brussels with Social Affairs Commissioner Andor and       Marginson as keynote speakers.
138 participants from across all 27 EU       member states attended, including senior officials from government,       employers' organisations and trade unions.
In looking at the relationship between labour market insecurity and       migration, Meardi's research contributed to current policy debates by       engaging union representatives, policy makers and ethnic associations on       the finding that social regulations and policies are complementary, rather       than alternatives, to beneficial migration flows.
Stakeholder       understanding of the topic was enhanced through:            A practice-orientated workshop with employer associations (CECOT),         trade unions (CCOO) and ethnic associations (Federaci&#243;n de Entidades         Latinoamericanas de Catalu&#241;aon) migration in construction held in         Barcelona, on the 11th of February 2010.
