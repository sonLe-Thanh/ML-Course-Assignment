     Pathways to Impact: These were designed to promote dialogue, and       the translation of research findings for policymakers, including UNICEF       and others [1].
In the period prior to 2008, this was achieved via:             Connections with user organisations.
Green was invited to work         for 14 months (2004-5) on secondment from Manchester within DFID's         Policy Division.
This positioning provided the basis from which her         impact-oriented social policy work evolved.
The convening of a specially selected international policy           audience at a two day Foreign and Commonwealth Office `Wilton         Park' meeting (2005) `Strengthening National responses to Children         Affected by HIV and AIDS...' Green was commissioned to provide a key         background paper [1].
The presentation of findings to a biennial meeting of policy         stakeholders from leading agencies around children and AIDS in the form         of a background paper, written by Green, for the Global Partner's Forum         (2006).
The development of a two DFID commissioned policy papers on         the potential contribution of state social protection for children         affected by HIV and AIDS (2007-8).
The translation of research findings via engagement with policy forums       provides a bridge between the research and the later uptake of core       recommendations by the African Union.
This uptake was part of a longer       term transition in programming around social policy and children, which       occurred at the same time as social protection approaches were becoming       mainstreamed in policy discourses.
For example, UNICEF's 2004 guidance on       supporting children affected by HIV and AIDS &#8212; `Framework for the       Protection, Care And Support of Orphans And Vulnerable Children Living in       a World with HIV and AIDS' &#8212; highlighted five zones of intervention, of       which community and family structures were the most important [2].
Crucially, this framework failed to consider how children's vulnerability       and poverty might be related to limited state action.
Instead, the       responsibility for supporting children affected by HIV/AIDS fell on       families and communities, presented as `traditional' community safety       nets.
Green's research instead proposed that child vulnerability is not       merely constituted by the presence of HIV and AIDS alone, but also through       the absence of state systems for supporting children and their families.
The research recommended that policy responses should promote the       development of state capacities for the delivery of social welfare,       particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and this must include sufficient       budget allocations for its effective delivery.
Impact 1 - UNICEF: This impact was set in motion 2005-6, and has       continued throughout the period 2008-13.
In 2007, as a result of Green's       contribution to the Global Partners Forum (2006) that built on the Wilton       Park (2005) discussions, UNICEF revised their guidelines.
As corroborated:       "there was a substantial shift in the policy of UNICEF, and other         international donors, from 2005- 2006 onwards, with much greater         importance being given to the role of the state in building social         welfare capacity to support children and families affected by AIDS"       [9] The revised guidelines were set out in UNICEF's 2007 report `Enhanced       Protection for Children Affected by AIDS...' [2].
Although support       for families and communities continued to receive attention, this new       document made the specific case for strengthening state systems and       prioritising social welfare as part of national programmes, rather than       leaving social welfare provision as the sole preserve of oftentimes       piecemeal NGO interventions.
Whilst Green's background work at these fora,       alongside the recommendations taken forward, should rightly be considered       the product of the participating group, the link between the position       outlined by Green in the two papers, and the subsequent change of tack by       UNICEF are evident.
The former head of UNICEF's AIDS section suggests         "The work of Professor Green and others contributed to a crucial shift         in the strategies and policies of UNICEF, and other international         donors...
The Wilton Park conference &#8212; for which Professor Green wrote         the background paper &#8212; was particularly important as the State's role in         the creating social welfare capacity was re-emphasised..." [7]     This shift in UNICEF policy is part of an wider social policy transition,       on-going in the period 2008- 13, where cash transfers have been proposed       as a form of social support, and it is this wider framework within which       Green's research has operated and to which it has contributed.
These       changes are particularly significant given UNICEF's role as the lead       agency in setting the parameters of `good practice' around programming for       the welfare of children.
The change in this guidance is significant       because it has opened a space for the reinsertion of the state into social       policy programming, particularly in the African case where development       agencies have tended to bypass the state and to channel resources through       NGOs, claiming that state support is unnecessary because indigenous family       and community networks already `accommodate' the vulnerable.
Significantly, this overall shift can be seen in recent documents, such       as `Taking Evidence to Impact...' published by UNICEF/IATT (Inter-Agency       Task Team for children affected by HIV and AIDS) in 2011, at the Global       Partners Forum in New York [3].
This report took the 2004/2007 UNICEF       framework as its starting point, but then used recent evidence to indicate       that social welfare systems are a priority area.
From 2012, IATT has had a       Working Group on Strengthening Child and Family Welfare Systems,       co-chaired by World Vision and USAID.
Thus, as the former head of UNICEF's       AID section notes: "Professor Green's contribution to a re-focussing on         the role of the state has been significant, and can be seen still today"       [7], and this is confirmed by the Senior Policy Adviser, Vulnerable       Children and HIV &amp; AIDS at World Vision International, who confirms       that, subsequent to Green's work:     "UNICEF and other donors, particularly USAID/ PEPFAR, have given         greater emphasis to the importance of strengthening state social welfare         systems and less emphasis to the role of NGOs.
This shift can be seen in         UNICEF's 2011 policy document ... which prioritised social welfare         systems strengthening `recognizing that the movement from pilots to           sustainable programmes can only be achieved when the relevant           government ministries are capacitated, equipped and financed to           oversee service delivery and track impacts'.
It can also be seen         in USAID/PEPFAR's 2012 Guidance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children         Programming which states that, in line with Green's work, `PEPFAR           programs should prioritize within their country context ...
Supporting           host-country governments to initiate, expand, or be innovative in           their social protection initiatives at both the policy and operational           levels.'...
Green's contribution to this policy shift through her         research, publications and involvement in policy discussions were         considerable and the long-term impact can be seen still today.
The         single most important impact of Green's work is the recognition of the         need for governments in Africa, supported by the international         community, to strengthen state social welfare systems."
[4][9][10] (policy         docs underlined)     Impact 2 - African Union: Green's ongoing work continues to make       the case for considering how the design of states can limit capacities for       addressing the social welfare needs of citizens.
She was commissioned by       DFID to produce an analytical paper as background to the Second Session of       the African Union Conference of Ministers of Social Development in       Khartoum (21-25 September 2010) [5].
The paper examined core constraints       on the capacities of member states to implement the Social Policy       Framework for Africa (2008).
Green's recommendations reiterated priorities       from previous research regarding the importance of state capacity and       adequate fiscal space.
They were adopted by member states, with the AU       Executive Council endorsing, in particular, the recommendation that: "The         implementation of the Social Policy Framework for Africa should be         accelerated at national, regional and continental levels"; and       requesting that the AU Commission: "Facilitate capacity building         activities for social policy analysis in Member States and devise         strategies for the successful implementation of the Social Policy         Framework for Africa (SPF)" [6].
Once again, Green's work had proved       important in setting out an agenda for considering the importance of state       capacity in relation to ongoing welfare outcomes, particularly in       Africa, and not only in relation to AIDS.
As HelpAge       International's Head of Strategic Alliances confirms:     "HelpAge and UNICEF have a MOU for joint work and policy influence &#8212;         with much greater importance being given to the role of the state in         building social welfare capacity to support families affected by AIDS.
This also supported the uptake of core recommendations (for instance a         `minimum package' of child and old age pensions, disability benefits and         health inputs together with reinforcing the role of social institutions)         by the African Union.
This uptake was part of a longer term transition         in programming and policy prioritisation running concurrently with         growing international commitment to social protection packages including         the concept to the `social protection floor'.
Professor Green's ongoing         work has continued to make the case for considering how the design of         states can limit &#8212; or enhance &#8212; national capacities for the social         welfare of citizens."
