     Ataxia telangiectasia is a devastating disease that affects children from       a young age.
The inherited nature of the disease has meant that advances       in our understanding of the underlying genetics has played a vital role in       diagnosis and effective assessment of risk of related conditions in these       patients, and it is here that the work of Professor Malcolm Taylor's       laboratory at the University of Birmingham has been vital over the past       two decades, and notably within the assessment period (when they have       confirmed 70 new diagnoses of ataxia telangiectasia in the British Isles).
The Taylor group has consistently worked towards defining how furthering       knowledge of the specific genetic mutations underlying A-T in each       individual patient can be put to use in advising the family on prognosis       and longer term outcomes.
A-T is not the only recessively inherited ataxia condition, with others       such as Friedreich's ataxia (a degenerative disease that primarily affects       the nervous system and the heart), spastic ataxia or abetalipoproteinemia       (which interferes with the normal absorption of fat and fat-soluble       vitamins from food) also occurring at a young age.
These conditions need       differential diagnosis so that patients can be treated appropriately as       quickly as possible.
Prof Taylor's team has been involved in identifying       ATM mutations since its discovery in the mid-1990s, and gained widespread       credibility as the laboratory that would confirm the increased sensitivity       of possible A-T patients' chromosomesto ionising radiation, one of the       hallmarks of the disease.
Pediatricians, neurologists and immunologists       nationally and internationally send blood samples from their patients       direct to the Taylor laboratories in the University of Birmingham for       rapid results to help diagnose their patients, as directed by either the       A-T Society or the documentation relating to the UK NHS National       Specialised Commissioning Team relating to diagnosis and care in children       and adults [1-2].
Their laboratory techniques allow them to provide a       comprehensive cellular analysis of the effects of the ATM mutations in       each specific A-T patient, all of which is returned directly to the       patient's consultant to inform treatment.
Originally, the gold standard       for confirmation of diagnosis of A-T had been simply the identification of       two pathogenic ATM mutations.
Building on their research studies, the       Taylor group demonstrated a key clinical criteria was actually whether       protein was or was not expressed.
The group's innovation in diagnosis was       to add to this test a cellular investigation when the mutations could be       classed as `leaky' (producing some normal ATM protein) or `missense'       mutation (producing some mutant ATM protein), and if protein is expressed       they also determine whether it has any functional activity.
This provides       further information to the centres caring for these patients on whether       the clinical phenotype might be milder, which therefore helps inform         and improve their clinical management.
Their work in diagnosis informed the establishment and development from       2009 of a national A-T management service.
Together with the AT Society of       the UK and Clinical Geneticists, Neurologists, Immunologists, Respiratory       Medicine, practitioners and others they have received National Specialised       Commissioning Team funding from April 1st 2009 to become the national A-T       diagnostic service for treatment [1], extended in 2012 to cover adults as       well as children [2].
This means that the Taylor laboratory is the         designated laboratory for confirmation of the diagnosis of AT across the         UK, and as part of differential diagnosis they are also the       designated laboratory for confirmation of the diagnosis of ataxia       telangiectasia like disorder (which they themselves had identified) and       oculomotor apraxia type 1.
As outlined by the Consultant Clinical       Geneticist and Clinical Lead, National Paediatric Ataxia-Telangiectasia       Clinic "the services provided by Professor Taylor are pivotal to the         work of the National Paediatric AT Clinic and the proper management of         patients with not just AT, but also ATLD and AOA1, as well as their         families.
These services are not available through any NHS Molecular         Genetics Service Laboratory or through any other Research Group in the         UK or Ireland."
[3].
They also offer this diagnostic service         internationally, and in the last three years have confirmed a total       of 30 new diagnoses for Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Lithuania,       India, Sri-Lanka, and Malaysia for the genetic diagnosis of A-T.
The       advanced genetic screening tests pioneered by this group are essential for       diagnosing the milder form of disease, and the genetic diagnosis directly       influences patient management, since it is only patients suffering from       A-T rather than the associated conditions who have increased risk of       cancer, and therefore need to be kept under lifelong surveillance for any       signs of a tumour, while others can be advised appropriately without the       added burden of concern.
The role of Prof Taylor's team as the key UK experts on A-T has driven       them to play an ongoing role in patient support.
As the Chief       Executive of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Society states in his letter of       support from Prof Taylor's impact [4], "Malcolm was responsible for         the first gathering of families affected by A-T in the UK.
Working with         a parent, ..., they sent a letter to all the families known to Malcolm         at the time, inviting them to a meeting.
From this meeting, the A-T         Society was born, and without Malcolm's ongoing and active support it         would not have survived and thrived in the way it has."
The A-T       Society represents and looks after over 95% of those diagnosed with the       condition, currently supporting 152 people with A-T in the UK and also 12       in the Republic of Ireland.
They credit this in large part to Prof       Taylor's contribution, stating "The fact that the Society is in active         contact with so many people reflects both the fact that when carrying         out laboratory confirmation of diagnoses, Malcolm usually recommends         contact with the Society".
Furthermore, the supportive information       distributed to their worldwide audience reached through their website       (currently visited by over 1500 individual users a month), social media       and newsletters has relied heavily on significant input from Prof Taylor:       "Malcolm was initially the provider of most of the Society's         information and still acts regularly as consultant on information         provision, the interpretation of research etc."
Prof Taylor also       attends A-T clinics for both adults and children to meet families there       and discuss their diagnoses, outlook and support available, as well as       speaking at the A-T family weekend organised by the A-T Society every       year.
This has made a major impact on patient experience of living with       their disease &#8212; as articulated in the letter of support from the A-T       Society: "Malcolm's concern for those with or awaiting a diagnosis of         A-T is such that he goes out of his way to ensure that certainty be         given as quickly and in as effective a manner as possible.
He follows         the lives of those he has diagnosed with interest and compassion and         frequently attends funerals.
He is loved and admired by many across the         community of those living with A-T in the UK and Ireland."
Critically, the work of the Taylor group has also had a major role in         national policy.
Their work demonstrated that absence of some       function in the ATM protein biasesthe development of cancer towards       non-lymphoid types in A-T patients, specifically toward breast cancer       development in surviving adults.
This also confers an approximately       doubling of risk of breast cancer in ATM mutation carriers, and a       five-fold increase risk in ATM carriers under 50 years of age.
As a direct       result of their work on breast cancer in A-T patients, from 2012 annual       MRI breast cancer screening is now offered to female AT patients from the       age of 25 years of age or from presentation (in milder cases of A-T).
A       clinical genetics consultant and member of the Advisory Committee for       Breast Cancer Screening in England (ACBCS) reviewed evidence in 2007 and       2010 for breast surveillance in these groups to make recommendations that       fed directly into the decision and current guidance, and states that she "relied         heavily on research work undertaken through the National Ataxia         Telangiectasia Clinic and in Malcolm Taylor's research laboratory"       [5], going on to affirm that "Professor Malcolm Taylor's experimental         work has provided evidence to explain many observations seen in clinical         practice.
His collaboration with other groups has ensured that         epidemiological studies have been comprehensively achieved and, as his         laboratory undertakes ATM mutation testing in the United Kingdom,         provided the necessary molecular evidence to support these findings...         His work on Ataxia Telangiectasia is key to the continued progress and         understanding between the clinic and the laboratory."
As a result of this report, the national Cancer Screening Programme       recognised in 2012 that A-T heterozygotes (those with only one mutated       gene) should be included with women who had four times the average risk of       breast cancer (moderate increased risk), and that A-T homozygotes (those       with both genes mutated) should be included in the highest risk group for       breast cancer, and confirmed that both would receive appropriate screening       [6,7].
This obviously has major ramifications for the support and       potentially life-saving surveillance available to A-T patients and genetic       carriers of the mutation.
