     Preserving, conserving and presenting Baul cultural heritage:     Chatterjee's research contributes to processes of commemoration,       memorialisation and reconciliation across the Bangladesh/Bengal border,       reaching descendants of that divided community.
It has been presented over       35 times, across 3 continents to a range of audiences:            USA: 2 performances in California, 12 performances in New York, and 1         performance in Los Angeles.
UK: 3 performances at Loughborough University, organised in         collaboration with Charnwood Arts.
A further performance took place at         the London Barbican's Do Something Different weekend, which was         a sell-out, as evidenced in the review [5.1].
India: Kolkata&#8212;10 performances in total.
Bangalore&#8212;2 performances at         the prestigious Ranga Shankara.
A review of the performances in         The Times of India demonstrates the clearly engaging presentation         of Baul culture that is achieved through Chatterjee's work: `Employing         projections, audiovisual (AV) clips, light and sound, the play takes you         on a haunting musical journey where various chapters of Lalon's life are         rediscovered through music and lyrics' [5.2]        Bangladesh: 1 outdoor lecture-demonstration in Dhaka.
Europe: 2 performances in Berlin [5.3], 1 in Paris; in Berlin         Chatterjee also coordinated a concert, `Interweaving Lalon'.
The performances have made significant impacts on the preservation,       conservation and presentation of Baul cultural heritage.
In so doing, they       enrich and expand the lives, imaginations and sensibilities of individuals       and groups.
As reviewed by the online magazine website Weekly Blitz,       the performance `makes inroads into the deeper understanding of life and       its purpose, while unfolding the story of a man who believed in the power       of music to alter the physical, intellectual and emotional state in order       to be able to understand and appreciate life itself' [5.4].
Man         of the Heart is reported as `satiating the hunger of the viewers by       nourishing their imagination and leaving enough food for thought' [5.4].
The research of Chatterjee has brought the work and philosophy of Lalon       to a global general audience interested in world music performance,       theatre, religion and spiritualism, and returning the results of the       research to the people who are its source.
Lalon lived and worked across       what is now the border dividing India and Bangladesh, and across the       theological divides of Islam, Hinduism, and Tantric Buddhism [3.2].
Public engagement with the research is partly demonstrated through the       extensive programme of performances detailed above.
The project was also       seen in Rome by a broad public audience on the occasion of the first       International Lalon Festival, in October 2011 [5.7].
As is essential for the preserving and presenting of Baul cultural       heritage, Man of the Heart has directly engaged the communities       from which this heritage has developed.
The project has employed       translators and guides during Kushtia fieldtrips, and incorporated       professional musicians at the key public performances:            the 2008 Kolkata performance featured two phokirs, Nazrul Shah and         Balai Shah from Kushtia, taking the project back to the people whose         work inspired it.
in 2010, all performances of Man of the Heart in Britain were         accompanied by Labik Kamal Gourab, the Bangladeshi strings-player and         vocalist.
In 2011, Berlin performances were accompanied by Rashmi Bhatt, an         Italian drummer, Nour Eddine Fatty, the Moroccan strings-player, and         Pietro Silvestri, Italian dotara-player.
In 2012, further Berlin performances were accompanied by Rashmi Bhatt,         Satyaki Banerjee (Indian dotara-player), Mriganabhi Chattopadhyay         (Indian percussionist), Nazrul Shah (Bangladeshi         phokir-instrumentalist), and Daminee Basu (Indian vocalist).
In 2013, performances in Kolkata and Bangalore employed musicians         including Nazrul Shah from Bangladesh and the local Satyaki         Bandopadhyay.
Engagement with the work of Lalon and the preservation of this cultural       heritage is further evidenced through access to the social media and       online content, including the project website (with over 32,000 visitors)       [5.6] and on its videos on YouTube (with over 46,000 hits) [5.7].
