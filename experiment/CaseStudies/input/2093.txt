     The creation of Oxford Multi Spectral Ltd. has had an important cultural       and economic impact within the Classics discipline, and the subsequent use       of the technology in other industries has contributed to substantial       discoveries and innovations in those fields.
Media interest in these       developments has brought about greater public understanding of the use of       scientific techniques within the Humanities.
Obbink's digital research has led to the creation of an Advanced       Multi-spectral Imaging Laboratory in the Papyrology Rooms of the Sackler       Library.
This has led to an important economic impact through the creation       of Oxford Multi Spectral Ltd, the company that produces the scanners.
In       addition to the grant funding required to develop the scanner for       research, and a grant from the University Challenge Seed Fund for       prototyping work, the company attracted an initial investment of &#163;400,000       from a Chinese investor Changsha Yaodong Investment Consulting Co and its       UK based partner RTC Innovations, enabling it to commercialise,       manufacture, and market the scanners globally.
Oxford Multi Spectral was       the first ever spin-out company from the University of Oxford's Faculty of       Classics and indeed from the University's Humanities Division.
Obbink       serves as managing director of Oxford Multi Spectral Ltd.; he is also a       member of the Association of Questioned Document Examiners.
The scanner       units are manufactured by Worldlight Ltd., Hong Kong, while the company,       which has a current book value of &#163;2.5m, employs three UK staff, including       a CEO, and projects sales of 100 units per year by 2016.
Increasing cultural capital     The scanner has had important cultural impact through its application to       a range of material.
As described more fully in a separate case-study       submitted by this Unit, multispectral images produced by the scanner were       included in the online interface of the AHRC Ancient Lives Project (www.ancientlives.org),       where hundreds of thousands of volunteer transcribers helped to determine       by statistical analysis exactly where and to what degree multispectral       images offered an improved record of legibility over conventional images.
Although the scanner was developed for imaging ancient papyri, the       technology has been used to successfully scan, restore and archive over a       half-million historically significant archival documents.
The scanner is       able to detect an artist or writer's signature under multiple layers of       paint or a pencil sketch under a watercolour.
Examples of its use include:            Enabling the reading of a poem by Archilochus that is now used in the         teaching of Greek literature in Universities and discussed by online         groups.
[i]         [text removed for publication]       Recovering one of the oldest Hebrew commentaries on the Old Testament         (now in the Bodleian Library), which dates from the 10th century AD, and         was rendered illegible in the late 19th century during         chemical attempts to make it more readable.
Combining data from         different frequencies has highlighted the old ink and allowed the         document to be read, thus restoring it to public view and use.
[ii]        Making legible for the first time the text of an Egyptian Hieroglyphic         papyrus manual of how to build and decorate a temple (`The Book of the         Temple'), for which Professor Joachim Quack (University of Heidelberg)         was awarded a prestigious Leibniz prize.
Revealing that a crossed-out signature on a manuscript of poems in the         New Library of Christ Church, Oxford was that of William Shakespeare ,         and facilitating its illustration in a public exhibition of manuscripts.
Proving a previously accepted signature of Paul Cezanne to have been         misread and to have deceived art historians and the public in painting         valuation and sale in the UK[2].
Authenticating the artist's signature in an early portrait painting of         Karl Marx offered for public sale in the Netherlands.
[3]           Wider business applications     The scanner has also had important impact on business and government       agencies.
While Oxford Multi Spectral Limited focuses on the applications       in restoring manuscripts and art, it has also entered the market for       detecting forged security and border control documents, bank notes,       forensic evidence, and bio-medical applications.
The scanner has been       variously used, from recovering the inked out names of parents on orphan's       birth records to comparing bank notes and passports with reference       documents of known reflective properties.
The business impact of the       scanner was underscored by Paul Westwood, Managing Director of Forensic       Document Services, the largest forensic document company in the Asia       Pacific, who has stated that `the portable nature of the scanner means       that it is a great resource when document examiners are required to       undertake examinations out of the laboratory environment, such as at Court       Registries or the offices of opposing lawyers.
'[iii]     Models of the Oxford Multi Spectral scanner are now in use or under       development in locations as far afield as the University of California       Berkeley's Center for the Study of the Tebtunis Papyri, Baylor       University's collection of historic Robert Browning manuscripts (to read       Browning's notes on Greek texts), the Thomas Jefferson papers in the       Special Collections Room of the Library of the University of Virginia (to       enable the decipherment of badly faded hand-written documents from the       papers of Thomas Jefferson),[1] The Library of Congress       (for conservation purposes), the US Postal Service (fraud detection), the       National Archives, Washington DC (to read invisible watermarks), and the       Thames Valley Police Force's fingerprint detection and analysis       departments (for detection of fingerprints on bank-notes)[4],       as well as widely across several provinces in China, where it is employed       mainly in document verification, immigration, and forensics[5].
Public understanding     The technology developed in Oxford has also received much media attention       and other forms of coverage, including articles in the Economist[iv],       the Wall Street Journal[v], and business       technology websites[vi].
The MSI project, with backing       from the investors, completed the permanent installation of the Papyri and       Multi Spectral Imaging exhibit in the `Reading, Writing, and Counting'       gallery (Room 6) of the Ashmolean Museum, which opened in November 2009       and receives more than 1 million visitors per year.
This exhibit contains       a large panel on the MSI process, as well as the original papyrus of the       poem by Archilochus newly recovered through application of the technology,       together with a translation of it by Dr Obbink.
[vii]       Public colloquia during the Meeting of the Friends of Herculaneum Society       at the British Museum, in conjunction with the exhibition Life and         Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum in June 2013, showcased the results       of applying MSI imaging technology to the books of the Herculaneum Library       over the past five years; the exhibition (which had c. 300,000 visitors in       4 months to the end of July 2013) included MSI images on the unrolling and       preservation of the Herculaneum papyri.
Work on Herculaneum papyri using       MSI technology supports the goals of the Friends of Herculaneum Society,       of which Obbink is a trustee, and which undertakes outreach activities       including an annual writing competition for schoolchildren and a biennial       outreach magazine, Herculaneum Archaeology.
[viii]       The success of MSI imaging also led the Italian Archeological Service to       undertake and complete an initial feasibility study (2008) for the       excavation of the Villa dei Papiri for the remainder of the library and       papyri, assessing the ecology and impact on the local community.
