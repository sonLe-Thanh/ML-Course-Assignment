     Impacts on public policy and services:     From the outset, these exercises have aimed to have an impact on policy,       with representatives from government agencies, non-governmental       organisations and industry involved as collaborators and authors in order       to increase credibility and ownership of the results within each user       community.
For example, the workshop underpinning the 2008 paper on       emerging issues for UK biodiversity (section 3 ref 2) involved 32 people,       13 from major governmental bodies, 6 from non-governmental organisations,       1 from industry, 1 science journalist and 11 academics.
Thirty-two of the       48 participants in (and authors of) a 2013 exercise to identify the key       knowledge needs for evidence-based conservation of wild pollinators (led       by Sutherland) were policy makers and users, including 5 from governments       and agencies, 16 from businesses (food production, retail, agrochemicals),       and 11 directly involved in conservation6.
In terms of direct       evidence of impact of the work in section three, examples include:            The UK horizon scanning exercise (section 3 ref 2) was used by NERC as         a case study in their `Science into Policy' (second edition, 2013)         booklet.
NERC has stated that "we used the outputs of the horizon         scanning work in strategy development.
We have fed in issues to our         Strategy Board/Council and Theme leaders for discussions around         refreshing our strategy.
We are currently starting the 2011 strategy         refresh, and the issues from the most recent exercise will again be fed         into those discussions'.7        The 2010 UK Marine Science Strategy8 lists research         questions under each of its three science priority areas and for each         set of questions it states `based in part on Sutherland et al (2006)'.
In 2009, Sutherland and colleagues were commissioned to undertake an         exercise on global agriculture questions as part of the UK Government's         Foresight exercise on Global Food and Farming Futures.
The resultant         paper9 was presented to the Food and Agriculture Organisation         of the United Nations in 2010 by Sutherland and co-author Professor         Jules Pretty (University of Essex).
Within a month of publication, it         was the most downloaded paper ever from the publisher's website.
The methodology has also had impacts beyond the biological sciences.
For       example, in 2013, Sutherland coordinated an exercise to identify the       priority research questions required to reduce UK poverty on behalf of the       Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which works for social justice.
As stated in       the resulting paper10: `The Foundation funded the process and       the workshop [i.e.
the exercise coordinated by Sutherland] as part of its       programme to develop anti-poverty strategies for the UK.'
The methodology has been adopted for use in many different countries, and       Sutherland himself has assisted with the following:            to identify environmental issues in the U.S.11         (commissioned by the Kresge Foundation),       to identify questions relating to global agriculture9         (funded by Foresight and the Food and Agriculture Office of the UN)       to identify relevant issues for the Canadian marine environment (2012,         funded by Canadian Government)12.
The accompanying press         release states: `This report [40 Priority Research Questions for Ocean         Science in Canada] has already started to create a synergy amongst         Canada's ocean scientists, leading to ... an increased understanding         regarding research priorities and needs.'
In 2011, the U.S. based Nature Conservancy reported of the Horizon Scan       of Global Conservation Issues for 2012 (section 3 ref 3) that: `our       External Affairs team was meeting with the federal agencies who write the       rules associated with the legislation [the Food Safety Modernization Act]       .... the paper was used directly in the regulatory process.
That was an       early stage in the rule-making, and an important moment to have credible       scientific material'.13     One of the fifteen issues identified in the same paper was the       deleterious effect of increased cement demand on karst forest and cave       ecosystems.
Identification of this as an issue has led to, for example,       the preparation of a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) for Holcim Vietnam       (one of the largest multi-national cement producers in Vietnam) by the       IUCN14 in order to mitigate biodiversity loss as a result of       quarrying activities.
The BAP was `prepared in the context of growing       global concern about the impacts of cement production on biodiversity',       and cites the 2012 paper as the context for this.
Impacts on practitioners and services &#8212; practitioners/professionals         have used research findings [here the methodology] in conducting their         work: Examples of organisations and practitioners being influenced       by the work, or using the research methodology to take planning decisions       include:            Professor Ian Boyd, Director of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the         University of St Andrews, has stated 9in an e-mail to Sutherland): `I am         now chairing a scientific advisory board for Oil and Gas UK on offshore         decommissioning.
The [2010 paper on UK policy options] has been passed         to the oil and gas companies, including BP (at global vice-president         level), Shell, Conoco, and several others that are less well known.
It         had an influential role to play in establishing the Scientific Advisory         Board for a Joint Industry Programme that is seeking to better         understand the rationale for current policies on offshore         decommissioning.'
the June 2011 workshop of the Global Food Security Programme         (established in 2010 by the major UK funders of food-related research)         to determine the Programme's research priorities commenced with an email         to participants stating: `we are using as a starting point a paper that         came out of the Foresight project by Pretty et al.
entitled `The         Top 100 Questions of Importance to the Future of Global Agriculture         (attached).
The workshop will aim to determine at least one question per         programme theme from the 100 questions to be tackled first (we have four         themes in the programme)'15.
In 2012, the Scottish National Heritage Scientific Advisory Committee         used the methodology to identify the conservation issues which Scottish         National Heritage will have to respond to in the short to medium term16.
Independent studies using the methodology to conduct their own exercises       in order to determine priorities for action or for further research       funding include exercises in Australia, Canada, Israel and the Alps, and       by sectors such as the water industry, forestry and mineralogy17,18.
