     Over the last seven years Dr Guerrina has provided policy briefings to a       range of organisations       based on research undertaken at Surrey at both the UK and EU levels in       terms of emerging policy       on maternity leave provision and paternal leave.
Based on this body of research undertaken at Surrey, Dr Guerrina has       become an active and on-going       media commentator on these issues.
Through this engagement the findings of       this research,       particularly relating to recent British government shifts in maternity       leave provision and reductions       in employers' provisions in the context of the economic crisis, have       reached a wide audience.
The main areas of impact are:     Contributing to a wider public understanding of policy and maternity       leave provision, through       programme development and contribution to the BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour,       for example; "The       results of the Italian elections, 2013".
Dr Guerrina's research shaped the       coverage of the 2013       Italian political elections.
Dr Guerrina's research on gender politics in Europe directly influenced       the theme of the Fabians'       women network debate at the Labour Party Annual Conference fringe event in       2012.
The event's       focus on the role of Europe in promoting women's rights was triggered by       Surrey's research on       women's political representation in Italy and the politics of gender in       the EU.
Furthermore Surrey's research contributed to the debate organised by the       European Parliament       UK office on "What has Europe done for Women?"
at Europe House on 7th       March 2013 and       resulted in the publication of a short essay on the same theme, later used       by the Chair of the       European Movement in his briefing on gender equality in the EU.
Surrey's research on working practices, gender and the political sphere       has contributed to the       wider public understanding of such policies, through interactions with the       public, examples of which       are detailed below:            BBC Radio 4, Woman's Hour Interview: (2013) "What has the EU done for         Women?"
In this         interview Dr Guerrina debated the role of the EU as a gender actor.
In         particular she discussed         the historical development of EU gender equality policies and the impact         of EU legislation on         development of an equality framework in the UK.
BBC Radio 4, Woman's Hour Interview (2011): "Women and Politics in         Post-Berlusconi Italy".
In this interview the overall impact of the Berlusconi years on the         politics of gender in Italy was         discussed and expanded to consider the position of women in Parliament         and the employment         market.
Finally, during the interview Dr Guerrina explored the impact of         recent political changes         in the Italian government on the relative position of women in Italian         politics and economics.
BBC Radio 4, Woman's Hour Interview (2005): "Which country is best for         working mothers?"
In         this interview Dr Guerrina compared the level and quality of maternity         leave provision in a         number of European countries.
She also discussed the impact of EU         policies on the         development of national provisions for the reconciliation between work         and family life.
Keynote at Fatherhood Institution workshop (2009): This workshop         sought to explore key         issues in relation to the development of a comprehensive parental leave         agenda.
Dr Guerrina's         contribution related to the impact of current reconciliation on         reproducing gender hierarchies         and divisions of labour.
The workshop was organised by NatCen, the         National Centre of Social         Research, and the audience included practitioners and policy makers.
Keynote at European Policy Centre and Equality and Human Rights         Commission Workshop         (2010).
Dr. Guerrina shared the platform at this event with Director, DG         Employment, Social         Affairs and Equal Opportunities, European Commission.
The workshop was         attended by key         European Social Partners, representatives of the European Women's Lobby         and the Social         Platform.
Keynote at Fabians' women network fringe event at the 2012 Labour         Party conference, the         research undertaken at Surrey contributed to the Fabians' Women Network         event on gender         equality and austerity, as well as contributing a keynote address to the         Fabian Society Europe         Conference (2013) on the impact of the crisis on working mothers in         Europe.
This interview led         to increasing contact and exchanges with key actors in civil society         organisations, such as the         editor of Fabiana Magazine.
