     More than 16 million people in the UK are thought to suffer from mental       health problems.
In 2010 the estimated cost to individuals, employers and       the government has been estimated as more than &#163;100 billion per annum.
With only around 10 per cent of sufferers able to access psychological       treatments, the development of effective self-help approaches represents       an important means of supporting service users, offering them greater       choice, control and shared decision-making.
Lucock's research has       underpinned increased support for the wider NHS workforce in providing       brief, accessible guided self-help interventions.
The two clinical trials       mentioned above demonstrated the benefit to patients of this approach.
The       controlled clinical trialc showed a positive effect on       patients' anxiety for a very brief, low-cost intervention (&#163;14 per person)       and this included evidence of significant goal attainment.
The pragmatic       randomised controlled triald provided evidence of improvements       in levels of depression following a brief 3 session intervention.
The       underpinning research led to the creation of SHARP, the Self-Help Access       in Routine Primary Care project1,2,3,4.
Initially developed as       a pilot initiative in Wakefield, Yorkshire, with the support of the West       Yorkshire Workforce Development Confederation and Wakefield Primary Care       Trust, SHARP was designed to supply primary care practitioners with the       materials and training needed to provide brief, low-intensity, effective       self-help interventions for sufferers of mild to moderate anxiety and/or       depression.
Between 2008 and 2010, 44 NHS practitioners in the Wakefield       area received training in delivering guided self-help under the SHARP       programme.
The initiative received positive feedback from practitioners,       with an evaluation of the pilot training programme reporting significant       increases in confidence in their ability to deal with anxiety and       depression and to use CBT in their practice5.
For example, two       nurse practitioners and a GP from a Yorkshire GP practice attended the       SHARP training and used the approach in their mental health clinics.
They       reported that the introduction of mental health clinics based on the SHARP       approach contributed to a reduction in the prescription for       anti-depressants.
The General Practitioner stated that "We have been         running the mental health clinic for at least 4 years now.
One of the         big differences is the reduction in the number of patients suffering         from stress related problems / anxiety / depression in routine GP         clinics.
We have also noticed a marked reduction in antidepressant         prescribing"6.
As a result of the pilot and expansion in       the Wakefield District, the SHARP initiative was included in the       specification for the roll out and development of IAPT services in       Wakefield and adopted as one of the step 2 interventions in the stepped       care service model7.
In 2009, with backing from Yorkshire and the Humber NHS, the scheme was       extended across the Yorkshire and Humber region, where a further 50 NHS       practitioners took part in a two-year `train the trainers' programme2,3,4.
This phase, completed in September 2011, was resourced in response to the       positive feedback received from the pilot5, described above,       and allowed the widespread training of SHARP practitioners in a number of       localities.
A project report produced in November 2011 showed that the       SHARP approach had been taught to a wide range of regional practitioners       including: 24 clinicians in midwifery and health visiting teams in       Wakefield; Improving Access to Psychological Therapies teams in Barnsley,       Bradford, Grimsby, Halifax, Sheffield and Wakefield; GPs in Sheffield;       health visitors and health trainers in Kirklees; and a drugs support team       in Leeds3.
In keeping with the findings and recommendations of       Lucock's studies, the training programme encouraged practitioners to       understand and support service-users' own self-help strategies and to       integrate facilitation of self-help into their routine work.
The training       programme confirmed our research finding that effective self-help support       could be provided by a range of health professionals after only brief       training (between one and two days).
The SHARP website1 was launched in 2009, and from 2011 has       allowed access to more than 40 self-help leaflets, most in both `full' and       more readable `lite' formats.
These leaflets offer information on       self-help for anxiety, depression and stress.
They cover both       understanding and managing problems.
In keeping with the underpinning       research findings, these leaflets were designed, with input from a health       literacy advisor, to be brief and readable.
An audit using Google       analytics in July 2013 showed that the website is being accessed over 600       times by up to 400 separate users each week with 95% accessed during       weekdays.
Access was worldwide, not just from the UK.
UK users were       located across the country, including the London region, Manchester and       Glasgow, indicating widespread usage beyond the original area of       dissemination.
Local NHS practitioners can register on the website to       access training resources, with 226 registering during the training       period.
Feedback from services provides evidence of the value of SHARP in a       number of ways.
These include educating patients about their symptoms of       anxiety and depression and preparing them for a referral to the IAPT       service; supporting a shared dialogue between the GPs and the IAPT workers       about who is likely to benefit from talking treatments for anxiety and       depression; the benefits to patients of using the leaflets to normalise       and explain their problems.
An IAPT service manager stated that "The         GPs now use SHARP leaflets to educate the patients about their reported         symptoms, and introduce the idea that the patient can help themselves.
The leaflets help the GPs to assess if the patient is willing or able to         consider learning more about their problem.
This helps them to prepare         patients they think could benefit from IAPT"8 .
Lucock's research has also contributed to NHS guidance.
His contribution       to the Good Practice Guide on the Contribution of Applied         Psychologists to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies 9included       a description of the guided self-help intervention provided by the GMHWs       described earlierd.
He also contributed to the Good         Practice Guidance on the Use of Self-help Materials within IAPT Services10,       which was written in response to feedback from services and those       attending IAPT training courses who expressing a need for expert guidance       on the use of self-help materials, given the wide range of different       materials available.
This guidance is therefore widely used to support the       training and practice of those working within IAPT services in the UK.
