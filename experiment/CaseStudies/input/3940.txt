     Impact on clinical practice     The research described above has led to dopamine transporter imaging by       FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) SPECT becoming the standard method of diagnosis for DLB       around the world.
In 2005, revised clinical criteria were issued by the       DLB Consortium, which concluded that "Low striatal DAT activity also         occurs in DLB but is normal in AD, making DAT scanning particularly         useful in distinguishing between the two disorders" [a].
In       July 2006, the European indication for DaTSCAN (previously authorised only       for patients with clinically uncertain Parkinsonian syndrome) was expanded       to include differentiation of probable DLB from Alzheimer's Disease.
In       2006, the method was incorporated into NICE clinical guidelines for       dementia.
These recommended that:     "Dopaminergic iodine-123-radiolabelled       2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane (FP-CIT)       SPECT should be used to help establish the diagnosis in those with       suspected dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) if the diagnosis is in doubt" [b].
That this technique has now become standard clinical practice is shown by       its inclusion in information provided in leaflets and online by       Alzheimer's Research UK, who say "To help make a specific diagnosis of         DLB, a type of scan called a DaT scan may be used to look for changes in         the brain which are more common in this type of dementia" [c].
A 2011 paper from Southampton University Hospitals Trust which       retrospectively reviewed 80 patients who had undergone FP-CIT (DaTSCAN)       SPECT over a one-year period, concluded that "It would seem that         DaTSCAN imaging has a marked influence on the working clinical diagnosis         and subsequent management of patients with suspected DLB" [d].
Impact on patients     Early, accurate diagnosis of DLB, in particular its differentiation from       Alzheimer's disease, is important for optimal management.
It may provide a       better understanding of the symptoms and may induce changes in the       clinical management of patients, allowing initiation of effective       pharmacotherapy, and avoiding the consequences of neuroleptic sensitivity.
Patients and carers can be provided with information about the likely       symptomatology and illness course, which may help families, relatives and       caregivers to make correct decisions and future plans.
Altogether this       translates into better management of patients with reduced carer burden       and better clinical outcome.
FDA approval     In 2009, GE Healthcare submitted an application to the US Food and Drug       Administration (FDA) requesting to license DaTSCAN for patients presenting       with symptoms or signs suggestive of dopaminergic neurodegeneration.
This       application widely referenced the research described above, and Walker       provided expert advice to the panel.
The FDA concluded that the best       clinical data provided for the application came from the autopsy study and       the application was approved in August 2009 [e].
Impact on guidelines     Walker contributed to guidelines issued in 2009 by the European       Association of Nuclear Medicine on DaT SPECT imaging which recommended       (citing the research described above) that "[123I]FP-CIT imaging is         indicated for the differentiation of dementia with Lewy bodies from         other dementias" [f].
Guidelines issued in 2011 by EFNS       (European Federation of Neurological Societies) and ENS (European       Neurological Society) cite our work in support of using 123I-FP-CIT SPECT       for distinguishing DLB from non-DLB dementia [g].
Industry investment in research     The FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) ligand belongs to GE Healthcare.
There has been an       active collaboration between GE Healthcare and UCL, with Walker being       involved in the design and execution of a recent European study and with       GE Healthcare sponsoring explorative investigator-led studies (Morgan et       al 2013) and a PhD project within the group.
