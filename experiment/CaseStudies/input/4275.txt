     PCV2 has been associated with a number of disease syndromes or       pathological conditions in pigs during the last 15 years, and the       terminology `porcine circovirus diseases' (PCVD) was proposed to replace       existing acronyms.
PMWS is considered the most significant PCVD, and       therefore most of the prevention/control and research efforts have been       focused on it.
It is estimated that since its introduction in the 1990s,       that PCV2 had cost the European industry about &#163;468 million per year [a]       and, at its height in 2005/6, it was estimated that PMWS cost EU pig       producers in excess of &#8364;600-900 million per year.
Subsequently, now that       the disease has been reported in all major pig producing countries around       the world, global production losses related to untreated PCVD are       estimated in &#163;billions per year.
The impact of PMWS on food safety and       veterinary public health is also important as PMWS-associated       immunosuppression results in increased carcase contamination by food-borne       pathogens and increased virus shedding at slaughter, and an associated       increase in the use of antimicrobial agents in the attempted control of       PMWS-associated disease.
The latter provides an increased potential for       selecting for antimicrobial resistant bacteria and drug residues in pig       meat.
PMWS and PCVDs are also important drivers of poor welfare in pigs.
The initial isolation and characterisation of PCV2 by Allan and       colleagues at QUB, USASK and Merial, the filing of patents and the       subsequent body of research that lead to an understanding of the disease       process and development of diagnostics and vaccines, has been successfully       deployed around the world to control this devastating disease [b].
Vaccines to PCV2 are now sold under licence by four multinational       companies in all pig producing countries, with outstanding and       unparalleled results.
By October 2013, the associated royalty payments to       QUB were is excess of US$32 million [c].
PCV2 vaccination has been one of the most extraordinary success stories       of pig health control and is protecting the health, growth performance and       welfare of many millions of pigs around the world.
No less importantly,       the results at farm level show that it is more than fulfilling its promise       to be extremely cost-effective and consumers are benefiting from a       reduction in antibiotic use.
The successful application of this vaccine       against the diseases of major economic importance associated with PCV2 is       internationally recognised.
Launched in 2006, the PCV2 vaccine sales       continue to increase year on year around the world with the estimates of       market share in 2010 in Europe of 51%, North America at 73% and Asia at       67%.
In 2008, world sales of PCV2 vaccines were valued at $265 million [d].
In 2012 IFAH-Europe (on behalf of the European animal health industry)       reported that PCV2-vaccination is the only effective control for the PMWS       [e].
As early as 2009, the major role played by PCV2 vaccination on       reducing the on-farm use of antimicrobials had been recorded in Canada,       Japan, South Korea, Thailand and UK [f].
The dramatic positive       impact on pig farms, with mortality rates falling between 50 and 90% [g],       has driven a year on year increase of PCV2 vaccine sales, making it the       market leader [h].
The circovirus vaccines have delivered broad       global impact and exceptional returns on investment [i].
In 2013,       Boehringer-Ingelheim reported that one billion pigs had been vaccinated       against PCV2 with Ingelvac CircoFLEX&#174; and, based on yearly sales       volumes, that it is the most successful animal vaccine of all time [j].
