     "Prof. Sharkey's work stands out not only because of its high quality         technical analysis but also because it engages with some of the most         problematic and controversial ethical issues raised by these         developments.
He has clearly established himself as the leading critic         of the assumptions on which the leading military contractors are now         proceeding in the development of new lethal technologies.
Because of the         depth of his technical and scientific expertise, his work is an         indispensable reference point for those working on these issues."
(Prof. Philip Alston, Former UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial       Executions).
Stimulating and informing public debate     Sharkey used the skills learned during his EPSRC Public Engagement       fellowship to bring the issue of military robots to the attention of a       worldwide audience through widespread and intensive media coverage, and to       call for an urgent and informed international debate on the development of       unmanned weapons.
"[His] passion for tackling the complex issues         [.....] has brought the scientific and ethical issues related to the         development of lethal robotic weapons to the public in a way that would         not have happened without him" [S1] (Nobel Peace Laureate and Chair       of Nobel Women's Initiative).
His concerted press campaign (see Figure 1) was launched with an opinion       piece in The Guardian in August 2007, but it was his scholarly article       "Cassandra or False Prophet of Doom" [R6] in July 2008 that established       him as the foremost expert advocating caution.
This led to Sharkey being       in great demand throughout 2009, especially in national and international       press.
As awareness of and expertise in the issues became more widespread,       Sharkey was no longer the only media voice and his appearances fell in       2010, rising gradually to a new peak in 2013 following the launch of the       International Committee for Robot Arms Control (ICRAC)[S3] and the       Campaign to Stop Killer Robots (CSKR)[S7], see section on NGOs below.
From 2011 onwards, Sharkey's presence on major international broadcast       and online media in particular has increased steadily, with appearances on       Al Jazeera English (broadcast to over 220m homes in over 100 countries);       Sky News; CNN (638k viewers and 75m unique online users in April 2013);       and Voice of America (sold to national stations worldwide with a reach of       90m viewers).
In the REF period, Sharkey has featured in a total of       over 340 print, radio, television and online appearances/articles in over       50 countries.
"His dissemination activities have been crucial to the         public understanding of his work" [S6] (current UN Special       Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions).
Figure 1: Number of media appearances by year 	  	       Influencing the work of NGOs and Charities     Following Sharkey's efforts to raise awareness of the issue, a number of       international organisations have used his research to inform and shape       their policy.
"He has worked extensively with NGOs and other         organizations to influence policy on LARs [Lethal Autonomous       Robots]" [S1].
The Director of Human Rights Watch's Arms Division confirms:       "[Sharkey's] work on fully autonomous weapons was hugely influential         in our report "Losing Humanity: The case against killer robots"       [19/09/2012 - S2], which makes a number of recommendations that         reflect Noel's research and analysis.
This report is widely viewed as a         cornerstone of the new global NGO Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, which         is coordinated by Human Rights Watch" [S4].
In September 2009, Sharkey was led by his concerns over the findings from       his research to co-found an NGO, the International Committee for Robot         Arms Control (ICRAC) [S3].
It brings together 26 experts in robotics       technology, robot ethics, international relations, international security,       arms control, international humanitarian law, and human rights law who       foster global efforts toward effective limitation of military robotics.
Sharkey's work with NGOs culminated in April 2013 in the launch of the international         civil society Campaign to Stop Killer Robots (CSKR) calling for an       internationally legally binding treaty to prohibit the use and development       of autonomous weapons.
Sharkey was "a key driver in the creation of the         Campaign [....].
Noel has emerged as both a preeminent technical expert         for the Campaign and one of its most effective spokespersons.
His work         is admired and utilized across this growing coalition of more than 40         NGOs in more than 20 countries" [S4] (including Amnesty       International, Article 36, Handicap International, the International Peace       Initiative and the Nobel Women's Initiative, many of whom were       instrumental in the successful International Campaign to Ban Landmines       [S7]).
"It is accurate to say that Noel's work was key in laying the         basis for the Campaign, and continues to be invaluable in carrying it         forward" [S4].
Stimulating Policy Debate     "His work on fully autonomous weapons has led not only to a political         campaign by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch, but has had influence on         those who make policy" [S6] (UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial       Executions).
United Nations: "Prof. Sharkey's work has been highly         influential in all of the major efforts that have been undertaken in         recent years to influence public policy in this area, especially at the         international level.
This includes the report that I prepared in 2010 [and]         a follow-up report by the current UN SR on extrajudicial executions in         2013 [S5] [...] The issue has now been placed on the agenda of         the principal UN body responsible for arms issues [...] On 26 June 2013         the UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs urged the Panel "to         study potential developments in this field and generate an in-depth         analysis of the legal, technical, political, military and moral aspects         and impact of the militarization [...] of the [...] use of fully         autonomous weapon systems".
This new direction also owes much to the         pioneering work of Prof. Sharkey" (Prof.Philip Alston, Former       UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions).
Recently this       has resulted in the UN's Convention on Conventional Weapons agreeing to       convene to discuss lethal autonomous weapons.
The group will report back       in 2014 to start the process in 2015 with a view to producing a new       Protocol VI.
European Union: Sharkey's research has influenced the national       policies of three key EU member States, as well as the policy of the       European Parliament.
He has provided briefings to two UK All-Party       Parliamentary Groups (APPGs).
A Vice-Chair of the APPG on Drones, Baroness       Stern, confirms: "[Sharkey] was known as a key voice providing         decision makers at national and international level with sound evidence         on which to base their policy and was he was therefore one of the first         speakers to address the newly formed parliamentary group [....]       [His] knowledge and expertise from his research have provided a         detailed and scientific evidence base that has been invaluable to those         speaking in parliament.
In the past year there have been four debates on         drones and related matters."
The Chair of the APPG on Weapons and       the Protection of Civilians confirms: "Noel has addressed UK         parliamentarians on several occasions in the past year.
In December 2012         he addressed the APPG on Drones, as well as the APPG on Weapons and the         Protection of Civilians.
In April 2013, our Group arranged a         cross-party parliamentary briefing at which Noel addressed an audience         of approximately 20 MPs and Peers.
[...]The concerns raised by Noel's         research motivated a Vice-Chair of our APPG [...] to call a         parliamentary debate on this subject in the House of Commons on 17th         June 2013 to question and clarify the Government's policy on autonomous         weapons.
Evidence from Noel played a significant part in informing this         debate, and continues to motivate our group within parliament to push         for the government to introduce a moratorium on the development of         autonomous weapons" [S8].
He delivered briefings to the German       Foreign Policy Conference, Parliamentary Groups, Foreign Office and       Defence Ministry in the last year.
In France, "Professor Sharkey has         regularly addressed a range of gatherings of military and government         personnel and his expertise in the ethics and technology of roboticised         weapons systems has contributed to the ongoing process to inform and         shape policy.
[He] may be praised for his crucial contribution to         set the ethical issues raised by roboticised weapons systems on the         French and European defence policy agenda.
[He] is today a highly         influential voice on this issue among both national and international         military and civilian decision makers and his activities have been         instrumental in driving forward the global debate on this subject, which         would not have enjoyed the high profile it currently does without his         input".
(Policy Advisor, French Ministry of Defence [S10]).
The 2013       European Parliament Policy Document on The Human Rights Implications of       the Usage of Drones and Unmanned Robots in Warfare cites his research       extensively, concluding that "the EU should make the promotion of the         rule of law in relation to the development, proliferation and use of         unmanned weapons systems a declared priority of European foreign policy"       [S9].
Armed forces: Sharkey has addressed senior military in 26       countries (including Mitre Corp) and elements of his research are       incorporated in officer training in the US, UK, France [S10], the       Netherlands and an Academy for officers of all former Soviet states.
