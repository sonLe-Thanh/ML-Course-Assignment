     The impact of Murphy's work has been to engage thousands of people in a       public discourse on linguistic issues that transforms participants'       understanding of language change, intercultural communication and the       nature of language itself.
Impact in this context is achieved through       social media and speaking events.
Murphy's blog Separated by a Common       Language &#8212; SbaCL &#8212; [see Section 5, C1] identifies and describes       differences between British English and American English that are often       overlooked in dictionaries and language teaching.
The blog, Twitter feed       [C2] and public talks [C3.1, C3.2] address the general public, but their       quality has led to use by language professionals, including       lexicographers, translators, teachers and editors.
As well as creating forums for public discourse about language, these       activities change minds.
Many participants come to these forums immersed       in myths about English and how language changes.
Murphy confronts these       myths, and we see evidence [C1, C3] that she leads people to turn away       from them and look for research-based information, rather than       introspection and hearsay.
For example, a reviewer of a talk in which       Murphy examined the British media's prejudiced treatment of American       English admitted originally sharing these biases, relating a number of       examples that shook her beliefs.
It ends `I'm sold' [C3.1].
The online community created and developed through Murphy's blog is       substantial, with posts typically attracting between 40 and 150 comments.
With Murphy's moderation, readers engage with their own ideas and       experience and with one another's [C1].
This empowers language users to       share their views about variation and standards in English       internationally.
Klout, which tracks social-media influence based on the       amount of internet traffic generated by tweets, rates Murphy as a Top 10       `influencer' in linguistics, indicating that @lynneguist's tweets generate       conversations [C5].
Murphy's SbaCL blog covers the British/American linguistic divide, with       more than 420 posts from 2006 to July 2013 [C1].
Her Twitter account       @lynneguist posts a UK/US `Difference of the Day' and links to research       about English &#8212; over 17,000 tweets since May 2008 [C2].
Since 2011, Murphy       has given 14 popular talks, contributing to the cultural life of the       South-East.
These include the tongue-in-cheek `How America Saved the       English Language' and attract audiences ranging from 30 to 60 in       Skeptics-in-the-Pub events to 1,500 delegates at the 2012 Brighton SEO       (Search Engine Optimization) conference [C3.1].
Her 2012 TEDx talk on       linguistic politeness has been viewed 20,000+ times online, and her       Numberphile videos on math/maths and ways of saying       numerals have been viewed over 500,000 times, inspired 15,000+ YouTube       `likes' and thousands of comments [C3.2].
Her attention to these issues       has made them more interesting to mainstream media.
Between 2009 and 2013       she has appeared on Radio 4's Today Programme, in the Sunday         Times, and the New York Times discussing Britishisms in the       US, Fry's English Delight (Radio 4), on Webster's spelling reforms       and on Alan Yentob's Imagine, discussing the linguistics of       Scrabble (BBC1) [C3.3].
SbaCL's influence is demonstrated by the growth of its audience through       word-of-mouth and media attention.
Google Analytics reports that SbaCL       achieved nearly 80,000 page views per month during 2013 [C3.4].
It is       consistently in the Top 10 linguistic blogs according to Blogmetrics.org,       has been Yahoo.com's `Pick of the Day' [C4], and repeatedly placed in       babla.com's language blog awards (50 per cent jury/50 per cent popular       vote) [C6].
The Twitter feed has gone from 0 to over 7,700 followers in       four years [C2].
It was placed second in babla.com's `Top Language       Twitterers 2011' [C6].
In addition to engaging the general public, Murphy's work has impact on       the applied-language professions, including translation, publication,       natural language processing and lexicography.
On the babla.com blog       awards, SbaCL has been categorised under `Language Professionals' and, in       2009, it was ranked first in that category [C6].
It is nominated there by       language professionals &#8212; translators, editors, EFL teachers &#8212; who value       its in-depth treatment of dialectal differences that don't make it into       dictionaries, which they can use in their professional practice.
Murphy's       work was cited by the Chartered Institute of Linguists &#8212; the professional       translators/interpreters organisation &#8212; as `best practice' in the use of       social media for language professionals [C8].
Her work is regularly       reproduced or linked-to in translators' blogs or newsletters as a resource       that can aid in understanding English dialectal differences and semantic       fine points [C3.5].
Emphasis Training, a corporate writing-skills       consultancy, has engaged Murphy as a consultant in producing resources for       business people aiming to improve their communication skills and language       awareness.
Murphy's work (particularly C1) is also often cited in the       applied fields of Natural Language Processing and in lexicography [C8].
Murphy's in-depth treatment of word meanings has influenced dictionary       treatments of words, for example the most recent update of the Oxford         English Dictionary has added a new sense of hot dog in       reaction to her post on the term [C10].
Lexicographical interest in her       work is also evidenced by her invited participation in the 2013 symposium       on the future of the Oxford English Dictionary [C9].
