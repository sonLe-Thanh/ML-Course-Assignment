     The promise of the Intellectual Property in face biometrics generated by       Professor Kittler in the late       1990's, and filed for protection by Surrey at the turn of the millennium,       was instrumental in setting       up a unique commercialization framework.
This IP was vested in a University spinout company, OmniPerception Ltd,       in 2001.
The spinout       company was initially assisted both, financially, from the University seed       fund and Cascade fund,       and intellectually, on a long-term basis, by the University committing any       pipeline IP, to be       generated by Professor Kittler after OmniPerception had been formed, for       the benefit of the       company.
The relationship between the University and the company mirrored       the business and       exploitation model used by the Stanford University in setting up the       speech recognition company       Nuance at about the same time.
The output of the applied research in biometrics carried out at the       University of Surrey after the       formation of the company with EPSRC and EU support, jointly with       government assisted       technology transfer programmes including SMART, KTP, and DTI Technology       (TSB) projects, had       generated innovative core face biometrics technology that attracted a       Venture Capital investment       of more than &#163;2 million to enable product development and engineering.
In       2009, the production of       the OmniPerception technology was accelerated by a major investment from       BAe Systems via its       Investment in Innovation (I3) Programme, with a part of the funding       (&#163;250k) subcontracted back to       the University to develop solutions for cross spectral face matching and       pose invariant face       recognition.
The software engineering and product development have been facilitated by       the use of common       open source image processing library RAVL.
This ensured that common       classes and structures       were used for algorithm development.
In April 2012 the company merged with       Visimetrics, a major       UK biometrics technology integrator, to create an enterprise with the       combined capability to       manufacture high technology products, and to integrate them in advanced       security applications.
In 2013 Visimetrics was acquired by Digital Barriers, a fast growing SME       in Homeland Security       with then more than 200 employees.
A number of University of Surrey PhD       graduates have joined       the company.
The series of products that have been launched by OmniPerception since       2008 includes:             Face biometric access control systems CheckPoint and         CheckPoint.S.
Both use illumination         invariant imaging technology (enhanced by photometric normalization),         and the multiscale         Local Binary Pattern representation coupled with facial component based         matching.
The former         system requires user cooperation.
It is deployed for access control to         data centres in banks,         and by Menzies to enhance security at UK airports to control access to         the air-side by cargo         handling staff.
The latter version, launched only in 2011 captures and         processes face image on         the move, without the subject's awareness.
This is important for         watchlist applications as         diverse as those enhancing national security, as well as crime         prevention in shopping malls         and player exclusion in casinos.
Face search engine Collossus allows a rapid matching of an         input face with a huge database         of faces for retrieval purposes or for recognition.
The search engine         uses the basic face         technology modules, including face detection and localisation,         photometric normalisation, skin         texture representation, and discriminative face matching, with         multi-algorithm search solutions         available as options.
The search engine is used by the UK Police Forces         to identify suspects,         by United Nations, and as a core subsystem in stand alone biometric         access control solutions         (e.g.
time and attendance).
In April 2012 OmniPerception Ltd merged with Visimetrics, an integrator,       to create a company of       greater critical mass, with enhanced access to security markets.
The       annual turnover of the new       company was in excess of &#163;3 million and is growing.
With the proven track       record of its security       product installation at the Heathrow airport, the most recent successes of       the company include the       introduction of the OmniPerception face access control systems to       Manchester and other UK       airports by Menzies.
Quoting VP IT Operations and Communications, Menzies Aviation plc     "We analysed numerous biometric technologies and suppliers back in         2009 and concluded         that OmniPerception both as a technology and organisation fitted in with         the Menzies         Aviation philosophy."
