     WinBUGS is an established and stable, stand-alone version of the       BUGS software, which remains       available [A] but is no longer being further developed.
WinBUGS is still       used extensively (searching       for `WinBUGS' on Google returns over 205,000 hits, with 42,400 since 2008       and 11,300 in 2013)       and has been described as "the most widely accepted Bayesian modelling         package" [B].
Since       2005, development of the BUGS project has focussed on the OpenBUGS       project [C], the open-source       version of the BUGS code.
OpenBUGS was first released in 2005 and the       latest versions of       OpenBUGS (from v3.0.7 onwards) have been designed to be at least as       efficient and reliable as       WinBUGS over a wide range of test applications, but with greater       flexibility and extensibility [A].
The impact of the BUGS software is summed up by Prof Brad Carlin, Head of       Biostatistcs       University of Minnesota: "MCMC freed Bayes from the shackles of         conjugate priors and the curse         of dimensionality; BUGS then brought MCMC-Bayes to the masses, yielding         an astonishing         explosion in the number, quality, and complexity of Bayesian inference         over a vast array of         application areas, from finance to medicine to data mining" [D].
Books and Training:     A demonstration of the popularity and wide applicability of the BUGS,       WinBUGS and OpenBUGS       software has been the wide number of books published on them since their       launch.
Since 2008       there have been over 10 dedicated books published about WinBUGS and       OpenBUGS, including       one by Nicky Best and colleagues.
Some examples are:     1) Bayesian         Modeling Using WinBUGS (2009), Wiley, I Ntzoufras     2) Introduction         to WinBUGS for Ecologists: Bayesian approach to regression, ANOVA, mixed         models and related analyses       (2010), Academic Press, M Kery ([text removed for publication]       copies sold, 21/11/13, [E]).

7) Applied         Bayesian Statistics: With R and OpenBUGS Examples (2013), Springer,       MK Cowles     8) R         Tutorial with Bayesian Statistics Using OpenBUGS, Amazon Media EU       (2012), Chi Yau     Sales for four of the books above have been made available to us [E, F]       totalling [text removed for       publication] copies sold worldwide.
The BUGS Book, 6), co-authored by       Best, has sold [text       removed for publication] copies in its first year since publication, and       in November 2013 was       ranked #42 on the Amazon "best sellers in Mathematical Probability and       Statistics" list (this was the       top ranked Bayesian text book) and ranked #28,188 overall (out of       39,995,344) in their books       bestsellers.
The descriptions for books 2) and 3) state "Bayesian         statistics has exploded into         biology and its sub-disciplines [...].
WinBUGS and its open-source         sister OpenBugs is currently the         only flexible and general-purpose program available with which the         average ecologist can conduct         standard and non-standard Bayesian statistics" [G].
The BUGS software is also used widely for the teaching of Bayesian       modelling ideas to students       and researchers the world over, and several texts (as demonstrated by the       list above) use       WinBUGS and OpenBUGS extensively for illustrating the Bayesian approach       across both distinct       and general application areas.
For example, `The BUGS Book' (book 6) has       been adopted as       material for Bayesian courses at 19 universities across the world in its       first year since publication,       with a further 34 universities reviewing the book for courses beginning in       2014.
Countries include       the UK, Ireland, USA, Canada, Germany, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands       and Singapore [F].
Selected Applications of WinBUGs/OpenBUGS:     To provide a flavour of the impact that the BUGS software has had on the       practice of Bayesian       statistics outside of the academic arena, three exemplars are provided       below:       &#8226; Pharmaceutical Industry: For Pfizer Neusentis WinBUGS has been         the software of choice when         undertaking Bayesian analyses and has been used in numerous Phase 2 and         3 studies to         analyse data, adopting informative prior distributions for the placebo         and dose response, and         sometimes the standard of care response, saving time, money and, more         importantly,         unnecessary patient recruitment.
The most notable example is one in         which Pfizer reduced the         placebo arm of the trial by 100 patients, from 300 to 200.
As a result         the duration of the trial         was reduced by approximately 12 months and saved about $7.5M.
In a         further exemplar, the         results of a BUGS-based meta-analysis of dose response integrating seven         phase 2 and 3         studies proved central in a recent discussion supporting dose selection         that resulted in approval         of a new compound for the treatment of rheumatory arthritis [H].
More generally, Pfizer have stated that "Bayesian methods have           contributed a great deal to the           efforts being made by Pfizer to improve the efficiency of drug           discovery and development.
It is           only due to the invention of MCMC methods, and their practical           implementation in the BUGS           software, that we have been able to apply Bayesian methods as widely           as we now do.
By           making MCMC methods for Bayesian analysis both free and relatively           easy to program, BUGS           is a major factor in overcoming the inertia that exists in the           adoption of new methodologies" [H].
&#8226; WinBUGS is also the only software package discussed by name in the         report by the FDA on         Guidance for the Use of Bayesian Statistics in Medical Device Clinical         Trials (2010) U.S.         Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration         [I].
&#8226; Informing national disease control programmes in developing           countries: The geostatistical         model functionality in add on package GeoBUGS has been used to produce         spatial predictive         infectious disease risk maps to aid implementation of national disease         control programmes in         developing countries across Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.
These         maps, modelled by Prof         Clements (U. Queensland), have informed the allocation of resources for         various diseases         including schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminth infections, malaria         and rift valley fever.
Examples include generating maps for the planning of mass drug         administration campaigns to         control schistosomiasis in Africa, and maps of malaria risk at the         baseline stage of a malaria         elimination programme in Vanuatu, forming the basis of a decision to         limit indoor residual         spraying of insecticide to within 2km of the coastline of Tanna Island.
Work on Rift Valley Fever         (RVF) was done in collaboration with Prof Best [J], and created maps to         support the planning of         the siting of sentinel surveillance sites for RVF activity in northern         Senegal.
Clements states         that WinBUGs "overcomes a number of limitations associated with           traditional geostatistics           allowing for robust spatial predictions that incorporate information           from a range of sources" [K].
&#8226; Fisheries stock assessments: Fisheries stock assessments are         conducted to evaluate the         consequences of different management actions.
In 1999, a seminal paper         by Meyer and Millar         [L] recognised the potential of WinBUGS for Bayesian fish stock         assessments: "we report on         significant progress made in facilitating the routine implementation         that may have a         revolutionary effect on Bayesian stock assessment in everyday practice.
This is achieved         through BUGS, a recently developed software package" [p. 1078].
They         conclude their article         with the prediction that "the routine implementation of Bayesian         inference that is now possible         will `almost surely' have an impact on fisheries stock assessment" [p.         1084].
Fourteen years         later, a Google search on the terms "winbugs + fish + stock +         assessment" yields over 1,700         hits since 2008.
These include stock assessments of sword fish for the         Western and Central         Pacific Fisheries Commission [M], Chinook salmon for the Alaska         Department of Fish and         Game [N] and Bottomfish for the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science         Center [O].
