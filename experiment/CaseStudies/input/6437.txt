     The Design Research Group engaged in applied research through KTPs with       the following companies and charities during a nine-year period: Datapride       (2001); Hambleside Danelaw (2003); Creative Tops (2004); Lionmede       (Northampton Signs) (2006); Sue Ryder Care (2006); BCE (2007); The       Salvation Army (2007); Primarius UK Ltd (2009); and John Crane (2010).
The companies and charities supplied and manufactured a range of products       including: toys, games and gifts; signage; phone systems; building       products; household goods; and train seats.
This resulted in the following       impact: the creation of new products; growth in design capability; and       resulting business growth with increases in sales, profitability and       employment.
A further impact, an increase in quality of life provided by       the charity Sue Ryder Care, followed from the improved business       performance of the charity.
This account will focus on the impact on three       of the KTPs: Sue Ryder Care; BCE; and John Crane.
Sue Ryder Care KTP (2006-2009) was the central project of the       Design Research Group accounting for considerable impact.
Previous KTPs       informed The Sue Ryder Care KTP: Datapride (2001); Hambleside Danelaw       (2003) (S5); and Creative Topps.
Research carried out by the Design       Research Group informed more recent KTP projects such as the BCE KTP and       John Crane KTP.
In the Sue Ryder Care KTP the associate (Stewart Betts) under the       supervision of lead academics Turner and Battle applied       the research in design and design management, and the application of       computer-aided design (CAD) in the design process to retail new products       (primarily toys) through its chain of 380 shops.
Sue Ryder Care had       previously sourced the design and manufacture of its products overseas but       due to poor-quality products, required an in-house design facility.
The       KTP addressed the previous quality problems by implementing a new product       design methodology.
This contributed to an increase in total gross         profit of &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] for the charity in the year following the beginning       of the KTP (S1) as part of an increase in sales of &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] (S1).The       income generated was used for palliative care, a further impact of the       KTP.
The new design capability has enabled the charity to capitalise on       opportunities that previously would not have been explored and continues       to impact positively on the charity's sales and profits.
Sue Ryder Care       reported (S4) that over the period 2006-2009, a creative design capability       had been embedded and through a successful marketing campaign in the Daily         Mail, a profit of &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] was added to the charity's figures       for one new product.
The charity reported an increase in turnover of 30%       and an increase in sales of 50% (S1) during the KTP period.
In       response to a questionnaire in June 2013, Sue Ryder Care Head of       Commercial Operations, Dawn Bullen (S4), reported that during the period       2009-2013 &#8212; from the date of the final KTP report to June 2013 - turnover       had increased by &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION]: from &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] to &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION], noting an       annual profit increase between 2009 and 2013 from &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] to &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION]       for 2012-2013.
Bullen reported that the number of employees had increased       from 14 to 19 in the same period.
Bullen stated that Sue Ryder Care had benefited from KTP associate       Stewart Betts (subsequently employed by Sue Ryder Care): `Stewart         brought a distinctive taste level and innovation to the own branded Sue         Ryder offer of toys and musical instruments.
During 2010 the         organisation "re-branded" itself.
Stewart was the principal driver         behind creating products and packaging that fitted the new brand.
This         was key in differentiating Sue Ryder New Goods from the donated goods         that they also sell and has helped raise their profile and promote their         sale.'
Bullen summarised the increase in profitability at 6%,       with percentage increases in market share and sales, and improved quality       and operations.
KTP associate Betts was awarded KTP Business Leader of the Future       by TSB and Nesta at Westminster (2008).
The nomination form states clear       evidence of the Associate's impact upon the financial success of the       company, through the application of the research by Wilkinson and others:       `The finacial expectations have been surpassed, with extensive sales         and profits being made in year on year.
.
.
more importantly Stewart has         embedded new products and design capabilities which will considerably         impact the company's sales and profits going forward.'
(S7).
BCE reported (S1) that between 2007-2010 the KTP was `invaluable'       &#8212;as a consequence they were able to register three patents.
The       KTP introduced "a completely new style of design to BCE customers" with &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION]       saved because they no longer outsourced their creative graphics; an       increase in employees by three; a 50% increase in turnover;       and a 50% increase in sales (S1).
In a response to a questionnaire (S3) in April 2013, BCE reported that `.
.
.
the KTP collaboration has allowed BCE to bring all design elements         in house, which during the downturn, has been key to how responsive we         can be.
In the past all design/creative work would have been outsourced         to different companies, which would produce work but never quite capture         what was wanted as a business and brand.
With this internal         infrastructure BCE have been able to build several solid brand         identities that portray a consistent brand image, which is expected from         the leaders or their respective markets.'
Further: `The all round design capability that the KTP associate         offers has allowed the company to put in place several successful         patents and design registries, which have eliminated the many problems         that the company faced from rival businesses in the markets in the years         before the collaboration.
Once promoted to Design Manager, shortly after         the collaboration had concluded, the associate also took control of all         forms of media, marketing and advertisement for the company's brands.
This allowed BCE to strengthen their brand's image even further.'
The impact of the KTP is clear: The internal infrastructure enabled BCE       to control their brand and design direction and champion       new design technology and innovation in their products, which increases       appeal to customers and strengthens their brand image in the marketplace.
In a design capacity, the company is now more proactive than reactive and       customers recognise this strength when selecting their products.
(S3)     John Crane Ltd (2010) successfully embedded design competencies       through our KTP partnership that enabled them to develop their own design       studio.
Many companies were buying and distributing finished products from       overseas rather than designing and creating their own ranges.
As a consequence of the KTP scheme, John Crane's Managing Director       Jonathan Thorpe reported in April 2013 (S4) that `this autumn         we will have nearly 15 products in John Lewis that         the design department has taken from paper to retail shelf and this will         generate up to &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] in sales'.
He further notes: ` .
.
.
we will also have 10 products in our own         Tildo brand that will produce revenue up to a further &#163;[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION].'
Thorpe       states: `With your help (the KTP principal) and that of the University         of Northampton and the KTP programme, we have established a studio and         it now works exactly how I envisaged it should nearly two years ago .
.
.
resulting in financial rewards'.
