     Pickstock's research has entered the contemporary "canon", as a reference       point for clergy, ordinands and seminarians and liturgical reformers.
After         Writing is listed on the "Transforming Worship" website of the       Church of England's Liturgical Commission and the reading list for members       of the House of Bishops [1].
Her research is discussed and listed in Roman       Catholic and Anglican seminary bibliographies and in standard clerical and       seminary reference works, e.g.
the Oxford Guide to the Book of Common         Prayer (OUP, 2006) and The New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and         Worship (SCM, 2002) which remain in wide use and feature on standard       seminary reading lists [1, 2, 3, 6].
Pickstock's theological analysis of liturgy as "impossible" and "a       difficult language" (After Writing, p. 186) has been linked by the       Church of England's Secretary to the Liturgical Commission with the House       of Bishops' rejection of the proposed (2011) revisions of liturgical texts       on the basis that they were inappropriately accessible [1].
Pickstock's       insistence on the connection between liturgy, the arts and politics, and       on liturgy as a fusion of the real and the ideal have been cited as an       animating force behind the theme of this decade's most significant       liturgical conference organised by the Liturgical Commission ("Liturgy in       the Public Square" and "Liturgy with Arts and Literature", July 2013) [1].
Pickstock's analysis of the mediaeval liturgy has influenced Roman       Catholic liturgical reform and practice in various ways; for example, the       sustained increase in the use of the Tridentine Mass all around the world,       following Pope Benedict's Summorum Pontificum Motu Proprio (2007)       and Sacramentum Caritatis (2007), is attributed by Roman Catholic       commentators in part to Pickstock's philosophico-theological analysis of       mediaeval rites, and her critique of the Vatican II reforms [4, 6, 9; see       also 2].
Her analysis of liturgical texts and critique of the       reforms have influenced the International Consultation on English in the       Liturgy in their recent recommendations and commentaries upon new       revisions, as well as recommendations for liturgical practice, in       particular the need for liturgical complexity and 'stammering' as well as       the re-introduction of caesurae (2009) [3, 4; see also 1, 2].
Pickstock's       work was a point of reference for the reformers during their new English       translation of the Roman Catholic Novus Ordo (2010) which was       issued to English-speaking Roman Catholic parishes in the USA, the UK and       Australia in 2011 [3; see also 1, 2].
Her discussion of liturgical       complexity and stammer has also impacted upon liturgical practice, as       evinced by the Archbishop of Granada in his statement concerning his       continuing liturgical practices and understanding [6].
Similarly, in the Church of England, Pickstock's work was a central point       of reference for reformers during the period when the Church was active in       the reform of the 1982 Alternative Service Book, leading to its       publication of the new Common Worship: Services and Prayers in the         Church of England, authorised for use by the General Synod since       2005, and now in circulation throughout the Anglican Communion and in       daily use in parishes all over the world [1, 2].
The new practice of       "silent Masses" and the introduction of the "caesura" or "Form of       Preparation" (Common Worship p. 161) have been attributed to       Pickstock's After Writing [1, 2], and especially her analysis of       what she has identified as a "liturgical stammer" [1].
Her work has also       been linked with the recent tendency to draw upon mediaeval,       pre-reformation and pre-Tridentine liturgical practices, over current       liturgical provision (e.g.
A. Davison and A. Milbank, For the Parish:         a Critique of Fresh Expressions (SCM, 2010) [1, 2].
In published overviews of Roman Catholic and Anglican liturgical       revision, such as those of the International Consultation on English in       the Liturgy and the Centre International d'&#201;tudes Liturgiques ([3]; see       also for e.g., J. S. Baldovin, Reforming the Liturgy: A Response to         the Critics (Liturgical Press, 2009), ch.
1), as well as in various       discussion forums, the reformers and other discussants routinely cite       Pickstock's work when insisting on liturgy as a theological category, as       more than a text or isolated rite, as requiring apophatic "stammering" and       "recommencements" (e.g.
Baldovin, esp.
pp.
26-32) [also 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,       9, 10].
They acknowledge their debt to her critique of the reforms for not       adequately contextualising the liturgy in contemporary culture, and for       raising the following questions:            Do the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy and the subsequent reforms         too easily accept "modern" preconceptions about society?
[3, 4, 6, 7, 8]       Does the reform of the liturgy rationalize the Mass in a way that         evades its "impossibility"?
[1, 4, 6]       Have the strategies of translation (in the 1970s) adequately captured         the genius of genres to which they were applied?
(Aidan Nichols OP, Looking           at the Liturgy (Ignatius, 1996), pp.
82-6 and The Catholic           World Report (January 1997), pp.
58-9) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]       Was there adequate dialogue among liturgical historians, pastoral         specialists and theologians in the construction of the reform?
([3, 4];         also Baldovin, Reforming the Liturgy, ch.
1, esp.
pp.
26-32).
Pickstock's research and collaborative consultation have impacted upon       Croatian Lutheran liturgical practice (2010-2013), and are forming the       basis for a revision of the Croatian Lutheran Liturgy and pastoral       practice, with greater emphasis upon liturgical complexity, stammering and       caesurae, and more emphasis on the Eucharistic prayer and communal       contemplation than had been usual for Croatian Lutheran liturgical       practice.
Her work has also led to more lay attention to the theological       nature and purpose of liturgy [5].
Pickstock's research is central to the training of seminarians in       Granada, especially since the translation of After Writing       (Herder, 2006) made her work more accessible.
It has decisively impacted       upon the way in which new priests are taught to perform the liturgy, and       how the Archbishop of Granada regards and celebrates the liturgy, as a       broader and metaphysical pattern of ritual action in continuity with all       of life, and his manner of implementing the Pope's "reform of the reform"       and Summorum Pontificum in a Spanish context [6].
It has shaped       courses on worship and the liturgy in the ecumenical Cambridge Theological       Federation (the largest such institution in Europe) and has impacted upon       specific discussions of Anglican priesthood at Westcott House, one of the       colleges of the Federation [2].
Pickstock's critical re-evaluation of the liturgy has shaped public       discourse.
During the impact review period, Pickstock has been invited to       write Credo Columns in The Times, given public addresses       to groups of churchgoers and ordinands, including talks at Manchester       Cathedral (2008, c. 70) and Westcott Theological College (2010, c. 45), as       well as other religious and non-religious audiences and video-link       discussions (e.g.
Mus&#233;e d'art contemporain de Montr&#233;al, 2010, c. 200).
Her       works have been reviewed, discussed and reprinted in semi-popular       religious as well as non-religious journals and bulletins (e.g.
The         Reader (2009), Art and Christianity (2008)), reviewed and       cited in newspaper reviews and articles (e.g.
L'Homme Nouveau       (2008), The Tablet (2009), The Church Times (2009), and       mockingly cited in "Pseud's Corner" of Private Eye (Issue 952, p.       13) and discussed in blogs and online discussion forums (e.g.
[7, 8, 9,       10]).
