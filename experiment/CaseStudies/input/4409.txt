     The project changed the perceptions and practice of practitioners who       work with readers and/or       organize public events by providing new knowledge about the possibilities       and limitations of mass       reading events for enhancing the cultural life of a city or region,       creating social change and       producing cultural capital.
Changing the perspectives of practitioners through adoption of the           research in training and         development       Two key groups of beneficiaries from the research are book event       organizers and public librarians.
Feedback from the project conference demonstrated that practitioners       benefitted from       opportunities to see their practical experience in the light of       trans-national research contexts.
The research has been adopted as part of the professional formation of       publishers, librarians, and       educators in Europe, North America and Australia.
Both the website and       select articles are       currently prescribed readings on undergraduate courses in both       professional and non-vocational       programmes at U of Alberta, UBC, U of Toronto, U of Manitoba, Western U,       Dalhousie U in       Canada; at MIT and U of Wisconsin-Madison in the USA; at Monash U       (Australia) and at least 5       European institutions, including universities in Mainz, Paris and Lund.
Since 2008, the researchers have contributed directly to the continuing       professional development       of public librarians in North America and the UK through a series of       invited presentations and       continuing professional development events based on our research, e.g.
Fuller contributed to a training event for 50 Scottish Librarians         focused upon organizing and         evaluating `One Book, One Community' events, in Edinburgh, 20 June 2008         (Napier U in         partnership with the Scottish Arts Council and Edinburgh City of         Literature).
Rehberg Sedo has given two keynote presentations (May 2008 and May         2011) to members         of the Canadian Library Association at their annual conference with         audiences of 150+ in         attendance on each occasion.
Fuller has twice been an invited guest (via Skype) in Prof. Vivian         Howard's MSc in Library         Science and Information Services class to address 100 students following         the professional         programme at Dalhousie U, Canada (Feb, 2011 &amp; 2012).
Responses to Fuller's keynote presentation at a conference on Book Events       aimed at arts and       literature professionals, publishers, and academics (U of Stirling, 23-4       March 2012) indicate the       continuing practical value of the analyses for event organizers and       literature producers, e.g.
`Good       to access university research on this subject.
Examples and insights given       will inform and shape       my professional practice.
Very useful.'
(Publishing professional); the       trans-national aspects of the       research are especially helpful to book industry workers, e.g.
`It was       particularly useful to hear       about the comparison between the UK and North American contexts'       (publishing professional);       while the community-enhancing aspects of the models examined inspired       others, e.g.
`Interesting       to see how the embodied communal experience still enriches how we relate       to books &#8212; and makes       me wonder whether social networking has made people even more receptive to       acts that       consolidate community.'

Changing the practice of students and new practitioners       A key group of beneficiaries are postgraduate students pursuing degrees in       publishing studies,       library and information science, literary studies, cultural studies and       education who have benefitted       from workshops on the research in, e.g.
:            Oxford: Fuller and Rehberg Sedo.
Society for Authorship, Reading &amp;         Publishing Annual         Conference, 24 June 2008, 14 students from 6 nations;       Australia: Fuller, Master Class in Reading, Monash U, Melbourne, 26         June 2012: 30         participants, mix of early career researchers and graduate students;       Estonia: Fuller, lecture-workshop for MA students at the University of         Tartu, Estonia, 1         November 2012 (20 students).
Participants at the Australian workshop testified to the impact of the       BTB research on their       professional development by highlighting the ways that it would change       their methods/ways of       working: `Inspired me to work collaboratively' (early career); `The       complex methodologies displayed       here gave me some modelling for how to develop my own' (postgraduate       student); `demystifying       the benefits of using coding programs will inform future projects'       (postgraduate student),       `inspiration to pay academic attention to readers' (early career) [source       2].
Online Engagement and International Reach       A variety of forms and media were created in order to engage with a range       of user-groups around       the world and to disseminate the research as widely as possible.
The BTB       website       (www.beyondthebookproject.org),       for example, initially incorporated the online questionnaire aimed       at non-academic readers in the UK, USA and Canada (2005-7) and since 2008       online resources       continue to be accessed [source 3]:            Between 13 Oct 05 &amp; 03 Sept 08, there were 144,659 'sessions', 5%         of which (7,302) were         over 10 mins.
in length; an average of 19 visitors per day.
The most         visitors came from (in         descending order) USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Germany, India and China.
Between Oct 1, 2008 and June 1, 2011, the website received a total of         1880 visitors from         100 different countries, with particular interest from Australia,         Ireland, India and several         countries in mainland Europe.
Between 1 October 2011 and 30 April 2012, there were 645 visitors, and         while 46% of         these were from the UK, 19% from the USA and 13% from Canada, other         visitors hailed         from the Ukraine, Brazil and South Africa.
Between 1 May 2012 and 31 July 2013, there were 1909 visitors to the         site, and while 42%         of these were from the UK, 24% from the USA and 14% from Canada, other         visitors hailed         from Australia, Sweden, India and Estonia.
Online resources have been adapted in response to the needs of       user-groups so that, since May       2012, the website has hosted two videos aimed at public librarians and       book event organizers:       `Why organize a One Book, One Community programme?'
and `One Book, One       Community: Tips       for Success'.
The videos have been viewed 42 times and 22 times       respectively (May 2012-31 July       2013), with most views coming from the UK, USA and Canada.
These videos       were informed by a       series of face-to-face meetings with Reader Advisory librarians and       organizers of literary events       which were fundamental to the primary research phase (2003-7).
Beyond the Book has achieved unforeseen impacts on the perceptions and       practice of public       librarians, literature professionals and students through the planned       dissemination of research       online and through a series of professional development activities and       workshops.
