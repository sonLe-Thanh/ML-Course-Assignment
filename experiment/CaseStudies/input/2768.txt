Background:       Thomas's evidence to the National Assembly for Wales's Culture Committee       [C1] led directly to the establishment of the Library of Wales.
Using the research outlined above, Thomas argued that a great body of       literature was unavailable to general readers and students and that where       such books were reprinted `no provision [was] made for delivery or for         creating a market' [C2].
Taking as his model the Library of         America, that `great, popular monument to the literary         achievements of the USA' [C1], Thomas suggested the creation of a       `Library of Wales', which would require generous funding from the       Government.
The Culture Committee duly made this recommendation which the       Government accepted with cross-party support.
Smith was appointed to       create a blueprint for the project, Thomas was appointed to oversee the       development of the publishing franchise and funding arrangements at the       Welsh Books Council, and the first titles in the series appeared in 2006.
They were eagerly received on both sides of the Atlantic, including being       adopted for BBC R4 Book at Bedtime, Andrew Marr's Start the Week, and       promotions in American Barnes &amp; Noble stores.
CREW Development of the Library of Wales since 2008       The Library of Wales is currently edited by Smith and is       overseen by Thomas in his position of Chair of the Welsh Books       Council.
The publisher, Parthian Books, has an office at Swansea       University.
New titles are selected by Smith in consultation with CREW       colleagues (CREW drafted a list of 100 titles for the Welsh Books Council       in 2004 during the planning/lobbying phase).
Additional advice from       academics and teachers is sought, and now the series is well-established       proposals are received from the public, leading to the rediscovery, for       example, of Stead Jones's novel Make Room for the Jester, which       now has an introduction by Philip Pullman.
Impact and beneficiaries of the Library of Wales 2008-13       Since 2008, new funding worth &#163;280,000 has been awarded to the Welsh Books       Council to develop the Library of Wales.
To date 38 titles have       appeared, 25 of those published since 2008, accruing total sales of       56,000.
Principal beneficiaries are: a) the publisher, Parthian       Books (major boost to turnover and profile); b) the Welsh Books Council       (the grant for the series represented a 20% increase in the annual budget       for English-language books); c) schoolchildren and university students       (all schools and public libraries in Wales have a complete set of the       series and titles are now studied in schools and universities), and d) the       public, in Wales and beyond, who have been made newly aware of the       strength and diversity of the Welsh literary heritage.
Economic Benefit for Publisher       Sales for 2008-13 total 38,700 books.
Income from the Welsh Government       grant in 2008-2013 totals &#163;250,000, with turnover for the series at c.       &#163;75,000 per year [C3; C4].
The economies of scale generated by the series       in the period since 2008 have led to substantial strengthening of the       company's infrastructure and the series created new jobs (Manager, Editor,       Marketing = 1 FTE post) and work experience via 20 internships and 4 paid       graduate placements (Go Wales).
[C3]     e-book development       Welsh government funding made it possible for Parthian to experiment with       electronic publishing.
In 2010, Parthian made all Library of Wales       titles available as e-books (via Faber Fiction Factory and Amazon Kindle);       e-books increased sales by as much as 25% on promotional titles.
This test       case was the foundation of a very lucrative e-book strategy for the whole       Parthian list, and led to the creation of new digital initiatives by the       Welsh Books Council to support other publishers in Wales (e.g.
new grants       for publishers to develop e-books and new e-pub platforms supported via       its online bookshop gwales.com) [C4].
Raising the profile of writing from Wales: developing readerships in         Wales and beyond       New audiences have been developed for Welsh writing in English by the much       higher marketing budget (&#163;20k per year) promoting brand awareness of the Library         of Wales.
All titles are available as e-books, extending reach;       point of sale stands are prominent in bookshops, cultural centres and       tourist venues [C4].
Sales for the Library of Wales are double and       in some cases quadruple the average sales for a new literary novel in       Wales: average sale for a new Library of Wales title is 1,600,       with some totalling 4,000-6,500 [C3, C4].
Public consciousness of       Anglophone Welsh literary heritage has been raised.
Reader Development       Officers have used the Library of Wales titles for Reading Groups       across Wales and readers have pursued new titles in the series as they       appear.
The Library of Wales as a series was chosen as the       centrepiece of a televised debate (The Sunday Politics Show,       4.11.12) on arts funding, in which CREW postgraduate students appeared       alongside Assembly Members to discuss the value and impact of the series.
Sample testimonies convey the way the series has changed people's view of       Welsh literary heritage.
One reader encapsulates the value of the series       as follows: "it has been refreshing to see Welsh writing that would         otherwise have slipped me by.
They have widened my appreciation         and knowledge of Welsh writing, leading me to want to read more"       [C5].
A student of literature at Durham University said "I chose to         write my dissertation on Welsh Writing in English specifically because I         discovered the Library of Wales series.
Prior to that I would have had         no idea where to start with Welsh Writing in English as a literary         tradition."
[C6] The writer, Rachel Trezise (who won the inaugural       &#163;60,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for her book about Valleys life) has spoken in       public about the impact of the series on her: "I dedicated my novel       Sixteen Shades of Crazy to Gwyn Thomas.
When I embarked on my writing         career I'd never heard of him, or any other writers from the Rhondda,         but because of the Library of Wales I have gradually come to         realise that the south Wales valley novel is an established tradition; a         path I'm following, not forging."
[C7]     The importance of the series as a `brand' is recognized by politicians,       ordinary readers and the creative industries.
Since 2008, successive       ministers have endorsed the impact of the Library of Wales by       extending the funding for the series.
In 2008, the First Minister Rhodri       Morgan said of the Library of Wales that it is "One of the best         things we've supported as a government", and in 2012 the Minister       for Culture described it an `excellent way of selling our nation to the         world' [C8].
Outside Wales, readership has been expanded by       translations of some titles (into Spanish and Arabic) and the sale of       foreign rights.
The series is distributed across the UK and USA, and sales       beyond Wales account for 42% of the total.
Impact on tourism and creative industries     The Library of Wales has generated spin-off events and creative       opportunities, evidenced by:            National Theatre of Wales's successful adaptation of a Library of           Wales title, Gwyn Thomas's The Dark Philosophers, staged         nationally (2010) and beyond (Edinburgh 2011).
Literary tours organized by national promotional agency, Literature           Wales, based on Library of Wales titles, taking place from         Soho to Rhondda.
Nine different tours have run since 2008, each         averaging 40 people, plus on-line `tourists' who download maps and         reading lists.
Tours generate economic benefits for the host venues,         including hire costs, catering and transport [C9].
An established partnership (2006 - ongoing) with the Hay Festival.
This year Prince Charles was presented with a full set of the Library           of Wales during his visit to Hay.
Impact on education and ongoing Welsh Government policy       Sustaining the wider literary heritage of Wales is now seen by the Welsh       government to be a key component in creating and sustaining an ongoing       sense of modern Welsh culture and history.
The Government's education       policy, the Curriculum Cymreig (Welsh Curriculum), requires that schools       educate children about the history, culture and politics of Wales.
The       Welsh Government provides a full set of the Library of Wales to       all secondary schools and colleges in Wales, giving teachers new material       to help pupils understand their local and national cultural heritage.
A       teaching pack was published to help teachers introduce a range of Library         of Wales titles in the classroom at Key Stage 4 and 5 [C10].
To extend the impact of literature and arts in education, the Minister       for Education commissioned CREW's Smith to undertake wide consultation and       produce a report on "Arts in Education in the Schools of Wales: An       Independent Report for the Welsh Government" (2013).
The report recommends       that the Welsh Government makes `creativity', including critical       appreciation and creative practice of literature, a `core theme' alongside       Literacy and Numeracy in the Welsh curriculum, since literature is crucial       to developing an informed citizenry and an understanding of cultural       identity.
This is the same premise that underpins the sustained initiative       of Welsh Government funding for the Library of Wales [C11].
The       minister will respond in the autumn of 2013, and CREW has been invited to       give a policy briefing session for National Assembly members and civil       servants on the Library of Wales, education and the future of       Welsh writing in English in November 2013.
