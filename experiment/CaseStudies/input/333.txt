     Policy Impacts     In October 2009 the European Commission identified Dobson as the       best-positioned scholar to brief its officials at an informal seminar held       in Brussels on how to leverage cooperation with Japan in the G8 and G20 to       better achieve common goals.
This briefing helped its officials "better         understand Japan's immediate concerns and interests in various         multilateral fora and how we might be able to tap into these in our         pursuit of the EU's global aims" (S1).
Dobson's contributions "remained         important underpinnings as we built on this early work on upgrading the         EU-Japan relationship at the subsequent 2010 and 2011 EU-Japan Summits"       (S1).
The result of this process was the Foreign Affairs Council's       decision in November 2012 to begin negotiations with Japan towards both a       Framework Agreement and a Free Trade Agreement.
In addition, Dobson has co-organised numerous policy-focused workshops       and briefings in collaboration with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office       (FCO) believing that "it is invaluable and essential for diplomats in         the FCO to not only have at their fingertips our country's best research         on matters of policy importance, but also to have a sufficiently close         relationship with those experts that we may draw on their judgements at         often very short notice" (S2).
These events have included officials       with a direct role in the preparation of the G8 summit, such as the UK       sous-sherpa (aide) to Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
A workshop in       February/March 2008 entitled `The 2008 G8 Summit: Lessons for the UK and       Japan', took place at a time when, according to the aide, the UK       government was championing outreach and expansion among its G8 partners.
Dobson's research findings on Japan's promotion of, and resistance to,       these initiatives were fed into policymakers' understanding of what would       become a major issue just months after the workshop.
These events have       also included officials with a direct role in UK-Japan relations, such as       the current UK Ambassador to Japan.
During May and June 2013, Dobson       initiated, co-organised and participated in a series of weekly policy       briefings for the FCO on key issues, including global summitry, that were       timed around the 2013 Loch Erne Summit and "informed policy officials         as to the latest research on these topics, [and] also brought together         colleagues from across different parts of government to discuss issues         of common relevance who otherwise might not have met" (S2).
Dobson       also edited the briefings as a volume of policy papers for distribution to       UK missions overseas to ensure that "the impact of the seminars will         be made broader and more longer lasting" (S2).
Media and Public Understanding Impacts     This impact was created through collaboration with global think tanks       including the G8/G20 Research Groups, the Global Summitry Project and the       Centre for International Governance Innovation.
Dobson has joined       researchers from these think tanks and secured official media       accreditation to attend G8 and G20 summits since 2008.
He was thus able to       conduct a number of official press briefings and one-to-one in-depth       interviews with leading UK, Japanese and global media outlets including The         Times (readership: 500,000) and Asahi Shinbun (readership:       11 million), in addition to Nihon Keizai Shinbun (readership: 3       million), Wall Street Journal (readership: 2 million), Kyodo         News (Japan's major news agency and source of news for Japanese       newspapers, radio and television), BBC World Service (audience:       188 million), Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the national       radio and television broadcaster), Canada Television Network (the       largest private broadcaster), China Radio International (China's       equivalent of the BBC World Service) and Xinhua (China's       major news agency and source of news for newspapers, radio and       television).
Thus, Dobson's research on the historical context of Japan's role in the       G8, the reasons behind the Japanese government's conflicted response to       the creation of the G20 and the role of non- traditional actors has       impacted on media understanding of these issues.
According to a Japanese       journalist: "[i]t is often the case at these major diplomatic events         that a correspondent inevitably relies heavily upon his or her own         government for the necessary information and insight into how the         various negotiations and diplomatic contacts are progressing.
All the         more reason then why I have found Professor Dobson's help to be         invaluable" (S3).
Impacting on media understanding has in turn       impacted on the resulting reportage, as illustrated by two UK       journalists:"I often find myself struggling to catch up very quickly on         complex subjects.
Professor Dobson's clear explanations were exactly         what I needed, and The Times' coverage of the summit was         enhanced as a result" (S4).
"He [Dobson] provides me with         the necessary information to put recent events into context and this         helps me judge whether something is particularly newsworthy or relevant".
Moreover, this reportage ultimately impacts on public understanding by "feed[ing]         into the national debate going on in Japan on particular issues"       (S5).
