     The labour market is a key policy area in NI, as in the rest of the UK.
The NI labour market was characterised by employment growth from 1990 to       2007 but simultaneously also had high rates of economic inactivity.
This       raised questions about the distribution of paid employment in NI, access       to work for benefit claimants, and the need to ensure equality of labour       market opportunity between the two major `national' communities &#8212;       Protestant and Catholic.
The growth of employment and the attraction of       inward investment were therefore significant elements in the NI       Executive's 2007-2011 Programme for Government.
Additionally, just as in       the rest of the UK, welfare reform, and the involvement of benefit       claimants in employment, has been a major government objective and brings       together an understanding of labour market dynamics with social policy       initiatives.
The research undertaken by Shuttleworth et al       addresses these issues and has had the following impact since 2008:            DEL received detailed evidence from our research on the geographical         operation of labour markets and recruitment.
This informed the           advice they then provided to inward-investment companies as well as           other employers who have been seeking to increase their work forces in           NI (Item 1).
This included an assessment of the spatial and         non-spatial barriers to work and their operation in different places.
In         this case, better understanding of the geographical context of labour         markets led to better understanding of labour supply issues - efficiency         issues &#8212; and also equality issues.
Our 2001 analysis of who gets jobs         and from where within NI (Item 2) has impacts continuing to the present         day, with beneficiaries including the NI public.
The Task Group `Recovering the Unemployed and Inactive into the         Economy' (2009-2010, see Item 3).
(convened by the NI Advisor on         Employment and Skills, and including Shuttleworth) was set up as a         result of our research.
This contributed to framing the response by the         NI Executive to the UK Welfare Reform Agenda and is an example of the         effect of research upon public policy.
Evidence from Shuttleworth's         research contributed to round table debates with civil servants and         representatives from the voluntary and business communities.
These           included evidence of some individuals being trapped by localised low           mobility horizons, the evolution of these limits over a labour market           career, and the great distance of some people from employment.
This raised questions about the effectiveness of policy interventions         and their targeting, especially in a time of reductions in some areas of         public spending.
Dilemmas explored included the need to be fair by         supporting all claimants in their search for work but with the         recognition that scarce resources spent on older people a long way from         the labour market might be more efficiently spent on younger people         nearer the labour market and with better prospects of gaining a job.
This had an impact on decision-making and policy recommendations and in         the final report Shuttleworth el al's research was cited 14 times.
(See         Item 4 2010 Task Group Report on Recovering the Unemployed and Inactive         into the Economy).
Beneficiaries include policymakers and the public         more generally.
The research also impacted on the rolling out of the labour market           dimensions of the wider Welfare Reform Agenda in NI including           Shuttleworth el al's help in shaping government recommendations about           the introduction of Employment Support Allowance (ESA).
This was         done by providing information on the nature of the spatial (and         non-spatial) barriers to employment faced by Incapacity Benefit         Claimants to Job Centre Advisors and proved invaluable, for example in         determining the Department's response to implementing the ESA and of the         migration of Incapacity Benefit clients to ESA and Job Seekers Allowance         (Item 3).
Beneficiaries again include policymakers and the public more         generally.
Recommendations from the research led to changes in the provision of         services and advice by DEL to young people, unemployed people, and those         seeking training, that would better reflect the spatial structure of the         NI labour market (Item 5 and 6).
It allowed DEL to adjust its services,         for example, directly in the terms of advice and guidance given to         clients &#8212; and also to give the staff (eg careers officers, employment         service staff) an understanding of the environment that their clients         are working in.
The most concrete example of this is the decision by DEL         to produce labour market information on a Workforce Development Forum         (WDF) area basis (the WDFs cover the same area as the six Further         Education college footprints): this geography was deliberately chosen to         give local information &#8212; but not too local.
There were a number of         reasons for this but a key one was to widen the geographical horizon of         both advisor and advised especially in the Jobs and Benefits Office         context (Item 1).
This is an example of research influencing public         policy with policymakers and the general public being beneficiaries.
