     The main message from the research was that the maritime industry should       treat seafarers' fatigue as an occupational health and safety issue, which       could be addressed using established methods.
Evidence of initial impact       comes from the finding that fatigue-related accidents have decreased since       publication of the research.
Fatigue was associated with 62% of groundings       prior to 2007 and with 55% of groundings in more recent years (Lohrman,       CASCADe, 2013).5.1     Changes to international legislation and company policy     Maritime safety is a global transport problem affecting all seafaring       countries, and key stakeholders have used Cardiff's research findings to       inform changes to maritime practice and policy.
In the UK, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) have included fatigue       as part of their "human element strategy.
"5.2 An initial part       of this strategy has been to monitor ships' records in order to identify       false entries and non-compliance with hours-of-rest requirements.
The research has also been used to support measures to deal with fatigue       at both the national (presentations by Smith to the UK Transport Minister,       2009) and international level (presentations by Smith to the International       Maritime Organization, 2008).5.3 Additionally, the Cardiff       research on seafarers' fatigue was followed by major revisions to the       International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and       Watchkeeping for Seafarers (the STCW Convention) at the IMO conference in       Manila in 2010.5.4 These involved revised requirements on work       and rest.
Minimum rest periods in seven days were increased from 70 to 77       hours and seafarers must now have 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period.
It is now mandatory to maintain records of each individual seafarer's rest       hours.
These rest hours now apply to most seafarers, not just to       watchkeepers.
These amendments came into force in January 2012.
Implementation of Cardiff fatigue audit     A fatigue audit (survey of risk factors, perceived fatigue and       fatigue-related outcomes) developed by the Cardiff research team has been       used by several shipping companies (e.g., P&amp;O Ferries, Dutch Dredging,       BP Shipping).
The audit has involved all stakeholders and has been linked       to the development of fatigue training and countermeasures (e.g., the       P&amp;O cross-channel ferries survey5.5).
The research has also       helped the development of services in other countries; for example, it was       used to help develop fatigue management guidance for seafarers in New       Zealand.5.6, pp.228-9     The research was also instrumental in the formation of a World Health       Organisation (WHO) Maritime Health Group in 2009, and Cardiff's lead PI       (Smith) is a member of this group.
The WHO group has played an active role       in the dissemination of information about the prevention and management of       seafarers' fatigue.
Improved public awareness of a health risk or benefit has been raised,         and public behaviour has changed (auditing)&gt;      Dissemination has involved collaboration with maritime unions and other       bodies that aim to communicate with individual seafarers.
For example, the       research recommendations were included in newsletters that went to all       members of Nautilus (UK national union, 24,000 members)5.7 and       the International Transport Federation (660,000 members worldwide).5.8       The Nautical Institute (a charity providing information about seafaring       issues to the international community) covered the research on their       `Alert' website (over 10,000 hits).5.9 The organisations that       have run these campaigns perceive that the research has been of great       benefit:     "The Cardiff research took knowledge and understanding of the issue         from a relatively unmeasured level to the point at which the problems         could be quantified.
Nothing of this depth and scale had been done         before.
It made the case for action stronger than it had ever been and         it has been of immense assistance in pursuing representations on behalf         of seafarers."
&#8212; Andrew Linington (2012), Director of Campaigns and       Communication, Nautilus.5.6, p.228     The research team also created a film to highlight key issues emerging       from their research.
Cardiff made this publicly available at       www.seafarersfatigue.com (over 7,200 viewings in a year, covering 25       countries).5.10 The film is also being used for training       purposes by a number of organisations, including Warsach Maritime Academy       (cadet training) and Shell (as part of their ship management operator       reviews).
Organisations that have run these campaigns perceive that the       research has been of great benefit:     "Fatigue and the limitations on human performance (including         situational awareness) that result are an important element of the         Marine Crew Resource Management (MRCM) training course.
The ability to         reference back to the Cardiff research, the fact that it was done on         working vessels not in the lab, the analytical rigor and the widespread         publicity through the Cardiff seminars delivers the necessary evidential         `punch'."
