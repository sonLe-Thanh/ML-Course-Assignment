     As a research project, Languages at War was structured from the       outset to bring together non-academic partners with academic researchers.
Two colleagues from the Imperial War Museum, London, attended research       team meetings every three months.
The project's Advisory Group (meeting       termly) included two representatives from the Ministry of Defence, and one       from the Royal Military College, Shrivenham.
A range of non-academic       partners was invited to contribute to Workshops (May 2009, May 2010), and       to the final conference (April 2011) which included papers from the head       of the MOD's inter-services languages unit, the President of the       International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC), and the Head       of Research and Information at the Imperial War Museum (published in Languages         and the Military: Alliances, Occupation and Peace Building, Palgrave       Macmillan, 2012).
As a result of the structures which had been set in       place, researchers received invitations to discuss their ongoing work in       the MOD's Upavon Barracks (March 2009), the Defence Academy's Culture in       Conflict Symposium (June 2009) and Imperial War Museum staff seminars       (June 2009, March 2010).
From a situation in 2008 in which languages were largely absent from       accounts of war, the research has acted as a catalyst to stimulate       interest in languages in conflict situations amongst language       practitioners, the country's principal museum of war, the Ministry of       Defence, the professional interpreters association, and NGOs.
Language practitioners/academics          In response to the interest generated by the project, the publisher       Palgrave Macmillan set up a series (2011), Palgrave Studies in         Languages at War (co-edited by Footitt), which has signed contracts       for books from practitioners in SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers       Europe), and the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, as well as from       scholars in France, Macedonia, and Israel.
A Facebook site (http://www.facebook.com/groups/languagesatwar)       (2011) now brings together practitioners and academics from across the       world interested in the role of foreign languages in conflict, including       international interpreters, NGOs (International Red Cross, Terre       Solidaire), lobbying groups for Interpreter protection in war (Red T) and       members of the US Army.
Imperial War Museum (IWM), London          Besides adding the project's 60 oral history interviews on languages to       its Sound Archives Collection (2012), the Imperial War Museum is now       proposing to develop a languages-related theme in the next stages of its       review of collections (which would result in more specific documentation       and cataloguing terms to enable related items to be easily located by       researchers), and is planning its new visitor wayfinding in the       redeveloped London site (January 2013-June 2014) with greater awareness of       languages.
The Head of Research and Information at the IWM said, `Languages         at War has placed firmly on the IWM's agenda new ways of exploring       and thinking its collections from new perspectives.
It has added to our       collections, it has added new interpretations to our collections and it       has made us think about how we work towards our gallery redevelopment...Languages         at War has been groundbreaking for the Imperial War Museum...And,       ultimately, the IWM's public will benefit as well' (2012) [`Exhibiting         the "Foreign" in a National Museum: Imperial War Museum Languages at         War, in eds.

In October 2013, the IWM asked Footitt to       support them in a new Museum development, exploiting the languages       dimension of their vast resources of BBC monitoring reports ( World War II       to 1980) by leading a `Translation and Intelligence' group in an IWM       networking bid.
The Ministry of Defence          The Ministry of Defence used the research within its internal debates on       language policy, especially in relation to the role of locally recruited       language intermediaries.
The Head of the MOD's Operational Languages       Support Unit reported that, `From a MOD point of view, the project has       been a valuable contribution to the current internal consideration of what       our future military language capability needs to be...This is particularly       relevant in considering the use of contracted linguists and bi-lingual,       locally-employed civilians, whose backgrounds, strengths, weaknesses and       aspirations require careful consideration in the context of military       operations' (March 2012) [`Languages at War: a UK Ministry of Defence         perspective', in eds.
H.Footitt and M. Kelly, Languages and the         Military.
Alliances, Occupation and Peace Building, Basingstoke:         Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, 58-69.]
Subsequently (April 2013), the MOD published its first specifically       language-related Joint Doctrine Note (JDN), Linguistic Support to         Joint Operations, which Reading researchers were asked to comment on       before publication: ` Thank you for your valued comments on the draft of       the JDN; I think I have addressed them all in the final draft' (February       2013).
Professional Interpreters Association          The International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC) used the       research in its efforts to improve the conditions of interpreters `on the       ground' in war which resulted in AIIC's Code of Practice document, Conflict         Zone Field Guide for Civilian Translators/Interpreters and Users of         their Services (2012).The now President of AIIC notes that,`       allowing for its emphasis on language policy rather than protection of       practitioners, [the research] can be linked in many ways to our own       project Interpreters in Conflict' [http://aiic.net/page/3499/languages-at-war-2010/lang/1].
As a result of the cooperation established, AIIC became an active partner       in the subsequent Languages and International NGOS network,       `...the Languages at War project has encouraged us to seek a       closer relationship with the academic community whose research can be       invaluable as a basis for our own practical steps'( AIIC President,       November 2011).
NGOs          The methodologies and insights developed in the research led to the       formation of the Languages and International NGOs network (2012,       PI Footitt) to examine the role that languages play in NGO activity in       conflict areas.
The new grouping currently includes the International Red       Cross, M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res, and Concordis International, and has       disseminated its initial concerns to DFID (September 2012), and to members       of the European Parliament's Development Committee (October 2012).
By bringing together language practitioners, museum curators, MOD       personnel, and NGOs in an ongoing dialogue with academics, this research       has raised the profile of foreign languages in these areas, and encouraged       a positive attitude towards the role which languages research can play in       matters of public concern.
