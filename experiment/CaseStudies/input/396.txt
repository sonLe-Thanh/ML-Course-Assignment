     Tourism and leisure sectors increasingly feature in the strategic plans       of regional development       agencies but often with little evidence to support the role of tourism as       a local economic driver.
Furthermore, measures of tourism activity have typically centred upon       gross expenditure by       tourists but this does not reflect the impact on, for example, regional       employment or gross value       added, both important indicators for regional economic performance.
In       addition, demand has       increased for appropriate monitoring and evaluative mechanisms for       assessing and reducing the       environmental impact of tourism.
WERU research has addressed both these       needs.
Tourism Satellite Account development     WERU's development of the first TSA for the UK and their continued       involvement with the       production of TSAs for Wales has contributed to a change in the       international landscape of how       governments evaluate and manage tourism, as well as providing an essential       foundation on which       national and regional governments have built more established       infrastructures for monitoring the       effects of tourism (beyond simple expenditure).
Jones' participation in the UN World Tourism Organisation       Committee on Statistics and Tourism       Satellite Account provided a pathway by which WERU's research achieved       international impact.
Research on the development of regional TSAs was presented in a paper       written by Jones as part       of the organisation's Enzo Paci Papers on Measuring the Economic       Significance of Tourism, and       thus contributed to their International         Recommendations on Tourism Statistics5.1.
Sections 8.26-8.32 		reflect WERU's recommendation that, in regional analyses, three       subsets of visitors to a       region be identified (international, national, regional).
This report was       published in 2008 by the UN         Department of Economic and Social Affairs Statistics Division and       now serves as a guide to       staff involved in compiling tourism statistics in national statistical       offices across the world.
The UK TSA feasibility study by WERU researchers provided the fundamental       basis for       subsequent Office for National Statistics' (ONS) estimates and was       "critical to the formation of         the Tourism Intelligence Unit (TIU) at ONS"5.2 in       August 2008.
UK Regional Development       Agencies partnered with the ONS to develop this unit, with WERU research       providing "a framework         for an important part of [the TIU's] work programme to develop a         consistent set of TSA results for         the UK"5.2.
The formation of the TIU "has led to a         more consistent approach to the measurement of         tourism in the UK", with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport       employing the TSA results "to         inform them about the performance of tourism in the UK"5.2.
The establishment of the TIU is       particularly important in light of new European legislation concerning       European statistics on       tourism (No.
692/2011) which requires Member States to contribute       sufficient data to enable the       assessment of the macro-economic importance of tourism based on the       framework of TSAs.
In the       run up to the introduction of this legislation, WERU's development of the       UK TSA contributed to a       `Report         on the implementation of TSA in 27 EU Member States' which was       published by the       European Commission's Directorate-General Eurostat in 20095.3.
This report featured WERU's       work developing the UK TSA and acknowledged their contribution to       Ireland's TSA.
Economic and environmental impact analyses     From 2002 to 2010, WERU were involved in the consultation and stakeholder       engagement       exercises which led to the creation of a dedicated Major Events Unit         (MEU) within the Welsh         Government in 2009 and, subsequently, in the development and       publication of Wales' first major       events strategy (Major         Events Strategy for Wales 2010 - 2020)5.4.
For example,       Jones contributed       a written report and oral evidence to the Welsh Government Communities         and Culture         Committee cross party enquiry into major events and their impacts       (2010)5.5.
"In particular, WERU         contributed to the development of an assessment framework and criteria         which enables         government to assess the value of events in an objective and equitable         way.
This framework has         been welcomed by the events industry in Wales, the UK and         internationally"5.4.
Impact analyses       conducted by WERU on events inside and outside Wales (e.g.
Rugby World       Cup, Wales Rally GB,       Tour de France grand depart), provide "an important reference point for         the MEU which regularly         draws upon the research to provide the evidence base for funding and         policy advice to ministers.
For example, WERU research into the economic impact of the Heineken Cup         Final was a key         consideration in the decision to provide funding for the 2014 Final to         be held at the Millennium         Stadium"5.4.
Beyond Wales, WERU's research has       contributed to preparations for the 2014       Commonwealth Games in Glasgow (Legacy         lessons from past large-scale sporting events: Review of         evidence, 2012) and debates surrounding the potential economic       benefits of the 2014 Tour de       France Grand Depart in Yorkshire (`Yorkshire         seeks Tour de France windfall in 2014', 2013).
The Tourism Impact Model (TIM) is a unique policy tool which was       developed in response to       demand from organisations such as Visit Wales2; they       found that TSAs had limitations, including       the absence of `indirect' tourism impacts and their essentially static and       historical nature.
In       contrast, the TIM allows policy-makers to answer the future-orientated       `what if' questions and to       consider the indirect effects of tourism.
Visit Wales use both the       TIM and TSA "to develop an         accurate, reliable and transparent understanding of the economic         significance of tourism in Wales,         which enables [them] to assess a number of tourism policy         interventions"5.4.
In the face of       increasing public scrutiny of government expenditure the Welsh         Government has used WERU's       research to justify specific projects.
For example, WERU's impact analysis       of the newly opened       Wales Coast Path in 2011-12, which led to economic impact estimates of       &#163;16m, features both on       the Welsh Government website (Wales         coast path visitor spending) and in a news         article5.6 which       reported that a further &#163;1.15m would be spent on the path network in       2013-14.
A similar report,       published in 2011, was also used by Ramblers           Cymru and the British           Mountaineering Council       (who were involved in commissioning the work) to promote and support their       agendas.
WERU have also used the TIM and related analyses to support local       authorities in developing       tourism strategies.
An example of this is the impact analysis of Swansea       City Football Club's       Premier League Status, carried out for City and Council of Swansea       (January 2013).
This study       has been used by the Council's Premier League Steering Group       (representatives of the Council,       Welsh Government, Stadium and Police) in "planning and organising a         range of operational and         marketing services" and has "influenced the Council's own         economic/tourism development and         marketing activity"5.7.
In particular, "obtaining an         estimated value of the substantial economic         impact [&#163;58m] has generated a greater focus on the importance of         exploiting the opportunity"5.7.
Following Cardiff City's promotion to the Premier League (April 2013), the       report was also used by       Cardiff Council's Tourism Analyst in a report regarding ways the       council could capitalise on the       economic, sporting and cultural benefits of the promotion5.7.
Beyond Wales, this research has also       contributed to a House of Lords debate (July 2013) having featured       in a Library Note provided to       participants (Debate         on 25 July: Contributions of English Premiership Football to the UK)5.8.
In parallel with their economic impact research, WERU have expanded the       TIM to include       estimates of the environmental consequences of tourism.
This development       has enabled economic       and environmental trade-offs, for example, between jobs and increased       greenhouse gas       emissions, to be revealed and quantified within a common analytical       framework for the first time.
This has been welcomed by the Welsh Government, for which sustainable       development is a key       theme.
The TIM has been adopted as the key evaluative tool to understand       the impact of the       &#163;120m Environment for Growth initiative (2006-2013), funded by the       European Regional       Development Fund5.9.
The initiative comprises six strategic       projects aimed at developing the       outdoor visitor economy in Wales, managed by the Welsh Government, Visit       Wales, CADW (the       Welsh Government's historic environment service) and Countryside Council       for Wales.
Projects       are subject to common monitoring and evaluation procedures and WERU were       asked to provide a       central management service for this.
In this role, WERU have provided       monitoring forms, a       guidance pack, centralised data analysis, and have delivered a series of       workshops for project       managers to build capacity in the field of economic analysis5.9.
The application of the model has so       far involved the collection of visitor data on a consistent basis across       almost 200 sites/projects.
The TIM model has also been used to evaluate policy interventions in       sectors other than tourism.
WERU have undertaken a number of projects for Environment Agency Wales       which have       enabled them to make the case to Welsh Government to continue funding       beneficial programmes       of work.
For example, they used WERU's research "to demonstrate the         value of work undertaken         to reduce flood risk in protecting jobs", strengthening "justification         for additional funding"5.10.
Through working with WERU researchers, staff have "gained confidence in         exploring the economic         dimension of [their] work, to the extent that this is now common         practice ... a significant         achievement which should not be under-estimated"5.10.
Through changes such as these, WERU's       research has helped make the case for "interventions that are likely to         be more sustainable"5.10.
