     The impacts of the research were achieved through a series of Stevenson       events, the website       and media and public engagement.
RLS Day arose as a result of Dryden's       research, and that       of Grimes, which afforded the knowledge, expertise and reputation to       launch this initiative.
The       web team's research informed the content of the website and thus       Stevenson's reputation is       enhanced through a public-facing, expertly informed electronic resource.
RLS Day: Widespread Impact     Collaborations with the Edinburgh, UNESCO City of Literature Trust (COL),       (5.4) concerning       RLS enabled the impact to reach the wider community and contribute to       Edinburgh's literary       reputation.
RLS Day is a major success, becoming an international event       with a wide reach beyond       academia.
There were two RLS Days up to the Impact Case Study census date.
RLS Day       2011 was       modest in size, but, by 2012, eight city-wide events took place' including       pop-up theatre and the       world's first RLS Day Tachemob Flashmob, a spontaneous gathering of people       in Parliament       Square sporting RLS-style moustaches, simultaneously reading passages from       Stevenson's       works.
These events attracted an estimated audience of 630 in total.
In       2011 an evening event with       actor and author Nigel Planer and writer Ian Rankin attracted an audience       of 100.
In 2012 Planer       was joined by the actor John Sessions attracting an audience of 250.
On       RLS Day in 2012 the       COL website received 4465 visits, a 300% increase on average daily       traffic, #RLSDay trended in       the UK for 3 hours, and the Stevenson website had a 100% increase in       monthly visits, and a 200%       increase in daily traffic.
RLS Day featured on the Guardian photo       galleries, and was Guardian         Picture of the Day on November 13, 2012 (5.6, 5.7).
Social media was       extremely active with       individuals tweeting `Happy RLS Day' to their followers throughout the       day.
There was coverage in the national press and radio, and mainstream       periodicals between 11       and 14 November 2013.
Local newspapers covering the day include Scotland         on Sunday;       Edinburgh Evening News; The Times; Edinburgh Metro,       The Herald and the Daily Record.
Nationally, the event was covered by The Mail and The Sunday         Times.
Television and radio       coverage included STV Edinburgh, BBC News Scotland and BBC Radio       Scotland Newsdrive (5.5).
A free RLS Day QR code directing people to the website, specially created       at Edinburgh       Napier, was available at various locations in the city.
The French       Association Sur Le Chemin de         Robert Louis Stevenson exhibition, containing images, photographs,       drawings and texts illustrating       RLS's travels across France, was held in the Edinburgh Central Library       from 15 November-14       December, 2012.
Developing the Stevenson website alerted Dryden to the value of creating       such outward       facing, public-oriented projects.
As a result of the website Dryden was       contacted by Nigel Planer,       who has become the patron of RLS Day.
The production team for Michael       Portillo's Great Railway         Journeys found Dryden through the website, and Stephen Fry tweeted       about the site on the day       that it was launched.
Dryden has also formed good working relationships       with well-known local       writers such as Ian Rankin, James Robertson, Louise Welsh and Ron Butlin.
The web site and       RLS Day have proven to be very successful routes for maximising the impact       of Dryden's       research.
RLS Web Site     The RLS website is the most comprehensive site available for Stevenson.
The figures below       define the reach of the website:            13,000 hits per month.
On RLS's birthday in 2009 this peaked at 20,000         on one         day.
Individuals from over 200 countries have viewed the site.
It has had         over         1,200,000 separate page views.
75% of visitors are from outside the UK       Links to RLS site from elsewhere: 13,000       Time on site: 16% of visits between 3 and 30 minutes       Google search: no.

Added to the British Library Database of websites          The Ernest Mehew RLS collection and the Gelius Leopold RLS collection       were donated to the       University as a result of this presence on the web.
Once these collections       of books have been       catalogued and housed in a bespoke location at the Merchiston campus, it       is planned to allow       public access to the collection in order to bolster research into and       interest in Stevenson.
Dryden       intends to take on another PhD student in the Spring of 2014 whose       research will be focused on       Stevenson and who will find in this collection the largest Stevenson       library of any university in the       UK.

Collaborations with Edinburgh City of Literature on a literary trail         for RLS          These impacts demonstrate a wide public reach, the beneficiaries being       the general public in       Edinburgh, and, via media and electronic resources, across the globe.
Awareness of Stevenson as       a major Scottish literary figure has been raised considerably by RLS Day       and the resultant media       coverage.
Dryden's aim is to make RLS Day a truly international event,       thus enhancing       Stevenson's reputation further.
To this end, more activities took place in       2013 attracting a larger       audience and significant media coverage.
