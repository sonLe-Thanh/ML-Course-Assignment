     The publication of an Action Plan (SCIE, 2008) (See Reference 2 above)       based on the research findings showed that those funding the research were       serious about implementing the research recommendations.
The following       quote from SCIE underscores the legacy of this research in terms of its       impact: "SCIE was delighted to be involved in the partnership work         which led firstly to the publication of Looking out from the Middle       and then to the establishment of annual conferences which aim to         strengthen user and carer involvement in health and social care in NI.
The publication of this research was a key moment in the systematic and         strategic development of user and carer involvement in NI.
It was         symbolic and practical; symbolic in that RQIA, NISCC and SCIE jointly         made a public commitment to user involvement and practical in that this         was combined with a focused and specific Action Plan.
The annual         conferences embody this commitment and are an opportunity for users and         carers to hold RQIA, NISCC and SCIE to account, reflect on progress and         share learning" (From Reference 3): Duffy and Mc Keever (2012:112)     All three organisations have now changed their policies and working       practices on user engagement and public participation as a result of this       research.
Specific examples are as follows:     Example 1.
Since the research was published in 2008, an annual User       Involvement Conference funded and organised by the three commissioning       organisations now takes place.
This conference is jointly organised with       service user representatives and is a direct response to the research       recommendation that health and social care service providers need to more       actively engage and communicate with the public in Northern Ireland.
The       most recent conference was opened and endorsed by the Northern Ireland       Health Minister (Mr Edwin Poots).
As a reflection of this event's impact       and importance, the Patient and Client Council in Northern Ireland, the       watchdog organisation for service users' issues, have now committed to       leading on the organisation of the 2013 conference.
The conference       routinely involves presentations by service users about their experiences       of receiving services and always includes opportunities for a `question       time' panel debate with senior managers from the health and social care       sector through which service users can directly interface with and       challenge service providers.
Example 2.
User involvement practices are now firmly embedded in the       working practices of RQIA.
Patient Experience Reviews now       routinely take place before inspections; service user views on the       experiences of Guardianship are also sought and care experienced young       people with a learning disability are involved in inspections of       residential care facilities.
The following quote from RQIA further       highlights the impact of this research: "This research has been a         catalyst for us to ensure that we put service users and carers at the         heart of what we do in all our regulation, inspection and review         activities and by ensuring the voice of the user is reflected we can         qualitatively reflect their experience to those who care for them or         provide them with a service.
We have seen tremendous evidence of real         and meaningful and enhanced service improvements particularly on long         stay mental health and learning disability wards".
Example 3.
The establishment of a Participation Group in the Northern       Ireland Social Care Council (NISCC) whose work is directly impacted by the       research findings.
"The NISCC Participation Group is taking forward         and further developing the Council's user and carer agenda and         addressing the recommendations of the `Looking out from the Middle'         research into effective user involvement which was undertaken by the         Queen's University Belfast in 2008".
(http://www.niscc.info)     Involvement as co-researchers has also had positive outcomes for several       of the service users involved as the following quotes evidence:     "The research had a number of tangible outcomes for us, the experience         of working as peer researchers, being able to influence three large         organisations who actually took on board what was being said and acted         on it and the legacy of the research for us was the confidence it gave         people to take on a more strategic role in the three organisations"       (Service User Researcher)     "At a personal level, coming from a User background, the impact of         having been involved in this research has had a long term impact on me.
As someone who was directly involved, as a user researcher, I got a         tangible sense that I was valued as a person and that my experience of         life was acknowledged as being important.
For me, this research has         become a model of good practice and a template that others could learn         from."
(Service User Researcher)     Service user researchers have also co-presented with Duffy at       international and national conferences disseminating the research       findings.
