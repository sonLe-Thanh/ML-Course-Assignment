     Research carried out at the Lancaster Literacy Research Centre,       2002-2009, has had a major impact on the government's Skills for Life       (SfL) policy and practice.
21 reports are aimed primarily at the English       SfL strategy, where they are used in teacher training and professional       development and circulated across government departments.
The impact of       these included changes to public service practices/guidelines and/or       improved educational attainment among disadvantaged groups (for example,       the Public Service Agreement target for adult literacy was met two years       early; see: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmpubacc/154/154.pdf,       p.9).
Overall, in the period Jan 2008-Aug 2012, there have been 67,226       downloads of NRDC publications to which Lancaster personnel have       contributed.
More specifically, they have had impact in the following       ways:     Adult Literacy in England            Our work has a central role in the revised adult National Curricula         for England both for Literacy and for English for Speakers of Other         Languages and national revisions of the subject specifications for         teacher training.
Our underpinning research books are listed as core         reading in curriculum guidance documents, and referred to in training         materials for teacher training and professional development and teacher         handbooks produced since 2008 (such as Reference 9, below).
We have made direct contributions to professional development and         practice in the SfL workforce.
Since 2008 we have run practitioner         events aimed at specific target groups including practitioners working         with offenders and working with homeless people.
We contributed to major         evaluations of SfL that impacted on the quality of public policy         delivery and future targets (Report 4).
Prof Hamilton was a commissioner on the inquiry into adult literacy in         England, Work, Society and Lifelong Literacy, headed by Lord         Boswell, which reported in September 2011.
Impact on international adult literacy            Internationally our work is drawn upon in the UNESCO Decade of         Literacy and the Literacy and Assessment Monitoring Programme (LAMP),         most recently in the reports The Global Literacy Challenge         (UNESCO Paris 2009) and The next generation of literacy statistics         (UNESCO Institute of Statistics 2009) (See report 8).
In the period 2008-2012 we have addressed teacher groups and policy         makers in Ireland, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Norway.
(Testimonials on file which were collected in August 2012 confirm the         influence of our contributions to practitioner events and publications         in Canada and Australia.)
The German ministry for education and research (Bundesministerium f&#252;r         Bildung und Forschung) has funded a project 2009-2012 at the         Bundeswehrhochschule, Hamburg (the University of the Federal Armed         Forces) based on underpinning research output 1, above, to develop new         ideas for adult literacy and basic education curricula and programmes.
(Corroborating evidence 10, below)          Impact on Further Education       The parallel ESRC grant reported in underpinning research output 6, above,       was followed up by a DVD (http://www.publicspace.ac.uk/projects/literacies-for-learning)       (Dec 2007) and a widely circulated briefing paper (August 2008) aimed at       teachers, along with an associated website containing pedagogical       activities (http://www.lancs.ac.uk/lflfe/index.htm).
The website contains testimonials collected in 2008 on the efficacy of the       video for teacher training.
Further testimonials collected in August 2012,       which we have on record, particularly cite the value of the DVD and the       suggested activities.
The UK Open University purchased 8 minutes of the       video in 2010 to use on a teacher training course.
