     Undertaking fully through-thickness residual stress measurements in       thick-sectioned industrial components is expensive, whichever technique is       employed.
Neutron diffraction measurements are often viewed as the nearest       measurement alternative to deep-hole drilling, as they are able to measure       sub-surface residual stresses in crystalline materials.
However, neutron       diffraction is only able to make measurements to a depth of approximately       30mm in steel and commercial costs of neutron beam time are in the region       of &#163;15-20k per day.
Bristol's deep-hole drilling technique, in contrast,       can be used to take residual stress measurements on much thicker       components.
To date, the deepest measurement - 750mm - was taken on a       steel turbine for Siemens [a].
Costs are primarily determined by the time       to undertake the measurement.
As an example, an on-site measurement on a       large nuclear component may take a week to perform.
Using the University's deep-hole drilling technique, and its associated       data analysis methods, Veqter Ltd provide commercial residual stress       measurements for use in structural integrity assessments.
The company       undertakes the measurement service on structural-level samples sent to the       laboratory or, for larger components, conducts the service in-situ at the       plant.
The company was formed in 2004 by Kingston (UoB 1998-2004) when it       became apparent that the quick turnaround of measurements demanded by       industry, coupled with confidentiality requirements, necessitated the need       for an independent, commercial spin-out company.
Smith and Truman remain       non-executive directors on the Board of Veqter.
Since the company was       formed, the key impact indicators are [b]:            The growth from [text removed for publication] employees         (2004-2011).
The growth in annual turnover [text removed for publication].
The steady increase in the client base from across the world,         including Japan, America and France.
Veqter appointing a dedicated Japanese agent, IIC, in 2008 to extend         operations in this country.
In addition to the direct economic impact for Veqter, its unique       measurement service, often applied to safety-critical hardware, has       significant impact for its clients.
The through-thickness residual stress       profile measurements allow the client to undertake detailed fitness for       service assessments or to validate numerical simulations.
Examples       relating to the design and repair of components in the nuclear industry       include:            In 2010-11, deep-hole drilling measurement results were used in a         series of plant life extensions for EDF Energy (formerly British         Energy Generation Ltd) to help extend the life of the current fleet of         advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors.
As an example, full structural weld overlays have been used extensively         to repair, or to mitigate against, primary water stress corrosion         cracking at dissimilar metal welds in pressurized nozzles.
To support an         approved weld overlay design and safety submission, British Energy         commissioned Veqter to perform tests on pressurized water reactor         nozzles.
Specifically, a detailed assessment of the effects of a weld         overlay on the through-wall residual stress distribution in these         nozzles was conducted using deep-hole drilling.
This study allowed EDF         to determine the most appropriate form of weld overlay to apply to their         plant to maximize confidence in the structural integrity case [b,c].
The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission are employing deep-hole         drilling to measure and validate through-wall weld residual stresses         that develop at the J-groove welds in nuclear control rod mechanisms         [d].
The Commission and the Electric Power Research Institute worked         cooperatively to validate residual stress predictions at welds between         primary cooling loop components.
The residual stress distribution for         the prototype component was predicted numerically using different         techniques.
Veqter provided experimental measurements for comparison.
The Commission noted, in 2011, that due to the thickness of the         components "The only non-destructive or semi- destructive technique           capable of obtaining full through the wall residual stress ... is the           VEQTER Ltd proprietary Deep Hole Drilling technique" [d].
The         results of this study showed that, on average, analysts can develop         welding residual stress predictions that are a reasonable estimate for         actual configurations, as quantified by Veqter's measurements.
However,         the scatter in predicted results from analyst to analyst could be quite         large.
These results allowed the Commission to understand the         limitations of numerical weld simulation models and hence place an         appropriate error on numerical results [b,e].
The Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organisation has employed         deep-hole drilling in a series of key national nuclear safety projects         [b].
As an example, in recent years, the occurrence of stress corrosion         cracking in Alloy 600 weld regions of pressurized water reactor plants         has increased.
In order to evaluate crack propagation mechanisms, it was         necessary to estimate the stress distribution, including residual stress         and operational stress, across the wall thickness in the region of the         weld.
In a national project, for the purpose of establishing the optimum         residual stress evaluation method, a test model was produced.
The stress         distribution, resulting from fabrication processes, was measured by         Veqter using the deep-hole drilling technique.
The results showed that         the stress distribution, in the thickness direction at the centre of the         weld line, hardly varied during a hydrostatic test.
This insight allowed         the Safety Organisation to validate the numerical safety simulations         performed by plant fabricators Toshiba, Hitachi and MHI [b].
AREVA plc have placed high value on the use of Veqter's         deep-hole drilling measurements in the development of narrow gap TIG         welding.
For new nuclear builds, AREVA has developed an advanced narrow gap         welding technique for junctions between heavy section steel components         and stainless steel piping.
The company used finite element simulations         to predict the residual stress field of a 29" multipass narrow gap weld.
These numerical results were compared to Veqter's measurements obtained         by the deep-hole drilling technique.
This comparison provided data that         allowed AREVA to gain a better insight into the error levels associated         with numerical weld simulation modeling [b,f].
