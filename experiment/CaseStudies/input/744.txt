     Global (ILO, ITF) and European (ETF) organisations have       adopted Harvey's and Turnbull's research findings as an authoritative         analysis of the importance of positive industrial relations for both       airline companies and their employees.
It is already clear that the       research has contributed to critical public debate at the international         level.
The research has been influential in changing awareness       and understanding of the importance of positive employment       relations and in shifting attitudes to priorities in forging a       sustainable civil aviation industry.
Specifically, the research has created         critical public debate on the reduction and prevention of the       negative effects of industrial actions, poor work motivation and impaired       management-employee relations in the sector.
The organisations with which Harvey and others have been working       closely over a number of years play key roles in influencing labour       standards and policies internationally.
The ILO is a specialist tripartite       agency of the United Nations with representation from governments of over       183 member States, employers' associations and trade unions that jointly       shape labour policies and programmes.
The ITF represents several million       workers in over 100 countries and promotes their interests by bringing       international unions together to share information and build common       strategies.
The ETF represents 2.5 million transport workers in 41       countries.
The ETF coordinates trade union policy, organises coordinated       industrial activities, and provides education and training.
The ETF is       also a Social Partner in European Social Dialogue (coordinated by the       European Commission) representing the interests of transport workers       across Europe.
Harvey and Turnbull have generated two key reports for the ILO       [R6] and the ETF [R4] based on their research.
The ILO has used the first       report [R6] to formulate its response to the financial crisis in the civil       aviation sector.
It is a key document informing the tripartite resolution       `Recovering from the Crisis: A Global Jobs Pact' [C1] by the 98th       Session of the International Labour Conference.
As a result of the impact       of the report at the conference, it was presented to the ILO Governing       Body, responsible for ILO policy, at its 306th Session in       November 2009.
Most recently, the report has been cited extensively in an       ILO issues paper, `Civil aviation and its changing world of work' [C7],       developed for discussion at the ILO Global Dialogue Forum on the Effects       of the Global Economic Crisis on the Civil Aviation Industry in February       2013.
Importantly, the report [R6] is available on the ILO Sectoral       Activities Department (SECTOR) website [C2] as the only,       authoritative `Sectoral Assessment' of the impact of the financial       crisis on civil aviation industry and has been used as the key reference       in its framing of the issue [C3].
The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) has also drawn on       the research in the development of its work programmes and organizing       strategies.
It has also publicized the research and the reports [R4, R5]       widely [C4].
European trade unions are aware of the research and the key       findings, for example Hava-Is in Turkey [see link to R5].
Harvey's       research has had a direct and material impact also within ITF.
According to the Civil Aviation Secretary of ITF, the research `has         been influential in the design       of [ITF's] civil aviation section strategy and       instrumental in achieving policy objectives           ... Harvey's ongoing research into employment relations         within civil aviation is an invaluable resource for the Federation and         for our members, and is instructive for airline management as it         illustrates the ways in which both employers and employees might benefit         from sophisticated employment practices.'
[C10a].
An amended version       of the 2009 report [R6], was prepared specifically for the ITF [see, R5].
The report `forms the basis of a stakeholder dialogue'       within the industry [C6].
The report was cited in a letter from the       General Secretary of ITF to the Secretary General of ILO that called for       such a stakeholder dialogue involving the ILO and employers' associations       in order to discuss the `important and pertinent findings' of the       study [C9].
Moreover, the report `provided empirical evidence used by         the ITF during the recent ILO Global Dialogue Forum (Geneva, February         2013), thereby `influencing discussion between labour representatives,         employers and national governments' [C10a].
Another report, `The Development of the Low Cost Model in the European       Civil Aviation Industry' [R4] was conducted on behalf of the European       Transport Workers' Federation (ETF) and sponsored by the EC through DG       MOVE (Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport).
According to the       Political Secretary of the ETF, `This work provides empirical evidence         to support the political aims and objectives of the ETF and has enabled       the civil aviation section to define its         lobbying and industrial strategies' [C10b].
The       research findings that underpin the report were featured as a keynote       presentation by Harvey and Turnbull at the European Commission       Civil Aviation Social Dialogue Committee in June 2012, attended by members       of the EC Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion       and Directorate General for Mobility and Transport.
Crucially, the meeting       was also attended by the Executive of the European Transport Worker's       Federation (representing around 2.5 million transport workers) and the       Secretary General of the Association of European Airlines (representing 33       airlines, including Lufthansa, International Airlines Group and       AirFrance/KLM and employing some 390,000 employees).
The sustained and increasing impact of the research by Harvey       and Turnbull is further evidenced by the fact that the two reports [R4,       R6] set the agenda [C5] for the discussion at the tripartite         ILO Global Dialogue Forum on the Effects of the Global Economic       Crisis on the Civil Aviation Industry held in Geneva in February 2013 [C5,       C7].
The conference resulted in tripartite consensus, calling for       continued social dialogue and recognition of the importance of positive       employment relations [see, C8, Point 3].
According to the Specialist on Manufacturing and Civil Aviation (and the       author of the ILO discussion paper [C7]) Harvey and Turnbull's       research has `contributed to our understanding of the nature and extent         of the impact of the crises on employment in civil aviation and [has]         informed ILO facilitated tripartite discussion of airline best practice         response to the crises' [C10c] This statement is corroborated by the       ETF: `Following the discussions and taking into account the conclusions         of the ILO Global Dialogue Forum on the effects of the crisis in civil         aviation (Geneva, February 2013), the social partners [organized labour         and management associations] have jointly presented a project on the new         forms of employment in the sector' [C10b].
The ILO Governing Body       will discuss the conference report and the recommended future actions in       its meeting in October 2013.
