     ISM's critical and social marketing research contributed directly to the       passage of the 2009 Health Act (England and Wales) and the Tobacco         &amp; Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010, and was       instrumental in defending this and equivalent legislation in Norway and       Ireland from legal challenge.
The UK acts build on ISM research showing       that in-shop displays influence consumer behaviour and independently       encourage the onset of youth smoking; they require tobacco products to be       out of sight at PoS.
PoS marketing covers all in store activities designed to promote tobacco,       including advertising, furniture, d&#233;cor, staff clothing and product       displays.
The 2002 UK Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act (TAPA) limited       the amount of tobacco advertising allowed in shops to one A5-sized       poster, but it did not regulate the display of products, a gap       which was energetically exploited by tobacco companies.
Sophisticated and       stylish gantries have come to dominate many small shops (where underage       smokers typically buy tobacco) and elaborate sales booths were a prominent       feature in supermarkets until April, 2013.
The Guidelines for Article 13       of the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco       Control, an international public health treaty ratified by the UK along       with over 170 other countries, recommends the removal of all PoS tobacco       marketing.
Since 1999, ISM has monitored the nature, extent and effects of tobacco       marketing on young people in the UK through the YTPS.
Findings from this       research, published in a 2008 Cancer Research UK report `Point of Sale         Display of Tobacco Products' and in related peer-reviewed       publications, were influential in demonstrating the public health case for       a ban on PoS displays.
The report was widely cited between September 2008       and May 2009 in submissions and responses to the UK and Scottish       consultations on the proposed legislation.
Media interviews given by       Professor Gerard Hastings contributed to the public debate around the       issue.
Hansard records of debates in the House of Commons and House of       Lords show that the ISM report was considered one of the key pieces of       evidence in the passage of the legislation:     Lord Faulkner of Worcester: "I am delighted that the Government have         based their proposals in the Bill on research.
Some of the most         important research has been carried out by Professor Gerard Hastings,         director of the Centre for Tobacco Control Research.
He investigated the         complex relationship between tobacco marketing at the point of sale and         young people's intention to smoke.
He found that: "In 2006, almost half         &#8212;46 per cent of UK teens&#8212;were aware of tobacco marketing at point of         sale".
Moreover, the likelihood of a young person stating an intention         to smoke may increase by 35 per cent with each brand that they can         recall having seen at the point of sale".
(Hansard, 4 Feb 2009).
The YTPS research has also been instrumental in defending legal       challenges to POS legislation both in the UK and overseas.
ISM's Director       was appointed as an Expert Witness by the UK, Norwegian and Irish       Governments in separate cases brought by tobacco companies.
In each       instance the challenge was defeated (references in Section 5)     Beneficiaries of the research     Legislators have benefited from the provision of timely and robust       research to inform evidence-based policymaking, and the public health       community has benefited from a strengthened scientific evidence base on       the role of marketing in smoking.
The legislation will benefit young       people by protecting them from one of the few remaining forms of tobacco       marketing.
Emerging data (McNeill et al 2011 http://dx.doi.org/110.1136/tc.2010.038141)       from Ireland (see above), which prohibited PoS in 2009, indicate that the       law is correcting inaccurate pro-smoking norms and, in the view of       teenagers, making it easier not to smoke.
