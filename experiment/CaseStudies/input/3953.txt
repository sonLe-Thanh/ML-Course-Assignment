     Research outlined above has: (i) impacted on DEFRA policy development       and RCUK research policy with respect to soil erosion, land       management, and water quality; and (ii) resulted in increased         awareness and operational change in the UK and international farming       communities, in relation to effective agricultural land management       practices.
Much of the underpinning research has been conducted in       conjunction with DEFRA and has led to significant and wide-ranging       involvement in a number of DEFRA expert advisory roles.
These have       included the DEFRA National soil erosion policy meeting (Brazier, Quine,       Walling, July 2008; Exeter one of 5 Universities represented), DEFRA       Integrated Water and Agricultural Management Scheme (March 2009, Exeter       only UK University involved), DEFRA indicators of soil quality workshop       (September 2012) and steering roles on the Phosphorus Export and Delivery       from Agricultural Land Project (November 2009, February 2012, only UK       University involved on the steering group alongside representatives from       DEFRA, Environment Agency and Nature England).
Research into on-site       processes has also increased knowledge and understanding of erosion rates,       the contribution of tillage erosion to soil erosion, the impact of erosion       on soil properties and recognition of the erosive nature of lowland       grasslands (evidence items #1 and 2).
Crucially, this research has       resulted in Exeter Geography being invited to build a new cost-effective         national erosion monitoring capability in the UK.
This capability       will be unique in the EU and will support the UK's response to the       forthcoming EU Soils Framework Directive (evidence item #3).
As a       result Brazier was also invited to contribute to the NERC Sustainable       Agriculture Task Force, to help develop research policy for       sustainable food production research over the next decade (evidence         item #4).
Significant advances in understanding of off-site impacts, and especially       quantification of the contribution of agricultural erosion to diffuse       pollution of surface waters in England and Wales, has also had a direct       impact on environmental policy changes made by national       government.
This research has underpinned the adjustment of grassland       management practices to reduce the likelihood of contravening EU water       quality guidelines, and evidence of this impact is confirmed by written       correspondence from both the soil research and water quality research       teams at DEFRA (see letters; evidence item #5).
This body of       research has also directly influenced the working practices of DEFRA's       `arms-length' bodies, the Environment Agency (EA) and Natural England       (NE).
Both agencies commissioned Brazier to talk directly with farmers and       advise on a range of soil management techniques, including direct advice       on which subsoiling approaches can be used to combat soil compaction       (Field workshop with &gt;40 farmers from the Otter and Exe catchments at       the National Trust's Killerton Estate, July 2008) and Brazier was asked to       report directly back to the EA and NE on the lessons learnt from these       workshops (evidence item #6).
In addition to contributing to policy direction and development, environmental         awareness has been enhanced through the dissemination of knowledge       relating to effective land management practices to the UK farming       community via Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF), an initiative funded by       DEFRA and the Rural Development Programme, and delivered by the       Environment Agency and Natural England.
Brazier has been funded via       DEFRA's Integrated Water and Agricultural Management (IWAM) program, to       deliver workshops to land users and CSF officers on grassland erosion and       land management (for example, Rothamstead Research, North Wyke workshop,       March 2010 &#8212; evidence item #7).
Through the CSF officers, priority       catchments in Devon have also been targeted, resulting in the       dissemination of key research findings that support changes in farming       practice to directly reduce diffuse water pollution and achieve healthier       river systems.
Resultant changes in management approaches demonstrate the       impact of this research in changing awareness and operational         activities relevant to the environment and improved management         of environmental risks.
The reach and significance of these impacts       has been verified by written correspondence from CSF officers in the Taw,       Torridge, Otter and Exe river catchments (for example see evidence item         #8).
In addition to influence on UK policy, work on tillage erosion with       International partners (TERON group in Europe; Lobb, Manitoba, Canada) has       led to incorporation of tillage erosion in international indicators of       environmental sustainability (e.g.
OECD, evidence item #9) and       underpinned international policy change.
In Canada, Lobb and Quine       received AUCC (Canadian Government) funding to support soil redistribution       within cultivated landscapes research and the emission of greenhouse       gases, a collaboration that has supported engagement with         policy-makers in Canada, and resulted in widespread acknowledgement       of the importance of tillage erosion.
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada now       use tillage erosion models for national agricultural assessments, with two       such assessments since 2008 (evidence item #10).
Tillage erosivity       data tables have also been developed for use in these modelling exercises,       and all provinces in Canada now include control of tillage erosion in       their Environmental Farm Plan initiatives that farmers must carry out to       receive government "green" subsidies (examples are provided as evidence         item #11).
