     The project has presented its work to reach audiences beyond higher       education research       (accountants, digital content providers, schoolteachers) and organised       symposia and workshops       offering hands-on experience of using project software tools.
Release of       software 'open source',       the provision of case studies, technical demonstrators, prototypes and       documentation, and hands-on       workshops and dissemination events, promoted the adoption of project       technologies and       approaches amongst non-academic and general web users of the Semantic Web.
The www.ensemble.ac.uk site had 112 comments posted to its       pages and the ensemble@ljmu blog       has had 3583 visits, with over 17% of views originating outside the UK       (25th September 2013).
Key impacts:            Digital Content Providers interested in improving public engagement         with online content         e.g.The Economic and Social Data Service (now the UK Data Service)         adopted project         approaches and technologies to enhance their public collections and         Pioneers pages.
The         UK Data Service is a comprehensive resource funded by the ESRC to         support researchers,         teachers and policymakers.
Web analytics show an increase from 774 views         (of the original         Pioneers web pages - Oct 2008 to Dec 2011) to 7870 visits, of which 2210         have been to         the Simile based Ensemble designed pages (new Pioneer web pages Dec 2011         - October         2013).
Analytics show the Pioneers pages are the second most visited         page after the home         page.

Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (154,000 members and         432,000 students in         170 countries) and the International Association for Accounting         Education (50 institutional         members, including professional accounting bodies) benefited from work         on e-assessment         that proved the concept that automation to discern broad categories of         responses was         possible and that it could support markers in making more consistent         judgements.
Grant         award of &#163;16,000 from the International Association for Accounting         Education and         Research (2011-2012)       The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organisation that defines web         standards,         selected the Ensemble's Contemporary Dance case study as a non-technical         exemplar of         Semantic Web technologies in practical use.
The case went live in         November 2012 and         was reported in Semantic Web Activity News: "New SW Case Study by the         Liverpool John         Moores University" (http://www.w3.org/blog/SW/2012/11/),         Planet Semantico         (http://www.semanticaweb.info/category/sw-deployment/ )         and Next Web         (http://red.gnoss.com/en/community/nextweb/resources#sioc_t:Tag=teaching%20of%20dance).
It was also reported on Scoop.it (http://www.scoop.it/t/artificial-intelligence-for-students/p/3479915868/case-study-using-the-semantic-web-to-enhance-the-teaching-of-dance)           Other impacts:            Web users benefited from the open source extension of the SIMILE         Exhibit web application         framework; from detailed educational use cases based on project examples         (e.g.
W3C         dance case study).
These permit non-experts to amend semantic data         without degrading its         integrity and to innovatively link semantic data to timeline based media         such as video (e.g.
City of Radicals timeline).
The latter has potential impact for BBC         Learning (3 exploratory         meetings 2011-2012-2013).
The Digital Archive Community &#8212; Those working on the Data         Documentation Initiative,         benefited from participation in the Qualitative Data Exchange working         group.
Ensemble         provided educational and social science research use cases, models and         new archiving         tools.
This led to a shift from archiving models entirely based on data         curation and storage         to a model underpinned by the qualitative research processes.
A Teacher Agency ICT grant (`Linked Data for School Science' 2012-2013         &#163;5,000) involved         training ITE students and secondary school science teachers (2012/2013)         in three schools         using Ensemble work on linked data and video.
The training enabled         trainee teachers to         plan to use technology in their future teaching and existing teachers to         find strategies to         cope with new expectations of technology use.
A YouTube video (developed         by the project         following its work in 3 schools) has been viewed 876 times in 6 months;         21.5% from the         UK, 18.4% from the USA, 13.1% from the Netherlands, and evidence of its         use can be         seen in following comments: &#8212; http://octel.alt.ac.uk/forums/topic/b-f-skinner-and-the-teaching-machine-tablet-edition/;         https://twitter.com/ProfDanielMuijs/status/329982905663246336;         http://www.scoop.it/t/globalization-learning-and-literacy/p/3998840644/b-f-skinner-and-the-teaching-machine-tablet-edition;         https://annotary.com/collections/15490/ipads-LLY        Innovative work with the Semantic Web and video, was donated as open         source code to         MIT's Exhibit project software repository hosted by Google (e.g.
FELIX         flexible lightweight         editor for exhibit and JSON-X http://www.ensemble.ac.uk/wp/technologies) and it was the         foundation of a JISC funded project (see below).
The resulting tool         enabled narrative to be         associated with semantic data and the tool has been registered for use         by academics in         seven separate HE institutions, and two schools.
A JISC funded project, (&#163;25,000) part of the OER Rapid Innovation         strand (April - October         2012) contributed to the aggregation and presentation of Open         Educational Resources and         created a user friendly tool for non-technical users to create Semantic         Web pages with         minimal knowledge of the software frameworks that underpinned semantic         faceted         browsing.
It was given the name AutoKitty.
The AutoKitty, open source         software developed         by the project and available via a repository, has had 26 downloads         (25th September         2013).
