     The key organisations to have benefitted from this research programme are       Bolton at Home, Bolton       Council, GMSA and their partner organisations.
The projects' outcomes were       applied within stakeholder       organisations.
Between 2008 and 2012, Bolton at Home witnessed strategic and policy       impacts, including:       improvements to practice and quality of engagement with citizens; changes       to organisational strategy       and policy; developing aspiration and increasing skills and qualifications       in communities; and sharing of       best practice to ensure successful outcomes can be achieved by all parts       of the organisation.
Specifically impact was achieved through:     - Informing strategic policy regarding community engagement, leading to       improved customer       involvement in scrutinising and shaping services            Change in Bolton at Home and Bolton Council strategy on community         engagement,         which resulted in increased resources and staffing at the UCAN Centres          - Development of a Participatory Engagement model for working with the       community and       partners to improve quality of life outcomes in deprived areas            Improved community engagement and development practice through the         creation of a         framework for engagement strategy and a refresh of the community         strategy from 2013          - Changing practice in teaching, knowledge exchange and transfer of best       practice across       both Bolton at Home and the University of Bolton, directly supporting       improvements to work       practice in regeneration, community engagement and development,       neighbourhood       management and employer engagement, through work-based learning     - Enhanced efficient and effective services and activities in       neighbourhood management,       building confidence and improving opportunities for local people to       address health,       education and training needs, unemployment and crime     - Community engagement planning and evaluation framework created to       enhance methods       and impact of working with local people     - A change in evaluation of impact assessment to include social       accounting and social return       on investment informed by our evaluation study (see section 5, reference       3)     - Development of new collaborations for knowledge transfer     - Developed skills and competencies in community representatives to       become informed       customers and be more effective in participatory decision making     - Students involved in community projects improving corporate social       responsibility and       employability     - More efficient and effective work practices leading to improved social       impact     - Person-centred approach focussed on social, community, economic and       physical aspects of       regeneration            Employment/career progression for staff and residents undertaking         university courses.
The 20-credit module, Introduction to Regeneration, has been running for         six years, and         has engaged with 108 students (employees, volunteers and fulltime         students) from 11         organisations and differing backgrounds.
A 2012 internal survey         identified that 36% of         the students who completed this module have gained employment or         promotion as a         result.
It was one of the three finalists for the HCA awards, Skills for         Better Places, in         2009.
The joint Bolton Regeneration conference 2011 to disseminate the research       outcomes led to:     - further collaboration with Phoenix Community Housing, London;     - development of student projects between the University's Community       Studies group and Bolton       at Home.
The impact for the Greater Manchester Strategic Alliance (GMSA) occurred       between 2008-2010       through the participation of network members in the research projects and       dissemination of good       practice across the network.
The Effective Group-working in       Multi-Professional Teams that Support       Regional Regeneration project in collaboration with the GMSA and 13       partners from the regeneration       and education sectors, highlighted the challenges in developing lecture       content for e-learning.
The       research output, a module, Working in Groups, has been undertaken by 106       Community Studies and       Youth and Community students at the University, and available on Jorum for       public access.
The       components of the module have been viewed 2459 times and downloaded 872       times (May 2013       statistics).
The challenges identified led to further research in       technology-enabled learning undertaken       by Dr Nelson, which fed into the university's revalidation programme.
The key impact was in the development of the GMSA Advance programme       validated by the University       in 2009 as the Professional Development Framework, a flexible credit       accumulation framework, which       enables students to transfer credits earned from certificated and       experiential learning into a framework       leading to an award.
This was further developed into a research framework       for undergraduate and       postgraduate studies through the Inquiry-Based Inter-Disciplinary Learning       (IDIBL) project; expanding       the University's widening participation and lifelong learning programme,       with the first graduates in July       2013.
The `Stay at Home' project started in 2013 with Bolton Council, leading       to improvements in engagement       with parents and service partners, participatory development of innovative       solutions, improved practice       between Council and care and support providers, and developed wider       partnerships with minority       communities.
Though still in the early stages, the project has also       identified other long term impact on       strategy and policy as documented in the supporting letter from Bolton       Council.
