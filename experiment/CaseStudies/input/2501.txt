Improved professional practice related to the financial accounting of         carbon     Pathway: The underpinning research findings have had major       implications for regulatory practice, audit and common agreement on how       carbon accounting is to proceed in governmental and industrial contexts.
Pathways to impact were generated through interactions with stakeholder       institutions, development of international standards and policy, and       through facilitating communication between financial accounting sectors       and the carbon markets.
These include:            The interview research on the Fungible Carbon project led to         an invitation in 2009 for Lovell to join the Climate Disclosure         Standards Board (CDSB) Technical Working Group, an international group         of accounting and climate change experts drawn from industry,         accountancy firms and academia [A].
In the aftermath of the Accounting           for Carbon report, the Executive Director of the CDSB notified         Lovell that they were interested in formally adding financial accounting         issues to their agenda.
A factual statement provided by the Executive         Director states that the subsequent (2012) incorporation of financial         accounting into their work programme was directly underpinned by the         Edinburgh research [B].
Lovell has been instrumentally involved in bringing together key         stakeholders across the CDSB, IETA and IASB over the period 2009 - 2013,         to resolve the confusing diversity of financial accounting practices and         to agree best practice standards in the future.
Following interest         within CDSB for developing a voluntary carbon financial accounting         standard, Lovell contacted the Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) project         leader at the IASB and in December 2011 led meetings between the IASB         and the CDSB to discuss such a standard.
Lovell also led the submission         from the CDSB to the 2011 IASB Agenda Consultation, providing         research-led evidence from the Accounting for Carbon project of         significant (material) diversity in carbon financial accountancy         practice and reporting [C].
Following this consultation, in May         2012 the IASB signalled its renewed support for the ETS project,         identifying it as a `priority research project' [D].
Further         corroboration of the underpinning role of the Edinburgh research can be         provided by the IASB Project Manager [E].
Lovell also coordinated an Expert Workshop in Edinburgh, held in         January 2013, for the first time bringing together representatives from         CDSB and the IETA and also attended by one of the sixteen IASB Board         Members, as evidenced in the meeting schedule and list of attendees [F].
The workshop discussed objectives in carbon financial accounting, with         the aim of resolving uncertainty in standards for carbon financial         accounting.
The workshop led to the notification of the European         Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) of the importance of         variability in carbon financial accounting.
Corroboration of this         interaction and the influence of the Edinburgh workshop can be seen in         the May 2013 joint response of the CDSB and IETA to an EFRAG draft         comment paper on ETS, an output agreed at the Expert Workshop [G].
Significance and reach:       The organisations impacted by the research are of international reach and       great significance for professional practice in the field of carbon       accounting.
In particular:            The incorporation of carbon financial accounting into the CDSB work         programme influences its eight consortium members (drawn from         international business and environmental organisations and including the         World Economic Forum, World Resources Institute, The Climate Registry         and the CERES investment group) and beyond, as the CDSB has a growing         international presence.
A factual statement provided by the Executive         Director of the CDSB states that Lovell played a "key role in         facilitating impact via institutional take up of issues associated with         the financial accounting of carbon" [B].
The IASB is the independent standard-setting body of the International         Financial Reporting Standards Foundation and consists of sixteen         international experts.
The IASB Board Member who attended the Edinburgh         workshop noted in their summary/reflections that the evidence presented         points to a standard being required.
The IASB also requested digital         recordings of the workshop to use for their Emissions Trading Schemes         research for standard development [E].
The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group provides technical         advice to the European Commission on accounting matters and is highly         influential (for example advice from EFRAG in 2004 led to the withdrawal         of the first IASB guidance on carbon financial accounting, called         'IFRIC-3'").
