     The framework developed by Schaffer and colleagues has been used by the       EBRD and the World Bank in a series of policy analyses and publications,       framing localised responses to national issues.
The framework provides       researchers and policymakers with tools for a data-based diagnostic of the       state of the business environment in their countries and for developing       strategies for reform.
The EBRD values the fact that "the framework         that you proposed ... identifies interventions that policy makers should         prioritize to improve the public infrastructure within which firms         operate", and they regularly use the framework in their analyses of       the data collected in the joint EBRD-World Bank survey of companies, the       Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS).
The EBRD made extensive use of the framework developed by Schaffer and       colleagues in their EBRD Transition Report 2010, EBRD Transition Report       2012, and Diversifying Russia report.
This work was done by the EBRD's       economics staff without the direct input of Schaffer et al.
More recently,       Schaffer and Carlin have been working with the EBRD's Office of the Chief       Economist to quantify the impact of business environment constraints on       companies' costs.
In order to do so, the EBRD has developed, with input       from Schaffer and Carlin, a series of follow-up questions on business       environment constraints and are currently implementing them in surveys of       thousands of companies in 30 countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia,       as well as in 10 countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa region.
EBRD's Office of the Chief Economist states, "A great advantage of the         framework you proposed is that it identifies interventions that         policy-makers should prioritize to improve the public infrastructure         with which firms operate.
We have used a version of your framework in         analysing the results of BEEPS V Russia, which covered 37 Russian         regions, and we have presented them to a number of regional policy         makers in Russia in December 2012.
...
Your work has had a significant         impact on the way we interpret the business environment constraints and         their use in policy dialogue, which we hope will improve the business         environment for the firms in the EBRD countries of operation."
[S2]     In its Diversifying Russia report, the ERBD undertook a survey of 37 of       Russia's Regions with over 4,000 companies applying the framework       developed by Schaffer et al.
The application of the framework in the       survey suggests that even neighbouring regions often have very different       profiles in terms of their business environments.
For example, in the       Primorsky Region, where the Far Eastern seaport of Vladivostok is located,       companies perceive corruption, competition from the informal sector and       access to land to be the most important obstacles to doing business.
By       contrast, in the neighbouring Khabarovsk Region, various aspects of       infrastructure appear to constrain local businesses most: transportation,       access to electricity and telecommunications (page 46).
The World Bank used the framework for two flagship reports.
The first was       Turmoil at Twenty (2009), a twenty-year retrospective on the       experiences of economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former USSR       since the collapse of communism in 1989-91 and the start of the transition       to market-based economies.
The second was More and Better Jobs in         South Asia, a forward-looking evaluation of the labour markets of       the 8 economies in the World Bank's South Asia regional operations.
Schaffer and Carlin served as consultants for both reports, contributing       directly to the analysis and to drafting of portions of the reports.
The       most important of the findings, as identified by the World Bank, that were       based on the framework developed by Schaffer and Carlin were that (a) in       the transition economies, physical infrastructure and labour market skills       during those twenty years had become significantly more severe constraints       to the operations of companies in transition countries compared to       non-transition countries at similar levels of per capita income; (b) in       the economies of South Asia, notwithstanding the notable diversity of       those countries, the top three constraints affecting the operations of       firms that had added jobs in South Asia were the lack of reliable       electricity supply, bribes paid to the utilities and tax authorities, and       political instability, and addressing these constraints should feature on       any agenda for job creation.
The World Bank's Chief Economist for the Europe and Central Asia Region       [S1] when the work for the first report was initiated was also a member of       the World Bank team that drafted the second report.
He writes that "These         results emerged from a rigorous and imaginative application of the         framework developed by Mark Schaffer and his co-authors.
They have had a         clear impact on the way World Bank economists working on these issues         think about the business environment."
