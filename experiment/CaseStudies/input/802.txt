     Our work has directly led to changes to government policy and public       service guidelines and       practices for TB control across Nepal and Pakistan, improving care for       more than 300,000 people       with TB annually, and helping to protect nearly 200 million people from TB       annually.
The strategies       we developed and demonstrated were effective, which have been rolled out       since 2008, have led       to improved quality of life for patients through reduced financial burden,       better treatment outcomes,       reducing risk of TB spread and development of drug resistant strains of       TB.
Without our research,       and development support, it is unlikely that any change to care would have       occurred.
These       strategies have also been adopted in other low-income countries, such as       Swaziland.
Impacts on international development       From the outset, to ensure our research influenced policy and practice at       large scale, we adopted       a deliberate strategy of working closely with National TB Programmes.
This       strategy develops       trust; ensures our research addresses national priorities; ensures       findings are relevant for policy       makers; promotes policy-makers' ownership of the research findings; and       encourages joint       development of subsequent policy, operational guidelines and training       methods and materials.
Much of our research uptake was made possible through our partnership with       in-country research       and development NGOs, set up by ex-students/employees of the University of       Leeds.
TB       Programme Managers and members of their teams were involved from       conception (responding to       their prioritisation of the problems) to completion.
This included joint       development of the       interventions to be tested, regular briefings and discussions of likely       implications of findings.
Our research and research uptake strategy have together led directly to       better, evidence-informed,       public policy and improved public services in Nepal and Pakistan for       people with TB.
We were       involved in the development of draft national policy and operational plans       published since 2008.
National guidelines adopted since 2008 have been revised to take account       of our findings, and our       patient-friendly approaches have been implemented in both in Nepal (A-G)       and Pakistan (H-J).
We have also jointly developed training materials and courses that have       been used by the TB       Programmes from 2008 onwards to train health workers in the new       strategies.
Walley and Newell       have provided on-going advice and support to the NTPs throughout the       assessment period.
More widely, the research influenced key WHO/Stop TB Partnership (www.stopTB.org)       documents       (K-M) (including the Stop TB strategy 2006), in which the       requirement for DOT has been replaced       by a more patient-centred approach of `supervision and patient support'.
Although publication of       these documents falls outside the assessment period, their influence in       encouraging adoption of       this strategy across low-income countries has continued throughout the       assessment period.
Impacts on health and welfare       Our research and our research uptake strategy have together led to 100%         reach across our         intended target populations - the (overwhelmingly poor) people of       Nepal and Pakistan receiving       care for TB - starting in 2008 and continuing to date.
This means improved       care for 30,000 people       with TB in the mountain/hill districts of Nepal annually, helping protect       30 million people from TB       infection in Nepal (A-G); and improved care for 300,000 people with       TB in Pakistan annually,       helping protect 177 million people in Pakistan (H-J) (based on WHO       statistics on numbers at risk).
Our research has also contributed to improved TB treatment outcomes in       both countries (N).
in Nepal, the TB treatment success rate was 48% (case detection 56%)         in 1995 prior to our         research, and 85% (case detection 71%) in 2011: mortality fell by 900 to         7,000.       in Pakistan, the TB treatment success rate was 70% (case detection         4.5%) in 1995, and 91%         (case detection 65%) in 2011: mortality fell by 31,000 to 59,000.
Our research has also led to significantly improved quality of life         for people with TB in Nepal and       Pakistan, who no longer need to attend a clinic daily, and can therefore       continue their usual       employment/duties and follow normal lives (4), reducing the burden       and costs of TB.
In Nepal, we estimated costs to patients using family/community health         worker DOT were         US$32 lower than using standard health centre DOT (a reduction of nearly         50%) (5).
To put this         in context, the average annual income (2001) was US$400 and 55% of the         population earned         less than the international poverty line (IPL) of US$1.25 per day.
in Pakistan, we estimated costs to patients using family/community         health worker DOT were         US$27 lower than using standard health centre DOT (a reduction of 50%) (3).
The average         annual income (2001) was US$750 and 23% of the population earned less         than the IPL.
