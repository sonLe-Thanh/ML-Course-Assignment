     Newcastle University's PEDM group has a substantial history of research       collaborations with       manufacturers of consumer products, including Black and Decker, LG and       Electrolux and in       particular we have had a fruitful research relationship with Dyson       spanning the last decade.
Dyson       have incorporated many of the group's innovations into their products and       their recent (2011-2013)       use of a specific, novel sensorless control scheme is the topic of this       case study.
It will be       appreciated that because of the need to protect commercially sensitive       intellectual property the       Dyson information contained here is necessarily limited.
Key elements of the sensorless control work were subject to April 2012       patent applications [E1, E2]       which have yet to come into the public domain.
Dyson have chosen to implement the sensorless control system on all their       new drive systems       because the design offered the following:            Lower manufacturing costs and improved sales margins, estimated by         Dyson at         &#163;2M/annum.
Ergonomic benefits of flexibility and simplicity in product         realisation, particularly in small         machines, because there is no longer any need to incorporate a position         sensor.
Reduced complexity in the production line, leading to increased         production rates and         reduced costs.
Less variation in performance within a production run and across the         entire population of         drive systems manufactured.
The sensorless design allows, through the elimination of the position       sensor, the control electronics       and motor to be separated and in turn this provides much more ergonomic       flexibility in designing       the product's external envelope.
Dyson is noted for the ergonomic design       of its machines and the       new control system contributes to cost savings by allowing reductions in       component count and       assembly complexity.
In the period April 2011 - March 2013 the Newcastle research team       provided close support to       Dyson staff based at Newcastle whilst the sensorless control system was       made production ready       for manufacture in Singapore.
In parallel Dyson has invested &#163;5M in a new       production line to       manufacture vacuum cleaner products incorporating our sensorless designs.
[E3]     Dyson's Director of Motors &amp; Power Systems makes clear the exclusive       and fundamental nature of       his Company's relationship with Newcastle University in this field and the       scale of products       impacted by that relationship, stating "Our research collaboration with         the Power Electronics Drives         &amp; Machines Group at Newcastle University has had a fundamental         impact upon the design of         Dyson products.
In particular, the patented sensorless control         technology has been implemented in         products with annual sales of 4.5 - 5 million units per year and annual         sales values of         approximately &#163;0.5Bn.
We have invested around &#163;5M in a new Singapore         based production line to         manufacture these products and we estimate that the sensorless designs         will yield annual         production cost savings of around &#163;2M.
On a more general note, the         Company has benefited from         its relationship with Newcastle University via the transfer of ideas and         realisations as well as the         transfer of personnel.
We collaborate exclusively with Prof Mecrow's         group in this field and the         core of our Motors &amp; Power Systems team has been recruited from         within the Newcastle research         group."
