     Dental services for older people       Public services, including dental services, must adapt to the rapid       demographic change associated with the ageing population.
The British       Dental Association (BDA) has promoted changes to public policy to meet       this challenge.
Steele was a member of the BDA's Expert Reference Group       that in 2003 wrote the Key Issue Policy Paper BDA Oral Healthcare for       Older People 2020 Vision (Ev a), which draws on R1 and R2 in making       recommendations such as integration of dentistry with other health       services for older people, and changing the professional training       curriculum to allow practitioners to cope with an increasing caseload of       older people.
Progress on implementation of the policy paper's       recommendations was detailed in a 2012 report produced by the BDA (Ev b),       which found that seven of 21 recommendations had been met and another six       deemed partially met (Ev b).
The pathway to a new NHS dental contract       The majority of adults in the UK receive dental care from the NHS: a 2009       survey indicated that 31.7 million adults (82% of the adult population)       had seen an NHS dentist in the preceding two years.
Therefore, it is       essential that NHS dentistry is properly configured to meet the current       and projected future needs of the population.
In 2008, the UK parliament health select committee published a report       detailing major problems with the dental contract in place at the time.
They found that while the 2006 dental contract had moved away from the       fee-per-item payment model, it was still too focused on treatment activity       and not enough on prevention.
In response to the select committee's       findings, the Secretary of State for Health invited Steele, with his       background of research on oral health trends and health economics, to lead       an independent review of NHS dental services in England in early 2009 (Ev       c).
Steele's 2009 review of NHS dentistry (Ev d) drew on a range of sources       including the 1998 adult dental health survey (R3), the 2003 child dental       health survey, and economic research by Steele and colleagues at Newcastle       University (R5).
The epidemiologic data describing the change in oral       health trends (see section 2) directly underpin the review's       recommendations of a shift in payment model from one that encourages       treatment activity to one that favours high-quality preventive care; from       fee-per-item to capitation and quality provision.
The review recognised       that the younger population, with better oral health, required fewer       resources; these funds could then be redirected to treat the older       population, with poorer dental health.
NHS dental contract reform programme       Since its publication, Steele's review has substantially influenced policy       debate on NHS dentistry.
It has influenced UK Parliament discussions on       NHS dental services in Commons debate and written answers (see Hansard       records for 1 July, 14 October and 3 November 2009, Ev e).
In 2010, the       coalition government announced a redesign of the NHS dental contract,       which would be based on the recommendations in Steele's review.
Both the       reasoning behind this decision and the strategy for redesign were       explained in the Department of Health document NHS Dental Contract:         Proposals for Pilots (published December 2010, Ev f):     "When the NHS was founded ... the main work of NHS dentistry was the         extraction of decayed teeth, and the creation of dentures.
Since then,         the oral health of the population has changed."
"Today [16 December 2010] we are publishing our proposals for         pilots.
We have developed them with the advice and support of a group of         experts, including representatives of the British Dental Association,         and Professor Jimmy Steele, author of an independent review of NHS         dentistry."
Components of the new dental contract are currently being tested on a       large scale; specifically, variants of the payment model are being applied       to a number of different practices around England.
The process began in       July 2011 and, as of June 2013, 90 practices overall are taking part (Ev       g).
This equates to approximately 35 000 patient treatment sessions per       week (based on mean data for the UK).
An October 2012 assessment of the       early findings reported that staff felt better able to offer appropriate       care (EV h, pg 21).
The Head of Dentistry and Eye Care Services at the Department of Health       confirmed (Ev i) that Steele's research underpins the design of the NHS       dental contract pilots: "Research by Professor Jimmy Steele and         colleagues at Newcastle University underpins the design of the new NHS         dental contract pilots.
Original research on the oral health of older         people... and Professor Steele's major contributions to the 1998 and         2009 Adult Dental Health Surveys and the 2003 Children's Dental Health         Survey have been influential...This [Steele and Walls' epidemiologic       data] pointed to a need to reform NHS dentistry so that a much greater         emphasis on preventive care rather than just high levels of treatment         activity is encouraged and the health benefits of NHS dentistry         maximised."
As a consequence of the 2009 independent review, commissioning of NHS       dental services has been reformed.
Economics research in Newcastle and       subsequent work as part of the review identified that a lack of expertise       in dental commissioning was affecting the quality and effective use of       resources in dentistry.
Dental commissioning responded to these specific       findings by moving towards expert and specialist commissioning on a larger       scale.
The Chief Dental Officer for NHS England and the Department of       Health confirms that Newcastle work has underpinned this change (EV j): "...         researchers at Newcastle University, led by Steele (Holmes et al.
2008...       [R5], Holmes et al 2009 [R6] have been part of that growing         understanding [of approaches to commissioning].
This work along         with the widely cited epidemiological data published by Steele and         colleagues...went on to inform the recommendations that emerged from         that review."
In summary, research carried out at Newcastle University that       found a change in the trends in oral health led to aspects of a new dental       contract being tested in pilots.
The success of these initial pilots       resulted in a national reform of the NHS dental contract.
