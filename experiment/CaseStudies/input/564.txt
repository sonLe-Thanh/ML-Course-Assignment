     The research of Noble and his team has informed policymaking and practice       in a number of countries, however, it has been of particular value in       helping governments and other organisations in the UK and South Africa to       target resources and improve living conditions in deprived areas.
UK Policy     Each of the UK indices was initially commissioned by central government       for a particular purpose, e.g.
the first English Indices of Deprivation       (2000, 2004 and 2007) were developed to identify the most deprived areas       of England to inform targeting of regeneration programmes such as the       Single Regeneration Budget and the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund.
The following are selected examples of uses of the indices:             Targeting funding: &#163;1.5 billion (2008-09 to 2010-11) Working         Neighbourhoods Fund (WNF) was allocated to local authorities on the         basis of levels of deprivation in their constituent neighbourhoods, as         determined by the 2007 Indices [R1; Section 5: C1]; &#163;30 million         (2011) of Community First funding was allocated to the most deprived         neighbourhoods identified using the 2010 Indices and other sources [R2;           C2]; the 2007 Indices and the Local Index of Child Well-being are         being used to estimate the number of troubled families in each local         authority for the allocation of &#163;450 million (2012-2015) of funding [R1,           R3; C3].
Funding formulae: the NHS has used the English Indices as part         of its weighted capitation funding formulae to calculate allocations of         funding to primary care trusts and deprivation-weighted additions to GP         salaries e.g.
&#163;85 billion was allocated in 2011-12 [e.g.
R1; C4];         the disadvantage uplift in 16-19 education funding is calculated using         the 2010 Indices [R2; C5]; the Local Index of Child Well-being         is used in a funding formula for allocating &#163;25.4 million (2010-11) for         under-18s drug and alcohol treatment [R3; C6].
Targeting programmes: the Community Energy Saving Programme         (2009-2012) contributes to the government's Fuel Poverty Strategy by         targeting geographical areas selected using the income domain of the         indices.
[R1; C7].
Further impacts: the indices appeal broadly to charities,         voluntary organisations, businesses and the general public.
For example,         many National Lottery grants are targeted at deprived areas using the         indices, as are other charitable funds, such as the Church and Community         Fund (http://www.ccfund.org.uk/apply/index-of-multiple-deprevation)         [R1, R2; C9].
Public consultations on methodology, data sources and outputs were held       for each of the UK indices to ensure that the outputs met the needs of the       user.
The indices attract media attention (e.g.
http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/29/jaywick-essex-resort-most-deprived).
The English Indices 2007 report was the most downloaded document from the       Department of Communities and Local Government's website from 1 April to 8       December 2008 with 182,000 downloads       (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/docu         ments/localgovernment/pdf/1415647.pdf, p17).
Building on recognition afforded to the research by Universities UK (as       one of the top 100 discoveries and developments in UK universities), in       2008, the UK government gave formal recognition of the impact of SDRC's       various UK indices by awarding Professor Noble a CBE for services to       research on poverty and deprivation, in particular his work on the English       Indices 2007.
A University of Oxford spin-out company called Oxford       Consultants for Social Inclusion (www.ocsi.co.uk)       was established in 2003, amongst other things to assist local government       and voluntary organisations with the analysis of deprivation in their       local areas using the indices; they have worked with over a hundred public       sector organisations.
South African Policy     CASASP's South African indices were undertaken in collaboration with       stakeholders in South Africa (Human Sciences Research Council, Statistics       South Africa, and the national Department of Social Development) who       contributed to the development of the research.
These indices were       promoted widely by the Department of Social Development, which, in       recognition of their value, provided financial support to update the work.
The indices have been used to inform and target a range of strategies and       programmes, including:            The government's anti-poverty strategy (2009 onwards)         http://www.pmg.org.za/docs/2009/091013waronpoverty-edit.pdf,         p19 [R4; C10]        The City of Johannesburg's programme of subsidies for the poor (2008         onwards) [R6; C8, C11]        The Social Grants Outreach Programme (2007-2010) (improving take-up of         social assistance in deprived rural areas) [R4; C10]        The National Development Plan (2013)         http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=154434,         p237 [R5; C10]
