     The impacts of Baysted's innovative research into sound design and       soundtrack composition in racing simulation achieved primarily through a       commercial pathway are threefold:            Commercial success of the Shift 2 game;       Enhanced enjoyment of gamesplayers;       Debate, discourse and commentary in and around the games industry.
These impacts, which are materially and distinctly linked to Baysted's       specific and innovative contribution to the simulation games are to some       extent inter-dependent and are described in detail below.
Commercial success of the N4S Shift and Shift2 games     Need for Speed is the most successful racing video game series in the       world, and one of the most successful video game franchises of all time.
Baysted's contribution came to the third generation of the series       (releases no.
13 and 17, termed herein as Shift (2009) and Shift2 (2011));       the research described in 2).
Relates to the second of these two games.
Shift 2 has sold 3.75M units globally and a key factor in the commercial       success of this game is the sound design and soundtrack as indicated by       these reviews from IGN (the largest games news site in the world, ranked       326 in the world for web traffic of all sites; http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ign.com).
About the sound design: "The excellent audio visual feeds into this;         the cars growl with purpose and they're finely modelled too", and "Shift         2 Unleashed's a violent and immersive racer that recreates the driving         experience like no other game on the market..." ; and about the       soundtrack "This is a totally unique approach to videogame scores,"       said Steve Schnur, Worldwide Executive of Music and Marketing for EA.
The       score and game has received a prestigious international peer award       nominations (Golden Joystick, Game Audio Network Guild).
Enhanced enjoyment of gamesplayers     Over 3.75M people worldwide have played the game (not including       multi-players per unit and second hand sales) plus many millions more have       experienced the score through TV, Cinema and online advertising campaigns.
Evidence that the soundtrack makes a substantive contribution to the       gamer's experience and enjoyment is provided in the millions of views of       YouTube videos of the game featuring its sound design and soundtrack.
A       search on YouTube for "shift 2 unleashed soundtrack" (in quotes) provides       1550 results, each are video clips from the game.
A total of 658 of these       are YouTube video clips from Shift 2 game menu screen i.e.
no gameplay       just sound.
The top 10 of the 658 `menu only' clips are clearly downloaded       by people just wanting to hear the soundtrack total 611,541 views alone       (18/10/13).
Comments posted on YouTube in reaction to these re-imagined       tracks further underpin the importance of the soundtrack to the quality       and intensity of the overall experience, the majority, but not all are       positive (quotes, colloquialisms &amp; typos are quoted verbatim) : "this         was the best thing off the game!
", "Did you know that Rise         Against used this mix in one of their Concerts?
I don't care if people         said this is bad.
For me, this is just pure awesomeness.
", "...this         song and the soundtracks are pretty damn dope, it fits the game         perfectly", "The specifically composed soundtracks from Need for         Speed 2 and 3 are on antoher level alltogether", "this song         reminds me that im in the final GT1 world championship", "It's         scary!
This is game has been turned into a horror film compared to the         1st one..".
Debate, discourse and commentary in and around the games industry     The game has generated much debate across awards panels fora, blogs, news       sites, YouTube and music sales and share sites.
The innovation in the game       were critical in nomination for Game Audio Network Guild 2012 annual       awards: Shift 2 nominated for Best Use Of Licensed Music; and also a       factor in the nomination for Best Racing Game in the 2011 Golden Joystick       Awards.
Some of the sound design techniques for the realistic recreation       of engine noise also featured in an earlier instance of the Need for Speed       Series (Shift; 2009) leading to a nomination for Best Sound Editing:       Computer Entertainment in the 57th annual Golden Reel awards       (2010).
Reviews by professional critics and amateurs are often sites of       debate; there are myriad such reviews online; a Google search of `"need       for speed shift" and review' yields 15,100,000 results.
Many reviews refer       to the audio experience, many citing it as an important feature of the       game and the gaming experience (see IGN link above) and others less       positive; nevertheless public debate is evidenced; other illustrative       reviews are provided in the corroborating sources.
The gamers engage in       debate too as indicated above; a Google search of "engine sound" "need for       speed shift" returns 1,220,00 results.
Whilst not always so eloquent as       the reviews gamers often pick up on (and argue about) aspects of the sound       design and soundtrack, the re-imagined pop/rock hits are either described       as awesome or irritating, the engine sounds as realistic or not.
