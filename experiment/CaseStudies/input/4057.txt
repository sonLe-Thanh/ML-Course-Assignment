     Through the period of intervention (2008-2010), the Ecovillage's `Process       Group' (responsible for       the Ecovillage's organisation) led the internal learning process between       the researchers' visits, and       implemented an entirely new organisational structure, using the research       tools discussed earlier to       facilitate its design.
By the end of 2008, the role of the Board of       Directors had been clarified and       changed to focus on policy issues; the 22 original working groups in the       eco-village were re-grouped       into 7 Primary Activity Groups; and a monthly `Coordination' meeting was       created to look       for synergies and resolve conflicts.
By the end of 2009, adaptation       systems were introduced and       discussed at the Coordination meetings, and accountability mechanisms were       put in place.
Evidence collected in 2010 (through multiple interviews, focus groups, a       longitudinal analysis       based on narratives, and social network analysis) shows many significant       improvements in the       levels of communication and self-regulation of the community.
Some examples are (Espinosa et al 2011, pp.
16, 17):            The use of VSM distinctions enabled the construction of a very rich         narrative about the         ongoing and desirable organisational transformations.
The intervention         succeeded in         embedding core complexity management principles into people's         understandings of the         interactions between different roles, allowing them to design         improvements to their self-         organising principles and practices, such as new roles, new decision         making structures and         information sharing mechanisms [A], [Cardoso (2011), p. 255-290,         Appendix 3, Espinosa &amp;         Walker, 2013], [C].
Structured observations showed that the intervention helped the         community members to         create and share models of their organisation.
This resulted in improved         communications,         role definitions, connectivity and performance, all of which contributed         to improved viability         and sustainability of the community [Espinosa &amp; Walker (2013), pp.
126-128 and Appendix         3].
Choices made by the community members about working groups and         meta-systemic         management positively affected the connectivity and communications         within them.
For         example, matching of members' expertise to the skills required for         particular tasks changed         from 9% to 21%; members became closer to each other (reciprocity         improved from 38% to         59% during the intervention); and there were faster flows of         communication taking place         between roles at the end than at the beginning of the intervention [B]         &#8212; Cardoso (2011), pp.
168-195]; [Espinosa &amp; Walker (2013), pp.
126-128].
The above statistical evidence coincided with the views expressed by         interviewed         members, who recognised that improvements in performance, task         identification and         connectivity were related to sharing a clear model of the organisation &#8212;         resulting from the         intervention of the researchers [Cardoso (2011), pp.
255-290], [E, F,           G].
Once internal organisation improved, the eco-village developed         successfully.
In a recent         visit (2013), there were over 50 houses built and more than 100 new         members had come to         live at the Village.
Now they needed to create work opportunities in         order to live         sustainably.
We had discussed seed ideas for new businesses during the         2009 and 2010         workshops.
While in 2008 the only green business was the community         development         project, in 2011 there were 25 new local green business initiatives:         e.g.
an organic farm, a         sustainability education initiative, a service company, a hostel and an         eco-build company         [Espinosa &amp; Walker (2013, pp.
125].
In 2013, in addition to these 25         businesses, several         more were under discussion.
Some of the members who participated in the         intervention         have used the suggested organisational design principles for designing         and running their         new businesses (e.g.
the Village Farm and the Educational NGO), which         demonstrates the         continuing impact of this research [G].
This approach and toolkit for supporting self-transformation in       communities aiming to improve their       resilience has potential for great reach, as there are multiple       communities in the world also aiming       to self-organise and work in a cooperative, flat organisation, better       suited to adapt and improve       resilience in a rapidly changing socio-ecological environment.
An example       of this is the Transition       Network project that originated in Devon, UK, and now has hundreds of       branches across the UK       and in several countries around the world.
They have begun to experiment       using this approach in       one of their regional branches (Diss Transition Town) and a local branch       (Marsden and Slaithwaite       Transition Town &#8212; MASTT [H]).
In 2012-2013, a large Latin-American       building corporation       experienced Espinosa's methodology for improving their organisational       structure, with very positive       results [I].
Furthermore, in 2012, a new project started in the UK       &#8212; with the UK Permaculture       Association (PMA) &#8212; and this has already produced positive improvements in       the organisation [J].
The European Association of PMA is now using this methodology, so the       influence of the research       continues to spread [J].
