     The main impact of this work has been:     a) the development and implementation of networks of scanning UV           spectrometers to measure volcanic SO 2       flux, continuously and automatically;     b) the application of the datasets generated to used to forecast           volcanic activity and influence local government planning.
The development of the scanning UV spectrometer networks to monitor SO2       fluxes has revolutionised the way in which volcanic gas monitoring data is       acquired and utilised globally, and as a consequence the value of gas       monitoring has increased significantly.
At Soufriere Hills Volcano, the SO2 flux data is critically       important during the 1-2 year- long pauses that occur every few years.
Currently (July 2013), the volcano is in a prolonged pause that has lasted       two years.
It is important to be able to assess whether the eruption has       stopped, or has merely paused, in order for the local government to plan       development and to approve access to volcanic areas (both for domestic and       commercial purposes).
A Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) was       commissioned by the UK Foreign Office to provide a risk assessment, based       on the monitoring data (between 2003 and present).
There are three       criteria for recognising the end of the eruption (based on seismicity,       ground deformation and gas flux).
The end of the eruption will be marked       by SO2 fluxes that are consistently less than 50 t/d for more       than 12 months (in tandem with little or no ground deformation, and no       seismicity).
Given that we believe that the SO2 flux at the       surface is a direct indicator of deep magma supply (see underpinning       research), and that it has been shown that the influx of magma at depth is       associated with only weak seismicity and ground deformation, the SO2       flux is the most important dataset for recognising the end of the eruption       (see SAC reports, particularly Report 13; www.mvo.ms).
So far, the SO2 flux has remained high, even during long       (&gt;24 months) pauses, which indicates that gas-rich magma is being       supplied at depth and that the eruption will probably resume.
This       assessment allows local government to make decisions about where to build       new infrastructure (they have focussed their efforts in the north of the       island, away from volcanic areas) and whether to attempt large projects       with commercial value, which might bring in revenue but must be weighed       against the possibility of a resumption in volcanic activity, which will       bring them to a halt (e.g.
geothermal power and aggregate mining, both in       volcanic areas, and both requiring dredging of the area around the jetty).
The Director of the Disaster Management Coordination Agency,       Government of Montserrat (http://dmca.gov.ms/),       will "provide independent assessment and corroboration of the societal         impact of the scanning spectrometer system for the measurement of         volcanic gas fluxes, developed by University of Cambridge researchers,         on the island of Montserrat in the West Indies."
He will also       corroborate the value of the SO2 monitoring network, initiated       by this group of Cambridge scientists, for risk assessment, risk       mitigation and planning and that "The reports of the Scientific         Advisory Committee rely heavily on these kinds of monitoring data to         produce probability-based forecasts, which are then used by the civil         authorities to make decisions on hazard mapping, exclusion zone         management, land use planning, development and investment."

Report 13, based on a meeting held 7-9 September 2009, executive       summary, page ii: "...Measurements of the flux of SO2 and       deformation of the ground surface on and around the volcano have, unlike       the seismicity, shown signals as strong as ever.
We consider these to       indicate that the deeper part of the system is still receiving magma and       that the volcano may resume surface activity at any time..."       http://www.mvo.ms/resources/downloads/finish/40-sac-13/931-sac13main/0     Report 10, based on a meeting held 14-16 April 2008: "It is       possible that lava extrusion will never resume.
For this to happen ...       signals for ground deformation, SO2 emission and long-period       seismicity would fall below the threshold levels we defined previously.
To       be assured that those conditions have become established, all these       signals would need to remain below these threshold levels for about one       year.
When we test these criteria at the moment we find that the       deformation and gas measurements do not meet them.
We find that there is       at least a 98% probability that the process that powers the eruption ...       is still occurring."
http://www.mvo.ms/resources/downloads/finish/44-sac-10/893-sac10main/0     In a wider context, our development on Montserrat led directly to a US       patent (filed by B. Galle, in 2010, details below), describing the       innovative use of a scanning apparatus (made up of a telescope, and prism,       rotated using a stepper motor), which, when attached to the UV       spectrometer via a fibre optic cable, allows complete automated scanning       through the plume and calculation of SO2 fluxes, given a       knowledge of the plume speed through the scanned section.
Scientists from       other volcano observatories came to Montserrat to learn about the methods       that we developed for automated gas monitoring, and they later set up       their own networks, such as Dr Mike Burton (INGV), who later installed a       spectrometer network on Etna and Stromboli, Dr Nick Varley (Colima       Volcano) and Dr Santiago Arrellano (Ecuador).
The scanning UV spectrometer       network, based on differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) for       retrievals, has been adopted at 20 other volcanoes worldwide, and all of       the peer- reviewed papers resulting from the networks cite our work as the       first example.
Over the last few years, improvements have been made to the       DOAS scanning spectrometers, including adopting new geometries for       scanning and more sophisticated hardware, but the design and idea behind       the systems remains the same.
The Director of the Disaster Management Coordination Agency,       Government of Montserrat, will also testify that "the lessons on         Montserrat are actively being sought by regional partners with volcanic         risks."
