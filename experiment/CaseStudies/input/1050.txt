     Cronk, Kahn and Robertson have used their research insights to contribute       to bringing classic European literature to a wider audience through being       involved in the editing and translating of 15 OWC titles, with 10 of those       titles published in the REF impact period (2008-13) [1].
Titles they have edited are:            Cronk (ed.
), Voltaire, Letters concerning the English Nation         (2009)       Cronk (ed.
), Voltaire, A Pocket Philosophical Dictionary, tr.

), Montesquieu, Persian Letters, tr.
Margaret Mauldon         (2008)       Kahn (ed.
), Lermontov, A Hero of our Time, tr.

Anthea         Bell (2013)          Involvement with OWC enables the academics concerned to bring the       products of their research to a wide public; to convey their understanding       of, and enthusiasm for, their chosen authors to a non-academic audience;       to communicate in an accessible, informative style which respects its       readers and avoids condescension.
Academics professionally committed to       studying and disseminating a foreign literature also want to counter the       British reading public's notorious lack of interest in translations.
Readers demonstrate the accessibility of the editions through reviews e.g.
a review on Amazon of Robertson's Kafka: A Very Short Introduction       says: `this book does a fantastic job of introducing Kafka in a way which       is as useful to those familiar with his work as it is to new readers       [...]One of the most enjoyable aspects of the book is that it does not try       to teach you the 'meaning' of the novels, which is a flawed business where       Kafka is concerned and which would be impossible in such a short space of       time, but rather how to read them in a way that allows you to draw your       own conclusions.'
(Zerbina, 11 December 2011).
[i]     Within the OWC series the five Kafka volumes form a distinct subseries       (now available as a set)[ii].
The Kafka project provided an       opportunity to commission new translations of Kafka's main works from       outstanding translators including Anthea Bell, Joyce Crick, and Mike       Mitchell for a five-volume series, each with introduction and notes by       Robertson.
This enabled Robertson to use his scholarly knowledge of Kafka,       his long experience of teaching Kafka to undergraduates and speaking on       Kafka to general audiences, and the practice in concentrating on       essentials gained from his well-received Kafka: A Very Short         Introduction (2004), by mediating these often opaque texts to a wide       readership without over-simplifying and without pressing any particular       line of interpretation on readers.
The first three volumes were launched       by a public event hosted by the Bodleian Library, featuring a panel       discussion among the three translators, chaired by Professor Karen Leeder,       and talks by Mark Harman and Stanley Corngold (who have translated various       Kafka texts for American publishers), now available as a podcast.
The       three volumes were also featured on the BBC Radio 4 Open Book programme       (with Mariella Frostrup and Lawrence Norfolk), broadcast on 12 July 2009       and repeated on 16 July [iii].
The remaining two volumes       appeared in 2012; Robertson presented them with a talk at the Oxford       Literary Festival on 29 March 2012 (audience c. 30) [iv]; one       attendee, a retired schoolteacher, wrote: `Robertson's lecture on The Man       who Disappeared at the Oxford Literary Festival not only inspired me to       read Kafka's first novel, but also sent me back to Kafka's masterpieces,       The Trial and The Castle.'
As OWC are published by OUP, their editor, who is based in Oxford, is       able to cultivate close links with Oxford academics.
In the resulting       symbiosis, academics reach a wide readership; readers in turn benefit from       the introductions and notes which distinguish OWC from rival paperback       series.
The editors, when not themselves working directly as translators,       work closely with translators: thus Cronk ensured that the translator of       Voltaire's Pocket Philosophical Dictionary, unlike all       predecessors, conveyed Voltaire's deliberately jarring use of low register       (which, after the Guardian printed an admiring review by Nicholas       Lezard, led to an exchange in its letter columns about the appropriateness       of using the word `shit' [v]).
Besides their own contributions, Cronk, Kahn and Robertson are often       asked to advise the publishers: `In my role as Senior Commissioning Editor       for the Oxford World's Classics series I solicit opinion from expert       scholarly advisers concerning the viability and quality of new proposals       for titles under consideration for publication in the series.
For titles       in the field of modern European literature I consult with Ritchie       Robertson, Nicholas Cronk, and Andrew Kahn.
They advise on the quality of       sample translation material, on the suitability and scope of editorial       material, on the prospects for new editions in the college market, and       they recommend possible translators and editors.'
[1]This       collaboration leads also to expanding the classics base (e.g.
by including       Jonathan Mallinson's translation of Graffigny's Letters from a         Peruvian) and to added value: e.g.
Cronk's edition of Diderot's Rameau's         Nephew has as an appendix Goethe's essay on Diderot, never before       translated, and Kahn's version of Lermontov's Hero of our Time       (2013) also includes a new annotated translation of Pushkin's `Journey to       Erzerum'.
The academics' involvement helps to ensure and enhance the quality of       translated literature available not only in Britain but (since the series       sells widely overseas) to an international reading public.
OWC has the       largest market share of any classics series after Penguin Classics.
Sales       figures show that there is also a substantial demand worldwide among       general readers for reliable translations with informative introductory       material that enhances their reading experience and gives them background       knowledge.
The OWC series is distributed worldwide via OUP's branch       network.
Its sales form a significant part of the trade contribution to       the Academic Division's turnover.
For the reporting period (Jan 2008 - Jul       2013) global sales for the volumes edited by Cronk, Kahn and Robertson (15       titles) total 84,028 with a further 23,891 in UK sales.
[1]     OUP gains prestige from having a quality paperback series advertised in       both its academic and trade lists.
Since the target readership includes       students, and the Commissioning Editor normally wants to be assured that a       text is widely read by undergraduates and/or graduates, this is a further       reason for wishing to maximize the quality of the translations and       editorial matter; it is assumed, however, that the student readers are not       (mainly) modern languages students using cribs, but students on courses on       comparative and general literature, both here and (especially) in North       America.
Cronk's edition of Voltaire's Letters concerning the English         Nation is used in French universities, including Rouen, Lyon II and       Paris IV (as the only edition of the English version of the Lettres         philosophiques authorized by Voltaire, it is crucial evidence of       Voltaire's European reputation and influence).
[1]     During the impact period the above OWC titles were adopted for over 900       courses across more than 200 universities in the USA, taken by over 21,500       students; 394 of these courses were at private, 541 at public       institutions.
In geographical range, the largest number was in the       Northwest (297), closely followed by the Midwest (285).
The universities       with the most enrolments on courses using these texts were Michigan and       Berkeley with Ivy League universities such as Columbia, Harvard and Yale       also adopting the texts.
Some 50% of the adoptions were of the         Interpretation of Dreams, The Metamorphosis, and the         Golden Pot.
Besides the expected literature, language, history, and       general humanities / liberal arts programmes, some titles (Letters         Concerning the English Nation, Persian Letters, Rameau's Nephew, and       The Castle) also appear on political science and anthropology       syllabi.
The Trial appears also on law and criminal justice       courses, while The Interpretation of Dreams is prescribed for       courses (both undergraduate and graduate) on history of science, law,       media studies, psychology, and music.
The breadth and depth of adoption in       US higher education institutions clearly demonstrates the contribution       Cronk, Kahn and Robertson make to teaching via the supply of quality and       accessible translation of texts with wide interdisciplinary application.
