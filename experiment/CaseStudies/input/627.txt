     By identifying the best fluid replacement techniques for the management       of severe shock, OUCRU has significantly improved clinical understanding       and management of DSS globally.
This research has improved international       guidelines and clinical practice guidance in endemic countries, and has       also directly influenced changes in the WHO's 2009 Dengue Guidelines         for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and Control, and the WHO's 2012       Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue.
The impact on patients       has been faster, safer and more effective resuscitation.
The guidelines       have simplified management for clinicians and helped to avoid unnecessary       interventions.
WHO 2009 Guidelines     WHO guidelines for the management of dengue were first formulated in 1975       and subsequently updated in 1986, 1994, and 1997.
While these guidelines       recommended immediate treatment with crystalloid solutions for dengue       shock, and colloid treatment for persistent shock, a lack of evidence and       any significant updates since 1975 led to increasing concern that the       recommendations were outdated and ineffective.
In particular, there was       debate among clinicians regarding the use of crystalloids versus colloids.
OUCRU ended this debate by performing the first three randomised blind       trials, investigating the effect of different crystalloid and colloid       fluid regimens on the outcome of DSS.
This work provided key evidence for       the WHO's 2009 Dengue guidelines for the management of DSS.
The following recommendations were published in the 2009 WHO Dengue         Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and Control,       directly citing OUCRU's three fluid trials2,3,5 as key       evidence:     "The action plan for treating patients with compensated shock is as         follows... Start intravenous fluid resuscitation with isotonic         crystalloid solutions at 5-10 ml/kg/hour over one hour."
7       "Based on the three randomized controlled trials comparing the         different types of fluid resuscitation regime in dengue shock in         children, there is no clear advantage to the use of colloids over         crystalloids in terms of the overall outcome2,3,5.
However, colloids may be the preferred choice if the blood pressure has         to be restored urgently..."7     "Colloids have been shown to restore the cardiac index and reduce the         level of haematocrit faster than crystalloids in patients with         intractable shock."
7     Ministry of Health Malaysia 2010 Guidelines     The 2009 WHO updates led a number of local health ministries to revise       their own clinical practice guidelines.
The Ministry of Health Malaysia       and Academy of Medicine Malaysia revised its Management of Dengue         Infection in Adults, Clinical Practice Guidelines in 2010, directly       citing the three key papers from OUCRU8.
"To date, only three randomised controlled trials studying different         types of fluid regime in DSS in children aged from 5 to 15 years of age         are available2,3,5.
Our recommendations are         extrapolated from these studies.
These studies showed no clear advantage         of using any of the colloids over crystalloids in terms of the overall         outcome.
However, colloids may be preferable as the fluid of choice in         patients with intractable shock in the initial resuscitation."
8     WHO Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue 2012     The WHO released a revised Handbook for Clinical Management of Dengue       in 20129, emphasising the importance of early aggressive       resuscitation.
OUCRU's three key papers on fluid replacement regimens were       cited directly in this handbook9.
"All patients (infants, children and adults) with hypotensive shock       should be managed more vigorously...Colloids may be the preferred         choice if the BP has to be restored urgently, i.e.
in those with pulse         pressure less than 10 mmHg.
Colloids have been shown to restore the         cardiac index and reduce the level of haematocrit faster than         crystalloids in patients with intractable shock 2,3,5.
9     UpToDate Clinical Guidelines 2013     OUCRU Vietnam's three papers on fluid replacement regimens are also cited       in UpToDate, an evidence-based clinical decision support system,       which is authored by physicians to help clinicians make the right       decisions at the point of care.
Last updated in 201310, the       following recommendations appear on the UpToDate page for the Prevention         and Treatment of Dengue Virus Infection.
"There has been debate as to whether crystalloids or colloids should         be used for volume replacement in critically ill patients.
Three         randomized, blinded trials have investigated the effect of different         fluid regimens on outcome2,3,5.
The largest of these         studies was a double-blind randomized comparison of three fluids for         initial resuscitation of 512 Vietnamese children with dengue shock         syndrome5....This trial established that Ringer's lactate       was a safe, effective, and inexpensive alternative in initial       resuscitation of patients with moderate shock.
In patients with severe       shock, dextran and starch colloid solutions performed similarly, although       dextran was associated with more hypersensitivity reactions."
