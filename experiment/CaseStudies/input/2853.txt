     Incorporating engineering in education policy and school activities     In order to embed ideas in the education system, the academic team worked       with policy-makers to develop the policy implications of the research.
Throughout the project and as its findings and recommendations were       disseminated, the curriculum in Scotland was being reformed through the       Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) programme.
The project team recommended       the formal inclusion of engineering in the curriculum and worked to ensure       this through: discussions with politicians, including a visit by the       Education Minister to an EtF presentation at the Scottish Learning       Festival; discussions with senior civil servants responsible for       curriculum policy; discussions with CfE subject development officers and       with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) development officer;       membership by officials responsible for CfE programme of the EtF Advisory       Board; and policy-maker participation in EtF seminars.
As a result the       final definitive Curriculum for Excellence policy documentation and       practitioner guidance explicitly recognises the value of engineering in       school education, including Building           the Curriculum 1: The contribution of curriculum areas and Assessing           progress and achievement in learning and technologies.
As part of the project team, Hayward and MacBride engaged with       policy-makers on the implementation of strategies to ensure that the       concepts and activities central to engineering are more than policy       aspirations and are embedded in pupils' experiences.
In 2010 the Scottish       Government extended its commitment to improving science education to       explicitly include engineering in the title of its new policy, Science         and Engineering 21 &#8212; Action Plan.
This made explicit references to       the EtF findings, endorsed and adopted several of its recommendations and       made commitments to build on the work of EtF.
Michael Russell, Cabinet       Secretary for Education, launched the Action Plan on 1 March 2010 in       Balfron High School, one of the schools participating in the EtF research,       against a background of EtF experiments and in the presence of the EtF       research team.
Scotland's Chief Scientific Advisor emphasised at the       event: `It's hugely important to our world-leading research base that we       continue to attract our best young minds into science and engineering.'
Creation and development of Science, Technology, Engineering, and           Maths (STEM) Central     The EtF project found that embedding engineering in schools requires       teachers who are confident and informed about contemporary engineering.
To       that end, the Scottish Government's Action Plan committed Education       Scotland to create STEM         Central.
A one-stop website for STEM education in schools, STEM       Central provides online resources for teachers to increase their awareness       and support their teaching of engineering.
The Action Plan specifically       recommended that the outcomes of EtF be taken forward to address the need       for practical support for teachers and learners.
The Action Plan       stipulated the need for: publication of `support for staff' materials to       illustrate engineering as a context for learning through the use of       resources produced by Engineering the Future and others.
Following       discussions with Education Scotland, EtF researchers were invited to lead       the academic team developing the proposal for this portal.
The researchers then participated in the advisory committee for STEM       Central and one member was employed as project manager.
The use of       real-life examples to support learning in the sciences &#8212; a key EtF       recommendation &#8212; was adopted as a central feature of STEM Central.
Education Scotland staff have promoted STEM Central and provided cases       studies of its use.
The second report of the national Science and       Engineering Education Advisory Group welcomed the contribution of STEM       Central and recommended that Education Scotland continue to expand its       focus.
The teaching resources developed within EtF were uploaded by Education       Scotland into the Glow intranet, an online resource open to all teachers       in Scottish schools, with a direct link to the project website.
The       materials made clear links to curricular documentation to ensure       consistency with policy guidance that could be used immediately by       teachers in their classrooms.
For the brief period 01 December 2012 to 18       April 2013, the EtF website had 16,204 hits (4,608 unique hosts) and 7,627       downloads.
Extending the model into primary education     The Scottish Government commissioned Hayward, MacBride and Spencer, as       part of the academic team, to extend the EtF model to primary schools and       to develop engineering education materials for this age group.
This has       involved 50 primary teachers and 1100 pupils to date and has resulted in       significant interim impacts, including:            collaborative production of a range of teaching and support materials         with primary schools       collaborative production with engineers in industry and higher         education of video materials to support engineering education in primary         schools       introduction to primary teachers of material developed in other         collaborative research projects (e.g.
FP7 Pollen and Fibonacci)       building capacity to enable people to learn from one another: teachers         working together and teachers and engineers working together.
A number of these materials have been adapted and uploaded to the       Education Scotland STEM Central website for use by all teachers, and       Education Scotland intends to expand the range of material available       online.
Development in the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)           Qualifications     Close cooperation between secondary school, university and other       education stakeholders ensured that project findings were incorporated in       the school qualifications system.
EtF findings emphasised the importance       of research into real life issues in creating meaningful learning       experiences in the sciences and technologies.
EtF engaged with the SQA       during its development processes and included SQA participation in its       Advisory Board and in its seminars.
As such, the research findings are       reflected in a number of developments in SQA National Qualifications:            the development of SQA Advanced Higher Physics Practical         Investigations related to engineering, designed to be carried out in         schools.
the development of a model for SQA Advanced Higher Physics Practical         Investigations in which candidates worked in a university where they         used state-of-the-art electronic engineering material and drew on the         expertise of the university.
the development of a `compressed' interdisciplinary course focusing on         engineering and alternative energy through which candidates gained         Intermediate 2 awards in Physics, Technological Studies and Economics in         the time usually taken for two such courses.
introduction of a `Researching Physics' Unit in revised Physics Higher         Arrangements.
restructuring of National Qualifications (NQ) Technologies         qualifications to provide a clear and explicit progression route in         engineering from National 4 to Advanced Higher.
