     The impact of the work is in the contribution of a scientifically       rigorous approach for determining extinction risk, applicable to all       species, to the development, evaluation and implementation of the leading       measure of global species conservation status, the IUCN Red List of         Threatened Species&#8482; [A].
This is a list of the threat status of       63,837 species, including nearly all of the world's birds, mammals, and       amphibians, of which 31% are threatened with extinction [B].
The IUCN Red       List is a major data source with detailed documentation on the threats,       distribution and conservation actions for the species.
The Red List for       threatened birds has 1,132 citations in Google Scholar [10/4/13], and the       2000 Red List of threatened species also has over 1,000 citations       [10/4/12].
Alterations to the Red List are announced on an annual basis,       and always garner substantial press attention [e.g.
C].
The IUCN Red List "contains the most comprehensive assessment of the         status of the world's plants and animals" [D].
As such it "plays         an important role in multiple international agreements" [D] and       informs international policy processes including:     1) providing unbiased data on species status in order to demonstrate       progress made towards implementation of the 2020 Aichi Targets of the       Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) [B]     2) the UN Millennium Development Goals, which use the IUCN Red List to       track progress towards targets of reducing biodiversity loss [D, E]     3) National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs).
Data from       the Red List has informed the NBSAPs, which are the principal instruments       for the implementation of the CBD, of 177 countries [D]    4) multi-lateral agreements, such as the Convention on the International     Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) [D]     Non-governmental organizations also make use of the Red List.
For       example:     5) Conservation International uses data from the Red List to inform       spatial prioritization schemes and to select targets for conservation       projects [D]     6) The Zoological Society of London has developed a sampled approach to       assess the conservation status of entire taxa, such as invertebrates,       which would have been impossible without the data in the Red List [D]     7) International funding bodies, such as the Critical Ecosystem       Partnership Fund, use the Red List to assess proposals [D]     In order to produce the Red List, the IUCN Species Programme within the       IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) draws on and mobilizes a network of       IUCN members, comprising scientists and partner organizations working in       almost every country in the world, who collectively hold the most complete       scientific knowledge base on the biology and conservation status of       species.
Researchers at Imperial College, particularly those at the Centre       for Population Biology, have played a "pivotal role in both the         formulation and continual development of this list" [D].
The Chair       of the SSC of the IUCN confirms that science carried out at Imperial       formed a "fundamental part of the scientific underpinning of the Red         List Categories and Criteria, as demonstrated by the highly cited paper         on the Red List methodology by Mace et al.
(2008) [6] .
As well         as supplying much of the fundamental science, Imperial College         researchers were also deeply involved in the actual formulation of the         Red List Categories, into which species are placed, as well as the rules         used by assessors to allocate species to these Categories" [B].
Georgina Mace, Kevin Gaston and E.J.
Milner-Gulland were all part of the       group that developed and tested these Categories, which required a       trade-off between scientific rigour and usability by the conservation       community, before their general rollout [B].
The IUCN confirms that Imperial researchers have also contributed to the       "adaptation of the Red List to the regional and national scales"       [B].
This was "very much wanted by governments, who were keen to see         how their own species were faring" but was "not straightforward         because political boundaries are not often meaningful in biological         terms" [B].
The Imperial project, led by E.J.
Milner-Gulland in       Central Asia and resulting in paper [3], was "one of the earliest         large-scale exercises in developing and testing Red Lists at the         regional and national scales, and also represented a major         capacity-building effort, bringing rigorous and repeatable Red Listing         methods to the newly independent states of the Former Soviet Union.
Several of these governments now use the IUCN Red Lists as the basis for         their national conservation legislation" [B].
As an example, work       with Imperial College and in-country partners led to the application of       the IUCN Red List system of categories, criteria and methods to the       assessment of the "extinction risk of the threatened species of 5         Central Asian countries at the national, regional and global levels"       [F].
The beneficiaries of the Red List are conservation NGOs worldwide, who       use it to monitor the status of threatened species and as a component of       prioritisation and strategy-setting.
It has also been used to develop a Red         List Index (RLI), which is one of the official indicators of the       status of biodiversity used by the 193 countries that are signatories to       the Convention on Biological Diversity [G].
The RLI "is based on the         movement of species through the categories of the IUCN Red List.
The RLI         shows changes in the overall status (extinction risk) of sets of         species, with RLI values relating to the proportion of species expected         to remain extant in the near future without additional conservation         action" [H].
Governments have committed to halt the rate of loss of       biodiversity, and the RLI enables reporting on their progress towards this       target [G].
The CBD signatories committed to a reduction in the rate of       loss of biodiversity by 2010, with a set of indicators (including a Red       List index) determining whether they had reached this target.
Failure to       meet the target led to a major rethinking of both targets and indicators       and to a substantial push to improve conservation action, outlined in the       CBD's 2020 Aichi targets [I].
The RLI [A] is a key metric that spurred       this action.
The Red List (and RLI) is the primary indicator for Target 12       of the Aichi agreement: `By 2020, the extinction of known threatened         species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly         of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained' [J].
RLIs       are now widely adopted at the policy level and have been used to report on       and against various processes and indicators including the CBD's 2020       Aichi Biodiversity Targets, CBD's "2010 Biodiversity targets, the UN         Millennium Development Goals, by CITES, CMS, and for regional policy         fora (e.g., SEBI in Europe)" [G].
They have also "been well         profiled in global assessments such as the Global Biodiversity Outlook-3         and Global Environment Outlook 5" [G].
The IUCN Red List is, however, not intended just to chart the declines of       species; in addition its aim is to "raise awareness of the status and         threats to species in order to catalyse conservation action.
The key to         halting the extinction crisis is to target efforts towards eradicating         the major threats faced by species and their environment; only then can         their future be secured.
The IUCN Red List acts as a gateway to such         efforts, by providing decision makers with a goldmine of relevant         information.
As an example of successful conservation action, the         Arabian Oryx was nearly hunted to extinction, with the last wild         individual believed to have been shot in 1972.
Now thanks to concerted         conservation actions, the wild population stands at more than 1,000         individuals.
In 2011, the species was downgraded from Endangered to         Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, making history as the first species         once listed as Extinct in the Wild to have improved by three threat         categories" [B].
It is clear that the research efforts from the Centre for Population       Biology at Imperial College, which fundamentally influenced the       formulation of the Red List, as well as the associated Red List Index,       have had considerable impact.
The IUCN Red List "is the gold standard         for international assessments of species status" [B] and through the       "Red List, the work of Imperial's researchers continues to have         significant impact on conservation priority setting and decision making"       [D].
