     The underpinning research (which was not commissioned or in any other way       instigated or facilitated by the Austrian Government) made a distinct,       significant and material contribution to archaeological and heritage       management, policy and practitioners in Austria.
It has led to a       transformation of Austrian government policy by informing and influencing       policy and practice within the Austrian archaeological heritage domain and       by providing expert advice.
As a result, professionals and organizations       have introduced minimum professional standards of investigation within       archaeological fieldwork; opening up contracts through changes to the       labour market and thus contributing to preserving and conserving cultural       heritage.
Consequentially, the research contributed to wider public access       to archaeology and the heritage management process, thereby leading to       improved finds reporting and the consequential positive contribution to       heritage protection.
1) Changes to the Austrian archaeology labour market            Recommendations were distributed by Prof. Karl to, and accepted by,         several archaeological employers in Austria [5.4].
Tendering process: A draft manuscript by Karl of output 3.3 (above)         presented to the Ministry for Education, the Arts and Culture (April         2008) revealed that grants by, and contracts with, the NHA were mostly         awarded without tender to a single contractor managed by civil servants         in the archaeology department of the Agency.
This led to a ministerial         edict (2009) prohibiting the practice of awarding grants and contracts         without tender [5.1].
The resultant change is that a market that is         worth an estimated &#8364;10 Million per annum, previously closed, was opened         up to all private archaeological contractors in Austria and neighbouring         countries [5.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6].
Already, over 30 contractors have been         competing for archaeological contracts, previously inaccessible to them.
2) Changes to Austrian archaeological heritage management and policy            Minimum standards of excavation further implementing Karl's proposals         were introduced in 2010 and revised in 2012, to the benefit of Austrian         archaeologists and archaeology students [5.1, 5.4].
Unwarranted restriction on metal detectorists: one aspect of the         underpinning research was to highlighting the heavy-handed         implementation of heritage protection laws.
Karl identified problematic         issues with finds-reporting legislation, which led to a dialogue between         the metal detectorist community in Austria and the NHA [5.1-5.3], the         founding of Netzwerk Geschichte &#214;sterreich [5.2], the first Austrian         association for metal detectorists, and the first code of practice for         responsible metal detecting (in 2011) [5.2].
Inconsistencies in awarding of excavation permits were addressed, and         a more transparent system was introduced during the census period [5.1,         5.6].
Consequently, there has been a transformation in heritage         management that has impacted the entire Austrian archaeology domain.
3 Changes to public perception of archaeological heritage management            The impacts detailed in 1) and 2) have led to a transformation in         attitudes by Austrian archaeologists towards the NHA, and heritage         management practices more generally: Prior to these changes, the Agency         was perceived as unapproachable [5.1, 5.3, 5.4].
Following         recommendations by Karl, the changes made in 1) and 2) led to more         positive attitudes, especially amongst archaeologists.
Public relations and awareness initiatives: In an explicit move by the         Agency to improve its image, an annual national discussion day with the         archaeological community was established (2010); academic and public         debates were initiated on the theory of heritage management (2010) on         the relationship with metal detectorists (2011), and on heritage values         (2013) [5.1, 5.3].
A broader dialogue between archaeologists and metal         detectorists began informally in 2010, collaborative projects started in         2011 in a bid to highlight responsible heritage management, and to         better engage with the wider public [5.1-5.3].
A special advisory group         regarding metal detecting was convened for the first time, under the         aegis of the NHA, and took place on 5/4/13 [5.1, 5.3].
One change to         public policy resulting from this was to start a series of information         and discussion events with the wider public with Prof. Karl as one of         the invited speakers [5.1-5.3].
He has meanwhile become an official         member of this advisory group.
Beyond Austria: In an international context, specifically Britain,         Poland and USA, the Austrian debate and resultant changes, initiated by         Karl's research, have been widely read and are being used to inform         views on benefits and disadvantages of restrictive legislation on metal         detecting of metal detectorists, heritage managers, the public with an         interest in archaeology and archaeological heritage management [5.2,         5.7-5.10].
Reach:     This research has affected the Austrian archaeological heritage domain as       a whole, but specifically, the entire archaeological and heritage       profession in Austria: metal detectorists, archaeology students and       contractors (both in Austria and neighbouring countries) and heritage       managers and metal-detecting and collecting lobbyists in Austria, Britain,       Poland, and the USA.
Significance:     This research highlighted that a heavy-handed implementation of heritage       protection laws mainly serves to exclude the public from participation in       archaeology and results in more negative than positive effects, and is       used in the debate on archaeological heritage protection by heritage       managers and metal-detecting and collecting lobbyists in Britain, Poland,       and the USA [5.7-5.10].
This research has transformed policy and       activities of the NHA and for the first time opened up an entire a       contractor's market worth an estimated &#8364; 10 million per annum (in Austria       and neighbouring countries) [5.1, 5.4, 5.6]; and directly led to dialogue       between metal detectorists and archaeologists with better heritage       protection as a result [5.1-5.3].
The prohibition of public participation       has also been discussed by the Board of Europae Archaeologiae         Consilium, in its recent Vienna meeting [5.1].
Discussion of the       research outcomes at this international level of policy, further       illustrates the significance of Karl's findings for archaeological and       heritage management policy across Europe.
