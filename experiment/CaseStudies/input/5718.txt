     The novel technologies initiated in the DBB, together with subsequent       research involving DBB staff, has (i) provided proof of principle for the       application of Atlas Genetics technology to clinical diagnostics (ii)       assisted in capitalization of Atlas (iii) led to expansion of Atlas       Genetics activity to include bacterial and fungal pathogen targets, for       which clinical evaluation has been reached (Chlamydia, Trichomonas)       or is planned (Candida).
The Atlas CEO commented:     "The creation of Atlas Genetics was only possible thanks to research         carried out in the Department of Biology and Biochemistry (DBB).
University of Bath support came as: funding (departmental BBSRC         studentship and University Sulis Fund); encouragement from the incumbent         HoD (Prof. S. Reynolds) and provision of laboratory space.
Early patents         to Molecular Sensing arose during this period.
Long term and ongoing         collaborations with academic staff, in particular Dr A. Wheals, have         contributed to the development of intellectual property and essential         capitalization.
Atlas funded a BBSRC Case studentship to DBB in 2006 and         the resulting Candida research confirmed the speed of the technology and         its ability to be adapted to detect general groups (pan-fungal probe)         and distinct pathogen species.
Exquisite sensitivity, even           from blood samples was a crucial demonstration.
Multiplexing will enable simultaneous detection of diverse pathogens.
Associated DBB links with the National Mycology Reference Laboratory         Bristol provided critical access to and advice from clinicians.
Candida,         as a major cause of sepsis, was used as one of several targets when         seeking venture capital, before the eventual focus post-2011 on         Chlamydia as STDs grew in importance.
Candida remains a future         potential Atlas target for hospital acquired infections and Atlas         remains committed to providing diagnostics solutions for sepsis.
This novel technology will enter clinical trials in 2014 and we are         confident that its speed and accuracy means that it will change         practices by allowing point of care application to result in direct and         rapid treatment of patients" [A].
Impacts from this work: company, investment, people and a new         technology            A spin-out or new business has been created [B].
Jobs have been         created.
Industry (including overseas industry) has invested in research and         development.
Highly skilled people have taken up specialist roles in companies       The health sectors in USA and Europe are trialling a new technology          Background     Molecular Sensors Ltd was the initial University of Bath spin-out       company, formed in 1996, listed as Molecular Sensing plc in 1999, then       sold in 2004 to the US-based diagnostics business Osmetech plc.
Atlas       Genetics was launched with &#163;500,000 initial funding, 50% of which came in       part from the Sulis Seedcorn Fund, established by the University of Bath       to provide support for new businesses.
Atlas was founded as a spin-out       from the University and Osmetech plc in 2005.
In 2007 Atlas completed       Series A financing of &#163;2 million and the company relocated to a 2,500 sq.
ft. site on a business park close to Bath (Trowbridge, Wiltshire).
The       number of full time staff increased to 12 and a commercial programme to       develop the Atlas system was initiated.
STDs and sepsis and in particular       Candida, were proposed as key targets to potential investors.
Impact &#8212; development of the company arising from DBB underpinning         research     In 2010 Atlas obtained a grant from the Regional Development Agency grant       for the development of a Syphilis assay.
Atlas was also awarded a       Technology Strategy Board grant for &#163;1.6m in partnership with Randox       Laboratories and the Health Protection Agency (HPA).
In early 2011 Atlas       secured &#163;1.5m Series B funding from Consort Medical plc and other       investors in a synergistic partnership, to utilise the plastic device       manufacturing expertise of one of Consort's group companies, Bespak Europe       Ltd. Atlas then raised &#163;16.9 million later in 2011 from a syndicate of new       and existing investors led by Novartis Venture Funds to further develop       the ioTM system, including a molecular Chlamydia test.
The new investors in this Series B financing are Novartis Venture Funds,       Life Sciences Partners (LSP), BB Biotech Ventures and Johnson &amp;       Johnson Development Corporation.
Atlas then relocated in 2011 to new 9,500 sq.
ft. premises and following       an expansion programme has increased the number of full-time staff to 35       (and 3 part time).
Most have higher educational degrees in science,       engineering or business.
Alistair Muir, a PhD student in DBB is now an       employee of Atlas Genetics (from 2012).
Other Atlas investors include the       South West Ventures Fund, Finance South West Growth Fund, Braveheart       Ventures, Sulis Investment Management Fund, GEIF Ventures, Consort Medical       plc, and private investors.
Atlas is currently venture capital funded and       to date has raised more than &#163;23m.
Dr Clarkson has been invited to       numerous investment conferences [C].
Fifteen patents have been granted and       nine applications are pending to date [D].
Impact &#8212; the Route to Clinical Implementation 	Since 2008, the Atlas ioTM system has been in further       development and clinical testing, which has established its value in       diagnosis of a range of infectious diseases in humans, including Chlamydia,       Gonorrhoea, MRSA, and bacterial meningitis.
Highlights include:            Clinical evaluation and trials for Chlamydia and Trichomonas         infections Chlamydia infection is one of the most common STDs,         causing an estimated &gt;95 million new cases globally of genital Chlamydia         infection every year, with prevalence rates in young people at 5-10%.
Rapid diagnosis is key to preventing disease spread.
An independent         evaluation was performed by Johns Hopkins University, Department of         Medicine (Baltimore, USA).
Results showed the clinical sensitivity and         specificity of the ioTM rapid Chlamydia trachomatis         assay compared with slower, laboratory based Gen-Probe Aptima Combo 2&#8482;         and the Roche Cobas Amplicor&#8482; as comparator tests.
These clinical tests         yielded impressive results that supported the adoption of the test in         clinical environments and led to a collaborative agreement between Atlas         and Johns Hopkins.
The published collaboration showed sensitivity and         specificity of &gt;98% [E]; it was developed further for Trichomonas,         showing sensitivity and specificity &gt;95% [F].
Trichomonas           vaginalis is the most prevalent, curable STD in the world, causing         around 248 million new cases annually [G].
Trichomoniasis can lead to         vaginitis, cervicitis, and urethritis, infection during pregnancy can         lead to complications and can increase the risk of contracting HIV and         other STDs.
Clinical trials coordinated by Public Health England for the Atlas Chlamydia         detection product are due to commence late in 2013 with the final         clinical evaluation in March 2014 [A].
The platform is scheduled to         launch within Europe with CE certification in 2014, followed by roll-out         in the USA pending regulatory approval.
Development of tests with Candida [B] will follow the success         with Chlamydia.
Impact &#8212; Scope for Growth     The in vitro diagnostics (IVD) market is $42 billion and growing       at 6% annum.
The most rapidly growing areas are molecular diagnostics       (valued at $3b and growing at 15% pa) and the point of contact (PoC)       market (valued at $2.5b and growing at 12% pa).
Atlas's focus on PoC STD       testing, embraces both these fast growing areas of diagnostics and offers       substantial routes for expanded future impact in terms of both economic       and clinical benefits.
