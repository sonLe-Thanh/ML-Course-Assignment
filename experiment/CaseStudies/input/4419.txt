     White's research on the Roman city of Wroxeter and the region has had       significant impact on: the       running and management of the site; English Heritage policy; education and       public discourse; and       on economic prosperity within the region.
White's research directly influenced the running and management of the       site by English Heritage.
Through his research, White has become universally regarded as the leading       authority on the       Roman city of Wroxeter and the region, and so he was commissioned by       English Heritage to       formulate the site's Management Plan between December 2008 and June 2010.
The Management       Plan continues to provide a guiding framework for engagement with the         site at all levels and       this has been implemented through the creation of a Conservation       Management Plan [see source       1 below] which is scheduled to be revised every five years.
The Management       Plan followed the       newly introduced English Heritage document Conservation Principles.
Policy and Guidance, using       a consultation process involving negotiation with all stakeholders ranging       from the local       community, landowners, businesses and councillors, through to Natural       England, the Environment       Agency and the international academic community (through a one-day       conference held at the       Society of Antiquaries in London, February 2009).
This process, along with       the implementation of       the Management Plan through the Conservation Management Plan [1], is         now being         implemented using the same model across the other 400+ properties       owned by English       Heritage.
The research also informed Education and Public Discourse, both       by enhancing the running of       the site (through the Management Plan) and through the generation of       outputs intended for public       consumption.
Following the success of the research outlined above, English       Heritage       commissioned two outputs; an online, digital resource and a guidebook [2].
The first of these was       commissioned in August 2010 and led to the creation de novo of a       research resource hosted by       English Heritage via their website, providing an outline of the history,       significance and research       related to the site, in addition to a comprehensive list of sources       available to members of the       public.
The resource went online in April 2011 as part of English       Heritage's Portico portal [3] which       is considered as the first port of call for anyone researching their sites       (approximately 400 in total).
The second output, commissioned in December 2009, was a popular 10,000       word guidebook       based on the results of the research outlined above.
This book went on       sale in August 2012, with       nearly 1000 copies sold up until March 2013 [4].
The new understanding of       the chronology of the       Roman city of Wroxeter developed during the research outlined above also directly         informed the         creation of reconstructions of the site commissioned by Shropshire       Museums Service which       provide illustrations in the new Roman galleries in the Shrewsbury Museum       (opening 2013).
Together these provide up-to-date research materials for all in accessible       formats presenting the       results of the research within the context of a narrative of Roman Britain       and the Empire.
Through       his research, White has advised on the exhibition in Shrewsbury Museum       that combines a digital       resource, a guidebook and museum content, the research is having a       significant impact on       education and public understanding of the site and region.
"The support of       the leading academic in       the archaeology and interpretation of Viroconium has ensured that the         gallery will be of both         national and international significance and an integral contribution to         our cultural heritage"       [5].
In addition to public engagement, the research outlined above has had an       impact on local       economic prosperity through increased public awareness and visitors to         the site.
White's       research resulted in him being consulted on and assisting in the       production of Channel 4       television's `Rome Wasn't Built in a Day' which focused on the       construction of a Roman villa at       Wroxeter using traditional techniques.
White's research directly         informed the design of the villa       and he was consulted on research about the site and on Roman building       technologies.
This       participation in the filming has fed directly into the continuing research       on the site, aiding       understanding of the footprint of Roman buildings there, and directly         informing the presentation         of the site to the public both onsite and through the guidebook       where the implications of the       project are discussed.
The programme was watched by 1.377m viewers [6] and       resulted in a 177%       increase in visitors to the site during 2011 [7].
This increase in tourism       will have had an economic       impact locally.
