     The major impact of the research has been the implementation of Flexible       Sigmoidoscopy as a       single examination at age 55 as part of the National Bowel Cancer       Screening Programme.
Following the publication of the trial outcomes in the Lancet in April       2010, and the results of the       successful pilot programme in the Journal of Medical Screening in June       2010, the Prime Minister       David Cameron announced in October 2010 that once-only FS screening would       be included in the       NHS National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme.
&#163;60m was pledged over the       next four years to       introduce this latest cancer screening technology, with estimates that       flexible sigmoidoscopy could       save 3,000 lives a year [a].
Then Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley       announced that pilot schemes       for the new screening programme would begin in spring 2011 [b],       subject to approval by the UK       National Screening Committee [c].
The existing NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is based on biennial       faecal occult blood       testing using the guaiac-based test (gFOBT), with an immunochemical test       (iFOBT) being piloted       in 2014.
An `options appraisal' of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening       modalities commissioned by       the NHS Cancer Screening Programme in 2004 from SCHARR (University of       Sheffield School of       Health and Related Research) had used the baseline data from the FS trial,       and concluded that FS       screening was likely to be highly cost-effective compared with other       methods because it reduced       incidence of CRC and therefore the costs of the programme would be likely       to be offset by a       substantial reduction in the costs of treatment.
SCHARR repeated the       analysis in 2012 using the       full FS trial outcome data and concluded that: `For a strategy of         one-off FS screening, the optimal         effectiveness (QALYS) is achieved with a one-off FS screen in the age         range 55-60.
The most         cost-effective strategy was FS at age 55 followed by biennial iFOBT         screening for ages 56-74,         irrespective of whether the comparator was the current screening         programme of biennial gFOBT         60-74 or no screening.
This strategy was associated with the greatest         net monetary benefit and         also the greatest reduction in CRC incidence, CRC mortality and CRC         treatment costs'.
The report       also concluded that `it may be cost-effective to spend considerable         resources on increasing         screening awareness' which has been a parallel focus of our       research, with a particular emphasis       on promoting awareness in order to reduce socioeconomic disparities in CRC       screening uptake       [d].
Professor Wardle now has programme grant funding from NIHR       trial for a trial (ASCEND) of       methods to reduce socioeconomic disparities in CRC screening uptake as       Co-PI with Professor       Rosalind Raine (also UCL).
In January 2011, the Department of Health's document Improving         Outcomes: A Strategy for         Cancer set out the plans for FS screening [e].
Implementation of the FS programme began in early       2011, with three `pathfinder' screening sites set up to finalise the       invitation and organisation       procedures [f].
One of the centres explored a novel method of       invitation, but the conclusion from       the 4,022 invitations across the three sites was that the invitation       system Wardle and her team had       developed in the FS Trial and applied in the Demonstration Pilot       (comprising a `flyer' giving brief       information about the programme, followed by a dated and timed invitation       that could be confirmed,       changed or cancelled, followed by a self-administered enema with detailed       information about the       test), was likely to be most successful.
Plans are now finalised for national implementation, and six sites began       screening between March       and July 2013 to finalise invitation procedures and patient information       materials [g].
Professor       Wardle's group has been commissioned to carry out real-time audits of       uptake, patient-reported       outcomes 24 hours after the test, and patient satisfaction at 12 weeks       when any follow-up       procedures should be completed, in the starter sites.
This will allow       rapid identification of any       problems and make it possible to implement small modifications to optimise       procedures in advance       of the national rollout.
To the end of July, around 2,220 people had received FS screening between       the pathfinder and       starter sites.
Data from the FS trial indicated that one colorectal cancer       diagnosis is prevented for       each 191 people screened.
So even with the small number of people screened       so far, it is likely       that 11 of these terrible diagnoses have been prevented [h].
