     Research insights impacted on policy within the two themes outlined in       Section 2, the main beneficiaries being central government regeneration       policy makers and advisers and also lobbying organisations and think       tanks.
First, our access to longitudinal change data across the 39 NDC       regeneration areas, combined with evidence on individual residents       therein, allowed us more accurately to monetise both the costs and the         benefits of ABIs.
This work has had an impact on central government.
This methodology based on shadow pricing was first published in the final       suite of NDC evaluation reports, and then subsequently incorporated into Communities         and Local Government's (CLG): Valuing the benefits of regeneration:         Economic Paper 7 Vol 1: Final Report (para 7.69) (S2).
A       communication (24/3/10) from the then Head of Neighbourhoods and       Regeneration Analysis Unit at CLG indicated that the then permanent       secretary 'was particularly interested in the shadow pricing methodology       and keen that we have a debate on its application to regeneration'.
In       addition the then key evaluation officer in CLG commented that 'the NDC       Evaluation made important methodological strides in valuing the benefits       of the programme in a way that had never been done before.
The findings       were used by the Department to analyse and prioritise future spend.
The       methodological learning gleaned through the NDC Evaluation has since       informed analysis relating to similar Government programmes where       monetising hard-to-value benefits was crucial' (S1).
The potential use of       this methodology was in turn referred to in an HM Treasury and         Department of Work and Pensions 2011 Report: Valuation techniques for         social cost benefit analysis (Table p.63) (S3).
A 2011 House of         Commons Communities and Local Government Committee: Regeneration Report       (par.44) (S7) using written evidence from Lawless, also referred to the       importance of formal evaluation in assessing regeneration programmes and       in ensuring lessons were retained from previous ABIs (par.
65).
Second, research insights emerging from this team enhanced understanding       of the nature of outcome change associated with regeneration       schemes.
Research established that regeneration is likely to be associated       with relatively modest area-level changes, most of which reflects improved       perceptions of the neighbourhood and its environment, rather than positive       changes with regard to people-based outcomes relating to, say, jobs,       education, or health.
These findings were acknowledged in the government's       2008 'Framework for Regeneration' (CLG) (S4), which propounded a       more economically orientated approach to deprived areas than hitherto,       partly because, although the NDC evaluation had shown positive change       across some outcomes, this did not extend to growth in jobs (p.3/4).
Research findings into the scale of outcome change associated with       regeneration schemes were disseminated to key government policy       specialists at sessions held at CLG on the 25/1/10, 15/3/10, 27/4/10,       28/5/10 and 8/6/10.
In all these were attended by around 150       representatives from five government departments (CLG, Home Office,       Business Innovation &amp; Skills, HM Treasury, and the Cabinet Office), as       well as key analysts from third arm agencies and research funding       organisations.
Attendees included the then Director General Communities,       CLG, and the Head of Community Analysis, CLG.
Lawless was recruited to two       of the then government's expert panels in Housing and Communities and in       Neighbourhoods, Cities and Regions.
In that role he produced a think-piece       for government reflecting on research evidence (published 1/3/11): Regeneration&#8212;What         are the problems and what can we achieve in addressing them?
These       research findings were in turn to influence two national committees.
First, whilst research showed only limited changes in relation to       employment, it also identified the useful role which job and training       schemes could play in integrating services at the local level.
These key       messages were developed in Lawless's presentation (11/12/08) to members of       the Houghton Review on Tackling Worklessness, which were later       incorporated into that Review's final report (p. 24) (S5).
Second,       Lawless's presentation (2/7/09) to the Marmot Review into Health         Inequalities also pointed out the limited scale of people-based       change associated with area-regeneration programmes.
This finding was       reiterated in that Review's subsequent report, which concluded that NDC       evidence suggested the neighbourhood may not be an especially sensible       scale at which to plan for people-based outcomes, such as job growth       (p.137) (S6).
Research by the team also identified the limited scale of outcomes       associated with community engagement.
These findings were referred to in       both the 2008 White Paper 'Communities in control: real people, real         power' (p.70) (S8), and in a House of Commons Communities and         Local Government Committee: Regeneration Report (par.
75) (S7).
The       implications of these findings on debates surrounding the 'Big Society'       were in turn explored with CLG staff (26/1/11), including the then Head of       the Communities Analysis.
In particular, the research team stressed the       importance of data pointing to the complexities in achieving robust       outcome change from community-based initiatives with regard to indicators       such as trust in institutions and residents thinking they can influence       local decisions.
The implications of these research findings in relation       to the community dimension, in turn impacted on lobbying organisations and       think tanks.
One nationally important lobbying organisation, the Royal       Society of Arts (RSA), used these findings to argue for community       engagement best being seen in terms of connectivity, rather than taking       place within defined 'spaces' (P.10-11) (S11).
Similarly, research into       community outcomes from local initiatives informed debate amongst       think-tanks.
One, Demos, supporting the broad concept of a more loosely       structured 'Big Society', used these findings to argue that the NDC       initiative lacked effective community engagement (p.36) (S9).
However,       another more critical of the 'Big Society', Labourlist, used evidence to       suggest successes associated with the NDC Programme occurred exactly       because of its substantial funding base (S10).
