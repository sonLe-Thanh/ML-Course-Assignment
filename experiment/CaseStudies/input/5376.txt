     Background     Argenta came into being when a team of two dozen highly experienced       scientists from the former Aventis Pharmaceuticals (formerly Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc       Rorer) Research Centre in Dagenham, led by Dr Christopher Newton set out       to raise money to become a pharmaceutical contract research organisation       (CRO).
Argenta Discovery was formed through a merger with an       Imperial-founded spin-out company, ChemMedICa, in addition to the       scientific know-how generated and working relationships formed between       Imperial and Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc Rorer forged through the TeknoMed project.
Argenta Discovery was fully funded in 2000 with &#163;7.2m of private       investment.
Aventis assisted the fledgling company by allowing the team to       use the Dagenham facility whilst the Argenta Harlow laboratories were       constructed, by awarding the first large research contract to Argenta, and       by allowing the purchase of all of the equipment at the closing Dagenham       site (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/college.asp?P=2146).
Two Imperial scientists trained in the Barrett laboratories during the       TeknoMed Project, Drs.
Jullian Henschke and Ray Boffey joined Argenta in       its early stages and, later, Drs.
Fabien Roussel, Robert Pace, and Sarah       Major joined the company having gained PhD/postdoctoral training in the       Barrett group.
In 2007, Argenta signed the largest-ever pre-clinical deal       worldwide with AstraZeneca for the co-development of new therapeutic       agents for respiratory diseases.
This collaboration with up-front and       milestone payments is potentially worth in excess of $500M plus royalties.
Scientific impact     The research carried out at Imperial College led to the highly favourable       environment in which ChemMedICa and, subsequently, Argenta came into       being, and has had wide impact in the chemical sciences.
Taken together,       publications in learned journals have been cited 500 times, with 100 of       these citations during 2008-present.
Commercial impact     Argenta Discovery continues to be very successful in both highly       profitable CRO work and in the discovery of new drugs to address unmet       medical need in respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive       pulmonary disease (COPD) (see: Current Opinion in Pharmacology 2009,       9 231).
This has led to the granting of a substantial number of patents:     Argenta patents, 2008&#8212;     WO 2010015818 (Feb 11 2010), WO 2009060209 (May 14 2009), WO 2009060203       (May 14 2009), WO 2009013444 (Jan 29 2009), WO 2008122784 (Oct 16 2008),       WO 2008119917 (Oct 9 2008), WO 2008096094 (Aug 14 2008), WO 2008017824       (Feb 14 2008), WO 2008017827 (Feb 14 2008)     In addition, Argenta has entered into major collaborations with global       pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including Aventis, Lundbeck,       GSK, Novartis, Genentech, Domantis, Pharmagene.
In 2010, Argenta Discovery sold the contract business and company name       for &#8364;16.5 million [A] in cash to Biofocus Galapagos to form Biofocus       Galapagos Argenta.
At the time, Argenta had 140 employees.
The combined       division is "one of the world's largest drug discovery service         organizations, with 390 employees, an estimated &#8364;70 million in annual         turnover and significant profitability" [A].
The acquisition also       added additional capacity and drug discovery capabilities to the Galapagos       Group.
Argenta's respiratory development programs continued as a       new privately held company, Pulmagen Therapeutics [A].
Reporting on the       deal, Onno van de Stolpe, CEO of Galapagos said: "today's [2010]         acquisition of the services division of Argenta, one of premier players         in the segment, creates a true powerhouse in the drug discovery services         market.
It also provides Galapagos R&amp;D with additional capacity,         capabilities and access to respiratory models for our internal R&amp;D         efforts" [A].
Galapagos acquired Argenta Discovery's "medicinal         chemistry, computational chemistry, ADME [absorption, distribution,         metabolism, and excretion] and biology activities as well as the         respiratory models and pharmacokinetics operations through a &#8364;16.5         million cash payment, approximately 4.7 x EBIT or 1.2 x annual revenue"       [A].
The Group's combined service division operations, which will operate       under the BioFocus and Argenta brand names, were expected to achieve &#8364;70       million in 2010 revenues (including ~&#8364;11 million in service contracts by       Galapagos) [A].
Post-acquisition, "Galapagos' service division         operations will employ 390 staff in the UK, Switzerland and the US"       [A].
In 2011 Argenta signed an integrated service agreement with Pulmagen       Therapeutics: "Galapagos NV (Euronext: GLPG) announced today that its         service division Argenta has signed a subcontracting agreement with         Pulmagen Therapeutics Limited to perform integrated services on two         respiratory projects.
Under the terms of the agreement, Argenta will be         eligible to receive up to &#163;6 million (&#8364;7 million) in fee-for-service         payments over two years, with the possibility to extend" [B].
Also       in 2011, Argenta and BioFocus announced a two-year extension of a drug       discovery collaboration with Genetech: "Galapagos NV (Euronext: GLPG)         announced today that its service division Argenta has extended its         integrated contract drug discovery agreement with Genentech, a member of         the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY).
Total potential value of         the contract extension is up to &#163;21.5 million (&#8364;23.4 million).
This is         the third such extension since the agreement was announced in December         2005.
The agreement covers a number of drug discovery programs that         utilize Argenta's expertise in computer-aided drug design (CADD),         medicinal chemistry, in vitro biology and screening to discover new         chemical entities acting against undisclosed drug targets defined by         Genentech" [C].
Biofocus Galapagos Argenta continued to expand and is now a significant       employer of PhD organic chemists in the UK (2010 CRO turnover &gt;&#8364;135M       [A]).
The clinical development of several potential new medicines to treat       COPD, asthma, allergic diseases and cystic fibrosis is currently being       taken forward in phases 1 and 2 by Pulmagen Therapeutics, the company       which owns the complete drug pipeline from Argenta Discovery [D, E].
This       activity too has led to the granting of patents:     Argenta-AZ patents     WO 2009139709 (Nov 19 2009), WO 2009138707 (Nov 19 2009), WO 2009139710       (Nov 19 2009), WO 2010019099 (Feb 18 2010), WO 2010018352 (Feb 18 2010),       WO 2008149110 (Dec 11 2008), WO 2008149053 (Dec 11 2008), WO 2008096127       (Aug 14 2008), WO 2008096129 (Aug 14 2008), WO 2008096136 (Aug 14 2008),       WO 2008096126 (Aug 14 2008)     Argenta-Pulmagen patents     WO 2008135537 (Nov 13 2008)
