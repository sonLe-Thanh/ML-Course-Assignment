     Adoption of FAST into national guidelines     In July 2008, FAST was included in NICE clinical guideline 68: "In         people with sudden onset of neurological symptoms a validated tool, such         as FAST (Face Arm Speech Test [sic]), should be used outside         hospital to screen for a diagnosis of stroke or TIA [transient       ischemic attack: a mini-stroke]" (EV b, pg.
8).
The 2012 National Clinical Guideline for stroke (EV c) addresses both of       the major barriers to rapid stroke care, recommending first that "All         patients seen with an acute neurological syndrome suspected to be a         stroke should be transferred directly to a specialised hyperacute stroke         unit".
Secondly, R2 is included as the sole source of evidence for       the recommendation that "People seen by ambulance staff outside         hospital, who have sudden onset of neurological symptoms, should be         screened using a validated tool (eg FAST) to diagnose stroke."
The       guideline also states that "The FAST is accepted as the tool of choice         for prehospital clinicians."
The effect of Newcastle work of re-organisation of stroke services     As a direct result of Newcastle research that demonstrated the       effectiveness of sending acute-stroke patients directly to a dedicated       unit, stroke services in two cites were reconfigured.
In December 2008, a       new model was implemented to deliver acute stroke services in the Greater       Manchester region, which led to a substantial increase in thrombolysis       treatments given: from 10 eligible patients in 2006, 12 in 2007, to 20 in       2008 and 69 in 2009 (EV e, pg.
19).
Between 2009 and 2010 a new model was       introduced in London that included eight hyper-acute stroke units (HASUs)       and in February 2010 stroke care in North Central London was merged into       one HASU to deliver a single standard of care.
According to latest       available figures, thrombolysis rates increased in North Central London       from 3.5% in February 2009 to 12% by October 2010, and mortality rate       decreased from above 30% in 2006 to below 10% in 2011 (EV d, pg.
7).
Administration of thrombolytics within 4.5 hours has been found to be       significantly associated with a favourable outcome, in terms of measures       of disability such as the modified Rankin scale and functional scales such       as the Glasgow Outcome Scale (Hacke et al.
2008, DOI       10.1056/NEJMoa0804656).
However, this same study found no significant       difference in mortality rate between the group treated with thrombolytics       and placebo, a plausible explanation being that the decrease in mortality       rate seen in North Central London was due to more rapid transport to       hospital.
This reconfiguration of stroke care led to NHS London and the Greater       Manchester and Cheshire Cardiac and Stroke Network winning the 2009 and       2010 Health Service Journal (HSJ) award for Clinical Service Redesign,       respectively (EV d, e).
Adoption of FAST as a national campaign     The effectiveness of FAST in paramedic use led to its adoption as a       public recognition instrument.
The first body to make use of the validated       FAST test was the Stroke Association, who state on their website that "Professor         Gary Ford's team at Newcastle University showed that ambulance         paramedics can use the Face Arm Speech Time (FAST) test to recognise         when someone is having a stroke.
The study, funded by The Stroke         Association, found that paramedics using the FAST test could identify a         stroke just as accurately as specially trained doctors."
(EV f).
The work went on to inform the Department of Health's nationwide Act FAST       campaign, to help members of the public recognise the signs of stroke and       to act quickly to ensure that thrombolytics are administered within the       short window of opportunity.
This campaign, originally launched in       February 2009, has seen several waves of activity, the latest in March       2013.
The memorable imagery includes the use of a "flaming head" and has       appeared on national TV, posters and bus stops (EV g).
The Director of       Research and Information at the Stroke Association states: "I write to         confirm that the work you did in assessing the reliability of using FAST         by paramedics was key to the Stroke Association's decision to use FAST         in our bus stop campaign and then in the Department of Health using it         in the flaming head campaign."
(EV h).
Poster from the Department of Health's national FAST campaign,launched in 2009 (EV g)      A National Audit Office report from February 2010 (EV i, pg 22-23) stated       that the Act FAST campaign had been seen by 92% of the 2000 people that       responded to a survey on its use.
The same survey found that from before       to after the campaign, public awareness of the symptoms of stroke       increased from 15% to 82%.
The report also states that an audit of one       hyper-acute stroke centre saw a 171% increase in the number of patients       presenting within three hours of a stroke between 2008 and 2009.
Following       a renewal of the Act FAST campaign in 2012, there was a 25% rise in       stroke-related 999 calls and a 19% increase in stroke sufferers being seen       more quickly (EV g).
As a result of the re-organisation of stroke services and the       introduction of the Act FAST campaign, thrombolysis treatment for those       stroke patients who will benefit have increased nationwide fivefold       between 2006-7 and 2008-9 (EV i, pg.
24).
The thrombolysis intervention       rate has continued to grow: from less than 1% in 20051, to 8%       by late 2011, according to the Stroke Improvement National Audit Programme       (SINAP, EV j).
