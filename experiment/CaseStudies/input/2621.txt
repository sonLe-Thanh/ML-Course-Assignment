     The National Theatre of Scotland's (NTS) production of Euripides' Bacchae       opened the 2007 Edinburgh International Festival, playing to 13,553       people.
In 2008, the production transferred to London and to New York's       Lincoln Centre, subsequently returning to Scotland with a touring       production.
The production was a critical and popular success for the NTS,       selling out even before its first Edinburgh performance.
The production       had substantial national and international exposure, reaching audiences of       33,529 in the UK and 9,338 in New York, where it opened the Lincoln Centre       Festival with a nine-day run at the Rose Theatre (2-11 July 2008).
Ruffell was commissioned by NTS to produce a literal translation from the       Greek with commentary to allow the playwright, David Greig, to create a       version that would be readily understood by modern audiences without       departing radically from the meaning of the play.
Existing translations       tended towards a very formal style of English, whereas the producers       wanted to create a modern version which would be accessible to a general       audience, rather than an `archaeological' relic of an ancient drama.
Playwright David Greig commented:     I was very keen to understand what an Athenian audience might have         been expected to experience when they watched this play.
And Ian was so         knowledgeable about all of that.
It was as close as I could get to         having Euripides available to me at the end of a phone.
Ruffell's research looks at the power of comedy in the play and the       impact this would have had on ancient audiences, and his ongoing role as       academic advisor on the script and at rehearsals enabled the scriptwriter       to strip back the formality and bring the comedy into focus without losing       the meaning of the lines.
His aim was to keep the flavour of the play's       word order and line structure, which can be difficult to acquire from an       off-the-shelf translation.
The critical reception demonstrates both audience appreciation of the       powerful humour of the script and the acting, and a sense as a critic that       comedy, gender and self-reflexivity were utterly unexpected in a Greek       play, with the New York Times, for instance, calling it "playfully       irreverent".
Many reviewers commented on a perceived imbalance between the       comedic and the tragic, but Ruffell argued that this was due to their       preconceptions of the play.
As he explained in a 2010 interview with the       Open University, the comedy, violence and the gender play were not modern       additions, but were present in the original text, obscured by the serious,       tragedic production style of most performances.
These same critics,       however, overwhelmingly give positive reviews; it was described as       "lively, funny and rich in invention, the production keeps you entertained       almost to the end" by the New York Times.
For playwright David Greig, Ruffell's contribution was instrumental to       being able to craft the play because:     ...the translation attended so plainly and in such detail to the         meaning of the text that I felt as fully aware as I could be of the         play's ambiguities, cultural contexts and ironies.
Reading a section         with [Ian Ruffell's] notes and references I felt as though I knew the         play nearly as well as if I were reading the original Greek.
I was very         keen to understand what an Athenian audience might have been expected to         experience when they watched this play.
The contribution of professional classicists in advising theatrical       productions has been investigated in a number of studies (outwith the       University of Glasgow) in the field of reception of ancient drama, in       which the example of the NTS Bacchae has figured strongly.
In The         Public Value of the Humanities, Mary Beard cites Ruffell's work with       The Bacchae as an example of academic-theatre collaboration and       notes that it takes years to begin to thoroughly understand a Greek play       due to their cultural density, "deeply embedded in the society, politics,       myth and religion of the ancient Greeks", hence the need for an advisor.
She goes on:     The National Theatre of Scotland's Bacchae similarly exploited new         academic approaches to the play... the result challenged the old         familiar play about madness and possession, to suggest a story of the         collapse of identities, especially sexual ones &#8212; in an extraordinarily         powerful, disconcertingly modern, as well as authentically ancient,         production.
