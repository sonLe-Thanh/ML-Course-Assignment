     The search for an understanding of the Universe as a whole (Astrophysics)       and of its fundamental constituents (Particle and Nuclear Physics) holds a       special fascination for young people and the public at large.
This is       employed as a vehicle for public engagement and education in an extensive       outreach programme, closely linked to the School's research activities in       the relevant areas.
The unique features of this outreach programme are the       size and diversity (both in terms of types of engagement and the subject       range).
Engagement is via science exhibitions, development of novel practical and       computer based demonstrations through to conveying science through art and       theatre &#8212; leadership recognized through a STFC Public Engagement       Fellowship.
Birmingham is in the top two recipients of STFC Small Awards       for Public Engagement, with 17 since their inception (1999), demonstrating       sustained leadership.
Since 2008 there have been 5 awards to Birmingham in       particle physics; more than any other UK institution.
The School is unique       in having led two multi-institute exhibits in the past three years       ("Discovering Particles" in 2011 and "Understanding the Higgs boson" in       2013).
It was also involved in "Cosmic 100" in 2012.
Prof. Watkins       represents the whole UK on the International Particle Physics Outreach       Group.
Activity and Reach:       The programme has been led by Lazzeroni (STFC Public Engagement Fellow),       Evans, Raychaudhury and Freise in conjunction with Lynne Long, the Schools       Liaison Officer.
The School of Physics and Astronomy runs, on average, 130       outreach events per year which include (all longstanding annual events) an       IoP sponsored programme of 8-10 evening lectures for A-level students       (typical audiences are 200-300), themed Master classes (particle, nuclear       and astronomy), Physics Summer School (50 students), the regional Physics       Quiz (300+ Y9 students), Activities/Challenge Days (attended by 300       students from 30 different schools), an "Ideas Day for Teachers and       Technicians" and a biannual "Residential Teachers' Conference".
We also       train teachers through themed events such as "Discovering the Cosmos       Teacher Training Workshop".
This considerable programme, the vast majority       of which is linked directly to the three research themes, is coupled to       the development of a series of innovative activities for public       engagement, which place the emphasis on participation, and helping make       Birmingham's cutting-edge research widely accessible.
These activities       include:     Particle Physics and Nuclear Physics     - Demonstrations of functioning particle detectors, illustrating the       principles of operation of detectors developed at Birmingham for       experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.
- The Feynman Zoo, where visitors create animals from Feynman diagrams,       and learn how these diagrams underlie studies undertaken by Birmingham       researchers in their experiments at CERN.
- Understanding W, Z and Higgs events using an adaptation of the ATLAS       event visualization software (MINERVA) &#8212; used in the experiments at CERN.
- Development of a booklet "Understanding the Higgs Boson" &#8212; produced for       the 2013 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition (2000 copies       distributed).
Birmingham had a central role in the Higgs discovery.
Astronomy     - Use of a small-scale prototype of a seismic-isolation system and of a       compact Michelson interferometer to demonstrate techniques for detecting       gravitational waves used in our research.
- Converting star oscillations, recorded by the Birmingham       solar-oscillation network (BISON), into sound &#8212; music of the Sun.
- Development of an online resource for gravitational waves, providing       information, games, and real research software tools used for detector       design, illustrating principles of our research.
During the period 2008-2013, different combinations of the above       activities, plus others, have been successfully used in more than 300       school visits, around 50 public talks, and at major science festivals,       including the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibitions of 2010, 2011, 2012       and 2013, the Manchester Science Festival 2011, the Brighton Science       Festival 2012, the Big Bang Fair 2012, and Bang Goes the Theory Live 2012.
The total numbers of people reached are approximately 10,000 through       school visits, 5,000 through public talks and 50,000 through science       festivals (sources 1, 2 and 7).
The message of the live events is reinforced by educational material on       particle and nuclear physics and astronomy research, made available via       the outreach websites of these research groups within the School, which       have received more than 10,000 visitors, and through media work.
The quality and strength of the University's physics-related       public-engagement work has been recognised through its attraction of       funding from the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and the Science       and Technology Facilities Council.
A notable example is Lazzeroni's         leadership of a team involving 18 UK institutes involved in Particle         Physics research in proposing, preparing and staffing the `Understanding         the Higgs Boson' stand at the 2013 Royal Society Summer Science         Exhibition.
The exhibit drew an estimated 7000 visitors, including         policy makers, school visitors and the general public.
The media work undertaken includes radio interviews and television       appearances and contributions to newspaper articles discussing       Birmingham's research results, for example, from ATLAS [Charlton, Newman],       from ALICE [Evans] and from the Kepler Mission [Chaplin].
With an average       of 30 interviews per year in radio/TV and national/international       newspapers and average figures for the audience, the total number of       people reached through this work is estimated to be in excess of 30       million worldwide (source 5).
Significance:       The immediate impact of live events has been assessed by asking random       samples of visitors to complete feedback forms (~450).
Over a range of       events, the feedback has been consistent, and overwhelmingly positive.
Some example statistics are summarised below (sources 1, 2 and 3):            Bang Goes the Theory 2012: in responses from visitors in family         groups, 97% said that they had learnt something new about particle         physics, and 80% said that they were more interested in particle-physics         research;       Birmingham Astrophysics Schools' Outreach Day 2011: in responses from         school pupils, 90% said that they were more interested in undertaking         further study in physics;       Birmingham Astrophysics Public Outreach Day 2010: in responses from         visitors in family groups, 89% said that they had learnt something new,         and 97% said that they would be keen to attend similar events in the         future.
The impact of the Birmingham outreach activities suggested by the survey       results is consistent with that represented in written comments from       people and organisations with a strong interest in science promotion.
Examples are given below:            Assistant Producer for Bang Goes the Theory Live 2012: "They used           easily accessible exhibits to show complex scientific processes which           were fascinating to the visitors."
Science teacher at Holy Trinity School, Kidderminster: "The           students [...] were motivated highly by the day and have asked for           astronomy to be included in the option choices at GCSE."
Learning and Operations Manager, Birmingham Science Museum         (Thinktank): "We see children becoming the `teachers' as they explain           a particular concept to their parents"       Physics World, 2011, reviewing the online resources for gravitational         waves: "This is different from most research-group websites...
Kudos           to the Birmingham group for doing something more interesting here."
Managing Director at Space Inspired, on the online resources for         particle physics: "The website is a fabulous teaching resource,           providing both imaginative and useful resources."
Head of Science Faculty, Yardleys School Birmingham: "There has           been a narrowing of the `gap' in achievement in Physics at Yardleys           over the past three years ... and there is no doubt in my mind that           Dr. Lazzeroni's visits have contributed to this"          Sustainability:       In addition to having an impact on participants, the outreach programme       has led to a variety of follow-up initiatives, providing indicators for       longer-term success.
For example:            Online resources on particle physics have been linked to the section         of the Royal Society Education website on particle/quantum activities         for Key Stage 5.
Online resources for gravitational waves and for the MINERVA ATLAS         event visualisation have continued to attract hundreds of downloads per         day (source 3 and 4).
Information panels on research at the Large Hadron Collider were         translated into Welsh for use at the National Eisteddfod of Wales 2012.
Collaborations between arts and science have been established: Tom         Espinor's play Going Dark (Warwick Arts Centre, October 2011;         Young Vic, March 2012) draws from Birmingham's research on dark matter         and dark energy (total audience of 8400).
A second run is starting next         year &#8212; to tour the UK including two weeks at the Science Museum;         Caroline Devine's sound collage 5 minute oscillation of the sun         (Milton Keynes International Festival, July 2012) uses data from the         Birmingham solar-oscillation network (source 6).
An extension of this is         funded through an IoP outreach grant to put an art-science installation         into Thinktank.
The outreach programme has allowed the School to develop important       relations with organisations such as ThinkTank, the Royal Society, and the       BBC.
This collaboration helps ensure that wide-ranging public engagement,       based on current physics research, can be maintained into the future.
The       School will continue evaluating the popularity and impact of its outreach       activities, and to monitor the science-subject intake from the schools       engaged through these activities.
