     Kieran has enriched the wider public understanding of artistic values       with his distinctive vision of the role of art in our lives.
This has       involved engaging with and developing skills in small-group workshops with       individuals, contributions to discussion among artists and arts       professionals and much wider engagement with the general public that       culminated in a prime-time documentary and widely disseminated interactive       internet materials.
Small-group public workshops       Tate Britain invited Kieran to design and run a series of public afternoon       workshops (2007 - 2008) based on his book Revealing Art (A).
All of the events were oversubscribed, with about 50 participants in each       session .
They featured an introduction by Kieran on key concepts from his       research followed by a workshop element in which participants were asked       to apply these insights to particular works of art and then a general       discussion relating the art to the lecture.
Strong positive feedback led       Tate Britain to invite Kieran to devise a further series in 2009 looking       at art, creativity and culture in the 40 years since Kenneth Clark's Civilisation       and in association with the Tate's Triennial exhibition curated by Nicolas       Bourriaud (B).
Engagement with artists and appreciators       Kieran's research has also engaged with creative and appreciator       communities at venues such as the International Miami - Basel art fair,       Crunch Art Festival, Hay on Wye, (200 audience members) (C) and       various galleries such as the National Centre for Craft and Design (D),       the Henry Moore Institute and the Leeds City Art Gallery (typically 50       audience members).
Evidence that his engagement enriched the creative       process includes the following blog, posted by an artist after       participating in the Visual Thinking Symposium for textile artists at HUB       National Centre for Craft and Design: "I particularly liked the talk         by Matthew Kieran ... which explored the ways in which character and         motivation are crucial to artistic creativity.
He presented really well         .
.
.
I'd really like to see him talk again, so I can get to grips with         and start to question his thinking, and explore the subject further."
(E)     Contributions to policy making and public debate       Impact on public debate and artistic programming include Kieran speaking       in December 2009 at the Henry Moore Institute on art and character for       Pavilion's Arts Council Turning Point programme for Visual Arts       Organisations 2006 - 2011.
Pavilion's Director said: "Professor         Kieran's outstanding presentation on the values of art brought a vital         dimension to the discussion, opening up a meaningful debate amongst         artists and arts professionals active in the region.
This event         (including Professor Kieran's invaluable contribution) will help inform         the development of the Turning Point strategy as well as Pavilion's         curatorial thinking and artistic programme for the coming year."
(F)     In 2010 Kieran was on the advisory panel of, and was an author for, the       Commission for Architecture and Built Environment public policy project       that measured the public's responses to beauty in the natural and built       environment and looked at the implications for planning.
This generated       wider public debate and professional discussion including a Royal       Institute for Architecture conference involving architects, politicians       and policy makers.
An essay commissioned from Kieran by the project, which       stressed the importance of beauty in everyday life and its connection to       practical motivations, was discussed in, for example, a Royal Society of       Arts commentary (http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal/archive/autumn-2010/features/on-beauty)       and the Planning Resource blog (http://planningblog.planningresource.co.uk/2010/11/15/defining-beauty/).
(G)     Media coverage, Channel 4 documentary and Internet engagement       Kieran's work has had widespread impact, including interviews for the       BBC/OU Ethics Bites podcast on his work on "Art, Censorship and Morality",       April 2008, and for national and international media, such as the Sunday         Times extended feature piece on `Censors and Sensibility' October 4th,       2009 and a feature piece in Le Monde, `L'Art Pervers' May 4th,       2013.
He also talked on the Today programme, Radio 4, 13th April,       2012, on emotional transgression in Munch's Scream and has       published art criticism for The Philosopher's Magazine.
Such interviews helped establish a media presence and in 2011 - 2012       Kieran acted as the art consultant developing Channel 4's Hidden Talent       programme.
Kieran's focus on the centrality of appreciators' skills and       capacities was reflected in the programme.
He helped advise on       administering the Meier art test to over 1000 members of the public, which       led to the selection of the subject of the programme&#8212;Lee Yenson, a tractor       factory worker who had left school at 15.
Kieran worked closely with       Yenson to develop his art appreciation skills, helped to devise the       relevant tests Lee had to overcome and explain to the audience what helps       to distinguish good from not so good or bad art.
The impact on Yenson, who       had never entered an art gallery, was profound but the programme also       allowed Kieran's ideas to reach an audience of just under 2 million       viewers on 1st May, 2012.
The programme attracted widespread       national and local media coverage.
Kieran advised on YouTube videos       offering further advice to members of the public and helped design a       shortened version of the Meier test to go online to test the public's       artistic appreciation skills.
The series producer said Kieran's thorough       approach and accessible style had "encouraged many viewers to         participate in the online testing and explore art in a hugely accessible         arena."
