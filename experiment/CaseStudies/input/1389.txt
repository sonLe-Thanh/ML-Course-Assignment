     Details of two projects undertaken by LORG members for hospitals in the       UK and China, each serving a catchment area of several hundred thousand       potential patients, but with different objectives and modes of operations,       will be given.
The first project involves the Queen Alexandra Hospital which is part of       Portsmouth Hospitals Trust and provides acute care provision for the       region of Portsmouth and South East Hampshire.
The initial work involved       helping the clinicians of the Medical Assessment Unit (a buffer department       strategically placed between the Accident and Emergency Department and the       rest of the hospital) understand the nature of the patient flow and       resource capacity restrictions they faced.
The project began when the       University of Portsmouth was approached by the Queen Alexandra Hospital as       the Medical Assessment Unit (MAU) was a new concept in UK patient flow       management at that time.
Their MAU had undergone a rapid expansion from 8 to 58 beds and this had       led to many questions regarding resource levels, optimal patient-flow       pathways, and lengths of stay, that were non-trivial in nature and       required the techniques developed by LORG members to answer.
This was       achieved by a series of over ten face-to-face meetings during which goal       programming and simulation models were built and refined as the       preferences and goals of the practitioners were elicited.
In order to gain       the depth of data required to build an accurate simulation model, a member       of LORG spent a period of three weeks collecting data and liaising with       medical staff at the MAU.
The impact was due to the results of the models       built and the knowledge gained by the MAU managers, particularly Dr Paul       Schmidt who was responsible for the resource management of the MAU, which       were used to inform the policy and practice of the medical assessment unit       with respect to bed allocation policy, patient flow management, and       resource allocation.
The impact of this project has taken place in the       period since the conclusion of the project in 2008 and has specifically       resulted in:            An understanding of the optimal levels of nurses and doctors which has         assisted in the setting of appropriate resource levels in the MAU based         on the knowledge gained during the formulation and solution of the         model.
A quantification of the amount of time that nurses spend on patient         centred and non-patient centred tasks (shown by the project to be 50% on         each) which has led to better policies for nurse workload allocation.
Some non-patient centred tasks have hence been reduced and eliminated         whilst others have been mitigated against.
A successful application to the South Central Health Authority for a         &#163;160,000 grant allowing QA hospital to undertake a larger project         simulating their entire emergency pathways.
The MAU project has thus         acted as a catalyst to allow the hospital management to engage with and         utilise the power of mixed modelling simulation techniques.
The second case study involves the Zichan hospital, based in Zichan,       China, a state run but profit making non-emergency care hospital serving       the population of the Zichan region which approached the University of       Portsmouth as they had a set of beds split between their hospital       departments that were allocated in an arbitrary rather than a systematic       manner.
The hospital was looking to optimise their bed allocation against       the two criteria of overall profit and probability of direct patient       admittance.
The hospital manager was also concerned that the preferences       of all the department managers were fairly represented and modelled.
The preferences of the hospital and departmental managers where thus       elicited through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique, and       multi-phase queuing theory was used to capture analytically the flow of       patients requiring different treatments to the hospital.
A LORG member       visited the hospital in order to collect primary data to supplement the       existing data.
A set of goal programming models was then developed, in       correspondence with the general manager of the hospital in order to       validate and verify the models built and their results.
The models       recommended a different bed allocation between departments that improved       both the probability of direct patient admission and the overall profits       of the hospital.
The impact occurred in the period from the conclusion of       the study in 2008 until the present and has consisted in enhanced       knowledge of the dynamics of the allocation of beds in the hospital.
This       has allowed for more efficient policies with respect to bed allocation at       the hospital to be implemented which re-distributed the beds by allocating       more to departments shown in the study to have overly high utilisation       rates.
This has led to the following improvements against the set       objectives of the study:            An improvement of the percentage of directly admitted patients in the         period 2008-2013.
The doubling of overall profits in the period 2008-2013.
An efficient bed policy for the new expanded 450 bed (previously 280         bed) hospital to be implemented upon and since its opening in 2010.
This         policy used the logic of the LORG model as its base.
