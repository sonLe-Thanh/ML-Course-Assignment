     [text removed for publication], a leading international manufacturer of       [text removed for publication], have produced a new range of support tools       and resources for assisting end users in the design and development of       applications of their [text removed for publication] platform ([text       removed for publication]), based on research undertaken by CSRI.
This       enables simple and effective biophysical and kinematic data capture.
[text       removed for publication] have also produced a new training product in the       form of a [text removed for publication], based on research in CSRI on       processing of accelerometry signals.
During 2007 CSRI was invited to join the launch of a new [text removed       for publication] [E1] that supported the acquisition of biophysical and       kinematic data in an easily configurable manner.
Following this event,       collaboration with [text removed for publication] has been intrinsic to       CSRI's research programme in assistive technologies [1, 3, 5, 6] [E2].
At       an event sponsored by [text removed for publication] (2010), research       activities within the domain of Connected Health were presented by [text       removed for publication] and CSRI [E3].
This raised awareness of research       within the area of wireless sensing in Connected Health to industrial       representatives on an all-Ireland basis.
Through the creation of the smart environment within CSRI, funded through       the DEL-funded Deployment of Sensing Technology for Connected Health       project (2009-2011), the [text removed for publication] became one of the       core sensing technologies used.
The [text removed for publication] was       used to measure activities such as walking, lying down and lifting       objects, in addition to measuring activity levels through step-counts and       distance travelled.
Analysis of the data gathered from such sensors was       used as the basis for the development of automatic activity       recognition-based systems [1, 2].
In addition, the experience gained by       CSRI in working with wireless sensors [3, 4, 5, 6], processing of the       recorded data and its visualisation for healthcare professionals [1, 2,       6], and reducing the complexity of sensor programming, formed the basis of       a funded collaboration with [text removed for publication] through the       [text removed for publication] (2010-2011).
The collaboration involved the       development of an interface to configure and visualise the data generated       from the [text removed for publication] to streamline the production of       host-side [text removed for publication] applications in a manner that       would be accessible to non-technical users.
Results from research on user       interface design for healthcare professionals undertaken by CSRI were used       to inform the development of this new software interface ([text removed       for publication]).
Specifically, these results address the appropriate       methods to design an interface to enable non-technical users to configure       rules, and how complex information is to be visualised.
The resources in       the [text removed for publication] provide a flexible architecture that       supports the configuration, visualisaton and analysis of the data       collected by the [text removed for publication].
Configuration and       programming of the [text removed for publication] usually requires the use       of an integrated development environment geared towards electronic and       software engineers.
The [text removed for publication] provides an       intermediate layer between the user and the integrated development       environment.
This intermediate layer enables healthcare professionals to       configure [text removed for publication] devices easily, monitor functions       such as vital signs, movement and orientation, and dictate how the       information is visualised, all from a non-technical perspective.
The successful completion of the [text removed for publication] Project       and development of the [text removed for publication] were independently       assessed by consultants from the [text removed for publication].
The       outcome of the assessment was that, from a selection of 50 projects, the       collaboration won the 2012 [text removed for publication] Project of the       Year Award [E4].
The development of the [text removed for publication] has provided an       economic benefit for [text removed for publication].
The company have       stated that through collaboration with CSRI and the development of the       [text removed for publication] product their company witnessed a [text       removed for publication] increase in turnover during 2012 [E5, E6].
The       product is being used in [text removed for publication] countries.
In addition, [text removed for publication] has stated that the number of       staff within their Research and Development department has increased as a       direct result of this collaboration with CSRI.
This collaboration has       supported the employment of [text removed for publication] new members of       staff at [text removed for publication], one of whom has taken the role of       Research and Development Director within the company, and the others as       research and development engineers [E5].
In addition to the production of the [text removed for publication]       product, a further collaboration between [text removed for publication]       and CSRI led to the joint development of a new product launched by [text       removed for publication] in May 2013 [E5, E7].
This new product is       targeted at the Educational market, and provides a starter-pack for the       [text removed for publication].
This is a new product range for [text       removed for publication] and has been guided and supported by CSRI based       on our research on processing of accelerometry signals [3, 5, 6].
