     By harnessing contemporary interests in textiles, fashion and costume       dramas, Wynne's public       engagement activities raise public awareness of the relevance and       significance of nineteenth-       century literary texts, while her research into the role of costume and       textiles in screen adaptations       has been informed by audience responses at these events.
The peer       reviewers of Wynne's AHRC       Fellowship application commended her impact activities as innovative in       their potential to enhance       general readers' engagement with literary texts, and the grant includes       &#163;1870.50 to fund the 2014       Textile Stories Study Day.
The following public lectures delivered       by Wynne were informed by her       Literary Fabrics research (audience numbers are given in brackets):            `Literary Fabrics: Texts, Textiles and Costume Dramas', Textile         Society Symposium,         London 19/03/2011 (64);       `Textiles in the Writings of Elizabeth Gaskell and Charlotte Bront&#235;',         The Daphne Carrick         Lecture, The Gaskell Society, Manchester 09/04/2011 (48);       `Arnold Bennett's Representations of Clothing', The Arnold Bennett         Society, Stoke-on-Trent         09/06/2012 (46);       `Hades!
The Ladies!
: Selling Textiles in Victorian and Edwardian         Literature and Culture',         Professorial Inaugural Lecture, University of Chester, 07/11/2012 (83);       `Dressing and Undressing in Pride and Prejudice: Viewing the         1995 BBC Adaptation', The         Jane Austen Society (Midlands Branch in Stafford), 27/04/2013 (28);       `Reading, Writing and Sewing with the Bront&#235; Sisters', workshop for         sixth formers, The         Queen's School, Chester, 02/05/2013 (10);       `Miss Havisham's Dress' (with Amber Regis), Textile Stories Study Day,         University of         Chester, 15/06/2013 (41);       `Reading Pride and Prejudice and the Drama of Costume',         Reading Group Meeting,         University of Chester, 06/07/2013 (18).
The Textile Stories Study Day in June 2013 brought together 41       participants, including teachers,       NHS workers, members of local sewing groups, textile artists, students of       textiles and fashion in       the FE sector, volunteers and paid employees from the heritage sector,       retired people and creative       writers.
The free event was organised around the idea that stories from       the past can be read       through surviving textile objects, while textile representations in novels       and film adaptations help       readers to a greater understanding of social and cultural histories.
Wynne, with Regis and Heaton,       presented talks and workshops, along with invited speakers (including       professionals from the       Yorkshire Fashion Archive, the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, a theatre       historian, and a local textile       artist).
The event was fully funded by the English Department from its QR       funding.
Regis and Wynne presented a talk at the study day based on their       co-authored article, `Miss       Havisham's Dress'.
While everyone in the audience had heard of Miss       Havisham, only a minority       had read Dickens's Great Expectations.
Regis and Wynne provided       the audience with a short       excerpt from the novel and led a general discussion on Dickens's character       and her various       appearances on screen, focusing on costume's role in creating an updated       `Havisham' to speak to       each new generation, showing how literary texts can be effectively reread       and reinterpreted in       visual forms.
Feedback indicated that the Textile Stories Study Day enabled       participants to make new       connections between different cultural forms.
Many stated that they had       learned something of       imaginative value, encountered academic research in an interesting way,       and some felt inspired to       use what they had learned in their practices as textile artists and       needleworkers.
Feedback       comments include:            `A really inspiring day, I have not been to anything like this before!
Informative and unusual';       `Lovely day, full of interest &amp; variety.
Very pleased that I could         enjoy (and have access) as         an ordinary person, with a strong interest in textiles, "old things"         &amp; social history.
Look         forward to more';       `[I]t's been very educational and inspirational to develop my creative         processes further.
It         was great meeting others at this event';       `I didn't know what to expect, coming, as I do, from an interest in         the retail side of the textile         story, also [... learned] how textiles have been so important in fashion         and class';       `A fascinating and varied day, with lots of stories to think about.
[...] Very encouraging to         hear about so many different aspects of research';       `Interesting to hear of link between age of film and dress given to         Miss Havisham';       `I loved the Miss Havisham lecture.
Very interesting take on the         character of women and         their place in film'.
Feedback from participants at other events indicate a similar experience       of educational value and       inspiration: `I've had a really enjoyable day and leave with lots of ideas       to think about' (Jane Austen       Society member); `Just wanted to say a big thank you for our Bronte talk       on Thursday.
I thoroughly       enjoyed the afternoon and found all your information so interesting &#8212; I       didn't realise how fascinating       the sisters were [...].
You'll be pleased to know I've taken some books       out of the school library and       am brushing up on my Brontes!'

The blog for the Textile Stories Project: http://dwtextilestories.blogspot.co.uk/       offers a miscellany of       research topics and personal narratives relating to the social and       cultural significance of fabric.
It       has extended the reach of the project beyond the UK.
By 03/07/13 there had       been 3,536 hits in the       UK, US, Europe, Australia, Russia, China, India, Canada and New Zealand.
One follower of the       blog from the US, a quilter, commented on a post about Jane Austen's       references to fashion and       needlework in her letters: `What a wonderful article!'
(26/03/13).
Plans for further public engagement events are in place: a Textile         Stories Study Day is being       organised for 2014 (supported by the funding from Wynne's AHRC       Fellowship), while Wynne is       scheduled to deliver two public lectures on textiles in literature and       culture at literary festivals in the       autumn of 2013.
