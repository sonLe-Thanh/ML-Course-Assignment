     In 2007, an NRAG report recognised the need to reduce the attrition rate       of radiography students and identified a potential crisis in England for       training staff and students for RT treatment of cancer.
The report identified the potential impact and benefits of VERT in this       context, and recommended the introduction of Hybrid Virtual Environment       (HVE) skills training facilities, to be rolled out across 10 educational       providers and over 40 clinical sites to support first year students and       Assistant Practitioners.
This was reinforced by the DoH's Cancer Reform       Strategy 2007 which recommended the introduction of VERT as part of a       national programme, supported by &#163;5M of capital funding from the UK       government.
VERT was rolled out to 40 clinics and 10 universities in the UK from       February 2008, effectively covering all RT trainees in England.
The main       beneficiaries were students, teaching staff and health trusts.
An       independent evaluation of the impact of the exploitation of VERT       recruitment and retention, and on students' knowledge and understanding       was undertaken.
It also made recommendations for future curriculum design       and teaching.
The Final Project Report was published in June 2010 (see       Section 5 [C1]).
Overall feedback was positive; pre-placement experience       with VERT was thought to enhance basic practical skills and enhance       confidence, including improved confidence operating hand pendant controls.
Skills developed in VERT were found to transfer well to the clinical       environment.
90% of students responding to a questionnaire agreed or       strongly agreed that VERT contributed to their enjoyment of learning and       teaching scenarios.
There was a perception that use of VERT had a positive       impact on: development of understanding of radiotherapy concepts (82%       agreed or agreed strongly); enhancement of practical skills (72% agreed or       strongly agreed); and motivation (70% agreed or strongly agreed?).
Sales of VERT worldwide have grown from 2008 to the present, and the       beneficiaries have been:            Health trusts, students and patients: VERT offers a safe and effective         training environment with the potential to reduce training costs,         increase training capacity, provide more effective training and         ultimately improve patient safety, as detailed in sections 3-5.
Vertual Ltd and its shareholders: 92 VERT systems have been installed         worldwide in 16 countries, with economic impacts including an         accumulated gross profit over 3 years of &#163;965k and typically &#163;2M annual         turnover.
Employees of the company, with employment/economic impacts in terms of         10 new jobs created since 1st January 2008, with an average salary of         &#163;30k.
This includes 4 full-time software developers.
A network of 12 distributors worldwide, with economic impacts in terms         of profits from distributing VERT.
Significant economic benefits to other UK industry, including         equipment suppliers and local manufacturing.
Vertual partner with a UK         based VR system supplier to provide over &#163;400k annual hardware sales,         including installation and support services.
Vertual also use UK based         companies for electronic printed circuit board manufacture and assembly,         electronic components, manufacture of enclosures, printing, graphic         design and exhibition services.
Benefits to the educational, medical and research community: Vertual         is a Diamond Partner of the UK College of Radiographers, providing         financial support for research and educational projects.
Vertual         regularly sponsor student graduation awards and prizes in the UK, US and         Canada, and fund student / staff attendance at conferences.
VERT is an established and recognised tool for training radiotherapy       professionals at over 90 institutions worldwide.
VERT has been       continuously used for RT training at Aarhus University Hospital from 2008       to present, resulting in a doubling of the training capacity [Ref.
C3].
A       training centre has been established where VERT is a key facility,       reducing the demand for training in the real clinic.
Following the same       model, three other VERT simulation centres have been established at       Birmingham City University, Michener Institute and City University.
A VERT user community was established from the outset which continues to       actively conduct and publish research and studies evaluating VERT,       expanding its scope and application, and sharing best practice.
The       beneficiaries are users of VERT, evidenced by the International User       Meetings in Bristol (March 2010), London (September 2011) &#8212; where 70       delegates from UK, Europe, USA and Canada attended &#8212; and Hertfordshire       (April 2013).
An annual user meeting is held in the USA, to cater for the       increasing number of US users (15 VERT installations in the USA and       Canada, and growing).
Impact is evidenced by the adoption of VERT under nationally funded       training programmes.
Following on from its uptake in the DoH (UK), in 2011       the Australian Department of Health funded the installation of 5       state-of-the-art VERT systems throughout Australia to improve radiographer       training.
This was followed in 2013 by the first installation in New       Zealand at the University of Otago, which was opened by the Minister of       Health.
VERT has also been adopted for training by Varian Medical System,       the global market leader for radiotherapy linear accelerators.
The scope of the use of VERT includes graduate and postgraduate RT       training, continuing professional development, anatomy training, skills       assessment, patient awareness, nurse training, staff training and       research.
VERT has an important role to play in improving patient safety       and in 2010 was adopted by the prestigious MD Anderson Cancer Centre       (Texas, USA) where it has been used to reconstruct RT treatment errors and       identify remedial actions with trainees (several institutions in the UK       use the system in the same role).
In summary, VERT is increasingly used worldwide for RT education and       training.
Radiotherapy professionals are identifying innovative       applications far beyond its initial scope.
VERT is continually under       development to improve its effectiveness for training, to keep abreast of       improvements in techniques and technology and cater for its expanding       diversity of use.
