     The considerable reach of these impacts may be seen by the fact that they       have extended to two major government bodies (the MoJ and CPS), two       Parliamentary Joint Committees, and an NGO.
Their significance lies in the       substantial changes they have brought about to legislation, parliamentary       assessment of the human rights implications of that legislation, the       judgment of an international human rights court, and national policy on       prosecuting journalists.

Influencing the Defamation Act 2013     Phillipson was invited to be the sole academic member of the Ministry of       Justice Libel Working Group (Jan-March 2010), which considered options for       reform of defamation law.
Proposals from the Report were then embodied in       the Government's Defamation Bill, published in draft in 2011 and       introduced into Parliament in 2012.
Drawing on output 1,       Phillipson drafted a report for the Group ("Public Interest Defence"       (1 Mar 2010)), summarising his research findings on relevant case-law of       the ECtHR.
His arguments were incorporated into the Working Group's Report       and assisted in convincing the MoJ that proposals for more radical       pro-media reforms advocated by the Libel Reform Campaign (LRC)       over-privileged free speech and therefore risked breaching the UK's       obligations under Article 8 ECHR.
Paragraph 79 of the Report adopted       Phillipson's argument (in particular paragraphs 83-85 were drafted and       corrected by Phillipson (source 1)) and advocated using       legislation not to introduce the radical new defence advocated by the LRC,       but instead to consolidate and clarify the existing Reynolds       defence.
The Defamation Bill (cl 4) followed this recommendation (source         2a at [29]).
An amendment to clause 4 in the name of Lord Lester was       subsequently made to the Bill &#8212; see now section 4 of the Defamation Act       2013 &#8212; but this simply amounted to a different way of capturing the       existing defence, as the Explanatory Notes to the Act make clear (source         2b at [29]).

Contribution to Parliamentary assessment of human rights         implications of Defamation Bill     Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) considers the       compatibility of all proposed legislation with the UK's human rights       obligations.
Drawing on output 5, Phillipson submitted evidence to       the Committee on the Defamation Bill 2012 which, inter alia:       (a) argued against a radical change to the Bill proposed by the Libel       Reform Campaign [17-28];     (b) suggested that the Bill should be amended to require a higher burden       of harm to be shown by corporate claimants [46-47] (http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/human-         rights/Prof_Gavin_Phillipson.pdf).
In its Report (source 3), the JCHR responded to each point:       On point (a) the Committee gave extensive consideration to Phillipson's       arguments [29-34] and adopted them, stating: "We share the view of       Professor Phillipson on this matter..." [34].
On point (b) the Committee set out Phillipson's argument with approval at       [55] and its recommendation concurred with his [58].
Parliamentarians and the Government followed the recommendation in point       (a) by continuing to resist the proposed Libel Reform Campaign amendment.
The House of Lords amended clause 1 of the Bill in line with the JCHR's       recommendation on point (b) &#8212; see now s1(2) of the Act.
Moreover, the significance of JCHR reports extends well beyond specific       changes made to the legislation to which they relate in Parliament.
Their       reports are an authoritative finding by Parliament on the compliance of       legislation with the UK's human rights obligations and are used by lawyers       preparing court challenges, and influence other parliamentary bodies,       NGOs, and the findings of international human rights bodies, including the       UN and ECtHR.

Contribution to Parliamentary Inquiry on Privacy     Phillipson gave oral and written evidence to the Joint Committee on       Privacy and Injunctions in October 2011, which was established following       controversies around the granting of `super injunctions' to celebrities       and public figures, to consider whether changes in the law and media       regulation were needed (p 848-857: http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-         committees/Privacy_and_Injunctions/JCPIWrittenEvWeb.pdf).
Phillipson       was one of only four legal academics invited to give oral evidence to the       Committee.
His evidence (drawing on outputs 1-4) argued that       section 12 of the Human Rights Act (HRA) struck an appropriate balance       between Articles 8 and 10 of the ECHR and therefore should not be       radically reformed, as many in the media were arguing.
The Committee's       Report cited Phillipson's evidence (source 4, at [55]; note 63)       and endorsed his argument against the radical reform of section 12, saying       "We do not recommend any alteration to the law in this area" [59].
This recommendation has been followed by Parliament and the Government in       that neither has announced any plans to reform section 12 of the HRA.

Influence on Crown Prosecution Service official guidance     The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), in the light of the phone       hacking scandal, published draft guidelines to assist prosecutors       considering the "public interest" element of the decision whether to       prosecute journalists who commit offences such as phone and email hacking.
Phillipson was invited to discuss the guidelines in a small seminar with       interested parties (mostly national media bodies; Phillipson was one of       only three legal academics invited) and respond to the formal consultation       process (source 7).
Drawing on outputs 1-4, Phillipson, in his written and oral       evidence to the DPP (https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/hrc/projects/ConsultationontheInterimGuidelinesforProsecutorson         AssessingthePublicMediaInterestinCasesAffectingtheMedia.pdf),       recommended narrowing how the interim Guidelines defined the "public       interest" journalists might be considered to have served by       obtaining information through unlawful means.
Para 31(d) of the interim       Guidelines stated that this included conduct "capable of raising or       contributing to an important matter of public debate" (source 5).
Phillipson argued that, in order to avoid privileging speech over privacy,       a more restrictive interpretation of "public debate" was needed,       indicating what types of debate were sufficiently important here.
He       suggested instancing "seriously unethical conduct", "misuse of public       money" and seriously misleading the public.
The Final Guidelines partially       adopted this point by re-defining "public debate" as including "serious       impropriety, significant unethical conduct and significant incompetence,       which affects the public" (source 6, [31(d)]).

Influence on submission to and judgment of European Court of Human         Rights     Output 1 impacted on the third party intervention submitted by the       Media Lawyers Association (MLA) to the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in       relation to the cases of Von Hannover v Germany (No 2),       Application 40660/08 and 60641/08 (7 Feb 2012) and Springer v Germany,       Application 39954/08 (7 Feb 2012).
The submission adopted and cited the       argument, developed in outputs 1 &amp; 5, that the scope of       Article 8 had been over-extended by the ECtHR in the previous decision Von         Hannover v Germany (2004) by finding that the press would generally       be invading privacy if they published photographs of an individual, even       in public, without their consent.
The argument was that this gave too much       priority to privacy over free speech (source 8, [16-17] &amp;         fn 14 and 17 citing p 677-683 of output 1).
The Court's judgment cited the MLA intervention at (source 10, [92])       and responded by shifting the balance between the two rights towards       freedom of speech, such that the case has been described academically as       an "important win for the press" (source 9, at p. 108).
The Court       indicated that, where pictures complained of were anodyne and taken in       public places without aggravating factors, prohibition of their       publication could not be justified given even a weak public interest in       the text accompanying them (source 10, [122-123]).
This partially       accepted the MLA's argument that Article 8 privacy rights had been taken       too far.
The judgments of the Court bind the state party to the case and       govern the interpretation of the Convention, acceded to by the 47 states       of the Council of Europe &#8212; covering some 800 million people.
