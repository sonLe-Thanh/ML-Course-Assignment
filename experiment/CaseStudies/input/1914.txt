     CDR research has had a significant influence on policy making and the       implementation of       practices that promote socially inclusive integration of disaster risk       reduction in post disaster       reconstruction activity, internationally:            Research on the integration of disaster risk reduction and post         disaster reconstruction has         shaped and influenced policy making by government and quasi-government         bodies by         Contributing to the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) Making Cities Resilient: 'My City is getting ready!'
campaign, launched in May 2010, which         addresses issues of local governance and urban risk.
Amaratunga and Haigh are members of UNISDR Making Cities           Resilient Campaign's         Advisory Panel (2009-present).
Using CDR research as the basis, they         advised the         Campaign with respect to the application of resilience and disaster risk         reduction in         different urban contexts, with particular attention to the gender         perspective; community         participation; stakeholder engagement; capacity building; training and         education; and         technology transfer.
These principles were incorporated into the ten essential areas for         resilience that are         being promoted to mayors and local government from over 1350 participant         cities         across the world (total in April 2013).
In doing so, CDR research is         supporting local         government officials faced with continuous threat of disasters who need         better access         to policies and tools to effectively deal with these threats.
CDR research on the integration of disaster risk reduction into post         disaster reconstruction         has been used to develop resources to enhance professional practice in         the humanitarian         sector, where there is a need to address the learning and capacity         building needs of         workers, identified in ELHRA's 2010 study on Professionalising             the Humanitarian Sector.
Amaratunga and Haigh provided technical input to the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic           Commission Manual and Guide on Enhancing Tsunami Risk Assessment           and Management, Strengthening Policy Support and Developing Guidelines           for Tsunami           Exercises in Indian Ocean Countries (TRATE).
The CDR work in the         manual included:                 Resources to enhance professional practice on the social dimensions of         vulnerability         and promoting the concept of resilient cities;       Guidance on identifying stakeholders, understanding their relationship         to the         intervention and their needs, and selecting an engagement strategy for         each, by         building and implementing an effective stakeholder communication plan;       Research findings on social dimensions of vulnerability towards the         conduct of         professional work and practice.
CDR research has influenced professional standards and training in Sri         Lanka, a country         subject to several large scale disasters in recent years, including the         2004 Indian Ocean         Tsunami and a civil war spanning three decades.
Sri Lanka is         implementing a highly         accelerated post conflict reconstruction programme.
Less than three         years after the end of         the civil war, a construction boom is under way driven by high levels of         investment in the         tourism and leisure sectors, the resettlement of shanty dwellers,         large-scale housing         development, and unprecedented construction activity in road and water         development.
Amaratunga, Haigh, Kulatunga and Pathirage have been working alongside         local         stakeholders to develop their capacity to create a built environment         that is more resilient to         the threats posed by natural and human hazards.
Capacity development has         been         improved through a series of international conferences in Sri Lanka         (2008, 2011, 2013)         organised by CDR, and training workshops held in conjunction with the         Chamber of         Construction Industry Sri Lanka, United Nations Development Programme,         the Ministry of         Disaster Management, UNESCO, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and         the city         of Batticaloa's local government (2009-2013).
The events provided         guidance for council         officers, construction and humanitarian professionals working on         respective policy changes         and plans incorporating disaster risk reduction concepts in their city         development plans.
In particular, CDR research informed a revision of the Sri Lankan           National Policy on           Local Government (Act No.
1632/26, 2009).
As a result of CDR initiatives, the post-disaster reconstruction         programmes in Sri Lanka are         reducing vulnerability to hazards, being more sensitive to the varying         needs of different         groups, and addressing inequalities in access to infrastructure.
The CDR has been nominated by the Federation of Sri Lankan Local Govt.
Authorities for         the UN 2013 Sasakawa           Award for Disaster Risk Reduction which recognises           excellence in         reducing disaster risk for a safer, more sustainable world under the         theme Acting As One.
The significant influence achieved by CDR on policymaking and         implementation of         practices continues through CDR's on-going research and engagement         activities.
Haigh         and Amaratunga are leading ANDROID Academic Network for             Disaster Resilience to             Optimise Educational Development, c.&#8364;800,000 and funded by         the European Union, an         international consortium comprising partners from 64 universities across         Europe, as well as         three institutions from Australia, Canada and Sri Lanka to promote         co-operation and         innovation in European higher education institutions to increase         society's resilience to         disasters of human and natural origin, such as earthquakes or wars.
CDR is currently also engaged in CEREBELLA Community             Engagement for Risk Erosion             in Bangladesh to Enhance LifeLong Advantage, funded by the         British Council.
The goal of         this partnership between the School           of the Built Environment's CDR and Patuakhali         Science and Technology University (PSTU) in Bangladesh is to share         skills, knowledge         and experience on climate change and disaster management.
In 2013, CDR         held a         capacity development workshop in conjunction with PSTU, the University         of Dhaka, the         British Council, and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center.
