     Research at the University of Sheffield into ticagrelor has had impact on       health and welfare through improved treatment for patients with acute       coronary syndromes.
In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)       recommended in October 2011 that ticagrelor is a cost-effective and       superior alternative to generic clopidogrel in patients with myocardial       infarction or moderate-to-high risk unstable angina (S1).
The work has       supported the introduction of life-saving therapy in these patients since       ticagrelor prevents one in five deaths in a broad spectrum of acute       coronary syndrome patients compared to standard therapy with clopidogrel.
Regulatory approval of ticagrelor has now been achieved in more than 80       countries worldwide, including approval by the European Medicines Agency       in Europe (2010) (S2) and the Federal Drug Administration in the USA       (2011) (S3).
Based on the PLATO study results, two European Society of Cardiology       guidelines entitled `ESC Guidelines for the management of acute coronary       syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation'       (published in 2011) (S4) and `ESC Guidelines for the management of acute       myocardial infarction in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation'       (published in 2012) (S5) have recommended ticagrelor as first-line       treatment in preference to clopidogrel.
The recommendations by the ESC and the approval by NICE then led to use       of ticagrelor for acute coronary syndrome patients in the UK.
Reflecting       the leading role that Sheffield played in the development of ticagrelor,       the South Yorkshire region, representing a population of over 1.5 million,       was the first to adopt ticagrelor as first-line treatment of acute       coronary syndromes in preference to generic clopidogrel in February 2012       (S6) and other regions of the UK have progressively followed suit, with       50% of NHS Trusts in the UK that manage acute coronary syndrome now having       adopted ticagrelor (S7).
