     The research that yielded the hybrid analysis method underpinned the       development of VASci/ESI's       vibro-acoustic analysis software, VA One, and provided the code with       unique full frequency       capabilities.
The Langley-Cotoni SEA variance theory enabled VA One to       predict variance of       responses and confidence intervals.
VA One was launched in 2005.
Its       impact continued and       increased in the period from 2008 to 2013.
[7]     The subsequent research that integrated periodic structure theory       provided the solution that was       commercially released as the VA One Periodic Structure Module in 2007.
Its       impact continued and       increased in the period from 2008 to 2013.
In addition, a further module       released in 2010       concerning rattle noise was based on Langley's work.
[7]     ESI will not reveal sales data, but stated in 2013 that over 600       companies are currently employing       VA One including large corporations such as Boeing, Ford, General Motors,       Airbus, EADS and the       US Navy as well as supply companies.
ESI also stated that the periodic       structure module has been       used extensively by Boeing [8], Bombardier [9] and other ESI clients [10].
VA One answers a need, across a range of industrial sectors, to predict       the vibro-acoustic       performance of products at the design stage.
For example, in the design of       an automotive structure       it must be ensured that the interior noise level meets customer       requirements, and for commercial       reasons this must be achieved at minimum cost of soundproofing or other       noise control treatments.
The problem of predicting the vibro-acoustic response of a complex system       faces two major       difficulties: (i) a wide frequency range is of interest, and at high       frequencies conventional methods       of analysis such as the Finite Element Analysis method (FEA) can require       millions of degrees of       freedom and large computational resources, and (ii) the system response       can be very sensitive to       manufacturing uncertainties, and the "as-built" performance can differ       significantly from the perfect       design.
[7, 10]     VA One overcomes these difficulties by: (i) employing SEA to model       modally dense regions of the       structure, thus leading to a dramatic reduction in the required number of       degrees of freedom, (ii)       employing FEA in regions of the structure which do not meet the conditions       needed for the       application of SEA, (iii) using the hybrid methodology to fully couple SEA       and FEA in a single       model, and (iv) allowing for manufacturing variability though       non-parametric SEA statistics.
The       software allows a fast assessment of vibro-acoustic performance to be       made, and this in turn       allows iterative design studies to optimise the commercial and technical       success of a product.
[7,       10]     Many VA One customers have provided statements that are presented on the       ESI website giving       evidence of high impact including:     "There are a large number of problems in the aerospace industry that         are amenable to vibro-         acoustics analysis.
These include aircraft interior noise, specification         of launch vehicle and satellite         vibration environments, and detailed stress analysis of lightweight         reflectors under high intensity         acoustic loading, among others.
Because of the wide range of frequencies         involved, no one         method can solve all of these problems.
VA One is the only tool that         includes solvers that can         perform analysis and design studies for low-, mid-, and high frequency         problems.
This allows for         fast and effective vibro-acoustic analysis and design of aerospace         structures, significantly reducing         cost and schedule impacts compared to build and test approaches",       Dr. Paul Blelloch, Director,       Aerospace Analysis, ATA Engineering Inc. [11]     "One of the advantages of VA One for automotive applications is the         ability to quickly start with the         evaluation of simple yet useful conceptual models and progress through         the evaluation of         increasingly more sophisticated models as the design evolves.
VA One can         provide critical design         assessments well before prototype vehicles are available such that         proper noise control measures         can be efficiently incorporated into the design; rather than         inefficiently added as bandaids late in         the program", Lear Corporation.
[11]     "Even with JM's extensive testing capabilities, the next generation of         acoustical solutions require         sophisticated modeling techniques.
ESI's vibro-acoustics software         compliments our experimental         facility proving the ideal tool for a broad spectrum of projects ranging         from building construction to         aerospace acoustics", Johns Mansville.
[11]     "Boeing Integrated Defense has been a long term and successful         AutoSEA2 user, and now has the         capability of implementing all of the common vibro-acoustics analysis         techniques, which are         integrated into a single software package.
The combined tools provide an         efficient analysis         environment when performing analysis to support Space Shuttle and         International Space Station         requirements.
VA One is a standard software tool for Boeing Integrated         Defense vibroacoustic         analysis, and it is used to support a variety of other business         activities", Ed O'Keefe, Associate       Technical Fellow, Boeing Integrated Defense.
[11]     "Hybrid FE-SEA analysis is a real leap forward when it comes to         acoustical modeling technologies         and is likely to set the standard for industrial computational acoustics         of large structures for the         future.
The innovative integration of FE and SEA methods within one         model allows the user to         solve problems that cannot be addressed by applying SEA or FE methods         separately", Ulf       Orrenius, Senior Specialist : Acoustics and Vibration, Bombardier       Transportation.
[11]     "VA One is intuitive and straightforward to use.
I was able to         complete a detailed, coupled         Boundary Element analysis the first time that I used the code",       Jeffrey Larko, Aerospace Engineer       Structural Dynamics, NASA Glenn Research Center.
[11]     "The ability to simulate noise levels helped the engineers involved in         the project consider the         impact of their decisions on noise early in the design process,         Engineers evaluated the impact of         different types of absorptive materials and traded off their benefits         against their costs.
They         quantified the impact of main paths and flanking paths so that they         didn't waste money reducing         main paths in situations where the flanking paths would be controlling.
The result was that noise on         the Cascadia tractor was reduced by 5 to 6 dB below the previous         generation and tests show that         the Cascadia is one of the quietest cabs in North America", Craig       Birkett, Product       Validation/Engineering Analysis, Freightliner LLC.
[11]     "By using ESI's vibro-acoustic software we were able to obtain up to         15 dB reduction in the interior         sound pressure levels in one of our vehicle platforms.
The software is         now used in production as         part of our standard vehicle design process", Kazuki Fukui, Nissan       Motor Company.
[11]     "Ensuring that our structures survive the harsh environments         encountered during launch and liftoff         is essential to our missions.
Using VA One we can now predict the         dynamic stress, strain and force         in key components.
This will help us to ensure that our structures are         qualified for the acoustic and         vibrational environments encountered during launch and liftoff", Ben       Tsoi, Senior Dynamics       Environmental Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratories.
