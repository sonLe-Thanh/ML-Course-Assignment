     This research has generated significant and wide reaching impact.
Dissemination of research outputs and engagement with the media has informed         the debate by challenging existing views in a number of key areas of       reform.
It has also had a significant direct influence on the reform         process through contributions to government consultations and select       committee inquiries, and the dissemination of findings to policymakers.
It       has also had a wider reach by influencing others with an interest       in reform, who have used it in various ways to support their own proposals       and submissions to the reform process.
The House of Lords: expertise and reform             Informing the debate &#8212; research on expertise in the         House of Lords has had a particular impact.
The article, `A question of         expertise', was featured in a package on Radio 4's The Westminster           Hour in 2010, which included an interview with one of the authors         (1).
It has also been referenced in a number of House of Lords library         notes, including on House of Lords reform, regional representation in         the House of Lords, and the House of Lords Appointments Commission (2).
Influencing the reform process &#8212; the researchers         submitted evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft House of Lords         Reform Bill in 2011.
Several aspects of this evidence were referred to         in the Committee's report, in particular on the patchy nature of         expertise in the House, the fairness of places reserved for particular         religious groups, and concerns about the efficacy of the Government's         proposals for by-elections to the second chamber (3).
The research also         informed a submission in 2011 by the researchers to the House of Lords         Constitution Committee's inquiry into the process of constitutional         reform, which was also referenced in the Committee's report (4).
Wider reach &#8212; the research has influenced other groups         interested in House of Lords reform, featuring, for example, in the         Electoral Reform Society's evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft         House of Lords Reform Bill, to support the Society's call for a         deepening of expertise within the second chamber, and in the Campaign         for Science and Engineering's policy report on House of Lords Reform           and Expertise (5).
Parliament and the intelligence and security services             Informing the debate &#8212; the research has been carried out         at a time when there has been considerable debate over the scrutiny of         intelligence, and has fed into this debate at a number of levels.
It has         twice been discussed on BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour (in         2009 and 2011) in relation to proposed reform of the Intelligence and         Security Committee (ISC), including a debate between Defty and a former         Chair of the ISC (6).
It has been cited in a number of House of Commons         briefing papers on the ISC (7).
Influencing the reform process &#8212; evidence submitted by         the researchers to the government's consultation on the Security and           Justice Green paper (2011) had a direct influence on subsequent         proposals for reform.
The submission was cited several times in the         government's response, and several of the recommendations and elements         of the subsequent Bill reflected those from the submission.
The research         provided evidence, including data from interviews with over 100         parliamentarians, that highlighted considerable support for reform of         the ISC, including its reconstitution as a committee of parliament, a         position which was subsequently adopted in the Justice and Security         Bill.
The Government's response also highlighted the submission's         recommendation that `the ISC could and should do more to engage with         Parliament in order to enhance wider knowledge and understanding of the         Agencies and the nature and limitations of intelligence', and, following         reform, the ISC has moved towards holding some evidence sessions in         public (8).
This research also contributed to submissions by Bochel,         Defty, Kirkpatrick and others to the House of Lords Constitution         Committee's 2011 inquiry into the process of constitutional reform, and         on the restrictions on the interception of MPs' communications to the         Government's consultation on Parliamentary Privilege in 2012.       the interviews conducted for this research themselves also provided         significant engagement with key individuals &#8212; senior officials,         Ministers and other parliamentarians &#8212; who were directly involved in the         formulation of proposals for reform of the Intelligence and Security         Committee.
A summary of findings was also sent to all participants and         other interested parties in 2012.
Correspondence shows, for example,         that the briefing paper was read by the Secretary of State for Justice         and the Minister for Justice, while the Clerk of the Joint Committee on         the National Security Strategy circulated it to Committee members.
The         research also prompted at least one MP to table a number of         parliamentary questions regarding the interception of MPs'         communications (9).
Wider reach &#8212; as with the research on the House of         Lords, this research also impacted on other organisations interested in         reform.
The researchers' earlier work on reform of the ISC featured in         the Equality and Human Rights Commission's submission to the Justice and         Security Consultation, and was cited in Democratic Audit's 2012 audit of         democracy in the UK, which highlighted the research's emphasis on the         role of select committees as providing an alternative means of scrutiny         beyond the ISC (10).
