     In December 2011, TPP was applied by Angelova and collaborators from the       MATSIQEL team to high-dimension data from Valley Care.
The data were       subjected to substantial data cleaning and preparation between December       2011 and April 2012.
Valley Care's primary aim is to assist people to live       independently in their own homes.
Therefore the data describes the usage       of equipment and facilities required for ambient living for people (mostly       ageing or in a need of assistance).
The Telecare equipment mainly consists       of: (i) a base unit for making and/or receiving calls from the operator,       which is available to each client; and (ii) a range of mobile or fixed       units, such as personal radio triggers, medication dispenser, smoke, gas       and CO detectors, fall detector, temperature-extremes sensor, property       exit sensor, bogus caller, bed/chair sensor, flood detector, epilepsy       sensor and GPS trackers.
These devices monitor the life of people with       limited abilities, enabling them to look after themselves and live in       their own homes, without the need of a carer or transfer to care homes.
Valley Care provided data for 500 (consent given) clients aged between 45       and 90 collected from August 2007 to December 2011.
The objectives of       applying the TPP method were to evaluate the usage of the equipment, to       identify possible risk factors and to establish usage patterns of Valley       Care services.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that       the mathematical and statistical analysis described has been carried out       on a data set of this type in UK and Europe.
Our study identified a number of users at a higher risk of falls,       seasonal peaks in the use of the service (predominantly in the weekends       and bank holidays) and the frequency and type of calls.
Our research       enabled Valley Care managers to establish the volume and frequency of       calls, to identify users at high risk and inform the manufacturers of the       equipment how to write database software to enable Valley Care to plan       efficiently the workloads of call operators and social care workers.
The       Team Manager of Valley Care stated that the research findings have enabled       Valley Care: "to improve the quality and efficiency of the services         whilst operating in the same budget."
As a direct outcome of applying our research, in 2012 Valley Care       transformed its system for the Call Centre operators, specifically:             Providing more efficient workload planning for call centre           operators: This is due to a better understanding of the volume,         type and frequency of calls.
Providing more efficient allocation of warden visits: Wardens         respond to alarm calls day and night.
The mobile warden service visits         clients in their own homes and such visits form one of the most         expensive parts of the Telecare service.
Prioritising calls to ambulance services and relatives: Such         prioritisation could not be done quantitatively nor automatically under         the old system (a key limitation), and thus our research has transformed         Valley Care's Call Centre service.
Eliminating false alarms: Eliminating false alarms         contributes to an overall quicker response from call centre operators to         real emergencies.
The research also provided knowledge about the usage patterns of the       technology and valuably identified clients at high risk of falls.
Monitoring and allocating special attention to clients with a high risk of       falls allows them to live independently at home for longer and thus not go       into residential care.
Laing &amp; Buisson's Care of Elderly People         Report 2012/13 estimates that a person can expect to pay more than       &#163;27,200 per year in residential care costs, rising to over &#163;37,500 if       nursing care is necessary.
Laing &amp; Buisson also report that the UK's       elderly care market is now a &#163;24 billion sector of the UK's service       economy:     http://www.laingbuisson.co.uk/MarketReports/MarketReportsHome/tabid/570/ProductID/548/Default.aspx.
Valley Care is a preventative service, and thus allowing clients to avoid       going into residential care represents a significant saving.
Valley Care provides a Telecare service to over 5,000 customers as part       of the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in the North East of       England (we analysed a subset of 500 consenting clients).
The Team Manager       of Valley Care states that: "the service informs a wider UK ageing         community as part of the NHS Foundation Trust".
Valley Care's Social       Care Call Centre provides a core service for vulnerable and elderly people       to remain in their homes for longer periods, and receives an estimated       129,000 calls per annum (as reported in the Northumberland County Council       minutes from the middle of the evaluation period &#8212;       http://www3.northumberland.gov.uk/Councillor/Upload/CDocs/4380_M516.doc).
As a consequence of our research, Valley Care has been able to transform       the quality and efficiency of their service while operating within the       same budget.
The positive benefits of this research also directly changed Valley       Care's policy for recording call information, i.e.
implementing categories       and attributes proposed by our research.
By extension, Valley Care is       currently in discussion with the manufacturers of its own Call Centre's       software and equipment (Tunstall Healthcare, the world's leading provider       of Telehealthcare solutions) for amendments to their database software       (using the categories/attributes of our research).
Building on our success of applying the TPP method to NHS data, we       foresee significant future impact working with global health       practitioners.
Further interest was generated when we presented details of       this impact case study at the LMS Regional Meeting and Workshop "Mathematics         of Human Biology" (July 2012) and through the MATSIQEL FP7       project, and we have received requests for implementation of the TPP       methodology to telecare data from Bulgarian and South African social care       centres; namely from CITT-Global       (the Center for Innovation and Technology Transfer-Global Ltd; a       European-wide consultancy company based in Bulgaria) and the Sout         hAfrican Medical Research Council.
Evidence for all the impacts described above can be found in a factual       statement from the Team Manager of Valley Care, Northumbria Healthcare NHS       Foundation Trust.
Statements of support from the Managing Director of       CITT-Global and from the South African Medical Research Council also       corroborate our impact claims (see section 5).
