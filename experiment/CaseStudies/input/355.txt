     Between 2008 and December 2012, Motivational Interviewing in Health         Care by Rollnick, Miller &amp; Butler sold 71,748       copies and was translated into 11 languages, prompting the senior       commissioning editor at Guilford Press to note: "Rollnick &amp;         Butler's Cardiff research provided the fuel for a book that has         surpassed all expectations.
It continues to find avid readers from         across medicine and related professions, and has established itself as         the primary source for teachers and practitioners wanting to learn about         the application of MI in different health care settings."
[5.2]     Specific strategies developed in Cardiff have also been integrated into       the 2nd &amp; 3rd editions of the standard Miller/Rollnick       text on motivational interviewing [5.1].
Between 2008 and December 2012,       these texts sold 77,028 copies and have been translated into over 25       languages [5.2].
The impact of the above Cardiff research on clinical strategies is very       diverse and widely disseminated worldwide, embracing guidelines and policy       documents in many countries and continents.
The following examples have       been selected because they provide precise links between Cardiff research       and impact.
Example 1: AETNA Health Insurance Organisation: Prof. K. Resnicow       (Michigan, USA, 2010) used Cardiff health care textbooks, and the       agenda-setting and importance-confidence strategies within them, in the       training of trainers within AETNA, a company with over 36 million members.
The focus was on behaviour change among members with a chronic disease.
Between 2010 and September 2012, 83+ trainers in health care MI were       trained, along with 2,210 clinical staff worldwide, with a reported 43%       increase in engagement in the disease management programme and a 55%       decrease in drop-outs [5.3].
Professor Resnicow notes, "The impact of         Rollnick and Butler's seminal research in Cardiff goes beyond the         private sector and is all but immeasurable.
Leading US government and         professional bodies, e.g.
the American Medical Association, the American         Academy of Pediatrics, and the US Preventive Task Force, have adopted         healthcare MI for the prevention and management of chronic disease"       [5.4].
Example 2: Emergency &amp; Public Health Medicine in USA:       Healthcare strategies evaluated in Cardiff ("pros and cons", "elicit-provide-elicit")       for very brief emergency room consultations with alcohol and drug problems       were used in 1994 by Bernstein (Boston, USA) and Rollnick to       develop a 3-5 minute intervention, Brief Negotiation Interview       (BNI) [5.5].
Bernstein established effectiveness in numerous randomised       trials, and set up a BNI ART Institute.
Since 2008 they       have trained 1525 clinicians across North and Central America.
Data       obtained by Bernstein from the small Boston-based cohort of 52/1525       clinicians (only 3.4% of the total), reveal that in 2011 alone,       BNI was used with 5,158 patients.
For the longer period 2008-2012,       Bernstein estimates that these 52 clinicians saw a total of 44,983       patients, all of whom received BNI, a method of proven effectiveness.
The       programme has been endorsed by the National Registry of Evidence-based       Programs [5.6].
Bernstein notes, "Rollnick's research on brief MI has         had a direct and measurable impact on the delivery of brief intervention         in emergency room settings in North America from Bethel Alaska to         Bayamon Puerto Rico to Yale New Haven and Boston Medical Centers.
The         benefit to patients emerged from our numerous controlled trials.
Implementation of this respectful and effective intervention now extends         way beyond the boundaries of our work here in Boston to many scores of         thousands of patients across the USA and in other countries."
[5.7]     Example 3: Swedish Quitlines for tobacco and alcohol: Dr Astri       Brandell Eklund and colleagues, used a health care text and the strategies       of "agenda-setting" and "importance and confidence" in the training of       staff of these two national telephone services.
Between January 2008 and       June 2012 counselling contact was made with 8,066 people on the alcohol       line, and 17,407 on the smoking line, with a reported quit rate of 36% for       the latter [5.8].
Example 4 - UK Family Nurse Partnership Programme [5.9]: The       founder of this intensive home-visiting programme for pregnant teens in       deprived settings bought 2,500 copies of the Rollnick/Miller/Butler Motivational         Interviewing in Health Care book for distribution among its home       visiting nurses tackling a wide range of behavioural issues (alcohol;       drugs; safe sex).
Rollnick was contracted to provide training and support       to the UK rollout of this programme.
Since 2008, the strategies developed       in Cardiff have been integrated into the training and supervision of 1000+       nurses who have delivered the programme to 9,207 families up to the end of       2012.
Example 5: African low resource settings [5.10] Paediatric Aids       Treatment in Africa (PATA &#8212;www.teampata.org) brings together HIV-AIDS       treatment teams for training from across the Continent.
It covers over 30%       of children in treatment in Africa.
Rollnick was a founding member and       currently a Director, and since 2008, he has integrated health care MI for       medication adherence into training provided in Mbabane, Swaziland (40       teams, 20 countries), Kigali.
Rwanda (40 teams), Gaborone, Botswana (41       teams; 18 countries; 65,142 children in treatment), Cape Town (South       Africa; 20 teams; 10 countries) [5.10].
