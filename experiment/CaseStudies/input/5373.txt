     In the late 1990s-early 2000s, the saiga population declined by 95%, due       to poaching for meat and horns following the break-up of the Soviet Union.
EJMG was already carrying out research on the ecology of the species, and       so her research team was the first to document the threat in the       international peer-reviewed scientific literature.
This provided the       evidence underpinning responses by international conservation bodies,       including (i) inclusion of the species (in 2001) on the IUCN Red List of       threatened species directly into the highest category of threat,       Critically Endangered [A], (ii) its listing on Appendix 2 of the UN       Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS,       2002) [B] and (iii) a Significant Trade Review by the Convention on       International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (2004)       [C].
This international response was crucial in catalysing investment in       conservation both by large international NGOs and by in-country       governments (N.B.
the saiga remains on the current versions of these       conservation lists).
Research by Imperial and collaborators then provided the underpinning       evidence for guiding action on the species by international organisations.
This included an understanding of the characteristics of poachers and the       widespread and consistent nature of the drivers of poaching, documentation       of the damaging effects of highly male-biased poaching on population       dynamics, and evidence that public engagement activities leads to improved       attitudes towards the saiga antelope [e.g.
D, E, F].
This research has directly driven the priorities and conservation       activities of the UK-registered charity the Saiga Conservation Alliance       (SCA) [G], which was formed in 2006 from a network of in-country and       international researchers who had met during collaborative research       projects led by Imperial College, and registered as a UK charity in 2010.
The SCA is now officially responsible for monitoring and coordination of a       Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on saiga conservation under the UN CMS       and is therefore highly influential both internationally and on the       ground.
In addition to its conservation work, the SCA produces the       bi-annual newsletter Saiga News [H] which is the main dissemination       vehicle for in-country stakeholders, set up by E.J.
Milner-Gullland and       collaborators.
This gives information on research outputs in 6 different       languages and is widely read by policy-makers at all levels (international       and national) and by the general public in the range states.
Imperial       research is regularly featured in this newsletter, including research by       Imperial students.
In 2008, Saiga News won `Best Environmental       Publication' at the 7th national contest for Environmental Journalism in       Uzbekistan.
Members of the panel noted that "Saiga News has united         every saiga range country, as well as the international community, in         concentrating their efforts on saiga conservation" [I].
The CMS MOU on saiga conservation came into force in 2006 at the first       meeting of the signatories to the MOU (Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russia,       Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan).
This meeting was supported by Imperial College,       as EJMG drafted the Medium Term International Work Programme (MTIWP) for       the MOU, and co-chaired the technical meeting amending it prior to       adoption by the Parties to the MOU.
The second meeting of the Parties was       held in 2010, and Imperial was contracted by the CMS to monitor and       provide background documentation on the progress made towards the       fulfilment of the MTIWP [J].
EJMG also "drafted a revised MTIWP for         2011-2015, chaired the technical meeting discussing these documents, and         led the associated discussions at the formal meeting of the Signatories"       [J].
The "impact of this activity is that range state governments, as         signatories to the MOU, are bound under their UN obligations to work to         fulfil the priority actions laid out in the MTIWP" [J].
As an       example of Imperial's impact, Imperial research contributed to       highlighting the inadequacy of current monitoring procedures and led to a       push to improve understanding of saiga distributions and numbers, with       Imperial College researcher input in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
The impact of Imperial's contribution to the MOU and MTIWP is confirmed by       the IUCN/SSC who credit Imperial's "invaluable contribution" to the       "knowledge and understanding of saiga biology and ecology, the         socio-economic context in saiga range, attitudes to poaching and the         potential response by saiga to climate change" [F].
They also       confirm that the impact of Imperial's participatory monitoring techniques       describing the methodologies as "pioneering" [F] and state that "Many         aspects of [the] research were used as the basis for the Medium Term         International Work Programme and to inform specific actions within it         and subsequent revisions" [F].
Through engagement with world conservation organisations and the SCA, the       impact of Imperial's research has therefore contributed to:     a) Improved status of the saiga antelope, a critically endangered       species and a flagship of the Central Asian region.
The "Red Listing         and CMS MOU have influenced national policy and spending on saiga         conservation by range state governments has increased, in some cases         dramatically.
Saiga numbers have responded to these conservation efforts         and the population is estimated to have increased by almost 190% between         2006 and 2012" [F].
Improved protection of this species' habitat       benefits the entire steppe ecosystem, because of its wide-ranging nature       and need for large areas of natural habitat.
b) Improved recognition of the educational and livelihood needs of       local people within the saiga range in 3 countries and improved access to       environmental education for children in villages in these regions [e.g.
E].
The SCA confirms the impact of the educational activities stating that       "people (children and adults) who attended educational activities had         significantly better knowledge about saiga antelopes and their         conservation" and, for example, the "SCA's engagement with local         communities and government, and the trust they built between them have         been crucial for the success of saiga conservation work in Uzbekistan"       [D].
From 2008, encouragement by EJMG led to farmers being hired as "observers"       and involved in "saiga monitoring", during which time "local         famers became friendlier to saiga" [E].
The saiga is a cultural       flagship species for the steppe, so engaging local people with saiga       conservation also changes their general attitudes to nature conservation       more broadly.
c) Improved conservation planning at the international and       national levels, as evidenced by the CMS process, and including national       legislative changes documented in Saiga News [H].
As one example,       following recommendations and scientific advice from Imperial College       researchers and colleagues (including [3]), Kazakhstan and Mongolia have       both dramatically improved their aerial survey techniques to produce       relatively unbiased population estimates with confidence intervals; in       2010 in Mongolia [H, issue 10, p18 &amp; issue 13, p10], and from 2008       onwards in Kazakhstan [H, issue 8, p5 &amp; issue 9, p2].
As another       example, the government of Kazakhstan in 2012 designated 490,000 ha steppe       as a protected area with saiga conservation in mind, but benefitting a       wide range of species [K].
d) A raised profile of the saiga antelope and of conservation       issues in Central Asia more generally (historically a neglected and poorly       known region) in the international and local media, including TV       documentaries, magazine articles and interviews etc [L].
e) Improved capacity of in-country scientists through       collaborative research with Imperial, as evidenced by articles in Saiga       News and elsewhere [H, e.g.
issue 15, p16].
There are 12 separate       instances of collaborative research by Imperial College and in-country       partners (e.g.
Institutes of Zoology of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,       Kalmykia State University) given in the CMS's official overview report of       progress towards fulfilment of the MOU on saiga conservation in the period       2006-2010 [M].
This has knock-on benefits for science and conservation       more generally, with people who have worked with Imperial researchers       going on to posts as laboratory directors, university faculty members and       directors of NGOs.
Additionally, the impact of the work of EJMG's group has been extended as       a model of good practice in conservation.
The "Saiga MOU and the         groundbreaking work of E.J.
Milner-Gulland and SCA in facilitating the         technical coordination of the MOU is frequently cited as a success story         both within the CMS Family and to the wider public.
In many ways, the         work under the Saiga MOU is pioneering a stakeholder-led approach to         coordination, which is seen as a model and useful best-practice example         for the development of effective coordination, monitoring and         implementation of other species instruments under CMS as well" [J].
Based on this assessment, the CMS has in 2013 contracted Imperial       researchers to develop a guidance manual for other MOUs under the       convention, to share best practice and lessons learnt on stakeholder       engagement with MOU coordination.
