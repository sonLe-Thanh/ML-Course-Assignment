     Introduction       The research has generated outputs which have made local cultural       heritages accessible to international audiences, have helped to preserve       cultural heritage amongst source-language communities, and have enabled       others to continue these processes.
Jones's translations and commentaries on the works of leading           Dutch, Bosnian and Serbian poets.
Jones research has demonstrated         the effectiveness of `creatively faithful' translation strategies that         reflect style and underlying image.
He implements these in his own         translations, e.g.
using norm-breaking archaic or dialect voices, and         prioritising poetic texture.
The effectiveness of this approach has led         to Jones being seen as "among the finest translators" from Dutch         into English (IMP5) and "the leading and most influential           translator of poetry from South Slavic languages" (IMP1).
The quality of the output ensures wide readership.
This affects three         main groups.
Firstly, English-reading poetry communities (publishers,         critics, poets and general readers) gain significant cultural value by         reading and hearing new, exciting poetry.
Secondly, because English is a         global language, this gives source-language (Dutch, Bosnian, Serbian)         poets globalized reach, raising their status from `famous at home' to         that of `key European poet'.
Thirdly, for source-language communities at         home and in diaspora, seeing `their' poets internationalized via English         strengthens cultural pride.
Expert poetry-translation seminars, and feedback to new           translators.
These transmit research findings which have two key         impacts: (i) they support experienced and novice poetry translators to         produce high-quality translations, thereby (ii) assuring the quality of         the end product.
Impact via research-informed poetry translation       Jones has published 18 book-length poetry translations from Bosnian,       Serbian and Dutch (plus Hungarian and Russian), including four in the REF       period.
His poetry translations have won 14 awards, including 5 from 2008       to 2013 (Sarajevo International Book Fair `Publication of the Year' 2008;       David Reid Poetry Translation Prize 2nd 2008, 1st       2010; Vondel Translation Prize Runner-up 2008; John Dryden Translation       Competition 1st Prize 2013).
These translations are a key       vehicle for cultural exchange; and impact on English-language readers (but       also source- and third- language readers) is considerable: "with         [Jones's] translation work, Bosnian culture has gained [...] an         ambassador the like of whom it has never had before" (IMP2).
Crucial to this success is Jones's prioritisation of style, his "creative         inventiveness" (IMP5), and cultural knowledge, which are       informed by his research findings (IMP1).
Two example poets given       global reach by Jones's translations are outlined below:     1.
Jones has produced the first book-length English translation of       leading Dutch 20th-century poet Hans Faverey.
Selected       poems Against the Forgetting (London, Anvil, 1994; expanded       edition New York, New Directions, 2004; James Brockway Prize, 2005) put       Faverey on the world poetry map.
The Editor/Founder of Leon Works literary       press states that this "introduc[ed] U.S. readers of poetry [...] to         an indisputable visionary of the poetic line" (IMP3),       inspiring her to commission Chrysanthemums, Rowers (Providence RI,       Leon Works, 2011; co-tr.
Lela Faverey, with introductory essay by Jones).
This has exposed the U.S. poetry market to culturally significant texts,       in which publishers are not simply consumers but wider enablers of inter-       cultural communication.
Both of these translations generated further       impact, e.g.
:     (i) A public reading and panel discussion about Faverey at New York Poets       House (2012) &#8212; with Jones, literary publisher/writer/academic Renee       Gladman, leading US critic Eliot Weinberger, New Directions poetry editor       Jeffrey Yang, and Poets House Program Director Stephen Motika (IMP4).
About 30 people attended (a contextually high turnout), including the       Netherlands Consul.
(ii) Reading Jones's English versions "inspired" (IMP5)       translators to translate Faverey from Dutch to French (Po&#232;mes, tr.
Linder and Such&#232;re; Courbevoie: TH.TY, 2012).
(iii) The Project for Innovative Poetry (PIP) website, which received       over 90,000 visitors between 2000-2011, posted a review of Against the         Forgetting (2011), drawing the attention of readers with an interest       in international poetry (IMP6).
(iv) A Faverey biography plus translated poem in the promotional work Dutch         Poetry Classics (2012) by the Dutch Foundation for Literature (DFL),       the Netherlands body overseeing literary `exports'.
A review essay (2011)       on Faverey in The Low Countries (yearbook promoting Dutch       arts/culture) cites Against the Forgetting (IMP6).
2.
Mak Dizdar's poetry collection Stone Sleeper is so       central to Bosnian culture that it appears on Bosnia's 10-mark banknote.
Jones has produced its only English translation (Sarajevo: DID, 1999;       revised edition London: Anvil, 2009), using norm-breaking voice and       poetic-texture techniques to reflect Dizdar's poetic pyrotechnics.
Jones's       techniques emerged from his research, and the resulting work was praised       as having "brought this work into [the] treasury of the world's most         highly-valued cultural achievements" and "a precious confirmation         of [Bosnian] cultural identity" which helped "affirm         South-Eastern Europe's cultural plurality" (IMP2).
Example       evidence is:            4.55/5 rating by 77 readers (many with Bosnian names) on the GoodReads         website; a 2012 review states: "It tells who we [Bosnians] are so we           have to keep on reading it over and over again" (IMP6).
Web/blog reposts of Jones's translations: e.g.
a poem from Jones's         2004 research article (Section 3: 2) on the blog Wonderful Bosnia           and Herzegovina (2008) (IMP7).
Jones's Stone Sleeper was `translated onward' from English         into Urdu (tr.
Hamid, Islamabad, National Book Foundation, 2008)         (IMP2): this secondary impact, on Urdu readers, would not have         been possible without Jones's version.
Bosnian philosopher Rusmir Mahmut&#263;ehaji&#263; used Jones's translations in         an English- language essay (2008) and book (2011) on Dizdar which         promote a non-ethnicized, multi- faith model of Bosnian society (IMP8-9).
Significance and reach: Newcastle research regarding the interplay       between norms, semantic faithfulness, stylistic loyalty and       cultural-political engagement, therefore, promotes highly effective       international communication of poetry.
This (i) gives non-English-language       poets international prestige, bringing them into a global market; (ii)       broadens the cultural experience of native and non-native English readers;       and (iii) enables source-language publics to validate their own culture       via English translation.
Impact via research-informed translator training       Jones's research also informs advice transmitted directly to other       translators, impacting on their translating approaches and subsequently on       readers who benefit from their translations.
Specifically, work with       poetry translators from Dutch has generated impact through poetry seminars       led by Jones at the DFL's `Literary Translation Days' (Utrecht, 2010) (IMP5),       and at Brockway Poetry Translation Workshops in which Jones has acted as       both leader (Amsterdam, 2005) and participant (Rotterdam, 2013) (IMP5)     Jones's research-led internationalisation of poets such as Faverey also       inspires interest in poetry translation amongst novice translators and       creative writers, generating further training impacts.
In 2012, publisher       Renee Gladman invited Jones to deliver two events to staff, students and       public at the Ivy-League's Brown University.
The first was a workshop with       around 8 creative writing students; the second was a talk and reading to       about 15 staff, students and members of the public on poetry translation (IMP10).
These types of engagement activities indicate that Newcastle's translation       research is generating global interest in innovative poetry-translation       methods and greater appreciation for `international' culture, which can       only benefit source poets and cultures.
The DFL's translation support       work, for example, shows how highly the Dutch government values the       globalisation of its literary output via agents such as Jones.
This is       exemplified in the DFL list, from which all literary translations       receiving state funding must choose a translator.
Since 1985, Jones has       acted as an assessor for this list, providing formative feedback for       submissions and helping the DFL to assure the quality of the Netherlands'       cultural exports (IMP3).
