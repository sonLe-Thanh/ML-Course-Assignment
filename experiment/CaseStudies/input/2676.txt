     Goodwin's ground-breaking research into the profile and motivations of       right-wing extremists has       not only improved understanding at a crucial time for responding to the       emergence of new specific       groups and isolated acts of violence, but helped change attitudes and       behaviour through training,       informed policy thinking and development at local community and government       level in the UK, and       internationally.
International Knowledge Exchange       Between 2010 and August 2013, Goodwin was approached and engaged by over       80 non-academic       bodies who invited him to share his research in workshop format and engage       in robust       dialogue.
In North America these include the National Intelligence       Council, Central Intelligence       Agency and Eurasia Group think-tank.
In Europe they include the Council of       Europe, European       Parliament, Open Society Foundation and think tanks such as the Barcelona       Centre for       International Affairs (Cidob), Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and Kreisky Forum.
Influencing UK Government policy       Increasingly Goodwin has come to influence central government on the       issues surrounding the rise       of the extreme right in Britain.
He has presented his research in workshop       format to the Home       Office, Government for Wales and many others (below).
He contributed to       the UK Government's       Foresight Project on Future Identities.
Dr Lucy Mason, the Joint       Deputy Head of Foresight, notes       that it `is among the most downloaded Foresight reports ever, with       more than 5,500 downloads       since launch' and `informed several strands of work in parts of         Government'.
[2]     Other activity which helped to disseminate his work to UK government       include his oral evidence to       the Home Affairs Committee on violent radicalisation in 2011; his project       on right-wing extremism       for the Welsh Government in 2012; and his presentations to Members of the       European Parliament       in 2012-2013, with one MEP describing Goodwin's research as `valuable to       our work', and `has       helped influence our work and perspective on the rise of the       extreme right in Britain, as well as       on a European scale'.
[3]     From 2010, Goodwin was asked to write briefings for Ministers       Sayeeda Warsi, Oliver Letwin,       Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and All Party Parliamentary Group on       Islamophobia.
In 2011,       this led to Goodwin's appointment to the cross-government working         group on anti-Muslim       hatred, responsible for allocating resources to tackle anti-Muslim       prejudice.
After reviewing survey       data on extremism for the Department for Communities and Local Government       (DCLG), the       Department then supported Goodwin's successful bid for a six-month       full-time ESRC Knowledge       Exchange secondment to DCLG, from September 2012 until January 2013       (ES/J020907/1).
Goodwin was at the heart of central government, working with the       Tackling Extremism team on       his core area of research, convening a series of closed workshops designed       to trigger new       thinking, dozens of one-to-one meetings, writing submissions for       Ministers, organizing a       conference for over 70 policy-makers and a `master-class' for over 30       policy-makers at the Home       Office.
Claire Gipson, Head of Prevent Strategy at the Home Office       states: `It is fair to say that Dr       Goodwin's engagement with government on far right and EDL [English Defence       League] issues       has contributed directly to policy thinking and development',       while the Team Leader of the       Tackling Extremism division at DCLG notes: `It is clear that the work Dr       Goodwin did with       us...significantly accelerated and deepened our thinking, ensuring       that it is more rooted in the       latest evidence', and `his ability to provide evidence and analytical       input....were also valuable'.
[4]     Such views are mirrored by the National Domestic Extremism Unit, who note       that Goodwin's       `research has greatly strengthened our understanding of the EDL [English       Defence League]...and       has covered gaps in our knowledge in a way that, as a police unit, we       would find difficult to       replicate'.
In addition to her comments in Section 1, Baroness Warsi notes       that Goodwin       `significantly impacted on the public debate' while `changing our approach       to tackling       Islamophobia'.[5].
From February until July 2013 this extensive engagement       continued under the       University of Nottingham's Hermes Fellowship programme, funding two days       per week of further       knowledge exchange activity.
Influencing local government and community activity       Between 2010 and 2013 Goodwin engaged with 50-100 policy officers at       dozens of workshops       organized by the south-west Counter Terrorism Unit and Birmingham,       Burnley, Camden, Leicester,       Rochdale, Rotherham, Swindon, Tameside and Wigan councils.
One Community       Cohesion policy       officer from Wrexham Council reflects on one workshop with 91 delegates in       2011 as follows: `By       addressing our knowledge gap this work has enabled us to develop our         local approach to         intelligence gathering'.
Another in Burnley reflects: `We made         use of points and analyses from         his research in our management of government funded programmes on       community cohesion and       preventing violent extremism, including a leadership skills training       programme for young people,       and...through the Burnley Good Relations Programme'.
After a more detailed project in Tameside that mapped local support for       right-wing extremism an       officer notes how Goodwin `addressed a gap in our existing knowledge base       and has been         significant in shaping our work in local communities'.
A period of       extensive engagement with       the Greater Manchester police Counter-Terrorism Unit produced similar       reflections:     Initially, we drew on Dr Goodwin's studies and research but it was         soon realised that         collaboration with him would have a significant impact on our ability to         change         attitudes and behaviour in the groups we most wanted to influence.
Consequently, we       worked together for two years both producing training materials for       teachers and lecturers,       and delivering conferences and training seminars.
It would be accurate to       describe both Dr       Goodwin's research...and his personal involvement as critical in the         success of our         projects, which have subsequently influenced work in this area beyond         Manchester         to a regional and national level.
Non-governmental bodies also underscore this influence.
The Community       Security Trust states       that this research `has significantly enhanced our knowledge of       these areas of extremist       politics, and is highly regarded'.
Kelly Simcock, Programme       Manager for the Foundation for       Peace and Co-Chair of the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) Prevent       working group       similarly notes: `Dr Goodwin's work has certainly changed our         understanding of the far right         and impacted our approach to the work we deliver'.
[6]     Extensive media coverage       In addition to the specific impact with policymakers and stakeholders       detailed above, the work has       been brought to the attention of the wider public via extensive media       engagement.
Between March       2009 and May 2013 Goodwin appeared in 146 articles in 15 countries, 78 per       cent of which       referenced his research on right-wing extremism.
This includes one-on-one       interviews in the       Economist, Newsnight and The Guardian and, in 2012,       his address to over 50 international       journalists who work on extremism-related issues at a Thomson Reuters       Foundation workshop in       Istanbul.
[7] The Assistant Editor of the New Statesman credits       Goodwin for his `accessible         presentation of ideas, backed by serious empirical research', while       his prominence is reflected       in over 6,000 Twitter followers, making him one of the most followed       political scientists in the       UK.
