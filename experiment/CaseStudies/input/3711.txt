     Because of this research, the ILO and EU now better understand the       relations between different forms of outsourcing and different logics of       establishing core labour rights: clearly, outsourcing has given rise to       new challenges in coordinating complex supplier networks as well as in the       area of employment relations.
Hammer's research is cited by the ILO       Director General, and in various EU documents.
At the national level Hammer concludes that the state is responsible for       implementing and enforcing labour regulation but this enforcement       mechanism is absent in the case of global employment relations.
IFAs       concluded between MNCs and trade unions have the potential to fill this       gap by implementing core labour rights along MNCs' supply chains.
In       practice, however, there are various challenges involved with realising       this potential.
As core labour rights `travel' from MNC headquarters in       the Global North to distant and sub-contracted workplaces in the South, a       range of actors and interests become involved.
These are the MNC at       headquarters level and the Global Union, the trade union(s) and works       council in the home country, the subsidiary and trade union(s) in the host       country, as well as the tiers of subcontractors (mostly without employee       representation) in the host country.
The challenges in the policy process       are to raise awareness of IFAs among all those actors as well as to       develop implementation strategies that take account of the particular       subcontracting arrangements.
Research at Leicester has helped address these issues in two ways.
It has contributed to initiatives which have raised the awareness of         the value of IFAs to the potential beneficiaries.
These beneficiaries         include organisations such as the ILO and EU, as well as workers' groups         and companies.
It has provided critical in-depth evaluations of IFAs that identify         the key challenges involved with implementing individual IFAs.
Research         was conducted together with trade union actors from Brazil, Malaysia and         Ukraine and identified the interface of subsidiaries and first-tier         subcontractors as the critical hinge in the implementation process.
The         actors' involvement in the research allowed in-depth evidence to be         collected and raised awareness and credibility.
Dissemination and Evaluation     First, as IFAs are voluntary agreements, it is important to demonstrate       their value.
The ILO and the EU have supported this process through a       series of evidence-based workshops, bringing together senior HR managers       from leading companies and global and national trade union representatives       as well as researchers and civil servants.
The central goal was to       highlight the spread of IFAs, their key provisions, as well as best       practice, in order to give legitimacy to this form of social dialogue.
Hammer was invited to numerous high-level ILO workshops to showcase and       disseminate IFA practices.
These took place in 2006, 2008 and 2009.
His       work offered the first complete overview and analysis of IFAs and made an       important contribution to this process of validating and legitimising the       agreements firstly within the ILO and EU and then, through the workshops,       to both companies and trade unions.
Hammer was asked by the Directorate General for Employment as well as the       European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions       to serve on the steering committees for various pieces of research which       were to support the deliberations of social partners, policy makers and       researchers in workshops.
This process was central to the European       Commission's efforts to develop a framework Directive on transnational       collective bargaining.
Taking the EU policy process in this matter       further, the Commission launched a multi-stakeholder consultation on       transnational company agreements in the second half of 2012.
Specifically, Dr Hammer was an invited expert to the following       organisations:            Hans-B&#246;ckler-Foundation (D&#252;sseldorf) project on `Organization and         Regulation of Employment Relations in Transnational Production and         Supply Networks.
Ensuring Core Labor Standards through International         Framework Agreements?
', 2008-2012       European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working         Conditions (Dublin) project on `International Framework Agreements: A         stepping-stone towards the internationalisation of industrial         relations?
', 2007/08       European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working         Conditions (Dublin) project on `Codes of Conduct and International         Framework Agreements', 2006/2007          Leicester researchers have informed and shaped policy debates and built       an understanding of IFAs.
This has also helped in raising awareness at       high, and official, level to the point that IFAs were either formally       embraced (ILO) or considered as a template (EU).
Leicester's research-led       involvement contributed to this process.
The legitimation of IFAs through       these institutions and workshops has generated further momentum,       contributing to a rapid growth of IFAs (currently around 110).
This work       has also been taken up by the ILO's training centre (pointing trade       unionists from all over the world to the potential benefits of IFAs) as       well as in reports by the European Trade Union Confederation.
The second line of contribution and impact is through evaluations of       existing IFA policy and implementation.
Practical research (3) with trade       union stakeholders in Brazil, Malaysia and Ukraine identified the key       stumbling blocks for successful implementation of IFAs.
In particular, it       points to the limits of existing approaches to implementation and `ad-hoc'       complaint resolution, instead directing the emphasis onto dynamics of       stakeholder coalitions and participation (as opposed to top-down       implementation).
Changes taking place     A consequence of the Leicester research is the increasing differentiation       of substantive and procedural provisions in a second generation of IFAs       over the last five years.
This means that actors negotiated more detailed       implementation practices right from the start, rather than dealing with       complaints in an ad-hoc way once they arose     In addition, trade unions within the companies, as well as Global Unions,       have developed more efficient ways of supporting, implementing and       monitoring existing IFAs.
Combining awareness raising with action-oriented       evaluation research, a specific benefit of the Leicester work stems from       exploring topical issues together with trade union stakeholders from the       Brazilian CUT, the Malaysian TUC and the Ukrainian labour movement (3),       thereby underscoring its credibility, both, with regard to international       policy makers as well as practitioners at the national level.
The relevance of Leicester's findings, calling for broader participation       and more active organising activities in implementing IFAs, has been       referred to and underlined by the ILO Director-General when he stated that       `outreach', capacity building and implementation issues have become the       critical issue in developing IFAs further (ILO 2008 Director General's       report, see source a below).
This influence and other similar       instances is evidenced in several ILO and EU working documents, which cite       Leicester's research findings.
