     Pathways to impact       Publications from this research have provided the major route to impact.
Accompanied by press       releases, they have been widely publicised in the media (e.g., a feature       on BBC Radio 4's PM       programme in June 2013 [5.1]).
In addition, Deary and colleagues have       actively pursued impact,       by presentation to policy-makers and at public engagement events.
Impact on public policy       The Foresight Mental Capital and Wellbeing Report (2008), commissioned by       UK Government for       policy-makers, professionals and researchers, cited the research [5.2       a&amp;b]; Deary co-wrote the       supporting state of the science review, `Normal Cognitive Ageing'.
This       report was used to help       construct the independent think-tank New Economics Foundation's `Five Ways       to Wellbeing'       (2008).
The Five Ways have been used by health organisations, schools and       community projects       around the world to help people to take action to improve their wellbeing.
Deary has contributed chapters to two Age UK publications `Improving       Later Life' (2011 and 2013)       [5.3 a&amp;b] with a wide circulation to Age UK stakeholders (over 5,000       copies distributed).
The Head       of Research at Age UK [5.4] cites the project results as directly       influencing Age UK policy and       giving it the authority to sit on advisory committees and influence       policy, including the inclusion of       "dementia" in the UK Coalition Government Program for Government [5.5].
As a result of publication [3.3] (2012), the UK Minister for Universities       and Science asked to meet       Deary [5.6].
Referring to the Nature paper [3.3], he said, "This         is an illuminating study; ingenious in         the way it drew on the database; and fascinating in showing that a         quarter of the change in         intelligence across the lifespan is explained by genetic factors."
Deary and colleagues presented the LBC1936 research to the Scottish       Government Cross Party       Group on Older People Age and Ageing (Sep 2011) [5.7] and to Edinburgh       City Council A City for       All Ages (June 2010).
They also presented to NHS Health Scotland the       importance of cognitive       ageing for the Scottish population.
The Director of Public Health Science,       NHS Health Scotland       stated "As a result of this, cognitive epidemiology and ageing are now         part of the thinking and         debate in Health Scotland" [5.8].
The team has also provided written and oral evidence to the Scottish       Parliament Finance       Committee Demographic Change And Ageing Population Inquiry [5.9],       highlighting the importance       of the LBC1936; the fact that how individuals age with respect to       cognition is dependent on many       factors.
Furthermore, they emphasised that "a quarter of the variation in       lifetime cognitive change       is estimated to be caused by genetic differences, implying that the       majority are non-genetic and       therefore may be subject to social and public health interventions."
Impact on public engagement       The UoE group's two publications on the genetics of intelligence [3.3,       3.6] have sparked enormous       public interest internationally, and resulted in articles and comments       online, comments on Twitter,       more than 300 articles in the international press and 2,600 views of       videos about the research on       YouTube.
Since 2008, Deary and colleagues have presented the research to the       University of the Third Age,       many Probus clubs and retired people's groups and at the Edinburgh       International Science Festival       (family audience; April 2010-2013; 2013 visitor numbers: 3,055, 58%       children).
Impact on culture and creativity       To celebrate its 75th anniversary, the Wellcome Trust       commissioned a play about the LBC1936.
`Still Life Dreaming', was performed to over 700 people at the Edinburgh       Festival Fringe (Aug       2011).
The BBC Arts correspondent Will Gompertz said "The play reveals         some of the results and         explores the subject of cognitive aging.
Which is interesting."

There were reviews in       whatsonstage.com, the BBC Review Show (19 Aug 2011), and an article in The       Times (20 Aug       2011).
Actor Simon Callow commented directly on the project in an article       in the Times (15 Feb       2010): "I was able to spend a day with Deary and his team of         exceptional scientists...I can think of         no more urgent and important project for every one of us."
The LBC1936 has been the focus of a series of art works.
Linda       Kosicewicz-Fleming's       (www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/transformations) [or http://tinyurl.com/mstw2bs]       photographic and video       installations were exhibited (200 attendees) and a discussion event held       (40 attendees; Apr 2010).
The work also appeared at `The Art of Ageing' (Newcastle, Jan-Mar 2011).
This work was profiled       in The Times (24 Apr 2010, p. 31), linking physical fitness and mental       ability, and in a YouTube       video viewed over 1,300 times.
The LBC1936 is the focus of a permanent exhibit at the Science Museum,       London (daily footfall up       to 20,000) in the "Who Am I?"
gallery, which opened in June 2010.
