       The research findings regarding 20th Century design in Britain have         directly impacted upon museum curation in the North East of England.
Buckley has contributed as advisor in the formation and on-going         development of the Henry Rothschild Study Centre (HRSC) at The Shipley         Art Gallery, Gateshead; and as consultant for their Heritage Lottery         Fund project `Collecting 20th Design'.
Her research insights have         contributed to the Gallery's transformation over the last three years as         one of its most important collections has been opened up to the public,         museum professionals and to academics and its design collection has         benefited from a distinctive rationale underpinned by key purchases.
The combined benefit of Buckley's research from 1986 to present         (emigr&#233;s, ceramics, modernist design in Britain) developed the         curatorial and public understanding of the collection particularly with         regard to emigr&#233;s, modernism in Britain and, retailing of crafts and         was, firstly, to develop understanding of an internationally-important         collection of studio ceramics and the role of collector, Henry         Rothschild through the establishment of the HRSC; secondly, to         contribute to the presentation and exhibition of ceramics; and thirdly         to underpin the on-going enhancement of the HRSC's mission with the         successful AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award studentship (as this added         and developed preliminary research on Rothschild).
Buckley, through her research, engaged with the Friends of the         Shipley's strategic aims, contributing to the establishment of the HRSC.
The HRSC's goal is to communicate academic research to the wider public         through and alongside their ceramics collection and archive.
From May         2009 Buckley was involved in a key initial meeting organised by the         Friends of the Shipley Art Gallery and its curatorial staff, to plan the         development of the HRSC.
Buckley was engaged in subsequent meetings with         curators to determine the remit and purpose of the Collaborative         Doctoral Award (starting September 2011).
The research findings had an impact upon the curators of the Shipley         Art Gallery, as Buckley was one of three experts on an Advisory Panel         (with Gareth Williams, RCA, and Christopher Wilk, V&amp;A), with Buckley         included due to her specialist knowledge of the regional design history         as well as ceramics.
The Panel advised on the selection and acquisition         of design for `Collecting 20th Century Design' project (May &#8212; June         2009).
It changed curatorial strategy as Buckley proposed, on the basis         of her research insights, that the Shipley choose objects which         demonstrated the ways in which modernism had contributed to the visual         and material culture of the North East of England, rather than to         reiterate a London-centric approach.
It achieved wider public value by         influencing museum-practices outside the capital city.
To date, the         project has resulted in the collection of several key design objects         that tell a different story about design in Britain as well as view         established designs through the different prism of networks of design         normally ignored.
The strategic research findings on design and gender, design in Britain         and fashion have had a direct impact in relation to the development of         design curricula in the USA.
This has been through new MA programmes at         Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian National Design Museum In New York (MA         Decorative Arts and Design degree) and Parsons School of Design in New         York (MA Fashion Studies).
Three intensive MA modules have been         developed and taught `Design and Gender' (2008, 2010), `Designing Modern         Britain' (2009, 2011) and `Fashion and Everyday Life: Britain and         America, 1890-2000' (2012).
These modules have had a direct impact on 85         mature students who came to the MAs from a variety of backgrounds,         including business, design practice, journalism, and academia.
Sarah         Lawrence, Dean of Art and Design at Parsons School of Design credits         Buckley's research, saying it "helped to re-invigorate a           well-established but theoretically under-developed Masters           programme..." Buckley's third module was an intellectual         cornerstone of the newly established MA Fashion Studies.
MA curricula         for these two internationally-renowned MA programmes were fundamentally         changed as a result of the underpinning research, thus bringing benefit         to students studying for this MA; the course directors and educational         institutions; interns; and design practitioners.
Buckley's ongoing impact is extended through her research strand         `transnationalism and design specifically relating to ceramics'.
Buckley         is developing a collaborative project with the Dorman Museum,         Middlesbrough (funded by the AHRC Cultural Engagement grant, 2012)         exploring Christopher Dresser's Linthorpe Art Pottery and Dresser's         collecting of art pottery.
This will benefit the Dorman Museum's users         and its curatorial practices.
As with the HRSC, the Dresser collection         at the Dorman Museum, recently enhanced by the Lyons Ceramics         Collection, generates huge international interest but its reach is         underplayed; the collaborative project will seek to address this.
