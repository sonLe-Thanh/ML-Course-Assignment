     The research has had a range of international governance, human rights       and legal opinion impacts.
The work of evidence gathering through       monitoring freedom of assembly is designed to produce outcomes that will       enable wider engagement with the relevant state authorities, particularly       police.
It aims to have a positive impact on the way that assemblies are       controlled and monitored by police and has involved the following impacts       to date:     4.1 International Governance Impacts       In 2007, the ODIHR working group was transformed into a standing Expert       Panel on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly which Jarman was invited to chair,       initially for a five-year period.
This appointment has been extended for a       further five years (2012-2016).
The Panel has had ongoing responsibility       to promote and update the Guidelines of Freedom of Peaceful Assembly       and to improve public and legal understandings of and respect for this       human right.
The initial draft of the Guidelines was co-authored by Jarman       for the OSCE/ODIHR and in 2008 it was adopted by the Council of Europe's       European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission).
The       ODIHR Expert Panel and the Venice Commission continue to work together on       issues relating to freedom of assembly, particularly on joint legal       Opinions, as well as further editions of the Guidelines.
The Head of the       Human Rights Department of OSCE has noted that, `Mr. Jarman has       strengthened ODIHR's capacity to promote freedom of peaceful assembly and       contributed, also directly, to improved legal frameworks, strengthened       monitoring capacity of civil society and better practice of policing       assemblies in a number of OSCE participating States' [1].
4.2 Impacts upon Human Rights' Law       The Guidelines of Freedom of Peaceful Assembly have been cited by       the European Court of Human Rights as an authoritative source, most       recently in the case of Vyerentsov v. Ukraine (App.No 20372/11) in April       2013; and also by the Polish Constitutional Court (case no 105/6/A/2008,       in Polish).
In both cases, the Guidelines provided essential research       evidence of best practices and key principles of freedom of assembly.
The       courts made definitive rulings on the basis of the guidelines as the       criteria for maintaining international legal standards.
They have also       been widely disseminated and cited in legal proceedings in other countries       (including Belarus and Russia) to promote understanding of issues relating       to freedom of assembly.
As part of this process, they have been translated       into Russian, French and Arabic (to facilitate engagement with the Arab       Spring countries) and also into Armenian and Romanian.
The Head of Legal       and Judicial Reform Advice in Armenia has advised that Jarman `made an       important and significant contribution' to the Guidelines which were used       as the foundational material for `drafting and adopting the new Armenian       Law on Freedom of Assemblies in 2011' [2].
The Guidelines were also widely cited as an authoritative source by the       UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of       association, in his first annual report published in 2012 (A/HRC/20/27) in       which he noted the Guidelines as being, `the most advanced set of good       practices available' (see footnote 7 of his report) [3].
4.3 Impact through Legal Opinions and Human Rights' Monitoring     Jarman's research for the ODIHR Panel on Freedom of Assembly has also       involved:            Preparing legal Opinions on draft or existing laws relating to freedom         of assembly upon request from a representative of the government in the         relevant country.
Since 2008, Jarman has co-authored Opinions on laws         for Armenia (June 2008 and December 2012); Sarajevo Canton (June 2010);         Serbia (October 2010); Ukraine (October 2010 and October 2011); Kyrgyz         Republic (May 2009 and December 2010); Belarus (March 2012); Poland (May         2012) and Tunisia (December 2012 and April 2013).
In a number of cases,         the Opinions have resulted in amendments to draft or existing laws as         follows:                 In April 2008, Jarman attended meetings with the Armenian government         at which he discussed changes that had been made to the law on         assemblies following large protests in March 2008.
This advice resulted         in a further Opinion paper to the government which, in direct response,         agreed to repeal sections of the law and amend others, in particular,         providing for spontaneous or non-notified assemblies which had hitherto         been considered unlawful.
In November 2011, at a public event in Kiev, Jarman presented findings         of an ODIHR Opinion on a draft law on assemblies prepared by the         Ukrainian government.
Partly in response to the critical Opinion, the         draft law was subsequently withdrawn and a third draft law text was         introduced into Parliament in July 2013.
Jarman's work with ODIHR on amendments to the Polish law on assemblies         in May 2012 resulted in an Opinion that led to a number of changes to         the draft law.
These changes related to the removal of an increase in         the notification period prior to gatherings taking place and clarifying         the specific responsibilities and liabilities of the organiser in order         to make the law compliant with international human rights' standards.
In 2010-11, Jarman provided support and guidance to a working group         involving civil society representatives and government officials that         was set up by the Armenian Ombudsman to prepare a new law on Freedom of         Assembly for the Republic of Armenia.
This resulted in a more liberal         law which was designed to comply with European standards and which came         into force in April 2011.
Jarman's comparative research on the monitoring of human rights in         South Africa, USA and Ireland led in 2008 to the development of a         research and training programme on monitoring freedom of assembly for         ODIHR.
Jarman has since delivered this on behalf of ODIHR to human         rights' organisations in Moldova (2008); Armenia (2009); Kazakhstan         (2010); Kyrgystan (2011); Georgia (2011) and Serbia (2011).
Research-led         training was designed to build capacity among civil society         organisations and was the prelude to a period (of between six months and         a year) of formal monitoring of assemblies to gather data for a         subsequent report.
In each country the findings of the monitoring were         published in a research report, which was co-drafted by Jarman.
Subsequently, the research reports were used by OSCE/ODIHR and the         national partner to begin a process of engagement with the government,         the police and municipal authorities as follows:                 In Moldova, the monitoring report was used to engage with the         municipal authority in the capital Chisinau to improve their         understanding and respect for the law; it was also used to engage with         the police as described in point 5 below.
In Armenia, the monitoring report provided an evidence base that was         used to inform the process of preparing the current law on assemblies         (as outlined in 2 above).
It was also used as a means of engaging with         the municipality in Yerevan and the national police.
The OSCE Mission in         Yerevan subsequently began a programme working with security forces in         monitoring and policing public assemblies.
In Kyrgyzstan, the monitoring report fed into (a) the wider process of         reforming the law on assemblies and (b) enabling the OSCE Mission in         Bishkek to work with civil society groups to increase awareness of how         this fundamental freedom was being respected.
In 2011 and 2012, Jarman's work impacted directly on capacity         building.
He involved members of ODIHR staff in his research protocols         and practices enabling them to lead their own research programme in         relation to two specific types of assembly: Pride events and global         summits.
This has resulted in an ODIHR report Monitoring of Freedom           of Peaceful Assembly in Selected OSCE Participating States (May 2011 - June 2012).
ODIHR has used the findings of this report to inform         their engagement with selected states and, in particular, with the         police (see point 7 below).
Further research-based training of ODIHR         staff in March 2013 was undertaken to support a second cycle of assembly         monitoring which began in May 2013.
In Moldova, the research reports produced by the monitoring of         assemblies began a process of engagement with the police which resulted         in a 2010 research and training project on public order policing run by         CREDO, a Moldovan human rights organisation, and on which Jarman acted         as expert consultant.
In Armenia, Jarman's research undertaken on monitoring with the police         was adopted by the OSCE Mission in Armenia from 2009, which employed a         former UK police officer to develop a training programme in order to         address some of the issues raised by the research.
Jarman's overall research on monitoring led to a further OSCE/ODIHR         programme initiative to produce a Handbook on Policing Public           Assemblies in March 2013.
Jarman is a member of the project         advisory group.
This guidance for police commanders is designed to         enable them to police assemblies under human rights' compliant         procedures.
4.4 Impacts on UN Special Rapporteur Reporting       Research on freedom of assembly has led to changes in international legal       facilitation and judicial rulings through advice given to UN Special       Rapporteurs, as follows:            In 2011, Jarman provided advice and assistance to the Special         Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, South         Africa for the latter's annual report to the United Nations which         focused on the use of force during public assemblies, (UN Report:         A/HRC/17/28).
Jarman's research was acknowledged in footnote 5 of the         report [4].
In November 2012, Jarman was invited to Kenya to meet the Special         Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association         to discuss and help frame issues to be included in his 2013 annual         report (UN Report A/HRC/23/39).
The Rapporteur noted that, `The work         that he and his colleagues do in the OSCE is clearly cutting edge' [5].
In January 2013, Jarman facilitated a number of meetings for the         Kenyan Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly         and of association as part of the latter's country visit to the UK.
For         example, this included arranging meetings with members of local         communities to ensure that their views and concerns were reflected in         his report (UN Report A/HRC/23/39/Add.1) following outbreaks of violence         in a range of cities in the UK.
In his first report to the Human Rights         Council in 2012, the Special Rapporteur noted that these were `the most         advanced' Guidelines available for consultation [5].
Nationally, the Guidelines have been used by organisations and         political leaders in their efforts to resolve disputes over public         assembly.
For example, in 2013, the Police Service of Northern Ireland         used the Guidelines in their management of the protests around the G8         summit.
The Guidelines have also been cited by The UK's Joint Committee         on Human Rights in their report Demonstrating Respect for Rights         (2008-09) and by The Equality and Human Rights Commission in the Human           Rights Review 2012.
