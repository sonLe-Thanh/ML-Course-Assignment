     Perhaps the most significant impact of the research described in Section       2, which underpins all others, is its vital contribution to creating a       paradigm shift in how people &#8212; and particularly the heritage sector in the       UK, Europe and the rest of the world &#8212; understand the risks of climate       change to cultural heritage.
Research by CSH was the first to highlight       these risks and, in so doing, focused attention on both the impacts and       the mitigation and adaptation strategies needed to safeguard cultural       heritage from these threats.
This research has above all informed       international policy and for the first time brought to the attention of       decision makers the potential of damage to cultural heritage across the       globe from climate change.
Research by CSH has thus had wide-reaching influence on international and       national heritage policy, through UNESCO, the Council of Europe and       English Heritage.
Through this means, research has had an impact on many       of the most important historic properties in the UK, Europe and globally.
For instance, English Heritage lists 374,081 listed buildings or groups of       buildings, 19,717 scheduled ancient monuments, 1,601 registered historic       parks and gardens, 9,080 conservation areas and 17 World Heritage Sites.
The UNESCO World Heritage List includes 725 cultural properties in 153       countries.
The management of a large proportion of these properties, and       of listed buildings and World Heritage Sites in particular, is affected by       the CSH's research findings.
As a result, the focus of 'Heritage Counts       2008', the annual survey of the state of England's historic environment       produced by English Heritage (who had commissioned the original CHS       research) on behalf of the Historic Environment Forum was on climate       change [1].
This CHS research [b, c] provided the vital evidence on the       impacts of climate change for international groups involved with heritage       conservation.
Before then heritage managers focussed on average rather       than extreme climate conditions affecting cultural heritage.
This is       demonstrated by the debate the research instantly occasioned, and its       subsequent adoption in key international frameworks.
For example, the       Decision at the 31st Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in       Christchurch, 2007, requested `the World Heritage Centre and the         Advisory Bodies to integrate policies and strategies established by the         World Heritage Committee on the issue of climate change in the         implementation of the strategy for risk reduction at World Heritage         properties'.
In 2008, UNESCO World Heritage Centre published a       Policy Document on the Impacts of Climate Change on World Heritage         Properties which referred to CSH research as 'a model for other         regions of the world' [2; pp.
5-6].
Also in 2008, UNESCO's Management         Plans for World Heritage Sites: A Practical Guide advised the       inclusion of reference to climate change impacts: `International         climate research has shown beyond doubt that climate change is both         progressing and accelerating ... World Heritage is also affected.
If         effects are visible or feared, observations and counter measures should         be described in the management plan' [2].
These were implemented in management plans which took effect during the       impact period, and UCL research expertise was deployed to support this.
For example, the 2007 update of the Tower of London World Heritage         Site Management Plan's Objective 7: Assess the risks to the Tower posed         by climate change and review the options for mitigation of those effects,       states that: `Historic Royal Palaces has begun a programme to assess         the risks of climate change and review the options for mitigation of its         effects.
It is assisting the Centre for Sustainable Heritage, University         College London, in developing a study to assess risk, and examine         adaptive capacity.'
[3; item 6.4.29].
In 2008, the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and       Artistic Works (IIC) also organised a roundtable discussion on `Climate       Change and Museum Collections' at which this research [b, c] was       presented as part of the panel of experts.
This was the first time that       awareness of climate change impacts on museum collections was recognised       at an international level; until then, the focus had been mainly on the       impacts on buildings and landscapes [4; p.2].
This research also led the Council of Europe European and Mediterranean       Major Hazards Agreement (EUR-OPA) to commission a report on the Vulnerability         of Cultural Heritage to Climate Change (November 2008) followed by a       workshop which produced a Draft Recommendation on the Vulnerability of         Cultural Heritage to Climate Change [5].
This draft       recommendation was approved at the 57th meeting of the Committee of       Permanent Correspondents (European state parties) of the EUR-OPA Major       Hazards Agreement (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 15-16 October 2009) [6].
This agreement is an important platform for co-operation in the field of       major natural and technological disasters between Europe and the south of       the Mediterranean.
Thus approval meant EU ministerial recognition of the       risks posed to cultural heritage by climate change.
Recognising the       importance of incorporating this research into practice, the Council of       Europe sponsored 7 European Master-Doctorate Courses and workshops between       2007 and 2012, most of which took place within the census period.
These       courses, based on the EUR-OPA report [5] were attended by 152       postgraduate students from 46 countries who chose to follow research       careers or professional careers in the heritage sector.
The course was       co-designed by UCL researchers who based their teaching explicitly on       research into wetting/drying of historic structures and into the       adaptation strategies for historic buildings developed at UCL [7].
In the UK, research has had a significant effect on understanding of the       impact of climate change on cultural heritage.
In Spring 2008, researchers       were invited by English Heritage to contribute to its Conservation         Bulletin: A Bulletin of the Historic Environment, which focused on       the issue of `Adapting to a Changing Climate' [8].
As the leading       opinion former in heritage circles, English Heritage's Conservation         Bulletin is published twice a year and is circulated free of charge       to more than 15,000 conservation specialists, planners, opinion-formers       and decision-makers throughout the UK and abroad.
By presenting research       by CSH in order to spell out threats and opportunities, it shows how       English Heritage recommends conservation in the context of climate change.
The significance of CSH research, and its application to individual       properties, is demonstrated by the use to which it has been put by       heritage professionals.
The research on the stresses caused by rapid       drying [a] was conducted in partnership with an insurance company       and a dehumidification company.
Both benefitted commercially from the       research in ways which exemplify the wider impacts on the sector.
As       indicated in Section 2, insurance companies typically advocate rapid       drying after flooding so that a building can be brought back into use, a       belief which was challenged by research.
One partner, Ecclesiastical       Insurance, specialises in heritage insurance in the UK, Ireland, Australia       and Canada, with a turnover of &#163;497.7 million in 2012.
This insurance       company, in particular, received confirmation of what it had anecdotally       believed to be the case: as their then Chief Surveyor reported, CSH       research `provided the evidence Ecclesiastical Insurance needed to         support its slow approach to drying of flood damaged historic building         in order to reduce the risk of damage to the structure, fixtures and         fittings from rapid drying' [9].
This confirmed that       Ecclesiastical Insurance's advice to its property surveyors was correct       and that rapid drying of flood damaged properties was to be avoided.
The       involvement in the research project of Historic Scotland's Brodick Castle       and The National Trust's Blickling Hall, both of which were subject       respectively to driving rain and flooding due to rainwater run-off, gave       these two heritage organisations opportunities to further their knowledge       on the impact of climate change, and in turn, fed into their improved       management plans.
For example, the National Trust has continued its       scientific research on flooding effects at Blickling Hall, with UCL       support [10].
