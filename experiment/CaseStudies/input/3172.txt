     Mazzucato's work has changed political discourse about how governments       should drive innovation.
As a result of private meetings with ministers,       public presentations, think-tank publications and media appearances, both       the UK government and opposition have taken on board her view that the       state has a more direct role to play in the development of innovative       industries.
A letter from the office of Chuka Umunna MP (Shadow Business       Secretary) notes that her work makes a cross party `contribution to       improving the quality of public debate and political discourse' [C1].
Influence on discourse is demonstrated in speeches as well as public       endorsement of her work, but there is also concrete evidence of changing       policies and new government programmes.
This influence is felt in Europe       as well as the UK.
In terms of a fundamental underpinning of policy approaches to       innovation, Minister of State David Willetts has cited her work on The         Entrepreneurial State in two recent speeches, where he credits       Mazzucato with introducing into the UK the understanding of the state as       not only fixing markets but also shaping them [C2a/b].
The work was       referenced in BIS's key 2012 growth paper which underpinned the       government's growth agenda [C3] and her influence on the Secretary of       State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable's growth strategy       was highlighted in the CBI's Business Voice magazine [C4].
Cable       cited Mazzucato in his August 2013 speech on why he set up the Catapult       Centres, and Mazzucato was invited to present her views alongside Cable at       the launch of the government's Innovation Strategy which took place at       Nesta on 21 November 2012.
Her research has had an impact on the Labour Party's Shadow BIS Strategy,       with the Special Advisor for Chuka Umunna MP stating that his flagship       `Active State' agenda, which culminated in a speech he gave in Liverpool       in March 2012, was greatly influenced by Mazzucato's insistence on a new       framework (C1b).
In listing what government must do to nurture       innovation-led growth, Umunna states in this speech "For some, this         might be viewed largely as an extension of the 'market failures'         argument.
I'd take that.
But it seems to me that there is a difference         between government positively adding new dimensions to the market, and         government simply oiling an existing machine."
(C1b).
The work showing the effect of US government investment on Apple has       influenced the government's approach to `picking' technologies for       investment, noted by Willets in the `Our High Tech Future' speech (C2a)       and this has fed through into sector policies.
Willett's has acknowledged       Mazzucato's influence not only on his understanding of technologies       needing direct support (the basis of his `8 Great Technologies'       initiative) but also the UK's Life-Sciences Strategy, when he said; "Our         initiatives aimed at bridging the valley of death have been influenced         by Mariana's work that has shown that even in the US government goes         close to market in supporting life sciences.
We are now doing the same         in Britain."
(C1b).
Indeed, her work was referenced in the House of       Commons oral evidence taken before the science and technology committee       `Bridging the "valley of death": Improving the commercialisation of       research' (C5).
The influence of the research has not been restricted to the UK.
The head       of policy in the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs wrote that: "Professor         Mazzucato's vision has had a significant impact on current policy         discussions in the Netherlands on innovation policy, specifically in         relation to the role of mission-oriented research and the role the         government can have in this area."
(C6a) This is the result of       Mazzucato's presentation to the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, and a       direct briefing of the Minister, Herald Kamp in January 2013.
Following       her presentation to economists in the department, Mazzucato then recorded       a 15-minute interview for the national TV news (C6b), and a two-page       spread in the NRC newspaper on Feb 3 2012 (C6c).
This prompted much       discussion in social and traditional media, these, as acknowledged by       Deputy DG for Enterprise and Innovation, Wessling, `also indirectly       influence policy-making'.
Her work has also had a strong influence in the European Commission,       where Mazzucato sits on two `high level panels' influencing EC innovation       policy.
Clara de la Torre, the Director of the EC's DG on Research and       Innovation states in a letter "...your powerful advocacy has motivated       many of my colleagues here and in national authorities and your research       has provided new scientific evidence for the rationale of research and       innovation policies."
(C7a).
Indeed, the EC chose an interview with       Mazzucato on her thinking to launch its new Horizon 2020 magazine (C7b).
Given the high risks that an active government agenda entails, Mazzucato       has also highlighted the importance of earning back a reward on the       upside, to cover the losses on the downside.
In a recent article in Research         Fortnight, it was stated that Mazzucato's work is directly       influencing the way that the Labour Party is considering allowing       government to earn back a return on its investments (C8).
Her work on       risks and rewards is highlighted in an influential Report written by the       High Pay Centre (C9) where it is stated that her work presents a framework       for understanding the "relationship between value creation and value       extraction".
One of the key ways in which Mazzucato's work has influenced the       political discourse on industrial policy and post-crisis economic recovery       is through her high profile media activity.
Mazzucato has contributed       actively to broader policy and media discussion of industrial policy and       post-crisis economic recovery.
In the past eighteen months, she has       appeared twelve times on BBC Newsnight, five times on the Radio 4's Today       Programme (once with Vince Cable), and several times on BBC World News,       Bloomberg and Sky News.
She has written regularly for The Guardian       newspaper, and her TedGlobal talk generated extensive coverage from CNN,       Le Monde, NY Times, Forbes [C10].
In the Independent, journalist Margareta Pagano has       written that Mazzucato's work on the role of the government in being the       lead engine of innovation-led growth should be "bed-time reading for all       MPs".
In a book review in the Financial Times Martin Wolf       concludes, "This book has a controversial thesis.
But it is basically         right.
The failure to recognise the role of the government in driving         innovation may well be the greatest threat to rising prosperity."
And most notably, The Economist, which usually depicts the       State as a menace to innovation, admitted in a recent review of her book       in the prestigious Schumpeter Column, "Ms Mazzucato is right to argue         that the state has played a central role in producing game-changing         breakthroughs, and that its contribution to the success of         technology-based businesses should not be underestimated."
