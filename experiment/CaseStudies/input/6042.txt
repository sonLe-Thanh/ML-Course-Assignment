     The research described in &#167;2 has given rise to economic impacts on and       for multinational companies and SMEs through:            the transfer of reliability modelling and evaluation methods into the         design and manufacturing flows of ST Microelectronics, assisting them to         achieve mass market penetration of their inertial devices in several         commercial sectors including the gaming and the cell phone markets;       the transfer of the Design for Test solutions arising from this         research into the UK SME BCF-Designs Ltd.
This has resulted in a new         Research &amp; Development program funded by both private and public         sector sources resulting in new contracts for BCF-Designs and an         increase in the company's value.
The transfer has also assisted with the         dissemination of enabling test technology into the structural health         monitoring sector;          Specific details are as follows:     The application of the research described in References 2 and 3       and later in Reference 4 has supported ST Microelectronics in         commercialising new products &amp; processes.
The research reported       in References 2 and 3 was used to provide reliability data       associated with the materials, fabrication process and moving structures       within MEMS test devices that was essential to the uptake of ST       Microelectronics MEMS 3D accelerometers in the Wii gaming console by       Nintendo in September 2006 that remain in use today [Vigna_2006].
The characterisation technology developed through this research, together       with further work with ST Microelectronics on a MEMS gyroscope [Reference         4] in 2008 that also delivered an optimised design, has provided ST       Microelectronics with the enabling reliability analysis tools [V_2012]       that have supported the evolution of ST Microelectronics MEMS products       from a $30M dollar market in 2006 to $450M in 2008 and $900M in 2012 [Yole         2102].
This growth has been primarily due to the uptake of ST       Microelectronics inertial devices, and in particular the gyroscope       technology, by several leading cell phone manufacturers, including Apple,       over the REF period.
In 2011 the exclusive use of ST Microelectronics       accelerometers and gyroscopes in Apple iPhones, iPads and iPods accounted       for over half of ST microelectronics MEMS revenue [isupply 2012].
The enabling research in References 2, 3 and 4 has provided ST       Microelectronics with a means to validate, through simulation, the       effectiveness of several reliability characterisation methods in revealing       potential reliability hazards within manufactured structures.
It also       supported research that validated the shock resistance of the original 3D       accelerometers and gyroscope sensor to 10,000g, essential for robustness       requirements in consumer applications.
Between 2006 and 2009 ST Microlectronics, through Beneddetto Vigna (now       Executive Vice President and General Manager of ST's Analogue, MEMS &amp;       Sensors Group), chaired the Industrial Advisory Board for the       Lancaster-led Network of Excellence in Design for Micro manufacture       (PATENT-DfMM, FP6-507255) that supported further research on design for       test strategies.
This research delivered solutions to further improve the       outgoing quality of MEMS based products by providing low cost, high fault       coverage embedded test solutions that utilised electrical only test       techniques.
This led to the research published in Reference 5 that       included work on an ST Microelectronics magnetometer together with a       further two demonstrators from Oxley Developments (an electrochemical       sensor) and QinetiQ (a MEMS accelerometer).
The bias superposition       research with QinetiQ on the accelerometer was extended [Reference 6]       and transferred into QinetiQ during 2008.
Although the use of this       knowledge is classified, QinetiQ are willing to testify that its impact on       their MEMS development programme has been significant [P_2012].
A feasibility study into the use of the inventions in Reference 5       for in-situ testing of aircraft wiring using intelligent connectors and       embedded instruments was carried out by Lancaster and Heriot Watt       Universities in 2006 under the PATENT-DfMM Network of Excellence.
This       research project was approved by the Industrial Advisory Board of the       Network under the chairmanship of Beneddetto Vigna (ST Microelectronics,       see above).
The results from this study underpinned a grant award to       Lancaster University of &#163;380K (2007-2010) from the company BCF-Designs to       address on-line (in-situ) testing of aerospace wiring systems.
The       research led to both public grants from the Department of Trade and       Industry and a US Navy contract into BCF-Designs with the associated       impact of the research on the company's products and services improving         the performance of BCF-Designs from a turnover of &#163;2.5M in 2007 to       &#163;9M in 2008.
The value of the company consequently increased from an       unsolicited offer of &#163;5-6M prior to the launch of this research to their       sale value of &#163;12.5M to ULTRA Electronics in 2008 [S_2008].
This       increase in turnover and value was primarily enabled through the Research       and Development portfolio and associated intellectual property developed       through the research including in-situ test signal injection, nodal       monitoring and superposition of acoustic test stimuli with Lancaster       University.
Further impact on the performance of existing businesses by         consultancy and services was achieved through the launch of several       workshops and co-authoring of an associated expert report by Lancaster       University that focused on the application of embedded test technology       within the structural health monitoring sector [Nexus_2008].
This       work has had positive impacts on the business development of several       companies &#8212; including Centrica, who commissioned Lancaster to conduct a       study into the use of miniaturised health and usage monitoring       technologies for instrumenting off-shore gas drilling installations.
