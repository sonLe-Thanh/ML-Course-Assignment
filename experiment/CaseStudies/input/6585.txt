     Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board     BCUHB commented: `This research is an integral part of the Betsi Cadwaladr     University Health Board's Arts in Health &amp; Wellbeing programme.
The     research activity supports health outcomes resulting from arts interventions     and provides evidence towards further development and funding of this work     to the benefit of patients and families.'
The project was not designed as a     trial of therapeutic intervention; it has been an investigation of changes     in emotional processing during antidepressant treatment, using artist     expression as a qualitative measure.
An unexpected finding is that     involvement in the creative part of the project seems to have had an impact     on participants' sense of well-being.
It would be valuable to test this     finding replicating the work in a larger sample using different artists, and     BCUHB would value this opportunity when resources allow.
The interim     findings suggest that type of intervention can make a useful contribution to     the range of support available to mental health service users, and may also     have a contribution to offer in the field of public health, reducing demands     on acute services.
[source a]     Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT)     FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) is a leading media arts       centre, based in Liverpool.
Offering a unique programme of exhibitions,       film and participant-led art projects, it uses the power of creative       technology to inspire and enrich lives.
As a centre for research and       development, FACT works with partners across the creative industries,       health, higher education and arts sectors to develop multi-disciplinary       projects exploring the relationship between technology and culture.
FACT's       Healthy Spaces programme is based on the belief that artists can play an       intrinsic role in the creation of healthy spaces using digital arts and       new media, with artist interventions encouraging health and wellbeing       within spaces - whether physical, imaginary or emotional.
FACT delivers       this work in a number of ways; for example through participatory projects,       commissions for waiting rooms, in-hospital commissions and online       resources.
Liggett and Heald attended a FACT presentation outlining future plans       including research in the field of Human Futures - Health, Work,       Citizenship, and had the opportunity to talk about their own work in the       field of arts interventions and their impact in mental health.
Liggett and       Heald wrote a proposal through TIN (Talent Incubation Network - PARC NW)       and were invited to present ideas to FACT outlining how they would like to       collaborate with them.
Staff were interested in the themes and approach       they were taking and invited Liggett and Heald to work with them in the       future.
Liggett and Heald are currently working on a research proposal for       further funding through the ARHC in collaboration with FACT.
The researchers aim to contribute to FACT's Healthy Spaces programme and       to FACT's belief that `artists can play an intrinsic role in the creation       of healthy spaces using digital arts and new media.'
The proposed project       will contribute to the public mental health message's `five ways to       wellbeing', through connecting people, encouraging activity through       encouraging a heightened awareness of one's environment, encouraging       learning through art and giving something back to the community through       creating artworks in the public realm.
The project will advance and test the findings from the previous research       by:            Engaging outpatient service users in the creative process via         non-linear videos.
These could be patients who are suffering from major         depression but are treatment resistant or who decline to take         antidepressant medication.
Disseminating the `dream' films from the In-between-ness         project through creative installations, e.g.
projections on to objects /         buildings or in institutional spaces that constitute in-between places         such as waiting rooms, alleyways, etc.
The films will be those made by         people suffering from depression and also the artists leading the         project.
Developing a website / smartphone application to enable service users         suffering from depression to engage in the project.
An interactive model         will integrate one-to-one participation with online engagement in         creative activities.
Providing an opportunity for a PhD candidate to work with FACT's         Healthy Spaces programme.
