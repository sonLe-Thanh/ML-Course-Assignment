     Research undertaken at Roehampton on migration from South Asia and       Eastern and Central       Europe has had a significant impact on policy and practice.
Given the       scale of new migration as a       result of EU enlargement since 2004, the research has been a timely       response to the needs of       policy makers.
The reach and impact of the research can be demonstrated on       three interrelated       levels:            The communication of research findings to wider public and         policy audiences, in particular,         through the media and intermediary organisations has shaped public         discourse.
The research on         patterns of new migration to the UK was reported in The Guardian,         Economist, Daily Telegraph,         Reuters, Datum (Austrian daily) and widely in the Polish media,         and through work commissioned         for BBC Newsnight and the Institute for Public Policy Research.
The         researchers have also worked         closely with the Polish Embassy to disseminate research findings from a         special issue of Przeglad           Polonijny &#8212; Studia Migracyjne to a policy-making audience in         London (November 2011).
Consultation between researchers and external users through         commissioned research and in         advisory capacities, leading to a range of policy changes.
The research         team at Roehampton have         been commissioned to carry out research on the social and economic         impact of migration by         London boroughs of Redbridge, Hammersmith and Fulham, Lewisham,         Greenwich and Waltham         Forest, as well as for the Southland Methodist Trust.
This body of work         has had an impact on         policy decisions on service provision by local government and other         statutory providers in the         health and education sectors; and on the work of advice and homeless         agencies (e.g.
West         London Day Centre, Upper Room, Barka, Club 999 and HomelessLink); and         ethnic/migrant         associations (e.g.
Polish Psychologists Association, Jagonari,         Bangladeshi Workers Association,         Migrants Rights Network).
Collaboration to develop and enrich the impact of research         though longer-term partnerships,         has influenced practitioners.
Working with university and NGO partners         in Vienna, Paris, Sophia         and Burgos with funding from the European Commission's Leonardo da Vinci         programme, the         research team at Roehampton has helped to develop a policy `toolkit'         (`Migrapass') to empower         disadvantaged migrants in labour markets across Europe groups, thereby         promoting social         inclusion.
The impact of the research in greater detail:            The research on the migration strategies and the use of public         services by new migrant groups         raised the awareness of new migrant social needs among local authorities         and other statutory         authorities.
By providing up-to-date data on the use of public services         by new migrant groups,         the research team contributed to strategic and longer term planning by         local government in the         areas of schooling, health, employment services, housing and transport         in the years between         2005 and 2010 (Corroborator 1).
The research on patterns of social integration and exclusion led to         changing policy measures to         ensure that service providers adapted to a changing demographic         environment.
For example,         the research assisted the London Borough of Redbridge in addressing the         needs of Romanian         Roma, whose social habits had led some to congregate in public spaces         resulting in         community tensions.
The research stressed the need to provide space         where this group could         socialise, and the London Borough of Redbridge successfully lobbied         central government in         2009 for additional funds from the Home Office to run the Migration         Impact Fund to address the         needs of Romanian Roma (Corroborator 1).
The study commissioned         by the London Borough         of Hammersmith and Fulham included an evaluation of the policy of         `reconnecting' homeless         Polish migrants run by Barka funded by Hammersmith and Fulham.
This         research showed no         evidence that this policy created a local `magnet' effect.
The research         team advised the council         that funding of Barka should continue since it significantly reduced the         number of rough         sleepers and thereby minimised the potential of health hazards, injuries         or deaths, especially         during winter.
On the basis of this research, Hammersmith and Fulham         extended Barka's         contract to provide support to new migrant groups and to address health         and public safety         issues in the community.
The research also allowed Barka to extend its         work with homeless         migrants across London and abroad (Testimonial 2).
The research on patterns of social integration and ethnic inter-group         relationships enhanced         the knowledge and understanding of local policy-makers and supported         changes to how local         government and other statutory authorities communicated with new migrant         communities.
Research commissioned by the London Borough of Lewisham provided         policy-makers with an         account of the negative effects of the undocumented status of some         migrants.
This         strengthened Lewisham's support for the `Strangers into Citizens'         campaign (i.e.
the         regularisation of undocumented migrants).
The study for the London         Borough of Redbridge         was used to establish and implement the Redbridge Social Cohesion         Strategy, a strategy         essential for forward resource allocation (Reference: Ward).
Research for both Lewisham and         Redbridge councils identified ethnic tensions between groups of         migrants, and subsequently         informed the work of both local governments to promote inter-community         dialogue and         understanding through working with local migrant communities (Corroborator           1.
Social           cohesion in Redbridge 2009; New communities in Lewisham 2009.)
Research on the anti-institutional attitudes and practices of homeless         migrants helped staff at         day centres to understand the value of the bonds among the homeless and         the intimidating         power of bureaucratic arrangements that fostered hostility from homeless         migrants         (Testimonial 2, Corroborator 5).
This helped centre staff to         devise new ways of engaging         migrants to improve their situation and health demonstrating the         harm-reducing impact of the         research.
Centre managers, as well as the umbrella organisation Homeless         Link, drew on         Roehampton's research to plan workloads in anticipation of the         increasing numbers of         homeless migrants (which did occur in line with the research findings).
Homeless migrants         were also helped to voice their concerns about service provision, which         strengthened the         knowledge of centre staff and built mutual understanding between staff         and service users         (Corroborator 5.

The research on economic and social integration among South Asian and         Eastern European         migrants led to the development of concrete policy tools to ensure         better labour market         integration.
The research on migrations from Poland and Bangladesh         resulted in the team         receiving funding from the Leonardo da Vinci Programme for the Migrapass         project.
This         research was a partnership with Autremonde; The Vienna Institute for         Urban Sustainability         `Oikodrom'; the Institute of Research and Information on Volunteering         `Iriv'; the New Bulgarian         University; and the University of Burgos.
This action research project         sought to empower         disadvantaged groups by giving them the skills to be more successful in         the labour market.
The         tested tool &#8212; the Migrapass Portfolio &#8212; has been taken up by three         organisations; the Polish         Psychologists' Association; the Jagonari women's educational resource         centre; and the         Bangladeshi Worker's Association, and is now being used as part of their         standard services.
Through several workshops and sessions with disadvantaged migrants, the         project worked with         50 individuals of Polish and Bangladeshi origin.
This has improved the         day-to-day practices of         NGOs in this field, in particular, in relation to outreach work with         hard to reach populations and         individual migrant communities (Testimonial 3 &amp; 4.
