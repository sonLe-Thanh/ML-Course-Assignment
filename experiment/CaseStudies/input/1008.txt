     A new vibration damping material for hollow blades (Araldite 1641) is         now used as a filler         for guide vanes on more than 2000 aircraft engines [text         removed for publication].
Fan outlet guide vanes are non-rotating aerofoils that guide air flow       from the fan and support the       engine core.
To minimise weight, vanes [text removed for publication]       comprise a titanium skin       into which lightweight, polymer-based filler is pumped.

The pathway to impact of our research was straightforward: work on       syntactic foams was directly       funded by Rolls-Royce with the specific aim of addressing the above       problems.
The research was       in collaboration with Huntsman Advanced Materials, a commercial company       specialising in       chemicals.
The Sheffield group's distinct contribution was to understand       how the chemical and       microstructural properties of the prototype materials were related to       desirable behaviour during       component assembly and in-service use.
Meanwhile, the Huntsman group       contributed the       chemical formulation and production of the prototype materials.
[text removed for publication] Our findings motivated an iterative       development activity [text         removed for publication] to create a material that would surpass       previous materials in damping       and be excellent for component assembly, or blade-filling.
For each       material iteration, we used in-       house finite element modelling techniques to specify the properties of the       material required and       our numerical homogenisation-based model to specify the constituent parts       required.
Huntsman       then produced the material, and we evaluated its performance.
The end       result was a new       commercial syntactic foam comprising a blend of several different polymers       reinforced by glass       and thermoplastic microballoons.
This was marketed by Huntsman as Araldite       1641.

This has reduced       annual maintenance       costs for the engine owners/operators     [text removed for publication]     A revolutionary fan filled with syntactic foam has been developed       [text removed for         publication]     Full-scale rotation and impact tests carried out by Rolls-Royce on fan       blades filled with syntactic       foams [text removed for publication] showed that viscoelastic       filler materials required significant       improvements in creep and impact strength if used in rotating blades.
To       address this, we       conducted further research in collaboration with Huntsman (material       supply), University of Oxford       (very high strain rate tests), University of Nottingham (blade filling       methods) and Rolls-Royce [text         removed for publication].
In addition to material design, our       contribution included the       understanding of creep and failure of the material [text removed for         publication] and included the       development of bespoke predictive software `JM63' for performing Finite       Element analysis of       components that incorporate syntactic foams.
A particle damper for an aero-engine fuel pipe is in use on 580         engines     [text removed for publication] Using the understanding gained from       our research (e.g.
the required       mass, shape, particle type and fill ratios), we guided Rolls-Royce       engineers in the design of a       suitable particle damper [text removed for publication].
The       economic impact is that this damping       technology has been adopted in [text removed for publication] more       than 580 engines [text         removed for publication].
