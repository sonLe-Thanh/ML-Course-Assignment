     Drever and colleagues have worked intensively to bring their findings to       the attention of the public, policy-makers, and industry professionals.
This has entailed public performances of his sonic art works; giving talks       at numerous public events; and dissemination via a range of media       channels.
He has worked closely with the UK's long-established Noise       Abatement Society [NAS],[1] participating with them in       networking events at the Palace of Westminster, giving public talks, and       publishing in their journal SoundScape.
Since 2011 he has also been an       advisor to its international eco-award programme, Quiet         Mark, which is run jointly with the Association of Noise Consultants       and recognises excellence in quiet product design.
Sonic Art works:[2] Drever's       innovative and accessible interpretative sound art compositions and       installations sought to convey to healthy adults, who are generally fairly       tolerant of short-lived loud or unpleasant noise, the striking levels of       discomfort experienced by others.
Thus Sanitary Tones has been       broadcast in its entirety several times, including in the `AV Festival: As       Slow As Possible', curated by People Like Us (Tyneside, 2012) and 88view       Co-LaboRadio (Berlin, 2013); and it has been released online by       Nantes-based collective APO33's Fibrr Records (July 2013) and performed at       the launch in the Mus&#233;e Des Beaux-Arts De Nantes.
Litany of the Hand Dryers was presented as a surround sound       installation at a Goldsmiths "Making a Difference" event in Feb 2013,       attended by 200+ members of the public as well as academics, and an       excerpt was broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on July 18th       2013.
[2] This elicited responses from listeners which,       amongst other positive comments, described their own children's aversion       to hand dryer noise: for example one tweet       shown on the BBC webpage reads "hand dryers terrify my 3 yr old so         much he won't go in toilets ...
He's not the only toddler to have that         fear".
Both works were included in a touring showcase, "Soundscapes           for the Public Realm &#8212; Exploring Practical Applications of         Soundscapes", linked to the EU COST Action TD0804 in association       with the NAS.
It has been exhibited at events for policy makers in       Brighton (2011, 2012), Vitoria-Gasteiz (2012), Merano, Italy (2013) and       Naples, Italy (2013).
Public talks: Since 2011 these have included a talk about       sonic experiments as part of Brighton &amp; Hove's White Night (an annual       participatory festival which attracts c. 25000 people);[4]       a contribution to a `Smart City Talks: Sound City' series; and a       keynote at the "Sounding Space" symposium held at Chelsea College       of Art &amp; Design in June 2013 organised by BE OPEN, a creative       thinktank which runs conferences, exhibitions, master classes and cultural       events.
These talks have not only elicited much interest from attendees, but have       enabled some to find solutions to longstanding problems.
Thus for example  	  a hyperacusis sufferer wrote to say that he had been triggered by       hearing one of them to contact various organisations for help, with a       successful outcome: "I now have Bose noise cancelling headphones paid         for by Access Point."
[5]     Media exposure:[6] On World       Listening Day (18/07/13) Drever was interviewed on Radio 4's Today and BBC       Newcastle.
The research findings were also reported in many newspapers and       blogs, including (in the UK) the Telegraph, Daily Mail, London Evening       Standard, The Independent, and (internationally) the Huffington Post,       Cyprustoday.net, and Miami Newsday.
They were also picked up by numerous       specialist publications produced by public or professional interest groups       (e.g.
Age UK Hearing Aids, Nursing Times, Tinnitus Support, Clearer       Hearing, Learning Disability Today).
It even featured in BBC News         Magazine Monitor: Quiz of the Week's News (19/07/13).
Dissemination to and interactions with industry and public sector           policy-makers:[7] The interest of       professional organisations in this research has manifested in invitations       to Drever to participate in events including, among others:            a roundtable discussion at the Royal Institution of Chartered         Surveyors, in preparation for the 2012 National Noise Summit organised         by Rockwool [the world's largest stonewool insulation manufacturer] and         NAS, at which over 100 experts from the architecture, construction,         acoustic and property professions gathered to discuss new ways to combat         noise pollution in the UK's built environment.2028 It included         contributions and debate from leading authorities from universities,         local and national government and major companies discussing what needs         to be done about the rising levels of noise in our towns and cities.
This contributed to the development of a Noise Manifesto to present to         Government and industry.
the European COST workshop described in section 2 above:         co-participants were members of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, NAS,         and an International Standards Organisation Working Group [ISO 54] which         is developing the first International standard on soundscape (due for         completion in 2015).
The Director of NAS has noted[1] that         "[Drever's] work on the noise effects of high speed hand dryers and           participation in the NAS-led COST Action TD0804 and ISO Working Group           54 projects has been invaluable for knowledge sharing amongst           government and local government policy makers, industry stakeholders           and local people who would otherwise not have been exposed to the           subject."
Drever has written articles for professionals and non-professionals in       non-academic publications[8] including Blueprint       (Nov 2011), a long-established magazine focusing on design, architecture       and style; the Noise Abatement Society's ezine, SoundScape (2012,       Issue 2); the World Forum for Acoustic Ecology News Quarterly (Vol       10:3); and the Acoustics Bulletin (2013, Vol 38) of the Institute       of Acoustics, the UK's professional body for those working in acoustics,       noise and vibration.
His research has also been cited in the AIA/Architectural         Record Continuing Education Program on "Hand Dryer Technology and       Accessible Restroom Design" sponsored by Dyson.
Industry has welcomed his constructive contribution to informing design       priorities.
For example, Mitsubishi Electric Europe has said that "Goldsmiths         is to be congratulated on its work &#8212; identifying an issue before it         becomes even more widespread and suggesting ways that it can be         addressed," whilst hand dryer producers Airdri, Savortex and       Mitsubishi, with distributor Intelligent Hand Dryers, have written that "We         hope that Mr Drever's study will lead to a new standard as hand dryers         must be inclusive for all users."
[9]     A consultant town planner with responsibility for preparing and       implementing the Greater London Authority's citywide noise strategy, to       which Drever was an advisor in 2004, commented in an email dated 7th       May 2013:[10] "Drever's work has had significant         direct impacts, for example, in raising the profile of severe noise         effects on certain vulnerable population sub-groups.
It has also had         wider impacts in demonstrating the need for improving the ways in which         the noise of such equipment is measured, assessed and regulated."
