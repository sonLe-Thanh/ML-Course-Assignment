     Evans' research on visual culture, history and heritage of Mao's China       has long engaged with non-academic audiences including curators,       journalists, film-makers, art practitioners, school teachers and children       and the general public in order to i) use Mao era visual culture, and       specifically posters, as a public space for critical debate about Mao's       China; ii) work with gallery curators and artists to develop projects to       facilitate the dissemination of such debate amongst the general public;       iii) liaise with school teachers in the UK, and particularly London, to       use Westminster's Chinese Poster Collection as a resource for the teaching       of modern and contemporary China.
Since the beginning of 2013, this work       has involved collaboration with a scholar based in the Freie University,       Berlin, to apply the latest digital archive and internet project       management technologies to develop Westminster's Chinese Poster Collection       as an interactive online resource accessible to primary school teachers       and pupils.
Specifically:            Work with schools since 2008 includes lectures to the history         department `A' level students at Portsmouth's Havant College (2008);         workshops and guided group study work with Brecknock Primary School         Camden, and Chace Community School, MX (2011).
Following their visit to         the exhibition, and participation in a specifically designed workshop in         the exhibition space, Year 6 teachers and pupils from Brecknock,         together with Evans, worked on a six week project involving 30 pupils         looking at Mao era posters as a window onto the history of modern and         contemporary China as part of the Key Stage 2 Curriculum.
Pupils have         written about their China project in the school newsletter and have put         together a school assembly based on the knowledge of China they acquired         during the project.
Brecknock's Headteacher is now working with Evans on         developing an interactive and sustainable online teaching package based         on Westminster's Chinese Poster Collection.
In the words of Brecknock's         Headteacher, "Evans' work has been inspirational to Brecknock, which         will now be at the forefront pushing for the inclusion of China in Key         Stage 2 teaching and learning, as part of the International Primary         Curriculum (IPC)."
The success of this project has led to a funding         application in collaboration with the Freie University, and current         plans to make this online project accessible to schools across Camden         will put Camden at the forefront of UK primary schools teaching modern         China within the framework of the Key Stage 2 curriculum.
The exhibition co-curated by Evans on `China and Revolution: History,         Parody and Memory in Contemporary Art' (University Gallery, Sydney,         2010, and RMIT, Melbourne 2011) was visited by 14,000 people.
Many of         these visitors attended public talks and workshops organized by the         curators, postgraduate students and the artists involved.
The show also         facilitated the research team's work with visitors, both directly and         through visitors' books, to assess the draw of posters as a means of         creating a public space for the discussion of difficult and emotionally         challenging issues.
Over 30 Australian newspaper and media reports and         reviews of the exhibition referred to its significance in giving public         visibility and legitimacy to discussion of migrants' experiences of the         Cultural Revolution.
Supported by University and Faculty funds, Evans curated an exhibition         titled `Poster Power: Images of Mao's China, Then and Now' at the         University of Westminster in 2011, which was visited by more than 4500         people.
In email correspondence, conversations with the curator and         media reports, many testified to the impact of the exhibition on         questioning standard interpretations of China's social and cultural         transformation.
Blog reviews of the exhibition posted on The China Beat,         one of the most innovative USA-based blogs on contemporary China, are         further evidence of the exhibition's challenging appeal.
