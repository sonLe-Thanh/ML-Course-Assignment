     The stated goal of WHO community-based public health programmes is to       implement the most appropriate means of maintaining a constant low level       of fluoride in as many mouths as possible.
We have collaborated with         nine laboratories in five different countries on an international         project that aimed to develop a much needed gold standard method for       measuring fluoride in biological and non-biological samples (Martinez-Mier       et al., 2011).
This was the basis for development of a Standard Operating       Procedure, in collaboration with Newcastle University, which has been         used by Fresh Pastures Dairy, Ossett (a).
Mouthwashes are increasingly used as an adjunct to toothpastes in oral       hygiene regimes.
In 2009, we led a project, funded by Johnson &amp;         Johnson, to test the potential benefit of the combined use of a         fluoridated toothpaste and a fluoridated mouthwash.
The original       concern expressed by some was that 100 ppm fluoride in mouthwash would be       too low, but our study was the first one to show that it is sufficient to       maintain salivary fluoride levels, where this is a main concern for dental       professionals and the consumers.
Our study (Duckworth et al., 2009) formed       part of a position paper in the British Dental Journal (b),       which contained key recommendations for the use of such products.
Our       study has also been cited by the British Dental Association: "The value of       mouthwash to orthodontic patients" (c, d).
From a public health perspective, it is very important to observe if a       population receives optimal exposure to fluoride.
WHO recommends that any       fluoride supplementation programmes should be monitored prior to and after       implementation to ensure that ingestion of fluoride from all sources by       the children involved is at the appropriate level.
However, it is very       difficult to estimate total daily fluoride intake in children.
We       developed experimentally-based models allowing the estimation of total       daily fluoride intake and retention from urinary fluoride excretion data       (Villa et al., 2010).
WHO published a monitoring document in 1999       (Monitoring of Renal Fluoride Excretion in Community Preventive Programmes       on Oral Health), which has been a valuable key source to the WHO Global       Oral Health Programme.
A formal review of the guidance was undertaken in       December 2011 at the WHO technical working group meeting to which Dr.         Vida Zohoori of the Health and Social Care Institute, as an         international expert in the use of fluoride for public health, was         invited (e).
Our publication (Villa et al., 2010) has       been accepted as one of the bases for the revised WHO guidelines for         urinary fluoride excretion to monitor community preventive programmes.
Since only 10% of the UK population receive fluoridated water, a school       milk fluoridation scheme was introduced in 1993 as a public health measure       for caries control in non-fluoridated socially-deprived areas.
Fluoride       milk schemes are offered by 510 education establishments in the UK       including more than 40,000 children aged between 3 and 11 years.
Currently       a 189 ml carton of semi-skimmed milk containing 0.5 mg fluoride is the       standard daily dose in the UK.
However, it is not clear that this delivers       the optimal amount of fluoride to balance dental protection against side       effects.
Dr Vida Zohoori, (alongside Dr Anne Maguire, a Professor of       Preventive Dentistry at the School of Dental Sciences, Newcastle       University) was commissioned by the UK National Fluoridated Milk         Advisory Group to investigate the urinary excretion of fluoride         associated with milk fluoridation.
We designed and carried out a       study to provide a robust evidence base for dental public health       consultants and other health professionals to review the amount of       fluoride added to school milk.
Our study did not show any statistically       significant differences in urinary fluoride excretion between the children       who received fluoridated milk containing 0.5 mg fluoride and those who       received fluoridated milk containing 0.9 mg fluoride.
Our study also       suggested that the moderate effectiveness of 0.5 mg fluoride milk used in       the school milk programme could be due to the low fluoride dose in milk       and/or sub-optimal compliance with milk consumption in the children       participating in the scheme.
Our study, therefore, concluded that actual       fluoride milk consumption should be assessed when the efficacy of UK       school milk schemes is being investigated or evaluated, particularly if       the fluoride dose is under review.
As a result of our study, the National Fluoridated Milk Advisory Group         decided in May 2011 that the amount of fluoride added to school milk in         the UK should be increased from 0.5 to 0.8 mg fluoride (f,g).
Approval for this increase has been obtained from all ten participating       local authorities and the change has taken effect since September 2013 (h).
(We appreciate that the date of the implementation falls outside the REF       impact census period, but it is included here to show the evidence       translation process in the round.
The implementation could not have       occurred earlier, due to the school summer holiday period.)
Our study also showed that UK schemes should review their current       monitoring programme.
As a result, in 2012 we (Dr Vida Zohoori, as the       co-author, alongside Dr Anne Maguire, a Professor of Preventive Dentistry       at the School of Dental Sciences, Newcastle University) developed a       protocol for baseline and ongoing monitoring of total fluoride intake and       urinary fluoride excretion in children participating in milk fluoridation       programmes in the UK.
The National Fluoridated Milk Advisory Group's         monitoring group has now prepared a Standard Operating Procedure based         on the protocol we have developed.
