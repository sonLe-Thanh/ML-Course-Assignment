     Techniques developed by PRImA and their partners are of international       standing and used by a number of European libraries (and beyond) and       commercial service providers, they influence international digitisation       policy such as the Digital Agenda for Europe in the area of digitisation,       and are funded through a range of incremental funding streams:             2008-2012: EU 7th           Framework Programme: The Improving Access to Text (IMPACT) project:         Supporting the EU's i2010 vision to significantly improve access to         Europe's cultural heritage, the British Library, the National Library of         the Netherlands and the University of Salford led a group of 15         institutions from across Europe to remove the barriers that stand in the         way of the mass digitisation of the European cultural heritage.
Libraries and archives around the world had relied on digitisation         service providers whose best technologies were designed primarily for         modern business documents (the service providers' largest commercial         market) and were not able to take fully into account the significant         challenges posed by ageing books and newspapers:                Antonacopoulos established the common baseline for evaluating           different approaches to mass digitisation through the development of a           comprehensive, large scale reference dataset with ground truth at           various levels, compiled in partnership with the content-holding           partners and representative of their collections.
Antonacopoulos           defined evaluation metrics and scenarios, and the tools to implement           them.
[7]               The dataset, hosted by the IMPACT           Centre of Competence in Digitisation, is a unique resource; for         researchers to create new methods of digitisation; libraries who want to         evaluate their holdings for digitisation and service providers who put         together workflows of different methods to identify what works best in         given scenarios to enable the objective evaluation of printed holdings.
Covering texts from as early as 1500, containing material from         newspapers, books, pamphlets and typewritten notes, and created,         maintained and expanded by University of Salford (PRImA) researchers,         the dataset forms a repository of document images reflecting the         holdings and priorities of major European libraries, running to over         600,000 document images, ground truthed in 50,000 cases.
The British Library, the National Library of the Netherlands and the         PRImA research lab explored methods of improving Optical Character         Recognition (OCR) for use in the digitisation of less standardised         material, making a significant impact on the digitisation of historical         documents, by focusing extensive research expertise to exceptional         material in both breadth and volume, such as the collections in the         British Library.
This collaboration increased resource discovery success         for historic mass digitisation, maximised production efficiency, quality         and volume, whilst significantly reducing the costs of digitisation.
Aly Conteh, e-Strategy &amp; Information Systems, Programme Manager,           British Library said: "It is absolutely vital institutions like             the British Library, the National Library of the Netherlands and             technical experts like the University of Salford work together,             sharing our experiences and resolving the challenges we face in             digitising historic texts to ensure that we deliver digital             resources, which are sustainable."
2011-onwards: The National Library of the Netherlands utilised         Aletheia to determine the expected quality in results in large scale         digitisation of their holdings.
Based on these findings they used         Aletheia to create a specification for large digitisation contracts to         service providers, ensuring high quality and cost-effectiveness (more         content digitised).
Novel features of Aletheia include the support of top-down ground         truthing with sophisticated split and shrink tools as well as bottom-up         ground truthing, supporting the aggregation of lower-level elements to         more complex structures.
Special features have been developed to support         working with the complexities of historical documents.
International         commercial service providers have taken up the Aletheia methodology         using the technology to implement institutions' digitisation plans,         improve their effectiveness and lower their digitisation costs.
The         technology is openly available for reuse via the PRImA website.
2012: The Wellcome Library commissioned Antonacopoulos to         evaluate what current OCR methods could achieve in the digitisation of         the their archives, including papers of Francis Crick, who discovered         (with James Watson) the double helix of DNA, and helped to crack its         code.
In question was a combination of typewritten documents, notes,         and, for example, versions of Francis Crick's seminal paper         demonstrating the construction of DNA.
Antonacopoulos evaluated which         types of document would yield high quality text after digitisation and         utilised Aletheia to ground truth the documents to test the required         level of accuracy.
During the pilot phase, the Library planned to add         over 1 million images of archives to the Wellcome Library website.
The         evaluation results helped Wellcome assess its digitisation strategy as         well as the prioritisation for digitisation of certain document types         over others.
"Regarding our archival collections, there is a wide range of             content that is theoretically OCR'able.
To find out we commissioned             the University of Salford PRImA           (Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis Research) to do a             benchmarking exercise from which we could determine whether we could             rely on raw OCR outputs, should not OCR this type of material at             all, or to test various methods to improve OCR'ability."
Dr.           Christy Henshaw, Digitisation Programme Manager, Wellcome Library,           Wellcome Trust, Wellcome             Library                2012 onwards: EU 7th Framework Programme: The Europeana           Newspapers: A Gateway to European Newspapers Online         project, with the objective of the provision of more than 18 million         newspaper pages online, is undertaking the aggregation and refinement of         newspapers through the European Library.
Antonacopoulos leads on quality assessment of the refinement           performed on the digitised newspaper pages, developing           state-of-the-art methods that have drastically improved the search and           retrieval possibilities in digitised historical newspaper content.
[8]                2012 onwards: The EMOP: Early           Modern Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project aims to         preserve and improve access to literary cultural heritage by using         innovative applications of OCR technology and crowd-sourced corrections.
Antonacopoulos leads on the development of a web-based system for           crowd-sourced editing of textline segmentation and entity labelling,           and further development of Aletheia for use in font-training for           improved OCR systems.
[9]                2013: The National Library of Slovenia is trialling Aletheia in         the creation of a dictionary of old Slovenian and the Dutch Institute of         Lexicology has commissioned Antonacopoulos to create an historical         dictionary utilising Aletheia to extract terms from relevant texts for         the dictionary.
The National Library of Turkey has commissioned a case         study focused on how OCR might perform on Ottoman scripts, utilising         Aletheia and the evaluation tools to produce the report whether the         digitisation of this material can proceed.
2013 onwards: The SUCCEED: Support Action Centre of           Competence in Digitisation (FP7) project, supports the European         Commission in executing the Digital Agenda for Europe in the area of         digitization:                Antonacopoulos leads on evaluation, to assess on behalf of, and           inform the European Commission of the effectiveness of, individual           software methods as well as complete digitisation workflows in a           variety of digitisation application scenarios.
