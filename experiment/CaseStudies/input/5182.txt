     Impact on the EU regulation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals         The contamination of water sources is a serious threat to the environment       and to human health.
Our finding that fish can accumulate &#339;strogenic and anti-androgenic       contaminants that can       impact on their fertility and health, and that many of these compounds       persist in the       environment, has been cited in a European Environment Agency Technical       report [see Section       5, C1, which cites Hill's publications R2, R3 and R5 above].
This EEA       report has provided       evidence that has underpinned EU policy on endocrine-disrupting chemicals       and their regulation       &#8212; specifically the proposal by the European Commission to regulate levels       of &#339;strogens in       surface waters under recent revisions to the Water Framework Directive       (2000/60/EC) [C2].
Some of our work cited in the report was presented in informal meetings       with the UK       Environment Agency.
A further report by the Institute of Environment and Sustainability, of       the Joint Research Centre       of the European Commission, cited work by Hill's group on the       identification of anti-androgenic       structures in wastewater effluents (see C3 which cites Hill's publication       R4 listed above).
The       report collated information on chemical analytical methods for the new       proposed Priority       Substances under revisions of the European Water Framework Directive       legislation [C2].
Impact on the development of in vivo fish-screening           assays by the EU     Hill's identification of anti-androgenic contaminants in UK effluent has       also been cited by the       Environment Directorate Chemicals Committee as evidence for the need for in         vivo fish-screening       assays which, as a consequence, have now been developed by the EU [C4,       which       cites Hill's publication R3].
Impact on the regulation of Nonylphenol in California     Finally, our work on the toxicokinetics of the endocrine-disrupting       chemical, nonylphenol, in fish       has informed the risk assessment of this compound, which has influenced       state policy and       regulation in California [see C5 which cites Hill's publication R1].
The beneficiaries of this impact are thus governmental organisations       responsible for       environmental policy, the environment and human health and, through them,       populations living       under their regulations.
