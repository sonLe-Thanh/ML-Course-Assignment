     Shaping ITE through the development of stakeholder partnerships and           extension of GWTEI     Following the University of Glasgow's evaluation of the pilot `clinical       model' for ITE, the GWTEI project was subsequently rolled out to schools       across other parts of Glasgow and led to the involvement of the University       of Strathclyde, a cluster of schools in West Dunbartonshire, and four       secondaries and their associated primaries in North Lanarkshire, thus       demonstrating the wide appeal of this model.
Additionally, in February       2012, Irvine Royal Academy and its cluster primary schools in North       Ayrshire became the University of Glasgow's official partner for       implementing the `clinical model' of ITE, extending the reach of the GWTEI       research project well beyond Glasgow.
The project and new partnership       received positive public endorsement from the Scottish Government's       Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning when he officially       launched the partnership at Irvine Royal Academy on 21 February 2012,       commenting that: `I am confident that this truly innovative model of         partnership will be of great value to pupils and teachers in the schools         involved and, importantly, to the student teachers learning the         profession here' [1].
Informing government review of teacher education and career-long           learning     University of Glasgow research influenced and shaped the recommendations       advanced in the Scottish Government's most radical review of teacher       education and professional learning in Scotland for over 20 years.
The       Government's Review was carried out from February 2010 to December 2010,       with the final report, Teaching Scotland's Future: Report of a review         of teacher education in Scotland (TSF) published in January 2011       [2].
Glasgow researchers were commissioned to lead an extensive review on       teacher education and this substantial evidence base lies at the heart of       the TSF investigation.
As well as contextualising and providing       insights into the kinds of initiatives and activities that had been       happening elsewhere to address system-level changes to teacher education,       the Glasgow researchers also made several recommendations.
Their key       recommendation that a much more integrated approach to teacher education,       spanning the career course of teachers and involving more developed       partnerships between the stakeholders, including schools and universities,       is clearly embedded in the final TSF Report.
In addition to formally acknowledging the usefulness of the University of       Glasgow review in the TSF Report, the outgoing Senior Chief       Inspector of Education (2002-2010) who led TSF, regarded it `...as         a very important piece of work which was extremely influential in         helping shape my thinking and the direction of the Review' [3].
Re-Shaping ITE: The `clinical model' as a mechanism for formal           stakeholder partnerships     Additionally, by engaging the Senior Chief Inspector of Education with       the ongoing development of the GWTEI project, during which the researchers       successfully negotiated formal partnership agreements between the       University of Glasgow and local authorities, members of the GWTEI project       team significantly contributed to and informed the recommendations of the       TSF review.
Among other things the TSF Report emphasised       the role of the university in teacher education, the importance of       career-long development and the signifb01cance of partnerships in       learning.
The TSF Report argued that the university location of Schools of       Education might be more fully exploited to reduce, `unhelpful         philosophical and structural divides [that] have led to sharp         separations of function amongst teachers, teacher educators and         researchers' (at p.5).
A view of schools as sites for `well         researched innovation' by `research-aware teachers' was       encouraged (at p.102).
There was also a commitment to the view that `every         teacher should be a teacher educator' (at p.73), which clearly       resonated with the aim of the GWTEI project being undertaken at the time.
The GWTEI `clinical model' is cited in the TSF Report as a best       practice example for other similar `hub school' models which the Report       suggested should be developed across the whole of Scotland.
The Senior       Chief Inspector of Education noted that he found maintaining contact with       research developments at Glasgow very useful for thinking through the       approach adopted in the Report on `hub' schools, which are similar to the       approach that was being researched by the University of Glasgow.
The final       TSF Report draws on the University of Glasgow research, where it       states that:     Current experiments involving a more intensive relationship between a         university and identified schools, analogous to teaching hospitals,         should be pursued as possible models of practice more generally.
Joint         appointments between schools and universities, for example, would         provide a very tangible form of partnership as a practical expression of         the theory/practice relationship (at p. 7).
It also explicitly highlights the benefits of the University of Glasgow       model, where it notes:     Current experiments, for example as led by Glasgow University and         partners, where university teacher educators are based within a         locality, may help to ensure better progression from initial teacher         education into induction and beyond (at p.47).
The influence of the University of Glasgow research also extends to the       formal recommendations made in the final TSF Report.
ITE was one of the       key areas subject to recommendations for change and improvement, of the       final Report's 50 recommendations, approximately 21 related to changes to       ITE; with 5 of these specifically relating to the issues identified in the       researchers' evaluation of the piloted `clinical model'.
The implications of the recommendations in the TSF Report       extended to teachers, school leaders, universities, local authorities,       government, and professional and public bodies.
The Scottish Government       accepted all 50 of the recommendations advanced in the TSF Report,       making it clear that all mechanisms required to implement them should be       put in place.
To this end, it established a National Partnership Group       (NPG) to devise an Action Plan for taking forward the recommendations; the       NPG reported on its Action Plan in September 2012 to the Cabinet Secretary       for Education and Lifelong Learning who accepted it in full on 6 November       2012; the Scottish Government subsequently appointed a National       Implementation Board and committed &#163;3 million over a 3-year period so that       the Board could successfully implement the NPG's plan [4].
The TSF Report, generally, and the GWTEI research project, in       particular, received coverage in numerous media outlets including: BBC         News online, the Herald, the Times Education Supplement         (TES), Holyrood Magazine, and the Scotsman [5];       thus, informing public debate about the state of ITE and training and the       potential implications for the quality of education in schools.
Additionally, Teaching Scotland's Future was used elsewhere in the       UK and Europe during the course of practitioner debate around ITE.
It       played an important role nationally and internationally in shaping       stakeholder debate about teacher education.
For example, Graham Donaldson,       the former Senior Chief Inspector of Education who undertook the TSF       review, used it to underpin presentations to the ATEPIE project, which       advances teacher professionalism and education across the Western Balkans       region, namely: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and       Serbia, in Sarajevo         in April 2013; as the basis for a keynote presentation at the Teacher         Education Advancement Network in Birmingham in May 2013; and in his       presentation on Better Assessment and Evaluation to Improve Teaching and       Learning, and the system-level change needed to achieve improvement in       these areas, to a practitioner conference in Dublin organised as part of Ireland's EU Presidency on 19 March 2013.
Conroy, from the GWTEI research team, presented the emerging findings and       best practice from the research with a range of international       policy-makers and practitioners (c.200) at the Department of Education and       Early Childhood Development's National Forum on Initial Teacher Education       in Victoria, Australia on 29 May 2012 [6].
Other speakers at the Forum       included: members of the Victorian Council of Deans of Education; the       Victorian Minister for Higher Education and Skills and Minister       responsible for the Teaching Profession; as well as the (former) Chief       Adviser on School Standards at the Department for Education and Skills in       the UK.
In this way, the University of Glasgow research, undertaken in the       literature and policy review as well as the design and evaluation of the       `clinical model', can be seen to have stimulated and influenced       practitioner discussion and debate at the national and international       levels.
