     The details of impact are drawn primarily from two distinct yet related       projects led by Charter.
The       first is the consolidation of his research and expertise through his       convening of the ISO panel for       Eco-Design, and subsequently his leadership of Sustainable Supply         Chains through Innovation, a       collaborative project funded by the Department of Communities and Local       Government with the       aim of transferring knowledge of eco-design and sustainability to SMEs.
International Organization for Standardization &#8212; ISO14009:2011         (Eco-design)       In 2008 Charter was elected to be the Convener of International Experts of       ISO14006:2011 (eco-design)       managing the process from initiation to publication of ISO 14006 (July       2011) [1].
This work       builds on his role as the UK expert to ISOTR14062 (eco-design) between       1999-2001.
His       expertise was also incorporated within the aforementioned ILV 2025       Foresight programmes which       also explored the role of standards.
International Standards Organisation       (ISO) is a network of       national standards bodies that has 164 international member organisations,       each of which has the       option to publish ISO14006:2011.
In the UK, ISO14006:2011 was incorporated       by the British       Standards Institution as BS EN ISO14006:2011 Environmental Management         Systems &#8212; Guidelines         for incorporating Ecodesign (ISO14006:2011) [2].
(Full       details of ISO membership are available at       http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/iso_members.htm?membertype=membertype_MB).
The work of ISO14006 has been disseminated to the business community in a       number of articles,       features and activities including:            Charter, M., Clements, V., `ISO14006 &#8212; the new standard in design', The           Environmentalist,         Institute of Environmental Management Assessment, Sept. 2011, pp.

Charter and V. Clements led a workshop on ISO14006 at the Institute         of Environmental         Management (IEMA) conference (UK, Nov. 2011)         http://www.iema.net/conferences/iemaconference/2011           Sustainable Supply Chains through Innovation (SUSCIN) [3]       Building on an established body of research concerned with the business       and organisational       aspect of eco-innovation, CfSD was commissioned by the Department of       Communities &amp; Local       Government (DCLG) to lead Sustainable Supply Chains through Innovation       (SUSCIN) working with       project partners Action Sustainability (AS) and Remade South East (RSE).
The project, undertaken between January 2009 and June 2012, sought to       build the sustainable       business/eco-innovative capacity of SMEs in the South East; deliver       sustainable procurement       training to buyers in the South East; and to bring together buyers and SME       suppliers of eco-innovative       products, technologies and services in the South East.
Match-funded by the       European       Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the South East England Development       Agency (SEEDA),       the project had a total value of &#163;407,677.88 and included programme       design, delivery and       evaluation.
The SUSCIN project developed a series of innovative       activities, workshops and events       for disseminating and transferring research knowledge through active       engagement of SMEs,       procurement professionals and buyers in the South East.
Working with       specific businesses over a       sustained period of time, these activities were bespoke and specific to       the needs of SMEs while       also offering training and development more broadly.
Events included `Meet       the Buyer/Green       Buyer' brokerage sessions, sustainable procurement training courses;       `Green Dragon' workshops;       `GreenThink' workshops; and 1:1 consultancy support.
Specific sessions       focused on the       application of eco-design within environmental management systems (ISO       14006), Intellectual       Property, and Green Marketing [3].
`GreenThink' is a customised process that aims to support individual       companies in developing       more sustainable solutions through existing and new products, services and       product-services.
GreenThink is a staged bespoke process beginning with an initial analysis       of the SME's particular       needs in relation to its existing and/or new product development and/or       innovation processes.
This       is followed by a `GreenThink' open ideas-generation session based on       findings.
The process       addresses: `state of the art' presentation on sustainable innovation and       design; identification of       income generating opportunities; highlighting of obstacles to market       success; 'drill down' focus on       specific opportunities; development of commercialisation plans; marketing       and selling products;       networking opportunities.
The ideas are filtered, analysed and presented       back to the SME in a       succinct report produced within five to ten days of the final workshop.
The report provides       recommendations in relation to a) existing solutions, b) the development       of new sustainable       solutions, and/or c) other innovation/organisational       challenges/opportunities that have been       identified.
The GreenThink process was conducted with 36 SMEs from       Hampshire, Kent, East       Sussex, Surrey, West Sussex, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, during which 247       delegates attended       from 98 SMEs [3].
`Green Dragons' aimed to be a practical implementation of the Forward       Commitment Procurement       (FCP) initiative, which originally arose out of `Procuring the Future',       the `Sustainable Procurement       Task Force' report produced in 2006.
It was designed as an innovative       workshop and consultancy       service, where a team of experienced consultants source and nurture an       eco-innovative pipeline of       products, technologies or services, focused on the construction sector.
Eco-innovative suppliers       were invited, following a selective evaluation process, to `pitch' their       sustainable goods and       products to potential end users such as major construction commissioners       and contractors.
Drawing upon the specific knowledge and expertise of these firms'       specifiers and buyers in their       role as Green Dragons, the project worked to advise the suppliers on how       better to shape and       enhance their offerings to meet the needs of their supply chains [3].
The organisations that provided `Dragons' included: HPW Architects Ltd,       Balfour Beatty; Morgan       Sindall, Skanska, Willmott Dixon, Capita Symonds, Network Rail,       Procurement for Housing and       Sainsbury's.
Eco-innovative suppliers included Ambiental, the producer of       flood risk software       mapping systems used to predict and assess the impact of flooding events       across the whole of the       United Kingdom; Mantle&#174; Building System&#169; who produce a patented, tested       and certified British       system-build solution using `super-insulated' composite materials to       provide a structural solution;       PaintPlus Colour Systems Ltd., whose Paint+ system for all substrates that       is exceptionally durable       and exceeds the stringent EU criteria for environmental compliance; and       Zeta Group Solar       powered lighting technology (Solar Powered Bus Shelter Lighting, Solar       Powered Bus Stop       Lighting, Solar Powered Amenity Lighting) [3].
195 semi-structured evaluation questionnaires were received from 566       participating SMEs.
These       demonstrate that SMEs benefited from improved understanding of the general       application of       sustainability to the development of new products, services and business       strategy, and in particular       support for the development of new business ideas, networking and       collaboration, and buyer       engagement (sources to corroborate impact [5,6,7,8,9]).
Specific       outcomes of SUSCIN include:            566 SMEs and a total of 1235 delegates attended training events and         engaged in 1:1         consultancy       204 SMEs received 12+ hours of business assistance resulting in         improved performance in         21 SMEs       &#163;2.3M reported new business won as direct consequence of participation         in SUSCIN       &#163;0.99M reported net increase in gross value added (GVA)       creation of 3.27FTE new jobs, and identification of a possible         139.35FTE new jobs across         SMEs       17 businesses attributed increased turnover of over 5% to new and         improved products       46 SMEs were enabled to tender for public sector supply chain         contracts (&#163;1.9M reported         business won)       network led to the creation of 53 new research and development links         between SMEs          Building on action research and learning from SUSCIN, ECOMIND and FUSION       projects, Charter       was commissioned by the EU Eco-Innovation Observatory to co-author `Eco-Innovate!
