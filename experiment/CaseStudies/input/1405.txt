     The research on individual victims of fraud has had a significant impact       on policy development by       public, private and voluntary bodies in relation to the services and       structures created to support       fraud victims.
Most significantly it has had a major influence on the       decision to create Action Fraud       with a variety of online services.
The Chief Executive of the NFA stating:     "...the research crystallised thinking that there should be a single         government backed body offering         a reporting service to victims along with the provision of other support         services."
The then Chief Executive of Victim Support also offered this conclusion       on the Button et al (2009)       research on highlighting the impact of fraud on victims and how this       should influence the       development of services for them:     "(the) research will help everyone better understand how victims are         affected, which is key for         developing more effective support services (NFA, 2010)     Action Fraud is now the single point of reporting for fraud related       offences and provides many of       the services which were advocated by the research, such as the point to       report fraud, public       information on the types of fraud which are prevalent, how to prevent       victimisation, the support       available and additional resources for help.
One area which was       particularly highlighted by the       research was the gap in support for SMEs.
The research led to a decision       by the NFA to offer       greater services to these such of fraud, confirming:     "...the findings made us realise it was necessary to do much more to         help such (SME) victims."
Indeed as the NFA (2010) noted in the list of achievements in relation to       this research:     "The research has also influenced the support offered to victims by         other bodies such as Victim         Support, OFT and the Serious Fraud Office."
Since the research the SFO has sought to address gaps with the       publication of a Victim and       Witness Strategy.
This implements many of the provisions advocated by the       Code of Practice for       Victims of Crime, such as keeping victims up-to-date with the progress of       the case and providing a       sympathetic response, amongst others (SFO, 2009 and 2013).
On the day of       publication of the       research, Richard Alderman, Director of the SFO commented:     "I am delighted with the prominence with which victim support is being         highlighted today and I         wholeheartedly commit the SFO to continue its own work, and to         cooperation, in this area (SFO,         2009)."
Another example is the toolkit OFT have developed for practitioners       dealing with `scam' victims       which has integrated within it some of the findings from the research on       the devastating impact       fraud often has (OFT, n.d., p 9).
The findings have also influenced how       bodies such as CIFAS,       which deals with large numbers of fraud victims, organises their campaigns       and services for       victims, as the Deputy Head of Financial Crime and Strategic Intelligence       from CIFAS noted in       relation to the research, it:     "has proved an important part of the foundation on which subsequent         awareness campaigns have         been built."
This research has also had a very positive impact in supporting the       actual victims of fraud and their       families.
There is often a presumption that victims are `greedy' and that       it is partly their own fault       they were victimised.
The research highlighted this attitude in many       organisations and has led       some to reconsider how they do this (see SFO, 2013).
One group which       represents victims of       `scams', Think Jessica and CIFAS have found the research very       useful in helping to articulate their       case to government and other bodies, noting:     "The research served to highlight the previously under-emphasised         emotional toll of this type of         crime."
Think Jessica stated in their letter that the research:     "had been invaluable in highlighting the financial and mental         devastation.."     of fraud on victims and that as a result of the research:     "...existing and new bodies have taken these victims more seriously."
The NFA Chief Executive also confirmed the importance of this in helping       to articulate the case of       fraud victims, stating:     "...through the large scale telephone survey which was conducted and         the many tragic case         studies described in the report.
This has proved very useful in         supporting policy development in         areas where fraud victims are not considered as higher priority as other         victims of crime."
The research in partnership with NatCen for the Sentencing Council (Kerr       et al 2013) builds upon       this initial work and further highlights the impact of fraud on victims       and how the actual loss is not       always the most important factor in the crime.
The Sentencing Council       (2013: 6) have issued a       consultation on the future sentencing of fraud offences, in which it       commented on the impact of this       research :     "The findings from this research informed the development of the         guidelines and particularly the         proposal that emphasis is placed on the impact these offences have on         victims when assessing         harm at step one."
