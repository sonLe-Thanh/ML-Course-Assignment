     Context     Fluorine is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table, yet       its compounds are some of the most useful, this is exemplified in       agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where more than 1/5th of       compounds on the market are fluorine containing, including 30% of the       top-thirty best sellers.
[O'Hagan, J. Fluorine Chem.
2010, 131,       1071]     The presence of a fluorine atom can confer advantageous potency,       selectivity and/or metabolic stability attributes to prospective drug       candidate molecules.
This desirability is tempered by the harsh and       hazardous nature of conventional fluorinating agents; many different       electrophilic fluorinating agents have been investigated, but most are       insufficiently reactive, too hazardous or too expensive for large-scale       applications.
Selectfluor&#174; was developed at Manchester, and between 1993       and 2004 was demonstrated to fluorinate complex molecules, to the point       where it has now been adopted as the method of choice in industry for the       synthesis of a wide range of products, including being the preferred       fluorinating reagent in medicinal chemistry drug discovery projects within       Pfizer "SelectFluor&#174; is a milder, safer and more easily         handled alternative to DAST (diethylaminosulfur trifluoride) and, as         such, it is a preferred fluorinating reagent in medicinal chemistry drug         discovery projects within Pfizer" (Senior Director, Worldwide       Medicinal Chemistry &#8212; Oncology, Pfizer) [A], and used to prepare one of       the most prescribed billion-dollar fluorosteroid products in the modern       pharmaceutical industry.
"Prior to Selectfluor&#174;'s discovery and         development, only a very few companies would dare face the challenges of         producing fluorinated steroids because of the necessity to obtain and         handle perchlorylfluoride, the only reagent available at the time to         provide electrophilic fluorination.
[Previously] perchlorylfluoride used in the production of         fluorosteroids had resulted in the fatalities of 2 production workers,         and as a result, the industry refused to consider commercial production         using the reagent.
With the development of Selectfluor&#174; chemistry,         this stable, safe, and readily handled white solid made it possible for         any company wishing to introduce electrophilic fluorination to do so.
Selectfluor&#174; was a game-changing innovation for commercial         production of fluorinated steroids" (Research Fellow, Arkema &#8212;       formerly at Air Products) [B].
Pathways to impact     Selectfluor&#174; was developed in Manchester by Professor R. Eric Banks in       collaboration with, and funded by, Air Products Inc.
Following its       development the research carried out in Manchester determined and       exemplified the reactivity and conditions of use for Selectfluor&#174; which       has subsequently led to it becoming the world's most widely adopted       electrophilic fluorinating agent to date.
Our publications of Selectfluor&#174;'s reactivity and protocols for its use       were published between 1994 and 1999, shortly afterwards patents       describing the application of Selectfluor&#174; started to appear.
In total       from 1993 to 2012, there have been 134 patents published which cite       Selectfluor&#174; (SciFinder search 07.01.2013), that cover a wide range of       multinational companies, countries and scientific areas.
Impact     As the chemistry and applications of Selectfluor&#174; were developed and the       industrial relevance of this compound became obvious Selectfluor&#174;       production was developed over a 5 year period onto a commercial scale.
It       is now produced on a multi-tonne quantity in America, China and other       countries, with estimated annual production and sales figures of ca.
25       tonnes and $7.5m (USD) per annum [C].
`Selectfluor&#174;'s widespread availability at commercial volumes         and its acceptance by both academic and industrial chemists changed the         way researchers and process development chemists in pharmaceutical and         agricultural industries think about fluorination.
Selectfluor&#174; became         the first tool of choice for any process requiring electrophilic         fluorination and even today it remains the most popular reagent used'       (Research Fellow, Arkema &#8212; formerly at Air Products) [B].
This has impacted on some of the largest pharmaceutical companies, for       example: Bayer for the application and processes for the preparation of       halogen-substituted compounds, for controlling animal pests, especially       arthropods, arachnids and nematodes; Pfizer for the synthesis of fluorine-       containing morpholine compounds as therapeutic mineralocorticoid receptor       antagonists to control hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic       kidney disease; Glaxo Group Ltd for Napththyrdin-2(1H) based compounds of       use as antibacterials, for example in the treatment of tuberculosis;       AstraZeneca AB for the synthesis of compounds used as selective/potent       GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) inhibitors of relevance to treatment in       chronic and acute neurodegenerative diseases, Alzhimer's disease,       Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, diabetes, inflammatory diseases and       cancers.
The area in which the chemistry of Selectfluor&#174; has had the most       significant impact is as the electrophilic fluorinating agent of choice       for the generation of fluorine-substituted corticosteroids used as       anti-inflammatory drugs [D,E].
It is estimated that ca.
80 % of the       currently produced fluorinated steroids, critical for the improvement in       quality of many people's lives, are produced using Selectfluor&#174; and this       is backed up by the patent literature [O'Hagan, J. Fluorine Chem.
2010, 131,       1071].
Fluticasone propionate (from flumethasone or flumetasone) is the active       ingredient in a very wide range of pharmaceutical products for the       treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms.
This fluorinated ingredient was first developed and patented in the early       1960's, based on small scale routes involving the use of anhydrous       HF/Pb(OAc)4, SF4 or ClO3F (perchloryl       fluoride) to introduce fluorine, all of which are hazardous and difficult       to handle.
Since the development of Selectfluor&#174;'s chemistry companies,       such as Hovione, Taro and Farmabios, have patented Selectfluor&#174;-based       methods as their preferred routes, including (but not limited to) EP       1207166 (2002), WO 02/100878 (2002) [F], US 7098328 (2006) [G], and US       7718793 (2010) [H].
These described (and cite) methods based on references       [1], [2] and R. E. Banks et al J. Fluorine Chem.
1998, 87, 1-17, as the       preferred method for the generation of this, and other corticosteroid       anti-inflammatory agents.
This fluorinated steroid produced in this way is sold-on and formulated       into a number of products which sell under tradenames such as Flixonase,       Flixotide, Flonase, Flovent HFA and Advair Diskus.
The latter two GSK       products are in the top 25 selling drugs.
Data from: www.drugs.com/top200.html       (accessed 8.1.2013) or from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics       (which covers US sales alone) shows that these pharmaceuticals for the       years 2009-2012 had total sales of over $17bn, corresponding to ca.
75       million units for Advair Diskus alone.
The reach of this       Selectfluor-prepared fluorine-containing drug is truly international and       benefits many millions of users per annum.
