     TFSL has seen a rapid growth in business through the proven performance       of this retrofittable       plasma source.
According to the CEO of Thin Film Solutions Ltd, total       sales value to date (June       2013) of advanced plasma sources is &#163;2.3 million over a four year period.
Industrial and academic users exist in most of the developed world       including Japan, China, USA,       Europe and UK.
The addition of this new technology, with appropriate training, has       allowed companies to achieve       very significant improvements in the performance of optical filters       produced on existing electron-       beam deposition equipment.
Encapsulation of e-beam optical filters is no longer necessary, as the       films are dense and do not       change with changes in humidity.
Room temperature deposition is now possible, allowing a wider variety of       substrates to be coated,       including polymers.
Optical filters produced using plasma-assist can now show much lower       absorption losses,       improving the performance of laser mirrors.
Very large area substrates (1 m diameter) can now be uniformly coated with       high performance       optical filters, as multiple plasma sources with very uniform coverage can       be fitted into large       chambers.
