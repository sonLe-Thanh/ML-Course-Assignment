     Newcastle research has shaped national policy and practice related to       flooding and agricultural       pollution, and international policy and practice in the developing world       related to managing forested       catchments and sustainable water resources management.
Impact on national policy (flooding and pollution management)       The Environment Agency's (EA) Research Scientist, EA Evidence Directorate       stated [E1]:       "Over the past ten years, Newcastle has consistently provided high         quality evidence and         tools forming some of the key evidence used by the Environment Agency in         this field."
Newcastle University research has had a prominent impact on key national       documents used by the       water industry, regulators, and land managers:            The 2004 Newcastle-led Defra report FD2114, `Review of impacts of           rural land use and           management on flood generation' [E2,P2] provided the         basis for building the research         evidence supporting national policy, policy review and regulation         documents [E1,E3,E4,E6].
The 2008 joint EA / Defra document `The role of land use and land           management in           delivering flood risk management' [E3] defined flood risk         policy mechanisms based on         evidence provided by the 2004 FD2114 report [E2].
The EA's 2010 policy review document "Greater working with natural           processes in flood           and coastal erosion risk management" [E4] recommends the         uptake of the Natural Flood         Management (NFM) approach pioneered by Newcastle, and directly cites our         research [P6]         and case studies [E5].
The EA's 2012 policy document addressing management of diffuse         agricultural pollution         "Rural Sustainable Drainage Systems (RSuDS)" [E5]         advocates using our soft engineering         approach, citing 5 examples from research at Nafferton.
The 2013 report `A Review on Natural Flood Management (NFM)'         which is part of the Defra         policy review "The Economics of Climate Resilience (ECR) project"         [E6] advocates that:         "Construction of a NFM scheme can be much quicker than traditional           approaches ...".
National impact on practitioners (agriculture and water sectors)       The EA's Environment and Business Advisor to the agriculture sector (and       project manager for the       RSuDS report [E5] which has been distributed to all Natural England       and Catchment Sensitive       Farming advisors in the UK's 79 priority catchments) stated [E5]:     "The work at Belford was a pioneering initiative to address a water         management issue within         a catchment at low cost, involving stakeholders and demonstrating the         solid evidence of its         success.
It is a fine example of research involving both policy,         industry and science         practitioners.
...
Many of the measures ... are included in over 40         Catchment Sensitive         Farming grants."
As a key example, although the cost of traditional flood defences (hard       engineering) for the Belford       village in Northumberland was estimated as &#163;2.5M, Newcastle University's       approach of installation       of NFM features which has now successfully withstood a number of flood       generating rainfall events       cost under &#163;250K [E7].
The EA Regional Flood Defence Manager states       in an official video [E7],       "For communities such as Belford that cannot receive traditional         defences, this sort of approach         gives real solutions, real benefits, and at a fraction of the cost."
A briefing paper on NFM from the       Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology review for the Natural       Environment White Paper       [E8] stated: " ... evidence for the efficacy of this approach         has been found."
To support implementation of research findings in practice, the EA/Defra       Making Space for Water       report [E3] recommended "Promotion of advice tools such as the         FARM tool ...".
Hence, Newcastle       University constructed a web-based advisory toolkit `FARM' (Floods and       Agriculture Risk Matrix,       http://research.ncl.ac.uk/thefarm/       ), which has had 3100 unique/first time visitors.
The Construction Industry (CIRIA) practice guide C719 `Land use         management effects on flood         flows and sediments: &#8212; guidance on predictions' [E1], a       primary national resource for policy       makers, farmers, landowners and land managers, governing bodies and       consultants to support       sustainable land use decisions, was co-authored by Newcastle staff [R4, R6       and R7] and uses       concepts, images, and case studies from Newcastle University research       studies [P2,P6,G6d].
A       key practical finding in C719 is that "the effects of land use         management on flooding are expected         to diminish as the scale of the catchment increases".
This was       proposed in [G4] and established in       [G5].
International impact on water resources management       Newcastle's catchment systems approach has led to the development and use       of integrated socio-technical       frameworks for water and land management worldwide.
Two examples are cited       here.
The World Bank-funded Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) engaged       Newcastle University to develop the       first water resources model of the full Nile basin that uses consistent       quality-assured shared data       from the nine riparian countries as part of a Nile Basin Decision Support       System (DSS), enabling a       shared approach to catchment management.
An independent international       panel of experts stated:     "The Nile basin is one of the world's most complex and difficult to         manage trans-boundary         river systems ... we concluded that the data management and modelling         tools developed         largely by Newcastle University had provided a key part of the NBI DSS,         and recommended         that they be used operationally by the NBI countries" [E9].
Several countries in Latin America including Argentina, Ecuador, Chile       and Costa Rica have used       guidelines based on Newcastle University research.
In Argentina, based on       research in the EPIC-FORCE       project [P3], the Director General of Water Resources, Government       of Tierra del Fuego,       and Member of the Federal Commission for Water Resources Management stated       [E10]:     "... Newcastle University has had a direct influence in the definition         of local and national         policies for environmental protection against extreme events ....The         problems and solutions         identified during the project were included as priorities in the         National Water Resources Plan".
