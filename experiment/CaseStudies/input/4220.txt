     Maruna's strategy for maximising the impact of his research has involved       a) frequent high-level       contributions to practice-oriented events, including the Annual Perrie       Lecture for HM Prison       Service (2010) and the 18th Annual Edith Kahn Memorial Lecture       at the House of Lords (Lords         Hansard, 692/100); b) the production of accessible materials and       tools based on his research,       such as a brief summary of desistance research, commissioned by the       National Offender       Management Service (NOMS) for distribution throughout all prisons and       probation trusts in       England and Wales and across Europe by the Conference on European       Probation; and, c) direct       engagement with agencies, including appointments to the two UK bodies &#8212;       the "Correctional       Services Accreditation and Advice Panel" and the "Scottish Accreditation       Panel for Offender       Rehabilitation" &#8212; charged with assessing all new rehabilitative       interventions across the UK.
The impact of Maruna's research has been the transformation of       rehabilitation practice in the UK       and beyond.
The Director General of the National Offender Management       Service (NOMS &#8212; with       responsibility for every prison and probation area in England and Wales       from 2005 to 2010) writes       that as a result of Maruna's research "we changed the emphasis in both         prison and probation to try         and maximise the opportunities to encourage and sustain desistance from         crime.
The changes           were to messaging, staff training and to prison regime design plus a           major programme of           change in probation called the Offender Engagement Programme"       (Document on file).
The       Commissioning &amp; Commercial Director at NOMS with responsibility for       the NOMS Competition       Programme currently competing over &#163;2.5bn of services, writes: "Shadd's         research sits on a very         short list of key individuals who in the past decade have made the most         significant impact on and         have influenced and shaped the policies and practices for offender         services in the UK."
Indeed,       Maruna's research featured strongly in the Ministry of Justice's 2011       Green Paper announcing the       initial plans for the Coalition Government's "rehabilitation revolution"       from 2011 (Sect 5).
Further, the NOMS Commissioning Intentions document which sets       out the framework for the       rehabilitative services it will fund, explicitly refers to the work       pioneered by Maruna that supports       desistance.
The Head of Evidence and Offence Specialism at NOMS writes: "The         evidence base         for what services we commission for prisoners and probationers...has         been particularly informed         by the understanding of desistance from Shadd's work".
The NOMS Guide         for Working with         Female Offenders also states explicitly that "Shadd Maruna's work         (2010)... provides insights and         strategies that are highly pertinent when working with women offenders"       (Sect.
5).
In The         Probation Journal, Eleanor Fellowes of London Probation (2012)       wrote: "The rolling out of new         National Standards can be seen as an explicit adoption of the invaluable         lessons of desistance         research, indeed the file I received as part of my induction into the         new model contained two         articles on the subject by Shadd Maruna (2010), Fergus McNeill and Beth         Weaver (2010)" (Sect.
5).
The Governor of HM Grendon Prison, an internationally renowned       therapeutic prison in       England, writes: "Professor Maruna's work has been widely discussed in         prisons... has permeated         into the strategic development of prisons ... and enabled the           maintenance and promotion of a           humane and empathetic approach to prisoner management" (Letter       in QUB REF Archive).
Indeed, in 2011, Maruna was awarded the inaugural Howard League         Research Medal for work that       "makes an impact and changes penal policy and practice through high       quality research."
One specific area of impact has been in the creation of formal rituals       certifying steps toward       behavioural change following Maruna's (2011) analysis.
For example, in       Durham probation       departments, progression toward rehabilitation is "now formally       recognised" drawing heavily on       "Maruna's research on the importance of ritual and ceremony in desistance"       (Document on file).
Likewise, the Governor of HM Grendon Prison writes: "Having read an         article Professor Maruna         published regarding 'desistance reinforcing rituals'... led to the         setting up of a group of residents         and staff to review this and pilot a new approach.
As a result a new         process of 'graduation' was         introduced where those completing therapy were presented with a         certificate with an audience of         their fellow community members ... family members or friends.
...
This         ... important enhancement         to our therapeutic process and was directly inspired by Professor         Maruna's work".
Maruna's research has also changed the focus of offender therapy from       correcting cognitive       deficits to promoting individual strengths.
The Head of NOMS' Dangerous       Offenders Section       writes: "Maruna's research on cognitive distortions has also changed         how facilitators of sexual         offender treatment programmes approach and address the cognitive         distortions of such offenders"       (Letter in Archive).
Likewise, the Head of Research and Offence Specialism       at NOMS states: "Our         new programmes are significantly more focused on positive targets such         as social capital.
...
This         shift was directly caused by Shadd's work on ... strengths-based         rehabilitation.
We have also         developed a new tool for monitoring the acute risk ... focused on         monitoring men's strengths as         much as their deficits.
Again we chose to take this focus because of         Shadd's work on strengths-based 		rehabilitation" (Letter in Archive).
This impact has also manifested itself directly in a number of new       programmes for prisoners       explicitly based on Maruna's research.
His research was the primary basis       for the development of       a new rehabilitative intervention known as the "Belief in Change       Programme" piloted at HMP       Channings Wood.
The Head of Dangerous Offenders Section for NOMS writes       that "Maruna's         work on desistance, reintegration rituals and strengths based approaches         has been incorporated         into the design and development of various interventions such as the         Healthy Identity Intervention         for extremist offenders" (Letter in Archive).
HM High Down Prison in       the East of England has       declared itself a "Desistance Prison" and invited Maruna to conduct a       "desistance audit" of all       aspects of the prison in 2011.
Avon Somerset Probation Trust (ASPT) has       created a post of       "Desistance Development Officer"; her report Supporting Desistance in         Avon and Somerset         Probation has 75 citations to Maruna's research (on file).
Maruna's       work is also explicitly cited as       foundational for the Good Lives Programme for offenders in Scotland in       both the programme and       theory manuals (on file).
The Chief Executive of the St. Giles Trust,       London, argues that his highly       successful organisation is the "living and breathing" embodiment of       desistance theory: "Shadd         Maruna is a pilgrim in making desistance theory not so much a theory but         a mainstreamed         practice.
... Fascinatingly the most enlightened civil servants in our         field, and there are some with         immense intellect and understanding, are all huge Shadd Maruna fans"       (Letter in Archive).
Maruna       was named a patron of the ex-offender charity UNLOCK and has provided a       strategic framework       for that organisations policy advocacy strategy.
In 2007, Maruna was       commissioned, with Tim       Chapman, to revise the National Outcomes and Standards for Criminal       Justice Social Work       Services for Scotland, and he also produced a substantial report for the       Northern Ireland Office on       "what works" in reducing offending in advance of the devolution of       criminal justice in Northern       Ireland.
As a result of the latter, the NI Department of Justice has made       desistance a central       organizing concept for its Strategic Framework for Reducing Offending,       citing Maruna's research       prominently (Sect 5).
The impact of this research extends beyond the UK.
In a survey of 1,379       offender treatment       programmes across North America, The Safer Society Foundation found that       around 28% of       programmes said they were incorporating "good lives" approaches into their       work (McGrath, 2010,       below).
The US Department of Justice, recently developed a $1.5 million       pilot test of the       desistance model explicitly "based on Maruna's (2010) trans-theoretical       model."
Maruna's findings       were instrumental in the establishment of the first mutual aid       organisation for ex-prisoners in       Japan, the Pathway Prisoner Reintegration Programme in New Zealand, and a       restoration ritual for       individuals completing parole held in Hawaii's State Supreme Court.
Maruna's research has been       the central organising theory for a federally-funded network of community       justice centres in the       state of Vermont and a system of "halfway house" interventions in       Connecticut.
Maruna's research       has also been influential in Singapore where the psychology unit for the       prison service has adopted       an explicitly "desistance-based" approach (Day and Casey 2012).
Likewise,       Maruna has been       invited to consult in Chile, where his ideas are now part of core       practices across several       organisations.
Paz Ciudadana have drawn directly upon Maruna's theoretical       ideas in the drug       treatment courts in Chile, and FASCO have designed the "first after-prison       project that has been       systematised and assessed in Chile" drawing explicitly on Professor       Maruna's work.
