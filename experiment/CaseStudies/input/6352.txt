     Newborn hearing screening services have been, and continue to be,       revolutionised around the world This has directly led to the early       detection of PCHI in thousands of babies, greatly improving their       prospects for fulfb01lling their potential and eventually contributing to       the economy.
The ISVR work [1]-[4] was among several studies       internationally that have been influential in the establishment of NHSPs       in the UK and overseas.
However, the ISVR contributions were distinctive       in their size and quality [5][6][7][15].
Without these specific       contributions, it is likely that universal NHSPs would have been       implemented later, in a different form and with a lower degree of       confidence in their predicted performance.
Impact on health, language development, and quality of life in the UK     After reviewing the evidence [5], the NHS began implementing a       universal NHSP across the UK.
The programme currently screens around       13,000 babies in England every week; an average of 265 of these are       identified as requiring further audiological testing, with 21 then being       identified as having PCHI [11][10].
Between 2008 and 2013, more       than four million babies in England will have been screened, of whom       around 5,000 will have been identified with PCHI.
A respected study found       that the introduction of NHSP reduced the median age for identifying PCHI       from 60 to 10 weeks [8, Fig.
1].
The reduction for the upper       quartile age was even more dramatic: from 140 to 25 weeks, greatly       improving the prospects for these babies.
The MRC currently uses the NHSP       case study on its website [7] as a primary example of the social       impact of its funded research, citing trials [1][2] as key drivers       of the NHSP.
The significant benefits of TEOAE over HVDT &#8212; earlier screening, higher       correct-detection rates, and lower false-positive rates &#8212; have had a huge       social and economic benefit.
Health providers have been able to intervene       at an earlier age, for example by fitting hearing aids or cochlear       implants, leading to improvements in language development [9][16].
In 2012, the Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley, said:     "Thanks to the NHS [NHSP], babies born with a hearing impairment can now       be identified much earlier.
This allows babies with hearing problems to       receive the support they need earlier to give them the best possible start       in life."
[10]     Susan Daniels, Chief Executive of the National Deaf Children's Society       also praised the NHSP:     "If hearing loss is identified at birth, deaf children have every chance       of achieving as well as other children."
[10]     Economic Impact     It is likely that the NHSP has also led to economic savings for society       between 2008-2013 in areas such as cost of education and lost parental       earnings.
Quantifying these savings is difficult, but one recent study       estimated that the lifetime loss of earnings due to PCHI was between       US$300,000 and US$610,000 per person.
This figure, together with costs of       welfare and education, is expected to reduce with early intervention in       cases of PCHI [11].
Impact Internationally     NHSPs continue to be reviewed and developed around the world.
In 2009,       the World Health Organisation (WHO) [12] recommended that a policy       of universal (as opposed to targeted) newborn screening be adopted in all       countries with available rehabilitation services, citing ISVR work [3].
And ISVR research continues to feature in the assessment of NHSPs by       official committees in numerous countries tasked with steering health       policy.
Two examples are in the USA [13], where they reviewed an       existing NHSP in 2008, and in Australia [14], where they       considered the introduction of universal NHSP for the first time, citing [1]       for its high quality.
Summary     In the UK, since 2008 the ISVR contributions have had an impact on many       thousands of patients whose PCHI has been detected earlier than it would       otherwise have been, with profound consequences both for the patient's       quality of life, and for the economy of the UK.
In addition, the ISVR       research continues to influence overseas policy via periodic reviews of       existing NHSPs, the establishment of new NHSPs, and in setting the WHO       recommendations which guide future health policy overseas.
