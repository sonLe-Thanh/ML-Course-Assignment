     The BKK project combined Kabir's research with Fareda Khan's interest in       exhibiting art arising from conflict through the lens of gender.
This       dynamic curatorial dialogue formed the basis for collaborations with a       number of UK museums and galleries, which in turn prompted the invitation       of the following ten South Asian artists, to make and exhibit work, and       participate in events: Priya Sen, Shilpa Gupta (India); Naiza Khan, Sadia       Salim (Pakistan); Yasmine Kabir, Tayeba Begum Lipi (Bangladesh); Sujeewa       Kumari, Anoli Perera (Sri Lanka); and the film-makers Paromita Vohra       (India) and Sabiha Sumar (Pakistan).
The principal event, the exhibition entitled `Between Kismet and Karma',       held at the Leeds City Art Gallery from March to June 2010, exposed       British audiences (85,340 visitors [recorded in C]) to new work by       contemporary South Asian artists.
The impact of the exhibition and its       planning rippled outwards to further collaborations and audiences through       a number of related projects:            Artistic residencies during the period of January-July 2010 placed Sen         at the Gasworks, London and Kumari at Wolverhampton Art Gallery (27,436         visitors [recorded in C]).
Supported by the British Council in Pakistan, an exchange scheme in         February and May 2010 enabled Salim to take up a residency at the         Bluecoat, Liverpool, while Liverpool artist Lin Holland visited the         Indus Valley School of Arts, Karachi, resulting in a collaborative         photographic installation (16,857 visitors [recorded in C]).
Cornerhouse, Manchester's international centre for contemporary visual         arts and independent film, showcased documentaries by Vohra, Y. Kabir         and Sumar (May 2010), followed by a panel discussion (150 estimated         visitors [recorded in C]).
A symposium Beyond Borders at Leeds City Museum (March 2010)         brought together the artists, writers and museums and galleries         personnel.
Tamil-Malaysian-British dramaturge Rani Moorthy delivered the         keynote performance.
At the invitation of Dame Jude Kelly, Moorthy, Holland and Salim         presented as part of the Alchemy Festival of South Asian Culture at         London's Southbank Centre (April 2010).
In response to the exhibition, Yorkshire-based dance group Manasamitra         created the performance piece `Mirror Images'.
BKK's contribution to         diversity was further confirmed when this was performed at Wakefield         Cathedral in July 2010.
These transnational pathways in turn generated new professional       opportunities for participants.
Khan became a Board member of Moorthy's Rasa Productions in 2011.
Moorthy performed at Alchemy 2012 at the Southbank Centre.
The To-Let House, a first novel by Postdoctoral Research         Assistant Hasan dealing with the research themes of conflict in         northeast India, was launched by Khan to an international audience at         Asia House, London, 2011; in the same year it was longlisted for the Man         Asia Literary prize and shortlisted for the Hindu Best Fiction Award.
Numerous creative and intellectual collaborations between symposium         participants were recorded in essays comprising the journal special         issue `Beyond Borders' (A).
The BKK project was discussed in media including the BBC, the Times,       the Observer, TLS, THES, South Asian Times (full list collated in       [C]).
Impact affected the following key areas:     UK-based museums and galleries     The BKK team acted as specialist advisors for museum and gallery staff       who were unfamiliar with contemporary South Asian art but interested in       diversifying their programming expertise.
Kabir's research revealed that       South Asian women artists mobilise vernacular, elite and craft traditions       to interrogate the psychological pressures of a society rife with       contradictory patterns of exclusions and inclusions.
Working closely with       curatorial and programming staff at Leeds City Gallery, the BKK team       identified ten female South Asian cultural producers whose practice       innovatively reflected these mobilisations.
The Learning and Access       Officer at Leeds Museums and Galleries said that `BKK presented the       gallery with a special opportunity to exhibit work by South Asian artists       deeply rooted in their own social and geographic contexts' [D].
Through their various collaborations with artists, venues were able to       challenge widespread assumptions regarding South Asian culture's       conservatism and extend their curatorial practice to respond to both South       Asian and non-South Asian heritage audiences [B, C].
Venues have       acknowledged the crucial role played by Kabir, Khan and Hasan in ensuring       thematic and aesthetic coherence of their projects.
The Exhibitions       Curator at the Bluecoat noted `the importance of Kabir's original       scholarship to the project... in leveraging funding as well as informing       [its] development' [E].
Further recognising the importance of the team's       expertise, the Programme and Engagement Director at the Cornerhouse       observed that their involvement was essential to the import and screening       of films otherwise unavailable in the UK [F].
BKK also provided a model of inter-institutional and academic-artistic       partnership/collaboration that several of the venues and museums       recognised they could use in further collaborations.
For some of the       venues involved, BKK successfully showcased the explicit conjoining of       `theory and practice' in BKK [D].
For others it provided a new model of       artistic exchange and of `hub and spoke' (multiple venues, with BKK as       centre) collaboration [E].
Participating artists and individuals     The South Asian artists felt that their creative practice was transformed       by the brief of `conflict' and new exhibition contexts, and they       subsequently took their transformed themes and media back to their own       countries.
In Salim's words, BKK `changed the way I work and the medium       that I normally employ (ceramics).
I created a cynical/critical response       to the (then) latest developments in the city especially in context of its       architectural spaces.'
Exploring these ideas in her subsequent Masters       thesis changed `the direction of [her] work and inculcated a deeper       dimension of enquiry through [her] art practice.'
Moorthy said of her       keynote performance at Leeds City Museum: `It was the first time I'd       experienced that level of artistic engagement; a platform for women to       talk not only about geopolitical areas of conflict, but also to talk about       their personal experiences in those areas.'
Holland, the only non-South       Asian artist participating in the project, commented that her time in       Karachi increased her knowledge of contemporary Pakistani artists, which       has influenced and enriched her own practice and teaching, and that both       she and Salim worked as a result in new mediums [G].
Communities and general audiences     Each of the participating organisations developed education programmes,       public talks and panel discussions that opened the culture of South Asian       heritage communities to others and encouraged public understanding around       the topic of the `Asian woman' [A, B].
BKK enriched British cultural life       by creating and interpreting artistic capital of South Asian heritage       communities and helped generate awareness and appreciation amongst       non-South Asian and South Asian audiences.
Individual questionnaire       responses record `I didn't realize that there were so many (South Asian       women artists)' and South Asian viewers expressed they could `take pride       in being South Asian' [recorded in C].
Collating feedback confirmed that       the artworks challenged stereotypes about South Asian women and South       Asian art circulating in both South Asian (18% of visitors) and non-South       Asian heritage British audiences (50%).
Of the total visitor figure for       BKK (130,026), 97% of those returning feedback expressed interest in       seeing future South Asian art exhibitions as a result of BKK and over 51%       felt that their understanding of South Asian art had been altered by BKK       [recorded in C].
