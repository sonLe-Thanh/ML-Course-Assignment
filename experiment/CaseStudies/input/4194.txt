     The data from catalyst aging tests are required in the commercialisation       of any new formulation in the automotive industry.
Traditional methods         to achieve this are not only expensive in terms of fuel consumption but         have secondary negative impacts including CO2         emissions.
The realisation that exhaust gas recirculation could be       applied to improve such issues was a significant advance and led to the       development of the patented dynamic Catalyst Ageing System.
This       technique currently out performs all published ageing procedures       in terms of the balance of overall cost.
It was research into the ageing of catalysts within CenTACat that       resulted in a QUB spinout company Catagen Ltd, which was formed in       May 2011.
Catagen produce a range of such ageing systems for the       automotive industry including Labcat.
Each system has been       trialled by industry to advance commercialisation of catalytic       technologies.
The first system was manufactured by FAST Technologies Ltd       in Derry City with product launch in January 2012.
This brought much       needed jobs to a region with the highest youth unemployment in N Ireland.
Catagen will have their own Belfast-based manufacturing facility in 2013,       with FAST involved as a component supplier.
The Catagen technology is regarded as a revolutionary innovation in       laboratory based ageing.
The technique which uses the patented dynamic         Catalyst Ageing System costs just over $3 USD per hour to run which       translates to lower running costs than competitors and faster return on       investment.
This low carbon technology also outputs 50 times less CO2         compared to engine ageing of equivalent catalyst volumes and space         velocities, therefore representing an environment-friendly         technology.
Catagen delivered the first machine to Fiat CRF, Italy       in June 2012 and, at that time, quotations were sent to 6 automotive       companies.
Turnover for the year 2012 was &#163;200k and the company is       projecting sales of &#163;1m for 2013, with a company valuation of about &#163;5m at       that time.
In January 2012 Arlene Foster MLA (N Ireland Minster for Trade) described       Catagen as a "Northern Ireland success story" that followed       a great tradition of local manufacturing excellence in the industry.
This       is backed up by former Director of Ford Motors in the USA (Rose       Mary Stalker) who stated "The automotive industry is built on innovation       and Labcat is a significant and welcome development ... it           will find international success".
Rose Mary Stalker's strong       belief in Catagen resulted in her accepting the position of its Chair in       January 2013.
That international success is now being demonstrated with global sales to         Fiat and General Motors Company (both iconic names and world       leaders in motoring) and a new major deal with Mahle Powertrain, the       second largest company in the world producing engine components.
As well       as bringing economic rewards to Catagen this has been acknowledged by the       Best High Growth Company Award at InterTradeIreland's 2012 all-island         Seedcorn Business Competition.
The global market size is estimated at 15,000 test machines (just       within the automotive sector) translating to a required production       capacity of 150 machines per year (current Catagen capacity is 4 machines       per year).
Further markets will be coming on-stream, such as small       off-road engines (SORE), which will require catalysts.
This will occur       over the next 10 years due to the introduction of new emissions       legislation.
Currently 100 million SORE are produced each year.
In summary the technology, developed at QUB, brings economic growth to       the region with global reach in terms of product sales and environmental       impact.
