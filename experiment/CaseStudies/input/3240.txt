     Between 2000 and 2008, Prof Haklay provided consultancy and pro-bono       advice to third-sector       organisations that used participatory mapping methods, such as London 21       Sustainability Network       and London Sustainability Exchange, which indicated the market need for       participatory mapping       services.
Thus, in 2009, Haklay and partners from the London 21       Sustainability Network       established a social enterprise, Mapping for Change (MfC) [a].
MfC       projects help communities         use mapping and geographical technologies to collect, analyse and       display information about       their life and environment, and then develop action plans on the       basis of it.
Projects are       developed through a process of co-design with the participants themselves,       and examples of these       projects are given below.
Any profit is reinvested in the company to       provide further support to       communities and groups that require help.
Mapping for Change currently has the equivalent of three full-time staff,       with an additional two       consultants employed on an ad-hoc basis.
Since 2009, MfC has secured more         than 20 contracts         worth over &#163;435,000 and support from public, private and third       sector organisations across       Europe.
It has delivered more than 30 projects in many communities, directly         engaging over         5,000 people and reaching far more online and indirectly [b].
The       website has registered       around 2,000 users, with some 3,000 additional users carried forward from       London 21.
Users do       not need to be registered to use the maps, but can register to add data.
Google Analytics shows       that in the 12 months to 30 June 2013 almost 15,000 people visited the       site, which had more than       30,000 page views.
Visitor numbers of 16,800 were recorded the preceding       year, growing from       8,200 in the corresponding period for 2010-2011 and 3,400 for 2009-2010.
In the last year, 50% of       visitors came from the UK, with others from countries including Poland and       Spain (where MfC has       major projects running), the US, Mexico, France, Turkey, India and       Germany.
Almost 4,200 visitors       visited the site more than twice in the last year.
Clients include leading       charities such as the British       Trust for Conservation Volunteers, the Department of Energy and Climate       Change, and       international clients such as the Northern Alliance for Sustainability       (ANPED).
Mapping for Change holds 198 themed map layers containing more than       15,000 points of       community-sourced data, with each layer designed by the relevant community       group themselves.
The layers are grouped into around 60 mini-sites, which are maps for       individual communities.
Mini-sites       can be hyper-local (focusing on a neighbourhood), regional, national or       international.
MfC       prioritises engaging local communities and ensuring that its projects are       inclusive, and this system       and the way it is used allows community groups to be fully involved in the       design of their maps       from the outset of any project.
Noise pollution and air quality on the Pepys Estate, London           (January 2008 - Ongoing): The       Pepys Estate in Deptford, London, suffered noise pollution from a local       scrapyard.
In 2008,       residents used noise meters supplied by MfC and were involved in the       development of a       measurement protocol that was both scientifically sound and practical to       implement.
Between       January and February 2008, they took more than 1,500 noise measurements       throughout the day       and night to develop their own `noise maps' [c].
As a result, the Environment         Agency appointed         an acoustic consultant to carry out a detailed analysis of noise in       and from the scrapyard,       which led to the scrapyard's licence being revoked [d].
Lewis Herlitz,       Director of the Pepys       Community Forum, said: "The Noise Mapping work is a major breakthrough for       residents.
It       allowed them to develop an evidence base about how noise damages their         quality of life.
It       shows that their long-standing concerns are real and need to be acted on.
It provides an       opportunity for greater community engagement around monitoring and       speaking up for an       improved environment.
There is no going back" [e].
In 2011, residents wanted to assess the estate's air quality.
Diffusion       tubes (commonly used to       measure nitrogen dioxide) were placed around the area, and wipe samples       taken to assess the       quantity and type of metals being deposited on vertical surfaces.
Ozone       levels were measured and       leaf samples collected.
As a result of the mapping survey, the local         authority (Lewisham) has         installed diffusion tubes at the main junctions identified by the         project as having higher levels       of NO2.
They also installed a PM10 monitoring station in the       neighbourhood to monitor the local       situation [f].
Previously, the closest fixed monitoring station was just       over a kilometre away.
Local council policy changes, Barking 2008: Working       alongside the neighbourhood       management team in Marks Gate, Barking and Dagenham, Mapping for Change       led the       development of a local action plan from the results of 130 individual maps       of local perceptions in       2008 created by local residents.
The neighbourhood management team used       the participatory       process to identify the issues of most concern to the residents and then       act on them in       collaboration with a range of local stakeholders, including the police and       local authority.
These       included a community group organising for a previously dirty lake to         be cleaned four times a         year, with the council parks' service allocating a budget       for the clean up; the mapping team       acted as a link between community groups and council departments, with the       result that the library         is now open three extra days a week and its issue figures have       doubled; local street pastors         use the map to identify and target anti-social behaviour hotspots;       and information about       crimes reported to the mapping team that were not reported to police have       been passed on,       helping the police develop a more accurate picture of local crime and         antisocial behaviour       [g].
Royal Docks Noise Mapping (2009-2011): Concerned about       increasing levels of noise from       London's City Airport, residents in London's Royal Docks carried out noise         mapping for use in a         campaign against plans to expand the airport's operations.
Working       in partnership with local       campaign group Fight the Flights, MfC provided noise meters and worked       with residents to develop       a protocol for noise measurement.
This was used during normal flight       operations and, due to the       on-going relationship between MfC and the community, during the eruption       of the Icelandic volcano       that grounded all flights in April 2010.
Noise levels rose to the       60-decibel range on only three       occasions during the no-flight period, whereas during normal flight       operations highs of 87 decibels       were recorded with just under a third of all readings exceeding 60       decibels.
These efforts, and the       noise mapping activities, gained coverage in The Evening Standard,       bringing this important       issue to the attention of a broader public audience across the city [h].
One of the participants       reported feeling that "the Royal Docks mapping project brought residents       together and gave them       confidence to call for changes in their community" [i].
Heathrow Airport Noise Mapping (2011-ongoing): Mapping for       Change is working in partnership       with HACAN (Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise) and       the EU-funded       EveryAware project to map noise issues around the airport.
Mobile         phone software developed         by MfC provides a low-cost, widely available noise monitoring tool.
More than 250 people in       the Heathrow area are contributing data to the noise map.
Following MfC's       work with HACAN, in       2013 the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead initiated a         large-scale citizen-driven         noise-monitoring project using the WideNoise App [j].
Importantly,       the project also highlighted       the importance of the MfC approach to citizen science &#8212; where projects are       co-designed with the       participants.
Indeed, due to this process participants showed a full       understanding of the limitations       of the tool, stating that: "It will never stand up in court to the levels       taken by professional       microphones, but is great for the general awareness of the level" [k].
Air quality mapping around London (2011-ongoing): In 2011,       MfC used diffusion tubes to       measure nitrogen dioxide levels at seven locations around London, with       participants recruited       through social media.
The results showed that along main road networks NO2       levels were as much       as 75% above EU guidelines; it also highlighted issues in several       residential back roads used as       rat-runs.
In Putney, concerns raised by the Putney Society about air       quality were successful in       leveraging political support to lobby for change, leading Transport         for London to introduce to         the area in 2012 new buses that comply with higher emission standards       [l] [m].
In Highbury,       Jenny Jones, the Green Party mayoral candidate, held a meeting with 40       residents to discuss air       quality.
She said the mapping results were "terrifying" but that the       turnout had brought her hope       and she recognised that the issue was obviously important for local       communities [n].
MfC has       partnered with other London organisations to call for action on air         pollution [o] and has       hosted an Air Pollution conference attended by around 120 participants       from local government and       community groups in April 2013 [p], leading to the development of further       action on air pollution by       community groups and local authorities, such as community air quality       monitoring in the Barbican       in collaboration with the City of London which will start in the autumn of       2013.
