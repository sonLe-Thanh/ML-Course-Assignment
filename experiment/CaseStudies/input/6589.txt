     The details of impact are drawn largely from an independent evaluation       report commissioned by the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery [1].
Earthen Lamp, an independent consultancy on the creative sector, was       commissioned to carry out a research-based evaluation of the Lost in         Lace exhibition.
BMAG's primary evaluation objective was to       ascertain and measure a change in perceptions of the Museum from being       associated with the traditional, to an increase or change in association       with the contemporary.
The main aims of the evaluation were:            To understand if the exhibition had an impact on the perception of         BMAG       To calculate the level of first time visitors to BMAG attracted by Lost           in Lace        To gain feedback from visitors on the exhibitions       To test the success of the exhibition app and other online marketing         methods       To understand the demographics of the visitors       To calculate the economic impact of the exhibition          The survey was developed in consultation with the BMAG and the Crafts       Council team to address the aims outlined above, and the report was       generated using the West Midlands Cultural Observatory online Economic       Impact Calculator developed in 2011 as part of the Cultural Olympiad in       the West Midlands: www.eitoolkit.org.uk       .
Economic Impact            Evidence suggests that Lost in Lace has generated around &#163;948,283.56         worth of economic activity.
The estimated economic impact of Lost in Lace was &#163;738,282.72         (before multiplier), or &#163;922,853.40 (after multiplier).
Audience Development             Lost in Lace had a total of 40,046 visitors.
Around a quarter of all respondents to the survey lived in Birmingham         while a further 40% lived in the rest of the West Midlands.
There is evidence to show that some of the visitors to Lost in           Lace came from places such as Italy, Holland, Portugal, Spain,         China, Japan, Malta, USA and Iran.
34% of all respondents were visiting BMAG for the first time and a         further 19% had not been in the last 12 months.
Using the total visitor         figures it can be inferred that around 13,600 visitors were on         their first visit to BMAG to attend Lost in Lace.
Around 19% of all respondents travelled less than 5 miles to the         exhibition.
Using the total visitor figures, this translates to 7,600         unique individuals.
Additionally, 38% (15,200 individuals)         travelled more than 31 miles to the exhibition.
42% of respondents indicated that they were visiting Birmingham (city         centre) specifically to attend the exhibition.
Using the total number of         visitors this translates to around 17,000 unique individuals.
Word of mouth was the most popular source of information for the         exhibition.
Around 15% of respondents chanced upon the exhibition.
Around 13% found out about it from specialist art/craft publications.
Around 36% of all respondents indicated that they had a smartphone and         a third of those that did, downloaded the Lost in Lace app and         rated it.
Of those that rated the app, 70% thought that it was Very Good         or Good.
95% of all respondents felt that their overall experience of the         exhibition was either Very Good or Good.
Only 15% of respondents were 65 or over, while 23% were under 25.
Around 13% were male, while 8% considered themselves to have a         disability.
Curatorial Innovation     A significant ambition of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery was to       present an exhibition of contemporary art that was different from the more       traditional regional, historical, and period art collection exhibits for       which they are more commonly known.
Findings demonstrate a significant       shift in visitor expectations of BMAG            Just over a quarter of all respondents felt that Lost in Lace         was not the kind of exhibition they would expect to see at BMAG.
A large percentage of respondents (55%) were motivated specifically by         their interest in the art form to attend the exhibition.
For 3% of all respondents, this exhibition was their first         arts/cultural event.
Using the total number of visitors this equates to         around 1,200 unique individuals.
Only one in five of all respondents had been to another exhibition         organised by the Crafts Council; the exhibition therefore extended the         reach of the CC.
Around half of all respondents felt that the exhibition had inspired         them to learn more about lace/the artists.
The majority of respondents found the object information useful and         felt that the handling samples enhanced their experience of the         exhibited work.
The Executive Director, Crafts Council, and the Exhibitions Manager,       Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery have testified to the impact of Lost         in Lace:     `Fifty:Fifty presents an excellent opportunity for an organization to       work with the Crafts Council on developing and presenting a high-quality       contemporary exhibition focusing on craft.
The first Fifty:Fifty partner       was BMAG and the resultant exhibition - Lost in Lace - was a       daring and thought-provoking exploration of contemporary textiles.
It       received double the number of visitors predicted and hopefully paved the       way for more contemporary craft exhibitions at BMAG.'
[2]     Executive Director, Crafts Council.
`The exhibition Lost in Lace was an absolute success - ambitious,       risk-taking, critically acclaimed, hugely exceeding its visitor targets       and widening the audience for contemporary textile practice.
This could       only have been possible through strong, creative and supportive       partnerships, and Fifty:Fifty was the ideal partnership for achieving       this.
BMAG immensely valued the opportunity to collaborate with the Crafts       Council through Fifty:Fifty, to shape, produce and present Lost in         Lace.
The partnership enabled us to work together as a team, sharing       skills, experience and resources to go beyond our usual capacities to       deliver something exceptional and which really engaged and excited       audiences beyond their expectations'.
