     `Crescendo' documents a single performance held inside a metro train in       Shenzhen, Southern China.
The performance was acted out by 25 participants       aged from their mid-fifties to mid-eighties and was filmed by Neno       Belchev, a Bulgarian artist who was one of the other international       resident artists hosted by OCAT.
Supporting documentation in the form of       stills photography was captured by Hong Kong-based arts journalist Phoebe       Wong.
During the three-month residency in China, the 25 participants engaged in       contemporary art practice for the first time in their lives.
They were       able to share their unique experiences with approximately 250 family,       friends and colleagues.
During the live performance, fellow passengers of       the metro directly engaged with the work, and were confronted with the       difficult but often unspoken issue of corruption.
Responses from the 60       passengers varied from those who stared in surprise, to those who had been       so disturbed or shocked that they ran to another carriage.
Others joined       in, shouting about the problems of corruption, while some complained about       the public disturbances.
The completion of `Crescendo' was initially met with a degree of       predicament by OCAT.
Due to the sensitive nature of the work, which deals       with the problems of corruption, and the fact OCAT is Chinese       state-funded, their initial reaction was understandable.
As a result of       this, OCAT declined to show the work in China.
However, as time went by,       OCAT saw the value and strength of the work and by the time the work was       published in the form of a DVD, the organisation showed their endorsement       by allowing their logo to be included in all publicity materials       associated with the work and DVD.
Once the project had gained recognition within the UK's cultural sector,       `Crescendo' was eventually co-commissioned by QUAD, a public gallery       institution in Derby.
This development enabled the footage and archive       materials to be edited into a seven-minute video, and a soundtrack for the       work to be added.
The subsequent launch exhibition at QUAD lasted six weeks and was visited       by 1,500 people from all walks of life.
This included students from the       University of Derby, local residents of Derby, art enthusiasts from across       the UK, and specialist arts professionals &#8212; including curators, gallery       directors, writers and artists.
The accompanying publication was produced       with a print run of 1,000 copies, 300 of which were posted by QUAD to       their national and international contacts within the cultural sector.
The       remaining copies were sold during the six-week exhibition to gallery       visitors.
As a result of completing this ambitious research and the subsequent       exhibition in Derby, Li was invited to exhibit `Crescendo' at other       national and international exhibition venues, which benefited a much wider       community.
It has been disseminated in public institutional galleries       around the world, including PHotoEspa&#241;a13 in Madrid (2,000 visitors),       Piccadilly Place in Manchester (500 visitors), Alternative Space Loop in       Seoul (1,500 visitors), and the Chalk Horse Art Centre in Sydney (1,500       visitors).
Published comments on `Crescendo' include:       "In his new work `Crescendo', Li explores dissent and engages people         literally in anonymous exposure of corruption.
Conceived as a flash mob         style intervention in a public space, Li supports a group of individuals         to participate in an act of momentary heresy.
In a place where         opportunities are scarce, competition is high, materialism is         fashionable and individualism is a treacherous endeavour, this is a         heroic act."
Louise Clements, Artistic Director, QUAD, Derby       Preface text, Dinu Li / Selected Works / 2009-2010     "In inserting himself into the performance as one of the players in         his film, Li fulfils a need to be on the inside in an act of         identification.
His family fell victim to the Communist victory in China         in 1949.
Split at the outset of the People's Republic of China, family         members dispersed into two separate, difficult worlds.
One, the harsh         struggle of `starting again', as his father left for Hong Kong where you         had to work your way up from scratch, a thankless labour with few         rewards (and later to England).
The other, a world of political exile,         semi-imprisonment, and punishment for having material possessions and         personal `wealth' or simply property, cast as `landlord class'.
Li's         mother's home was destroyed; his aunt suffered from her position as a         head teacher, a cousin was sent to Hainan, a wild island off the south         coast, where there was little habitation.
The hidden site, then, of the         expanse of grey tarmac on the road outside Guangzhou, where homes or         lives were destroyed or severely disrupted, provides a link to the site         of Li's unknown family home.
Forcibly removed and obliterated at an         earlier moment in history, within the lifetime of his parents, the         family state of being was shattered and changed irrevocably.
In a twist         of historical fate, different histories emerged."
