Context      Antipsychotics are among the biggest selling and most profitable of all       drugs, generating $22 billion in global sales in 2008       (healthcarefinancenews.com, 2009).
Atypical or second generation       antipsychotic (SGA) drugs were introduced in 1994 and were twenty times       more expensive than typical, first generation (FGA) drugs.
They were       perceived to be and promoted as being more effective, with fewer side       effects and preferable to patients.
SGAs were also claimed to be cost-       effective since the higher acquisition costs would be recouped from       savings on inpatient stays.
Most evidence had come from       industry-sponsored, short-term efficacy trials concentrating on symptoms.
Widespread uptake of SGAs caused the expenditure in England on       antipsychotic drugs to increase from &#163;19.9m in 1994 to &#163;211.9m in 2004.
Pathways to impact       The research findings were the subject of a range of editorials and       reviews.
The results went on to influence clinical guidelines for       schizophrenia in the UK, USA, Canada and other countries.
Reach and Significance of the impact       Impact on prescribing guidelines nationally and internationally       In the 2009 NICE guidance on core interventions in the treatment and       management of schizophrenia (S1), the CUtLASS trials were the only trials       not comparing individual drugs which were considered to be sufficiently       important to the guidance to be included: `In particular, evaluations         in which two or more antipsychotic drugs were treated as a class, and in         which comparisons between specific antipsychotic drugs were not         provided, were excluded from further consideration.
An exception was         made in the case of the Cost Utility of the Latest Antipsychotic Drugs         in Schizophrenia Study (CUtLASS, Lewis et al., 2006a, 2006b; Jones et         al., 2006), two large effectiveness trials conducted in the UK that         compared SGAs with FGAs and clozapine with SGAs; it was decided to         describe these studies in the systematic economic literature review         because their findings and conclusions, although non-informative on the         cost effectiveness of specific antipsychotic drugs, were deemed by the         GDG to be relevant and useful in decision-making' (p. 46).
Further:       `Lewis and colleagues (2006a) described two effectiveness trials         conducted in the UK that aimed at determining the clinical and cost         effectiveness of SGAs versus FGAs and clozapine versus SGAs in people         with schizophrenia responding inadequately to, or having unacceptable         side effects from, their current medication (CUtLASS, Bands 1 and 2).
The studies would normally have been excluded from the systematic review         of the economic literature because they treated SGAs and FGAs as classes         of antipsychotic medications; no data relating to specific antipsychotic         drugs were reported.
However, these studies were directly relevant to         the UK context and their findings could lead to useful conclusions         supporting formulation of guideline recommendations.
Therefore, their         methods and economic findings are discussed in this section.'
(p.       164).
The CUtLASS trials are referenced 11 times in the guidance document.
A semi-quantitative study comparing the quality of national guidelines for       schizophrenia found that the NICE guidance scored the highest (S2).
The results of the CUtLASS trials have influenced clinical guidelines       globally, as in: the World Federation of Societies of Biological       Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for biological treatment of schizophrenia       (S3).
A 2011 review of the six major schizophrenia treatment guidelines in       the US found the CUtLASS trials to be influential (S4).
Impact on global prescribing patterns       Evidence that the CUtLASS trials have influenced global prescribing       practices on a large scale comes from audit-based studies such as that of       national prescribing patterns in countries with national prescribing       databases, for example Canada: `First-generation antipsychotic (FGA)         recommendations for adults with schizophrenia increased by 38% between         2005 and 2009, from 329 380 to 454 960 recommendations.
Second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) recommendations increased to a         much lesser extent (9%), which was mostly attributable to an increase in         recommendations for clozapine...The rate of increase of FGA use is now         greater than that of SGAs.
This may be due to data from recent         comparative trials, which suggest that clinical efficacy, and the rate         of neurological side effects is similar between FGAs and SGAs' (S5).
CUtLASS1 (2) has been incorporated into US residency training programs       with documented change in prescribing practice as a result (S6).
Savings resulting from CUtLASS rollout       As part of an NIHR Research for Patient Benefit grant (PI Lewis),       CUtLASS was implemented in Bury Primary Care Trust in 2010.
UoM       researchers, supported by commissioners, worked with clinicians in order       to encourage the switch from SGAs to FGAs.
The resulting drop in SGA       dispensing brought about a significant cost saving in Bury: from a peak in       Q2 2009/10, the total cost of antipsychotics fell by 20% in Q1 2011/12 and       18% in Q2 2011/12, a real terms decrease in spending of &#163;51k and &#163;46k (S7)       in this period.
Assuming savings of &#163;200k per annum in Bury (population       100,000), a national roll-out of the policy would save the NHS &#163;100m per       annum.
Media impact       The results of the main trial (2) received immediate and global media       coverage.
For example, The Washington Post covered the findings on       its front page: `Schizophrenia patients do as well, or perhaps even         better, on older psychiatric drugs compared with newer and far costlier         medications, according to a study published yesterday that overturns         conventional wisdom about antipsychotic drugs, which cost the United         States $10 billion a year.
The results are causing consternation.
The         researchers who conducted the trial were so certain they would find         exactly the opposite that they went back to make sure the research data         had not been recorded backward... A U.S. government study last year         found that one of the older drugs did as well as newer ones, but at the         time, many American psychiatrists warned against concluding that all the         older drugs were as good.
Yesterday, in an editorial accompanying the         British study, the lead researcher in the U.S. trial asked how an entire         medical field could have been misled into thinking that the expensive         drugs, such as Zyprexa, Risperdal and Seroquel, were much better.'
