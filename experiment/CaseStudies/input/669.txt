     The conceptual contributions reflect pivotal contributions on positional       competition in schooling markets and the presence of co-opetition in       schooling markets.
The empirical studies investigate the relationship       between resources and school performance; changes in school performance       over time and the nature and effects of within-school competition.

Guardian), BBC (Radio 4), THES, and       international interest from Australia, which has led to further research       linked to education policy.

The following IEPR Working Paper is based on this project:            Telhaj, S.; Hutton, D.; Davies, P.; Adnett, N.; and Coe, R. (2004)         Competition within schools: Representativeness of Yellis sample schools         in a study of subject enrolment of 14-16 year olds, http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/business/iepr/docs/Working-paper11.pdf           The paper examines the issue of sample representativeness which is       critical in impact evaluations.
Biases can arise from a sample which does       not represent the participant population, or a non-participant sample       which does not represent the participant population.
Representativeness       expresses the degree to which sample data accurately and precisely       represent a characteristic of a population's parameter variations at a       sampling point.
Representativeness is a qualitative parameter which is       most concerned with the proper design of the sampling programme.
The       representativeness criterion is best satisfied by making certain that       sampling locations are selected properly and a sufficient number of       samples are collected:     The Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre is a federal institution that       produces studies and reports to advise and educate policy-makers when       deciding on healthcare and health insurance.
We were sent an email by them       which stated that one of their on-going projects in this field aims at       assessing the representativeness of a sample of the Belgian       hospitalisations at a national level.
They informed us that their       methodology refers to the above paper, and asked for permission to cite       this Working Paper as a reference.
(2008) Pugh, G.; Mangan, J.; and Gray, J.; Resources and           attainment at Key Stage 4: Estimates from a dynamic methodology       (DCSF)       The above report was referred to in Parliamentary Questions in the       Summer of 2009.
It was considered widely in the media: Radio 4 Today         programme (07/09/07), five national newspapers and the Times Educational         Supplement during that week.
The following paper was published from       the above project:            Pugh, G, Mangan, J. and Gray, J.

An earlier version of this paper was presented in a keynote symposium         at British Education Research Association conference, where the       discussant was a senior representative from the Government Economic       Service.
The published paper was later commended at the British         Educational Research Association conference in 2012.
Furthermore, it       was the instigator of contact which led to a project between the research       team and the Department of Education, New South Wales, Australia, to       assess the impact of school expenditure on performance.
