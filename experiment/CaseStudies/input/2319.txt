     The route to impact     Our impact strategy to change the nature of planting design in urban       places included writing articles for professional and public       journals/magazines, plus publishing books that translated the research       into practice.
We also disseminated our work to professional and public       audiences through conferences, workshops, websites, blogs, radio and TV,       in Britain and internationally.
IMPACTS     Influence on policy, both UK and international     Dunnett actively engaged (2006-11) with Sheffield City Council to       initiate the Sheffield Green Roof development programme resulting in the       only mandatory green roof policy for a British city.
`The research in         the design, maintenance and evaluation of green roofs has given the City         confidence to develop clear policies that promote green roofs across the         City: the city is fast becoming known as the green roof capital.'
(S1).
In addition, the Sheffield Green Roof Development Programme directly       inspired the initiation of a full-scale green roof programme by the City       of Melbourne, Australia, linked with University of Melbourne, following a       keynote presentation by Dunnett at the Australian Green Roofs Conference       in 2008: `'The City of Melbourne's green roof development programme,         and associated initiatives ... was modelled on Nigel Dunnett's work in         Sheffield".
(S2).
Since 2008 our research and practice has become       referred to internationally as the "Sheffield School."
Contribution to improved social, cultural and environmental         sustainability     Dunnett has communicated the principles behind our research to a national       and international audience through designing gold-medal-winning gardens at       the Chelsea Flower Show.
This has had a direct impact on what happens in       millions of gardens across the world.
Our work was featured as part of a       BBC2, three-hour TV programme in February 2012 (S3).
Influence on professional guidelines and best practice training.
Our approach to the design of the Olympic Park was highlighted in a       training video specially commissioned by the Landscape Institute (National       Professional Body for Landscape Architecture) for its members (S4).
This       has been viewed extensively by landscape architects in Britain and around       the world, to inform and change practice norms.
These impacts have been       further extended by books we have written derived from our research, which       now form a key part of the literature of Landscape Architecture (such as The         Dynamic Landscape: Design, Ecology and Management of Naturalistic Urban         Planting, Taylor and Francis).
These have now been translated into       four languages including Chinese and more than 15,000 copies have been       sold worldwide.
Changes in environmental design standards and professional practice.
Our work has re-invigorated planting design throughout the world: "Sheffield....         has emerged as the world leader in naturalistic planting, courtesy of         .... James Hitchmough and Nigel Dunnett" (S5).
This is evidenced by       a raft of invitations to undertake commissions to design examples of this       sustainable vegetation in prestigious, heavily visited landscapes (Eden       Project Cornwall; Royal Horticultural Society Gardens, Wisley and Hyde       Hall; Toyota UK (Derby); London Wetland Centre; Queen's Gallery,       Buckingham Palace; Burgess Park, London; Oxford University Botanical       Garden; and Cambridge University Botanic Garden).
Dunnett's innovative       approaches to green roof and rain garden planting have resulted in       prestigious and highly public design commissions including the South Bank       Centre, London, Google UK's new head office, the head offices of the John       Lewis Group (to create Central London's first street-side rain garden),       and at Buckingham Palace.
In June 2013, Dunnett gave a private tour of the       latter garden to Her Majesty The Queen, at her request.
In addition to our       own work, we have encouraged many others around the world to adopt our       approaches (S6, S7).
Changes in traditional attitudes and behaviours towards the designed         environment and biodiversity     Our research and practice has had a profound effect on winning support       amongst practitioners and the public for the use of ecologically based,       but culturally responsive vegetation in designed urban landscapes.
In part       this is because we have shown through our research how vegetation that is       attractive to people can, with only small adjustments, also be highly       sustainable and good for biodiversity.
The Royal Horticultural Society,       traditionally ambivalent or even hostile to ecological approaches has used       the Olympic Park wildflower meadows as a springboard for its 2013 public       campaign on increasing urban sustainability and diversity.
Sue Biggs, RHS       Director General, says: "After enjoying the Olympic Park meadows in         2012 there is a great appetite from the British public to create their         own version at home, which is great news for pollinating insects"       (S8).
In addition it has commissioned the authors to design over 15ha of       horticultural wildflower meadows at one of its UK gardens demonstrating       how its attitudes to conservation have been changed.
Hitchmough was       awarded a Fellowship in May 2013 from the British Naturalists Association       for outstanding contribution to natural history.
Dunnett's Green roof on       Sharrow Junior School (Sheffield) is the only designed green roof in the       world that has been awarded formal government Nature Reserve Status.
Help in shaping the 2012 Olympic experience and the UK's global         reputation     We were head-hunted by the Olympic Development Authority (ODA) to lead on       the planting design of the London 2012 Olympic Park.
This involved       developing a new planting strategy for the whole site based on our       research, designing and specifying the plant communities and supervising       implementation.
"At the brief stage I made it very clear that I wanted         James Hitchmough and Nigel Dunnett to be involved.
I wanted a 21st         century landscape that redefined the public park" (ODA Project       Director for the Olympic Parklands and Public Realm) (S9).
We have continued to provide guidance through the Transformation       (2012-14) and this will extend to the long term Legacy (&gt;2014) phase.
The park received 5 million visits over the six-week period of the games       and Paralympics, and the 20 hectares (equivalent to 40 football pitches)       of plant communities that we designed was key to shaping the experiences       of these visitors.
This email was received from a member of the public and       was typical of visitor responses reported in the media: "Thank you for         giving me and thousands and thousands of others the most wonderful gift,         the exquisite plantings around the Olympic buildings.
They will be my         most enduring memory of the London 2012 Olympics.., their impact was so         astonishing... the... natural... pervaded with a unique and precious         sense of humanity, a perfect metaphor for the Olympic ideal".
The       work has received rave reviews internationally ("the most ambitious         public planting ever?")
(S10).
The international impact of our work at the Olympic Park is shown by       invites to provide presentations on the approaches used to Landscape       architecture practitioner organisations/ university departments in (by the       end of 2013); China, the USA, Germany, Australia, Italy, the Czech       Republic, Denmark, South Africa, and Sweden.
The ground breaking nature of       the work has been recognised in many international design websites and       journals (Topos, Garten + Landschaft, the two leading       Chinese Landscape Architecture Journals; Chinese Landscape         Architecture, Landscape Architecture Frontiers), plus awards       such as the Dulux Colour Prize in 2013.
