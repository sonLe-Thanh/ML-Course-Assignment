Employment and mental health     Our research into employment for mental health service users revealing       that the majority aspire to paid employment has been cited in national       policy reviews (e.g.
HM Government, 2009; Perkins et al, 2009) in support       of the development of vocational services that are now a central strand of       mental health strategy implementation and welfare reform.
At a local level, results from the 2004 survey of service users'       vocational aspirations carried out by Secker with service user       co-researchers, together with evidence from the SESAMI study, convinced       the South Essex Mental Health Joint Commissioning Team and senior managers       at the South Essex Partnership University NHS Trust (SEPT) of the need for       an evidence-based vocational service embedded within the Trust's clinical       teams.
The service was one of the first in the UK to fully implement the       principles of the Individual Placement and Support approach to employment       support, and as such was singled out as an example of good practice in       national commissioning guidance (Department of Health, 2006), which we       highlight because it remains current and has been influential in promoting       subsequent developments in other localities (e.g.
East Sussex Health, 2009       (http://www.eastsussexhealth.org/pdf/HOSC19March09/Item%206%20App%201%20Day%20and%20Voc%20MH%20Briefing%20Paper.pdf).
Between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013 the SEPT service has supported       396 service users into work and 427 into education (vocational service       performance data).
An additional employment-related impact stems from Secker's establishment       of SE-SURG at Anglia Ruskin University in 2005.
As well as contributing to       further service developments via commissioned studies, the group provides       employment and skills development opportunities for members.
Membership       has remained consistent at around eight since 2005, with some members       moving on to take up further employment and education opportunities and       others joining the group.
Two members (Lyn Kent and Maxine Nightingale)       have achieved employment at Anglia Ruskin University on 50% FTE contracts       as service user researchers/SE-SURG administrators.
Our research has therefore achieved both national impact through       influence on government policy and local impact in terms of improved       welfare outcomes for mental health service users in our region.

Engagement in creative activity     The impact of our research into the role of creative activity in recovery       is demonstrated in terms of its reach by citation in two House of Lords       debates (Lords Hansard 6 March 2008 &amp; 25 July 2013).
In terms       of significance, impact on policy is evidenced by citation in a speech       later that year by the then Secretary of State for Health (16 September       2008).
The September 2007 launch of the research at Tate Modern was attended by       the Chief Executive and members of the Executive Team at SEPT, whose       support on learning of the results from the study was instrumental in the       subsequent development of Open Arts, a participatory arts and mental       health project established at SEPT in 2008.
The project aims to promote       wellbeing and social inclusion through running 12-week, community-based       introductory arts courses, with an emphasis on skill development and       follow-on opportunities to pursue individual goals.
From the inception of Open Arts in 2008 to July 2013, 615 people have       completed an introductory course, 225 have achieved National Open College       Network accreditation at levels 2 or 3 and 24 now work with Open Arts as       volunteers (Open Arts performance data).
Significant improvements on measures of wellbeing and social inclusion       were recorded for course completers in the two-year evaluation study led       by Secker from 2009 to 2010 (Secker et al., 2011).
These results were       recently replicated in the waiting list controlled evaluation reported by       Margrove et al.
(2012).
The latter study has received considerable       attention, with local reach demonstrated by an interview on BBC Radio       Essex (reach 75,000) and a full page article in the Essex Chronicle       (reach 26,327), including headline billing on the Chronicle's advertising       boards across Essex.
Wider reach is demonstrated by coverage in the Daily         Telegraph (reach 555,817) and the Huffington Post UK (reach       197,964).
In 2012 the positive evaluation results contributed to a successful bid       to Essex County Council for seed funding of &#163;9,211 to establish a studio       space where introductory course completers could continue their art work       more independently for six months, with support from a professional       artist.
The studio opened in October 2012 and 15 members who completed       their six-month placement in May 2013 have now formed a constituted group,       renting studio space together in order to continue their work.
Evaluation       of the studio outcomes is on-going but preliminary results are promising,       with further significant improvements identified in wellbeing and social       inclusion.
