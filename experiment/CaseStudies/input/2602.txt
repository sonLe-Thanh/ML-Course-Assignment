     There are two impacts of Phemister's research on embodied values, one on       artistic output and the other on psychotherapeutic theory and practice.
In       both cases there is clear evidence that the relevant non-academic parties       did not merely engage with Phemister's research, but that it also directly       influenced their professional practice in important and discernible ways.
(i) Art     The first example of impact concerns the artistic output of the prominent       ecological artists Tim Collins and Reiko Goto (formerly research fellows       at the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, CMU, Pittsburgh, and more recently       involved in the EDEN3 five-year project, which brings together artists and       scientists in understanding the biogenic interaction of trees with the       changing environment and climate of cities; see corroboration [2], [3 a       &amp; b]).
Collins and Goto participated in the 2007-08 British Academy       `Embodied Values' workshops with which Phemister was centrally involved       (see `grants' above and corroboration [4]).
Since this time, Phemister has       had many conversations with them, and particularly with Collins, on       human-environment relations, especially those grounded in relations based       on sympathy or empathy, the role of relations in the formation of       individual identity, representation/mirroring, and the possibility of       symbiotic transfers of values from humans to environment in places       considered as `value-places'.
These interconnected concepts are       foundational to the ecological metaphysics that Phemister has been       expounding since the mid-2000s&#8212;see, especially, Phemister (2011).
Accordingly, her work became very influential on Collins's thinking as an       artist (and, through him, influential on the work of his main artistic       collaborator, Goto, as well).
As Collins himself noted, in a (transcribed)       talk that he gave while he was a Visiting Fellow at Edinburgh's Institute       for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH) in 2010 (see corroboration       [5 a &amp; b]): "This is all very experimental work and the philosophy       [...] on the video comes out of the conversations I was having with       Pauline [Phemister]."
Phemister's research has also been instrumental in the development of new       works of art.
In particular, as Collins makes explicit in his written       supporting testimony (see corroboration [1]), Phemister's work was crucial       to the development of Collins &amp; Goto's `Plein Air: The Schelling Piper       Experiments' artwork, exhibited in 2010 at the Peacock Centre in Aberdeen       as part of the Plein Air: The Ethical Aesthetic Impulse       exhibition.
In his supporting testimony Collins writes that Phemister's       "argument for the evolution of a space of relational value, a new       conjoined responsibility that is the antithesis of dominion" influenced       him to the extent that it "resulted in the production of new work", where       by this he means the Collins &amp; Goto `Plein Air: The Schelling Piper       Experiments' artwork.
This is a multi-media installation monitoring the       life of a single tree in Aberdeen city centre over a 24-hour period, and       its response to atmospheric changes, in particular to the effect of CO2       levels, as an experiential tangible interface with climate change.
Data       are translated into sounds and the multi-media exhibit is designed to be       portable to public forests, gardens and parks.
(See corroboration [1], [5       a &amp; b], [6]).
Phemister's research on embodied values has thus not only influenced the       work of two important contemporary artists, but directly led to the       production of a significant and high-profile work of art.
(ii) Psychotherapy     The influential Romanian psychotherapist, Dr. Alexandra Parvan, of the       Bucharest-based Romanian Society for Experiential Psychotherapy&#8212;Societatea         de Psihoterapie Experien&#354;ial&#259; Rom&#226;n&#259; (SPER)&#8212;has been heavily       influenced by Phemister's work on embodied values.
As she notes in her       written supporting testimony (see corroboration [7]), Phemister's       research&#8212;in particular, Phemister (2011)&#8212;has had a "profound impact on my       work as a mental health practitioner."
She goes on to say that Phemister's       research made her "more aware of the way I am experiencing my own self as       being placed within what she [Phemister] calls `physical' and       `psychical' spaces" and prompted her to "consciously explore my relation       with the immediate environment and the consequences of my active or       passive engagement with it."
Phemister's research, she writes, "made me       realise that philosophical ideas on human beings' placedness or placed       existence can constitute an important resource for psychotherapeutic       work."
Given the prominence of Dr. Parvan within Romanian       psychotherapeutic practitioners&#8212;through, in particular, her engagement       with SPER, where she is a leading figure&#8212;the influence of Phemister's       research on how Dr. Parvan approaches her professional work has       implications beyond her own individual therapeutic practices.
