     The main impacts arising from this research are:             impact on practitioners, through the availability of efficient         new methods of analysis and design;        economic impact, principally through cost savings realised by         practitioners using the software, and/or realised by their clients.
Process     To help realise the potential of the numerical limit analysis method       developed for masonry block structures, in 1999 funding from Railtrack       (now Network Rail) was secured to develop the RING analysis software       application for masonry arch bridges.
This was then made publicly       available in 2001 (over 10,000 download keys were issued to users in over       40 countries worldwide over the period 2001-07, with usage of the software       continuing beyond this period).
This success led to the decision in 2006 to form a new spinout company,       LimitState Ltd, to exploit numerical limit analysis research being       undertaken at Sheffield, and to develop a range of software applications:            Following a &#163;50k investment in the company by Bestech Systems, a         completely re-engineered version of the RING software, LimitState:RING,         was launched in 2007 at the International Union of Railways HQ in Paris.
(Doctoral student Darwich, sponsored by Buro Happold and later employed         by LimitState, played an important role in ensuring large parts of the         software were generic, facilitating re-use in other limit analysis and         design software products).
Funding of approx.
&#163;100k was secured from South Yorkshire Investment         Fund, Bestech Systems and Sheffield University Enterprises Limited to         support development of DLO-based software, and patent protection was         secured to protect the IP covering the DLO method [R4].
The DLO-based LimitState:GEO         geotechnical analysis and design software was launched at the         Institution of Civil Engineers HQ in London in 2008 and was shortlisted         for a NCE/Civils Innovation Award the same year.
(Gilbert took a 6 month         abeyance from his EPSRC Advanced Fellowship [G2] to help finalise the         software and to publicise this in the geotechnical engineering         community.)
LimitState continue to actively develop and market both software       applications, via advertising in technical publications, at trade events       and by running seminar/training events for industry in the UK and abroad,       often inviting Gilbert and/or Smith as speakers (over 20 full and half day       events run to date).
Impact on Practitioners     The limit analysis software developed by LimitState effectively bridges       the gap between hand-type analysis methods (often automated in simple       software applications or spreadsheets) and significantly more complex       tools (e.g.
non-linear finite element analysis), which respectively tend       to over-simplify a problem or require significant user expertise and       computational resources.
This makes LimitState software unique in the       market and extremely attractive to practitioners.
Currently over 100 industrial organisations licence LimitState software,       located in more than 30 countries worldwide [S1].
Each product has a       similar number of users, with some organisations licencing both products.
Organisations currently licencing the software include:             Consultants: Arup, Atkins, Jacobs, URS, WSP, Aecom, Amey,         Arcadis, Bilfinger, Grontmij, Halcrow, Halcrow, Hyder, May Gurney, SKM,         WYG.
Infrastructure owners: Network Rail, SNCF, Railcorp         (Australia), OBB (Austria), also numerous local authorities in the UK         and Eire.
Contractors: Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Interserve,         Laing O'Rourke, Vinci.
Offshore: Advanced Geomechanics, Fugro, GL Noble Denton, [text         removed for publication].
Users of both LimitState:RING and LimitState:GEO have reported       significant productivity gains (up to approx.
50 times faster modelling       capability) and the ability to gain deeper insights into potential modes       of behaviour (the visual output is very easy to interpret, and is also       useful when communicating analysis and design issues to non-expert       stakeholders).
Specifically, LimitState:RING allows practitioners to rapidly identify       potential failure mechanisms in complex masonry arch bridge structures       which cannot be found easily using alternative tools [S2], whilst       LimitState:GEO means that practitioners can move beyond simplistic       hand-type calculations for constructions such as slopes, retaining walls       and footings, but without having to turn to significantly more complex       tools (e.g.
non-linear finite element analysis), which are generally much       more time-consuming and expensive to use [S3].
For example:            On a major stadium project, civil engineering contractor Laing         O'Rourke encountered site conditions which necessitated redesign of the         foundations of the principal elements; with LimitState:GEO this was         completed in a couple of hours &#8212; alternatives would have taken days or         weeks, leading to costly programme delays.
They have also         reported that `we find the software invaluable for quickly and           reliably answering the kind of questions we often face as contractors,           such as `How close can we safely place this 120t piling rig to the           crest of our temporary slope?'.
And because the software           doesn't prejudge the type of failure mechanism that will be critical           we sometimes get surprises &#8212; for example finding that a local bearing           capacity failure might be more critical than the global slope failure           we had anticipated &#8212; something that our traditional slope stability           analysis package would not necessarily have identified' [S4].
Economic Impact     Significant economic impacts have been realised by practitioners using       the software (and/or by the clients of these practitioners).
Indicative       examples from two of the 100+ users are provided below:            [text removed for publication] company that has been applying         LimitState:GEO to a variety of offshore engineering problems, observing         that 'in addition to the insights we get from using the software we           also see a massive improvement in productivity'.
In the offshore         sector this quickly translates into multi-million pound annual savings:         'If we had used hand calculations and FEA we could not have reached a           workable design that we could install from our vessels in the time           available.
We would have needed to use a heavy pile driven to depth,           and this would have cost us in the order of &#163;500k in direct project           costs.
Similar examples, where direct costs are avoided due to reduced           conservatism, reduced operational inefficiencies or potential failures           can be observed on a weekly basis across our project portfolio,           leading to current and projected future annual savings of between &#163;5           million and &#163;10 million'.
Kier MG (formerly May Gurney), a consultant working on behalf of         Network Rail, reported that they saved their client &#163;500k on a single         bridge when using LimitState:RING (by demonstrating that the programmed         strengthening work was in fact unnecessary) [S6].
The significant productivity and economic benefits outlined above is in       turn helping LimitState to grow worldwide product revenues (&gt;350%       increase in the last 5 years) [S1], and this is expected to continue.
