     New knowledge and capacity for amateur local historians,         archaeologists and onomasts       The adoption of the standard reporting proforma designed by Baker (and       underpinned by his research) by local historians, archaeologists and       onomasts demonstrates the significance of the research to a range of       specialist user communities.
The proforma (available along with precise       instructions for amateur participants through the project website)       facilitated a new approach to recording all putative early medieval       assembly sites in a systematic and detailed way (5.1).
Certain groups en       masse (including the Community Landscape and Archaeology Survey Project       (CLASP), the Wiltshire Archaeological &amp; Natural History Society       Archaeology Field Group (AFG), The Sussex Archaeological Society, the       Odsey study group), and a number of individual enthusiasts have been       directly involved with data collection using the proforma.
The results of       this data collection have:            fed back into the project (research and surveys carried out by         volunteers accounted for 50 of a total of 300 surveys);       formed the basis for further Society work (5.2).
The following are         examples:                CLASP became involved in 2010 after Baker's talk in Paulerspury,           undertaking a range of fieldwork in Northants; Baker made site visits           in 2011, and CLASP presented their results as a poster at the project           conference, UCL, November 2011.
The Odsey group was brought together by a Hertfordshire enthusiast,           after she attended the project conference.
The group includes amateur           researchers but also local authority personnel (e.g.
Historic           Environment Record officers, English Heritage employees, county           archaeologists).
It has met three times to discuss Odsey as a           meeting-place, and Baker has attended all three meetings as an advisor           and contributor.
The AFG undertook fieldwork at the meeting-places of the Wiltshire           Domesday hundreds.
Brief progress reports are to be found in Wiltshire             Archaeological &amp; Natural History Magazine 105 (p. 245) and           106 (p. 278).
resulted in further work by independent scholars; resulting         independent publications are beginning to appear (such as that by a         former archivist in Gloucestershire History 25 (2011), and that         in Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society Magazine         107 (2014); work on Odsey is to appear in Hertfordshire Past and           Present) (5.3);       been integrated into a broad range of education initiatives, e.g.
courses at the Institute of Continuing Education, Madingley Hall,         Cambridge (6/12/10, 10/4/11, 2-4/12/11), at the Institute of Continuing         Education, Rewley House, Oxford (26/3/2011), and for Wuffing Education,         Woodbridge (10/12/11, 20/4/13) (5.4).
Informing and supporting follow-on projects initiated by community         groups       Relationships developed over the course of this project indicate a high       degree of sustainability through the embedding of the research outcomes in       additional, independent projects.
For example, data was provided to the       project by the Friends of Thynghowe, a local Nottinghamshire society which       rediscovered the Thynghowe (`assembly mound') in Sherwood Forest and which       promotes knowledge about it within the local community.
The Friends became       involved in the project in 2009.
Baker assisted them in examining the site       (including a Geophysical Survey), and co-authored a discussion of the site       for publication in Transactions of the Thoroton Society (3.5).
Baker contributed to the Friends' successful application for a Heritage       Lottery Fund grant (&#163;50K).
The grant's authors acknowledged the key role       that Baker's research had played in the success of the grant (5.5).
This       HLF project funded a LiDAR Survey and a range of events for the public,       including Volunteer Workshops (Nov 2012 and March 2013), Ground Truthing       (Nov 2012 to March 2013) the Annual Perambulation Walk (20/4/2013) and the       Viking Spring Thing (18/5/2013- 19/5/2013), thereby extending the reach of       Baker's original research.
Enhancing public awareness and understanding about early medieval         assembly sites       The interest of Baker's research for the `Time Team'-type audience is       evidenced by 2011a &#8212; British Archaeology magazine has a       circulation of 16,000.
Its reach is evidenced by dissemination at public       engagement events to local archaeological and historical societies (e.g.
Kent Archaeological Society, Leicestershire Museums Archaeology Fieldwork       Group), and through day-schools and other Continuing Education initiatives       (see above) (5.4).
More than 500 individuals attended these events, which       took place in Bedford (21/9/09-23/11/09), Paulerspury (15/9/10), Rochester       (6/11/10), Northampton (9/4/11), Leicester (19/1/12), Leicester (28/4/12),       Welwyn (14/7/12), St Neots (1/3/13), Norton (13/3/13) (5.6).
All of these       talks included discussion of the project's methodology, and discussion of       variation in types of meeting place (e.g.
`hanging promontory' and `extra       potentiary' types), and in function (e.g.
mustering or leisure alongside       governance) and therefore drew on aspects of research from all of the       publications listed in 3, although the function shifted depending upon the       event's location and theme.
For example, at the Landscapes of Violence       study day (Woodbridge, 20/4/13) 3.4 was foregrounded, while in St Neots       (1/3/13), 3.3 was of particular interest.
Significant media coverage has in turn prompted increased public interest       in the research evidenced by the increase in web traffic to the project       website: the INS website and, in particular, the Key to English       Place-Names (see further below) experienced spikes in hits after the       following radio interviews about assembly sites: BBC Radio 4's `Open       Country' (9/4/11; audience approx.
2 million) and BBC Radio Nottingham,       `The Mark Dennison Show' (14/4/11; audience approx.
50,000).
The success       of these interviews is reflected in the continuing requests for INS       speakers (Mark Dennison Show, 23/5/12; BBC Radio Leicester, Down to Earth,       8/7/12).
Project fieldwork at Thynghowe gained the attention of The       Guardian in April 2012 (&lt;www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-         northerner/2011/apr/12/boulby-polyhalite-cleveland-potash-krebs-dark-matter-otley-kate-middleton-thynghowe&gt;).
Baker was subsequently asked by the BBC to       contribute to one in a series of events accompanying the BBC2 series, The       Great British Story (Michael Wood, broadcast 25/5/12- 10/8/12) to engage       the general public in local history.
Baker's event in Appleby Magna,       Leicestershire (8/7/12) attracted 470 individuals (despite atrocious       weather and unforeseen competition from Andy Murray in the Wimbledon       final!).
Baker gave a talk on the day focused upon the site of Spellow       (`speech-hillspur'), less than a mile away, around which he had devised a       place- names walk.
The project's findings about the wider administrative       context of meeting places fed into the talk, and around 280 leaflets       giving details of the walk and its names were distributed (a copy was also       made available on the INS website).
The freely-available AHRC-funded Key to English Place-Names web resource       (5.7), re- launched in January 2012 with a Google-maps interface, offers       clear explanations of England's town- and village-names for the general       public through a clickable map.
The Key contains project information       relating to the hundred-names.
Results not just from Landscapes of       Governance but from all externally-funded INS projects (The Survey of       English Place-Names (AHRC, British Academy); The Vocabulary of English       Place-Names (AHRC); Beyond the Burghal Hidage (Leverhulme); Anglo-Saxon       Mint-Names (AHRC)) are being fed into this resource.
Since its relaunch in       2012, we have information about site hits: 18,913 visitors made 23,999       visits to the site, with a total of 132,569 page views.
While most       visitors were from the UK, some 20% were international (5.8).
As of August       2012, the Key has been available as an iPhone app, freely available in the       iTunes store (between its launch and 31/7/13, there were 511 downloads).
Thus, we seek to present the cultural and linguistic heritage accessible       through place-names to the widest possible audience.
Enhancing factual accuracy of programme content for the BBC       The INS has an ongoing and fruitful relationship with the various arms of       the BBC, and is regularly contacted to offer advice and expertise on       onomastic matters, thus enhancing the factual accuracy of programme       content.
Baker contributed in various project-related ways to BBC       Education's support for the TV series, The Great British Story (see       above).
He co-hosted an information day (20/10/11) for BBC Learning,       Salford and BBC Lab UK, London, in order to help the team plan the       nationwide events accompanying the series.
Baker presented ideas for       place-name walks which included assembly sites for the events, and which       therefore drew explicitly on project material.
Ultimately, the locations       nationwide were chosen `drawing in no small part' (5.9) on this       information day, and in part the results of this consultancy work can be       seen in the account of the Appleby event described above.
To help with       preparation for Appleby, Baker provided the BBC Learning Manager for the       East Midlands with information and suggestions via email between February       and July 2012.
