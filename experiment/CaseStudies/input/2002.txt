     The University of Oxford's research on extensional thin layer flows has       resulted in significant       economic impact since 2008.
The beneficiaries are the glass manufacturers       [text removed for publication], Schott AG and Pilkington.
Pathways to impact:       [text removed for publication]     Between 2002 and 2006, the University of Oxford team (led by Prof. John       Ockendon FRS) was a       node in the &#8364;1.4m EU Research Training Network Math ematics for the Glass       Industry:       Computing and Analysis (known as MAGICAL) which aimed to promote       collaborations between       Universities and glass companies across the EU, including Schott AG.
Schott AG posed specific       research questions which were tackled by the MAGICAL team at the       University of Oxford, and       gained access to the University of Oxford's pre-existing research base       relevant to glass flows.
Finally, Pilkington (now NSG group) has had a long standing       relationship with the University of       Oxford's Mathematical Insitute through Industrial Workshops organised by       the Oxford Centre for       Industrial and Applied Mathematics (OCIAM) and was also involved in       MAGICAL.
The current       Head of the Float and Rolled Glass Technology Group says [B] "Pilkington         Group research &#8212; in         recent years the NSG European Technology Centre, have for many years         found the OCIAM         group to be much the most valuable point of contact for problems raising         complex mathematical         issues in glassmaking and glass products."
Nature and extent of the impact:     The glass industry constantly seeks improved models for production and       processing       technologies, so that it can reliably design and build improved,       fault-free products while cutting       development costs and innovating new advanced materials.
It is       understandable that major       industrial glass producers, such as [text removed for publication]       and Schott, were interested       in the University of Oxford's research into modelling thin viscous sheets.
[text removed for publication]     At Schott AG, another world-leading glass and materials company       with global sales of &#8364;2 billion       (in 2011/12), research from the University of Oxford has been used even       more widely.
Like [text         removed for publication], Schott has developed software, based on       Howell's methodology for       modelling thin viscous sheets and fibres, which is key in the improvement       and development of       glass forming processes.
A senior scientist in the Mathematical Simulation       and Optimization       group states [D] "At Schott, we now have models based on these methods         for all our drawing         processes.
A typical application is the prediction of suitable process         conditions (heater power         distribution, top roller speeds etc) for a desired glass sheet thickness         and net width in the float         process."
Schott use the models to save significant sums in       development costs.
The senior       scientist states [D] "In many cases, our only option in the development         process are experiments         in the actual production plant.
A day in a typical production plant         costs about 50,000 Euro.
I am         quite certain that the models saved us years of such experiments at the         plants."
In a subsequent       email he confirms that these years of effort were post-2008.
One of Schott's major production processes, tube drawing, has also been       heavily influenced by       the University of Oxford's research into pressure-driven flows and       hollow-fibre production.
In       particular, the asymptotic solutions developed at the University of Oxford       have been used to       create models which Schott claims offer improved accuracy over competing       models.
The senior       scientist in the Mathematical Simulation and Optimization group states [D]       "The results in [5,       published in 2008, and other papers] are of special significance for         the tube drawing process, one         of Schott's major production processes.
These asymptotic solutions for         non-circular tube         geometries are in my opinion superior to "brute force" numerical         approaches which suffer from         inaccuracies arising from the high glass viscosities downstream."
This allows manufacturing       processes for proposed new products to be reliably tested and optimised       computationally, leading       to significant savings in wastage and money.
Finally, work from the University of Oxford has allowed Schott to produce       glass with fewer faults.
Research into levitating thin sheets of glass on air cushions has allowed       Schott to reduce       dramatically the occurrence of instabilities in numerous moulding       processes, and understanding       of the presence of defects such as bubbles has helped them reduce the       incidence of faults in       many different glass-forming processes.
Pilkington is one of the leading glass suppliers in the UK and is       now part of the Japan-based       NSG Group which has manufacturing operations in 29 countries and global       sales of over &#163;4       billion.
The company uses research carried out at the University of Oxford       in several areas       concerned with risk management, which is an essential part of production       processes.
The       support the University of Oxford has provided with solving the problem of       bubbles bursting on the       surface of glass has given Pilkington invaluable understanding of the       underlying physical       processes (subsequently verified experimentally) as well as significant       financial savings by       avoiding lost production costs.
The Head of the Float and Rolled Glass       Technology Group at       NSG states [B] "The idea that distinctions which could be drawn between         various types of bubble         develops a way of analysing melting problems which results in a better         chance of taking the most         appropriate action".
A common procedure in the manufacture of windscreens involves heating a       sheet of glass so that       it sags under gravity into the desired shape.
The inverse problem of       determining the heating       profile required to produce a particular shape after sagging is tackled in       the industry using       computational modelling, which is found to be extremely delicate.
The       University of Oxford's       mathematical research on this problem has been very useful for Pilkington,       who found that       "guidance as to how much can safely be left to automated algorithms and         what requires active         intervention by the user is hugely valuable in reducing product         development time" [B].
