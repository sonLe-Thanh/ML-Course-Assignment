     (Figures in brackets e.g.
`[1]' cross-refer to Section 5)     The monographs are widely disseminated (cf.
http://copac.ac.uk),       and the total number of subscribers to the journal has reached 680       individuals and 311 institutions, far more than other Celtic Studies       journal.
Subscribers include undergraduates (e.g.
currently 7 at       Cambridge) and many non-academics.
CMCS was one of only two Celtic       journals placed by the European Science Foundation's European Reference       Index for the Humanities (2007, 2011) in its top `INT1' category for       Literature &#8212; INT1 denotes `International publications with high visibility       and influence among researchers in the various research domains in       different countries, regularly cited all over the world'.
[1]     Contribution to Cultural Life       While CMCS's impact within HE, including on teaching and students, extends       throughout the world, there is also an appreciative lay readership.
One       subscriber wrote: `I am not an academic &#8212; my working life was in central       banking, however I have found many CMCS articles fascinating and       admirable, and they have gone a long way to satisfying my general       curiosity about all things Celtic).
[2] The Foundation for Inspirational       &amp; Oracular Studies, London, noted that `The impact of CMCS       goes far beyond universities and its research inspires many ordinary       readers whose love of Celtic Britain and medieval matters cannot be       sated',[2] and Haycock's Legendary Poems from the Book of Taliesin       (2007), which will be reprinted in 2014, led to widespread interest       outside conventional academia, e.g.
the Temenos Academy in 2009, and to an       invitation to present a dayschool at the Bleddfa Centre in July 2013.
[3]       In 2009 a draft online version of Falileyev's Dictionary of         Continental Celtic Place-Names had more hits than any other academic       item in Aberystwyth University's electronic repository Cadair and       its accompanying map was downloaded 350 times in the year up to July       2013.
[5] It and the other CMCS monographs on Ancient Celtic attracted       particular interest in Eastern Europe, e.g., collaboration in an open       meeting in the Bulgarian National Archaeological Institute and Museum in       2010 (Aberystwyth University `being an important centre of Celtic       Studies'), followed by requests to help with a Celtic tourist centre in       Bulgaria.
[6] Sims-Williams's CMCS article in linking the Llywarch       Hen poems and Llan-gors (see 2. above) led to an invitation to address the       Powysland Club in 2011 and a request by a Heritage Lottery Fund       partnership project between `Head4Arts' and the National Museum of Wales       to assist with the libretto for Ynys Gwydr: Island of Glass, an       opera about Llan-gors featuring Llywarch [7, 9, 10].
The opera was staged       in Merthyr Tudful and the Wales Millennium Centre 12-20 April 2013.
The       project aimed to raise public engagement with an `elist' artform, to       increase the community's sense of ownership of its heritage, and to add to       cultural regeneration, and was deemed a great success [7,8].
Influence on HE curricula beyond Aberystwyth       CMCS's influence on HE curricula is illustrated by the Bibliography of         medieval Welsh literature for students, which has 177       journal-citations for 1993-2011, of which 52 (29%) are to CMCS,       the most cited journal, followed by Studia Celtica with 23       (13%).
[11] Sims-Williams's 1998 CMCS article `Celtomania and       Celtoscepticism' (cited in 2.
), was particularly influential on the       development of the discipline, partly via its reprinting in a volume on Critical         Concepts in Historical Studies (ed.
R. Karl &amp; D. Stifter).
It       was abridged in a Russian magazine in 2008 (`Kel'tomanija i       Kel'toskepticizm', Neprikosnovennyj zapas [Moscow], 57 (2008),       179-91), and praised as `wonderful, one of the most balanced views of the       problems at hand' in the inaugural lecture of the Professor of Celtic       Studies at the University of Sydney in 2008 [12].
It introduced the now       widespread term Celtoscepticism/Celtoskepticism to the English       language, copied as Celto-scepticisme in French.
[13] Thus a new       Celtic Studies MA course at Bangor (2013) considers `What are the       strengths and weaknesses of "Celtomania" and "Celtoscepticism"?'.
[14] The       article is one of several CMCS items (cf.
2. above) much used in HE;       according to a professor in the Humboldt University, Berlin:     `In teaching Celtic Studies to students in Germany, Sims-Williams's       article Celtomania and Celtoscepticism (1998) has become a       standard starting point that introduces beginners to complicated issues in       a competent and unbiassed way.
Rodway's discussion of The date and         authorship of Culhwch ac Olwen (2005) is a must for every class       approaching this important Welsh text, as is Haycock's Taliesin's         Questions (1997) for graduates.
The admirable readiness to take up       challenges for teaching and research in the field of Celtic is perhaps       most evident in the monograph series.
The volumes by Raybould &amp;       Sims-Williams on Continental Celtic personal names (2007 and 2009), with       English translations and helpful comments, make it possible for the first       time to present the evidence of Latin inscriptions to undergraduates.
'[2]     Another HE appreciation of CMCS comes from the &#201;cole Pratique des       Hautes &#201;tudes, Paris:     `As a teacher of Celtic languages, I found this journal full of resources       ....
Some contributions from the editor address central questions in       Celtic Studies (1998, 2012); this is, in a way, a re-foundation of Celtic       Studies'.
[2]     The importance for HE of the CMCS 2012 contribution here       mentioned (Sims-Williams, `Celtic     Civilization: Continuity or Coincidence?')
is also praised by a teacher       in the USA:     `Sims-Williams' extraordinary article on "Celtic Civilization" leaves one       breathless.
Forty-four densely packed pages with oodles of footnoted       references&#8212;really a summary of Celtic studies scholarship published over       the past 25 years or more.
This is a model of scholarly research at its       best.
I will again be teaching the retired/adult-learner class on a Celtic       topic, and of course I will share the article with them&#8212;truly it will be a       kind of ice-breaker for the students, to bring into focus the breadth and       depth of this important area of humanistic research' [2].
Another note:     `I have just started teaching here at Belmont Abbey College in North       Carolina and already CMCS has been making an impact on my       students, especially the recent research from Clarke, Rodway and Bisagni       on the origins of Leprechauns [CMCS 2010-12].
Leprechauns are far       more prevalent in American culture today than they ever were in Ireland so       the topic was a good way to introduce a range of ideas &#8212; including early       Irish scholarship and the blending of local and Christian ideas sometimes       found therein &#8212; in my course on Early Christian Ireland' [2].
Similarly a professor from the Netherlands comments:     `As CMCS is written in an accessible language and offers a       platform to young scholars, it is an important source of inspiration for       the student generation ...
I find especially rewarding the research       articles (and monographs) by, for instance Haycock, Constantine,       Falileyev' [2].
