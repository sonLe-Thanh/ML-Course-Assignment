     The research has impacted on the provision of healthcare in the Far North       of Russia, involving thousands of patients.
This is the main source of       impact.
However, the research has also received media attention [5.4]       and [5.5] in explaining how economic stress leads to financial       crisis [3.3].
Healthcare       The provision of healthcare to the people of the Far North is complex.
The       health of the population is influenced by many factors, including the       physical environment, climate, genetics, health-related behaviours, and       living conditions.
Healthcare provision in the Far North faces serious and       unique challenges, and has led to calls within Russia to recognise a       distinct branch of science called Arctic Medicine, in the same way that       Tropical Medicine is globally recognised.
Identification of this need for       specialist healthcare provision, further fuelled by plans for intensive       industrial development in the Far North, has led to the establishment of       the Scientific Research Institute of Medical Problems of the North.
The official mission of the Institute is the "preservation and       development of the health, longevity and active life of the human       population of the Far North and Siberia''.
This institute not only has a       research function but also a huge clinical mission, It has been directly       involved in a number of activities, based on the work of the Leicester       team, discussed below, which have improved the health and well-being of       inhabitants of the Far North.
To fulfil its mission, the Institute carries       out research, provides medical treatment and organises expeditions to the       region to monitor the health of the population, consult with practitioners       and prepare recommendations for local authorities and medical service       providers.
The Unit's analysis of dynamical models of adaptation research has been       used by the Institute to reveal the mechanisms of human adaptation to the       harsh living conditions in the Far North.
The director of the Institute, VT Manchuk, one of the most prominent       Russian experts in polar medicine, has testified to the value of the       research findings in guiding the organisation's expeditions and monitoring       work.
In a letter, he stated that: "the developed methods of adaptation       monitoring and control are now widely used in the practice of health       monitoring in the Russian Far North.
Many groups and regions and thousands       of people have been monitored with the help of this technique.''
[5.1]     Professor Manchuk has also provided several specific examples of the ways       in which the research had been applied.
These include:            A study of 4,770 inhabitants of Evenkia (a district of Krasnoyarsk)         including 1,248 natives and 3,522 migrants showed the difference in         response to various allergic disorders.
The results have been used in         recommendations to the local authorities concerning treatment of the         different groups of people [5.2].
A study of 305 Eastern Siberians between the ages of 15 and 79 of the         interaction between intracellular pathogens with allergic diseases.
Adaptometric methodology developed in Leicester allowed for estimation         of the strength of the immune system to such diseases, and diagnosis of         the adaptation of the system at the cellular level [5.3].
The monitoring of gastric secretory function in children living in         northern conditions (500 patients) which led to treatment and         recommendations for differentiated treatment according to ethnicity and         diet [5.1].
Development of differentiated interventions for different ethnic         groups of the Far North, who demonstrate different adaptation response         to environmental change (pollution, global warming, translocation).
A         study of 388 patients using adaptometry identified the different factors         which are most harmful to each group.
Not only has the research from Leicester allowed for specific       intervention such as detailed above, but it has also led to a systematic       approach to the monitoring of patients: (i) identification of groups who       need treatment; (ii) identification of high risk groups; (iii) evaluation       of new treatments and interventions.
This more systematic approach has       been applied across many thousands of patients in addition to the cases       mentioned above.
Manchuk states in his letter to the University that: "there are many       other examples of applications involving in total thousands of patients       for monitoring, consultation and treatment.
The methods for adaptation       modelling, monitoring and control developed by Professor Gorban and his       team already have valuable impact on the health monitoring and management       in Russian Far North and Siberia".
