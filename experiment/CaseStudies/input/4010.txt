     Canakinumab was licensed for the treatment of CAPS, a new highly       effective medicine for a rare       orphan disease, in the EU [a] and the US in 2009 and in Japan in       2011 [b].
Data for licensing       arose principally from the clinical trials led by Hawkins.
The NHS CAPS Treatment Service, established in 2010 as a result of       Hawkins' research, and       funded directly by the Department of Health, provides the national service       for patients with       autoinflammatory diseases, offering a clinical and genetic diagnostic       service, and highly effective       treatment with specific cytokine inhibitors [c].
Fifty patients       with CAPS are currently receiving       canakinumab treatment in the UK centre, at an annual cost of &#163;3.6m, and       nearly 300 patients are       now being treated world-wide, 234 of whom have CAPS and the remainder       having other       autoinflammatory diseases [d].
An international registry to document the safety and efficacy of       canakinumab has been created [e],       to which Hawkins contributed design and serves as a member of the steering       committee.
Among       the 241 CAPS patients enrolled on the registry, only two have discontinued       treatment due to poor       therapeutic response.
CAPS-causing mutations result in excessive production of interleukin       103b2 (IL-103b2), which causes       disabling multi-system inflammation from birth.
Patients suffer severe       fatigue, fever and muscle       pains on a daily basis that mimic influenza, many symptoms of which are       also caused by excessive       IL-1&#946; clinical features include chronic anaemia and inflammation in the       skin, eyes, joints and brain       that presents as rashes, conjunctivitis, arthritis, chronic meningitis,       blindness, deafness and in       some cases cognitive impairment.
About 25% of patients develop AA       amyloidosis that results in       kidney failure and death within 5-10 years.
Growth and development are       impaired, and puberty is       delayed as a result of chronic severe inflammation.
Patients with CINCA,       the most severe CAPS       phenotype, often die before adulthood.
Treatment of CAPS with the monoclonal IL-103b2 antibody, canakinumab,       results in complete or near-complete       remission of the disabling inflammation that affects the skin, eyes,       joints and brain and       causes the major flu-like symptoms and fevers.
The overwhelming fatigue       that impedes       employment and social activities is abolished, corroborated in clinical       studies through normalisation       of the SF-36 quality of life and FACIT-F&#169; fatigue scores.
In       the long term, there is every       expectation that continued treatment with canakinumab will prevent the       skeletal deformities,       blindness, deafness and amyloidosis that commonly occur.
Catch-up growth       and age-appropriate       sexual maturation have been observed in adolescents with CAPS who have       been treated with       canakinumab.
Feedback from patients treated with canakinumab [f] includes:     "I could not have imagined such a change in fortune due to this         drug..."     "My whole body ached, I had difficulty walking and had to be carried         to bed.
I missed a lot         of school with severe headaches, and could not even have a bath due to         the rash.
I cannot         believe the effect of this drug, my symptoms have completely         disappeared."
"My joints and whole body would swell right up, and I would itch until         I would bleed, and had         terrible migraines.
I am now NORMAL!!!"
"My joint inflammation and pains have completely disappeared"     "My daughter had terrible headaches, conjunctivitis, and rashes, and         was hardly able to get         of bed.
She was shunned at school, and put in a remedial class.
It got         so bad she took an         overdose.
After the drug all the symptoms vanished; she is happy and         alive for the first         time, and is now working and has her first boyfriend at 20 years old!"
"Joints were excruciating, and now the symptoms have disappeared"     "The effects have been absolutely life changing for me".
"This is a wonder drug".
