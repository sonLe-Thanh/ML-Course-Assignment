     Described as `social sculptures for a world in a constant state of         flux' (The Guardian, 2009), the outcomes from the research are       specifically intended to raise awareness of issues in relation to       biodiversity, environmental conditions, climate change and basic human       rights.
Reach and significance of impact is evidenced by visitor numbers       to the many public displays of the work, prominent commissions, and active       participation by the public in activities especially designed to engender       engagement with the issues.
A further indicator of the significance is       given by the institutions with which partnerships have been formed, many       of whom are at the forefront of efforts to increase public understanding       with regard to sustainability issues.
A work positioned in a prominent public space in St Pancras International       Station, London is the site-specific installation Clouds:Meteoros.
Related to OrtaWater, which deals with the general scarcity of       water and issues around the privatisation and corporate control that       affect access to clean water - Clouds focuses on the plastic       bottle with its multiple ecological, economic and social meanings.
Clouds:Meteoros,       two monumental suspended cloud sculptures with seated figures, was the       winning sculpture for the `Terrace Wires' international competition and       replaced the Olympic Rings in St Pancras Station in London (2013).
Over       the six-month period, more than 24 million visitors saw Clouds:Meteoros       (source: CEO HS1 Ltd. owners of St Pancras International), and the       sculpture was said to be `putting the rest of the station's art in the         shade' and bringing `the gothic structure back to life' (The       Guardian, April 2013).
Orta presented on Clouds:Meteoros in her       talk Clouds: a way to transport water at the TEDxWWF in Abu Dhabi       (May 2013).
Her invitation to speak at this platform for `world-leading         environmental thinkers and doers' was in recognition of her work on       how art can help to create a sustainable future for our planet.
The Ortas' recent exhibition at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, which       opened in July 2013, again took water as its central theme, as did the       artwork OrtaWater Fluvial Unit.
This work, addressing themes of       water and sustainable development was commissioned for the Austrian       Pavilion International Expo, Zaragoza, Spain, and attracted approximately       700,000 visitors from June to September 2008 (source: exhibition       organiser).
Three large-scale interventions (OrtaWater Purification         Factory, Antarctica World Passport Delivery Village and Nexus         Architecture) were shown at the 9th Shanghai Biennale (October       2012-March 2013) which attracted approximately 200,000 visitors (source:       exhibition organiser).
Here OrtaWater Purification Factory drew       water from Shanghai's Huangpu river.
It was then purified in a large       `factory-like' installation and snaked around the museum for visitors to       partake in the experience of drinking clean water sourced from the       polluted river.
Antarctica World Passport is an example of the use of tools       designed to actively engage the public in the issues communicated by the       artwork.
Since 2008, members of the public have been invited to visit       installations of Antarctica World Passport Bureau and commit to       becoming `citizens' of a no-borders community, with the aim of stimulating       exchange and creating awareness of their responsibilities as part of the       world community.
`Citizens' are issued with passports and commit to       combating all acts of barbarity, fighting against intimidation and       poverty, supporting social progress, protecting the environment and       endangered species, safeguarding human dignity, and defending the       inalienable rights to liberty, justice and peace in the world.
Since 2009,       information on these `citizens' has been carefully collated and stored on       an MIT-designed database and in July 2013 this information was uploaded to       a new digital social platform.
For the Southbank Centre's Festival of the World in London (May -       September 2012) a new iteration of the Antarctica World Passport         Bureau was commissioned.
It took the form of a room-sized       installation designed to attract and encourage reflection on Antarctica's       position as the last `free' landmass on our planet and on its       vulnerability to the dangers presented by climate change.
For the       festival, forty-four, 4 x 6 metre Antarctic M&#233;tisse Flags flew       from the roof of the Royal Festival Hall, during the Queen's Diamond       Jubilee and London Olympic Games.
Around 25,000 people visited the Antarctica         World Passport Bureau and nearly 5,600 individuals signed up to the       ideals of a no-border community and were issued with `passports'.
Footfall       on the Southbank Centre site during the Festival of the World was       approximately 7.8 million people (source: exhibition curator) and the       flags featured on the Southbank Centre's interactive homepage for the       event and in the trailer for the festival.
The Festival of the World       aimed to celebration the importance of art to various communities around       the world.
The Ortas were selected to participate as their `work blends         visual art, global awareness and community specify.
In particular their         Antarctica series was an obvious thematic fit, addressing issues of         freedom of movement, geographical relationships, and social         responsibility.
In the context of the Festival, an important aspect of         the Ortas' work was its ability to raise awareness and elicit the active         participation of visitors, making them more conscious of their position         in the world.'

Amazonia was commissioned by National History Museum's       Contemporary Art programme and formed a `key element' of the NHM's       contribution to the United Nations' International Year of Biodiversity.
NHM was at the heart of this major campaign and the Ortas `created an         exhibition that took the visitor on a mental journey and urged them to         become better stewards of nature.'
The recorded audience figure was       41,302, an average of 607 per day (source: Amazonia curator).
As       well as an installation of sculpture filling the Jerwood Galley exhibition       space, an entire wall was devoted to a photographic record of plant       species and graphic data recording a research plot that was protected as       part of the project.
Associated with this work was the ongoing public       engagement project, Perpetual Amazonia 10,000 plots = 10,000       posters, in which the public could take away a Perpetual Amazonia       poster in exchange for a financial contribution towards the preservation       of the metre-square plot it represented.
More than 8000 posters were       acquired, with the proceeds funding further research in the Amazon.
A new       venture for NHM was the engagement of volunteers to be present through the       exhibition period.
A total of just over 50 volunteers who had backgrounds       in science communication, arts, science, and in particular biodiversity       studies, interacted with visitors enhancing the interpretation and public       dissemination of the artists' ideas.
The Ecologist (October 2010) said       that the exhibition `[...] uses artwork to suggest and inspire         creative solutions to an impending environmental catastrophe' and of       Perpetual Amazonia that it `makes us consider how much we value         the natural world in monetary terms, in a way that mirrors the trend in         green politics to focus on the financial impact of environmental         degradation and climate change.
We want the lovely poster of flowers on         our wall at home, but are we prepared to pay to ensure the flowers still         exist in the future?'
Cape Farewell supported the work for Amazonia by bringing       together artists and scientists on an expedition to the Peruvian       Rainforest, and have placed the Ortas within their wider arts programme,       with the aim of engaging the public's imagination on the subject of       climate change.
In 2009 Antarctic Village-No           Borders was exhibited as part of the group exhibition GSK Contemporary-Earth:       Art of a Changing World at the Royal Academy of Arts, London (co-curated       by Cape Farewell).
The work was included at the centre of the show       alongside other exhibits that elucidated `the role of the artist in         the cycle of human and cultural evolution - as communicator, reflector         and interpreter of key issues of the day.'
The pieces Windows on         the World and Vitrine are also included in Cape Farewell's       international touring exhibition U-n-f-o-l-d, which has been shown       in 8 venues, most recently to CAFA, Beijing.
Work from Amazonia       was exhibited alongside that of four other artists in Cape Farewell's Carbon         12 exhibition at the Espace Fondation, EDF, Paris (May-September       2012).
The significance of the work was further evidenced by Orta's invitation       to give an address for the symposium Rising to the Climate Challenge:         Artists and Scientists Imagine Tomorrow's World in 2010.
The event       was a partnership between the Royal Society and Tate for the 350th       Anniversary of the Royal Society, bringing together scientists and artists       to imagine the social and psychological impacts of climate change.
In 2008       Orta was invited to become a Member of the European Cultural Parliament       and gave a presentation in Liverpool for the 2008 Culture, Media and       Democracy session, where she discussed the Antarctica project and       distributed passports to the members.
In 2008, the musician and campaigner       Bono was presented with Window on the World-Antarctica when he was       honoured by the 9th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates with the Peace       Summit Award.
In 2012 Orta participated in a round table discussion Art         for a Change of Perspective?
as part of "Art and Ecology: a question       of taste or science?"
at the Mus&#233;um National d'Histoire Naturelle,       organised by COAL (Coalition pour l'Art et le D&#233;veloppement Durable).
A       select number of international organisations, cultural institutions, NGOs,       associations, corporations and foundations as well as scientists and       artists discussed global initiatives and strategies to initiate an       artistic approach to sustainable development.
