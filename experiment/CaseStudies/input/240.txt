 The impact of this research has changed the way orthopaedic surgeons carry out THRs.
Fewer and larger anchorage holes are drilled perpendicularly to the hip socket to reduce stress risers and implant failure.
The subchondral bone is preserved to maintain good load distribution in the hip socket and cement mantle thickness is selected according to patient bone quality and size.
Cement-to-cement interface is thoroughly cleaned during revision surgery to maintain mechanical integrity.
Our research activities are clinically led; we work closely with orthopaedic clinicians from MEHT, Broomfield Hospital (2008-2013) and Ramsay Springfield Hospital (2008-2013), to improve THR surgical fixation techniques to increase implant longevity and to delay or avoid the need for revision surgery.
We have raised orthopaedic surgeons' awareness of the wide variations in surgical fixation techniques and the importance of correct implant fixation techniques to increase biomechanical stability through research dissemination to major stakeholders and at strategic meetings, including: i) major international conferences, regularly attended by orthopaedic surgeons and companies, (the 18th European Orthopaedic Research Society, July 2010, Davos, &gt;300 delegates; the 22nd International Society of Biomechanics; July 2009, Cape Town, 595 delegates; the 22nd International Society of Technology in Arthroplasty, October 2009, Hawaii, 600 delegates; MERG-organised mini-symposium on surgical fixation techniques at the 8th Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering Conference &#8212; February 2008, Porto, &gt;400 delegates); ii) the East of England Orthopaedic Research Meetings, (The Black Notley Conferences &#8212; March 2013 and June 2012, and the Denis Dunn Day &#8212; June 2008, &gt;100 delegates, each) iii) journal publications: (Technology and Healthcare, 2008 16(1):19-30; Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, 2009 12(5):501-510); iv) medical companies to integrate new knowledge in their products (invited speaker at ERBI 11th Cambridge BioPartnering Exchange, June 2009, attended by over 800 delegates; London Technology Network conference in March 2009, attended by over 200 delegates; the joint Anglia Ruskin University Medical Engineering / MediTech / HealthTech and Medicines Knowledge Transfer Network Conference in June 2011, attended by 65 delegates); v) patients, their carers and the wider community, who are the direct beneficiaries (the Broomfield Hospital Hip Day, June 2008, attended by over 200 THR patients / carers); vi) funding bodies &#8212; presentation of CMERT-funded research outputs at annual progress review meetings to the CMERT committee from 2009 to 2013).
Our research has helped surgeons make informed decision on treatment methods.
For example, a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at MEHT (Broomfield Hospital) testified: "...I have used the techniques that were seen to be effective from the research you did concerning the shape, number of key holes and cement mantle thickness in cemented total hip replacements since 2000, with excellent results.
The clinical importance is the success of the operation and the reduction in the number of patients requiring revision hip surgery for aseptic loosening of the acetabular cup, thus saving the NHS costly revision surgery.
I think that the use of these techniques would reduce the need for revision hip surgery by 50%.
This would be 8% loosening over 10 years prior to introduction, to 2-4% since the introduction of improved techniques."
A Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Broomfield Hospital has implemented these surgical fixation techniques on 35 THRs annually from 2000 to 2010, when he focused on spine surgery.
During this time, he had been training 2 surgeons annually to use our recommended surgical techniques.
He believes that our recommended surgical fixation technique has resulted in a reduced length of stay in hospital by 4 days for each THR operation and reduced patient recovery time.
THR patient satisfaction remains high at 98%.
Savings associated with length of stay in hospital alone (&#163;300/day) are estimated to be &#163;696,600 between 2008-2013.
Further savings are associated with the lower unit cost of a cemented polyurethane cup (&#163;235-&#163;389) compared to those of a non- cemented ceramic cup (&#163;1,663) and a non-cemented polymer cup (&#163;1,351), resulting in a saving of &#163;1,000-&#163;1,300 per operation.
The trend of an increasing number of continuing impacts emerging from our work on THR is demonstrated by the following:  Broomfield Hospital has recently been highly rated nationally for total hip replacements.
According to new data from the Department of Health patients who have hip replacements at Broomfield Hospital have the best outcomes in the country.
According to analysis by the King's fund thinktank, Broomfield Hospital scored highest in patient-recorded outcome measures for hip replacements among over 200 English NHS hospitals Mid Essex Hospitals scored very high in Hip Fracture Care, according to the 2013 National Hip Fracture Database Report, which covers 61,508 hip fracture cases among 180 UK hospitals.
Continual stream of external income from the CMERT (five awards since 2008, total of &#163;145,650), as a result of their confidence in our research &#8212;detailed in Section 3; Successful long-term collaborations with prestigious institutions that resulted in high-quality research outcomes are: i) the Hospital for Special Surgery &#8212; top-ranked orthopaedic hospital in the US, rated by the US news and World, and ii) Boston and Harvard Universities, to translate our research skills to the conservative treatment of the lower limb.
Two prestigious international awards resulted from this novel approach to identify and treat early-stage knee osteoarthritis: i) best Orthopaedic Research Society knee poster at the 2013 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting, which attracts over 25k delegates, and ii) the 2012 Mimics Innovations Award.
Successful collaboration with scientists from Micro and Nanotechnology Centre of the Science and Technology Facilities Council, the Electrospinning Company Ltd and Symmetry Medical on novel biological nanocoating technology on implants.
Our complementary expertise led to a 2008 Medical Futures Innovation Award in the Orthopaedics Category.
