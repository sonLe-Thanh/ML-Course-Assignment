     This research has had significant impact in three domains: professional       practice, Christian organisations, and public debate about       environmentalism.
Impact on professional practice       Together with clinicians and other professionals from NHS Scotland and the       Scottish Government, Haldane was a member of the working group which       produced the report Making Difficult Decisions in NHS Boards in         Scotland, published March 2010 (the difficult decisions in question       concern prioritisation of healthcare resources) [S3].
Haldane, the       only philosopher involved, was able to draw upon his research on values       and practical reasoning (e.g.
[1], especially the papers in section I).
This report has been cited by further NHS documents, for example A         Framework for Decision-Making for the Scottish Pre-Implantation Genetic         Diagnosis and Screening Service, and the NHS Shetland         Decision-Making Policy; it was cited by Nicola Sturgeon MSP in       responding to written question S3W-39407 in the Scottish Parliament In       March 2011.
[S4]     Between 2010 and 2013, both Haldane and Dr Lisa Jones (Principal Teaching       Fellow, in post since 2004), have worked with the Judicial Skills       Committee of the Scottish Judiciary, providing ethics training as part of       quarterly residential courses.
These courses were attended by judges,       sheriffs and other judicial officials from Scotland, Italy, Ireland,       Romania, Germany, and elsewhere, including Chief Justices of the UK and       Canada, and the Master of the Rolls.
Feedback on these courses includes "Excellent         contribution that set agenda for a very lively discussion of a wide         range of topical issues with direct bearing on judicial work"       (25/2/2010) and "made me give thought to the time I take in my working         day to think of fundamental ethical or philosophical issues arising in         cases.
I will now make time" (2/2/11).
[S2]     In developing this training, Jones and Haldane used various elements of       Haldane's research in practical philosophy.
For example, `Crime,       Compensation and Social Solidarity' ([1], chapter 11), was relevant to the       following session held in 2012-13: "`Ethics of Punishment' by Prof John         Haldane, University of St Andrews.
This presentation looked at theories         of punishment and the philosophical angle of what punishment entails.
This was followed by some problem scenarios put to the participants,         looking at ethical dilemmas they could potentially face.
Feedback for         the course was positive.
Delegates noted that the sessions were         interesting and informative."
[S5, p.16]     Impact on Christian institutions and organisations       Haldane is a leading Catholic thinker, who has published philosophical       research on the role of religion and philosophy in the public sphere (e.g.
[2]), including work in philosophy of education (e.g.
[1] chapter 13       `Understanding Education', and [3]).
Christian institutions worldwide have       sought his expertise, and he has engaged formally with the following:             Pontifical Council for Culture (Rome): Haldane is a Consultor,         one of a group of experts asked to, `assist the Council by their         research and the information and opinions they provide'.
The Center for Ethics and Culture (Notre Dame, US) brings         together policymakers, physicians and academics `to share the richness         of [the] Catholic moral and intellectual tradition'): Haldane is a         Senior Research Fellow.
The Anscombe Bioethics Centre (Oxford) is not affiliated to         any HEI, but `engages in scholarly dialogue with academics and         practitioners of other traditions.
It contributes to public policy         debates as well as to debates and consultations within the Church.
It         runs educational programmes for, and gives advice to, Catholics and         other interested healthcare professionals and biomedical scientists':         Haldane is a member of the Academic Advisory Council.
Campion College (Sydney) is a Catholic liberal arts college         (the first in Australia): Haldane is a member of the International         Advisory Board, tasked with `providing advice and assistance to the         College on issues related to its broad educational interests and         initiatives'.
The St Ninian Institute (Dundee) is an educational institute         serving the Diocese of Dunkeld as well as the Catholic community in         Scotland: Haldane is a member of the Board of Trustees.
The Catholic Union of Great Britain is the leading lay         organization in Great Britain to champion the teachings of the Catholic         Church in the public sphere: Haldane is Vice-President (Scotland).
Some of this impact lies within the higher education sector, and is       included not as impact on research or the advancement of academic       knowledge, but as impact on students, teachers and administrators in these       institutions, via advice on structures, curricula and public activities       (as per Annex C of the REF Assessment Framework and Guidance on       Submissions).
[S6]     Haldane has taken part in several high-profile public debates about the       role of religion in public affairs.
For example, he debated `Secularism       and Faith in the Public Square' with Christopher Hitchens in the       Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford (2010); the video has been downloaded over       200,000 times from YouTube [S7], and prompted debate across blogs       from many different perspectives.
He spoke at the 2012 Battle of Ideas at       the Barbican on `The New Culture Wars', and debated `Tradition: Friend or       Foe of Freedom' live on Australia's ABC network (July 2013).
He has also       engaged with politicians and other public figures; for example, one       crossbench peer writes "I have benefited from John Haldane's writings         on fundamental ethical, social and political ideas, as are found in his         book Practical Philosophy: Ethics, Culture and Society (2010) [1],         finding them useful in my own thinking for example about the nature of         liberalism and about difficult and contested issues such as euthanasia."
[S1]     Impact on public debate about environmentalism and climate change       Tim Mulgan's Future People [6] paved the way for his Ethics         for a Broken World: Imagining Philosophy After Catastrophe (Acumen,       October 2011).
Aimed at a broad audience, this book takes the perspective       of future people living in a world where material resources are       insufficient to meet everyone's basic needs, and is presented as a series       of `history of philosophy' lectures reflecting back on the thought of our       times.
The ethical questions which currently concern us are shown to look       very different from the perspective of a ruined world.
Ethics for a Broken World has sold over 800 copies to date, and       has been warmly reviewed both in academic journals, and in wider fora: "What         is particularly impressive about this book is the engaging style in         which it is written.
It is accessible, entertaining, and even funny.
This makes it the perfect book for those with an amateur interest in the         subject."
(Philosophy Now July 2013).
Likewise, Mulgan's research has influenced Scruton's Green Philosophy)       [3]: e.g.
reference to Mulgan's [6] on p.187 of Scruton's [3].
Green         Philosophy has been received with great interest by reviewers across       the national press: "philosopher Roger Scruton's thoughtful study on         environmentalism in the conservative tradition arrives at a timely         moment ... a valuable contribution to the debate over environmental         politics" (Caroline Lucas MP, Independent 13/1/12), "Agree         or disagree, Scruton has written a dazzling book" (Simon Jenkins, Sunday         Times 1/1/12), "Scruton's case for a green conservatism is         compelling" (Julian Baggini, Financial Times 30/12/11).
[S8]       It has attracted widespread discussion on websites including       lowimpact.org, bryanappleyard.com, themonthly.com.au,       conservativehome.blogs.org, and Critical Marxist blog       tendancecoatsey.wordpress.com, typically with lively debate in the       comments section.
[S9]     Both Mulgan and Scruton have given a number of public talks based on this       research.
For Mulgan, these include public lectures about the `Broken       World' ideas in St Andrews (2008), Auckland (2009), and at Dutch       think-tank the Club of Amsterdam (2010).
For Scruton these include talks       and debates about environmentalism at UK think-tank the Policy Exchange       (2012), the Royal Society of Arts (2012), the Gladstone Club (2012) the       Forum for European Philosophy at the LSE (2013), and in Basel (2012); he       also discussed Green Philosophy on Radio 4's Start the Week       (5/12/2011).
