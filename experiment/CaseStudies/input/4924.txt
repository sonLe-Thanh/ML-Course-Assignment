     The research on understanding ecohydrological processes at       landscape-scale wetland restoration       projects and on designing monitoring systems for such projects, has had       impact through:     (i) Changing the habitat restoration and monitoring practices of           conservation NGOs         engaged in wetland restoration.
This impact has been       achieved by re-framing approaches       to wetland restoration as `open-ended' rather than `prescriptive' and by       providing a guideline       document for wetland monitoring (see Stroh and Hughes, 2010 in section 5).
The adoption of       an open-ended approach to wetland restoration has led to a change in       management and       particularly in monitoring practices by the Wildlife Trust and the       National Trust at the Great Fen       and Wicken Fen Vision projects respectively.
For example, at the Wicken       Fen Vision project,       the research has had a direct impact on the National Trust's vegetation       and water level       monitoring protocols.
Moreover, the open-ended approach and the guideline       document have       had wider impact, evidence for which includes:            Francine Hughes invited to give advisory seminars on `open-ended'         management and         monitoring at wetland habitat restoration sites to: (i) British Trust         for Ornithology (Jan 2012)       (ii) NT's regional conservation advisors and Central Conservation Group         (5th Oct 2011);       (iii) EU-Leonardo da Vinci Partnership Programme of European wetland         reserve managers         (22nd May 2012)       Inclusion of Francine Hughes and Peter Stroh on NT's Local Committee         at Wicken Fen (a         nature conservation advisory committee which meets 4 times per annum;         chaired by         Francine Hughes 2004-09) and Peter Stroh on advisory committee at Great         Fen.
542 downloads of guideline document from ARU's website since November         2011       A request for 140 hard copies of the guideline document by the EA, NE         and NGOs       Favourable review of the guideline document in British Wildlife, 2011         (25,000 readers)          (ii) Capacity building to enhance biodiversity practice.
Between       2008 and 2012, Peter Stroh       and Francine Hughes provided training in biodiversity identification and       survey methods at the       fen wetland restoration sites for over 100 volunteers from the general       public and 60 6th form       students from Long Road Sixth Form College, Cambridge by organising 44       training workshops       and field visits across Great Fen and Wicken Fen.
In addition 18 amateur       or professional       experts engaged in training or monitoring activities associated with this       project.
Evidence for       the impact:            Annual biodiversity and hydrological monitoring by specialist groups         of volunteers (e.g.
bird         and plant surveys, hydrological data collection) for the NGOs involved         in the wetland         restoration projects continues to take place at both Wicken Fen and         Great Fen following         completion of the research.
(iii) Challenging conventional wisdoms through debate with           stakeholder groups.
Francine       Hughes has addressed and discussed with a wide range of stakeholder       audiences how to       design, monitor and evaluate landscape-scale wetland restoration projects       using an open-       ended approach.
Audiences have included members of the public, parish       councillors, UK local       government representatives, conservation NGOs, government agencies, EU       conservation       practitioners and policy makers.
There is scepticism in some parts of the       conservation       practitioner community and the general public about the relevance of using       an open-ended       approach to the setting of restoration objectives because of the uncertain       biodiversity       outcomes.
Peter Stroh wrote 8 articles in regularly distributed NGO       newsletters to interpret this       work for a wider audience (22,000 households receive these newsletters       around Wicken Fen).
The increasing recognition of the importance of an open-ended approach to       biodiversity       conservation and restoration is evidenced by:            Francine Hughes invited to speak at a Natural England workshop on         `landscape-scale         habitat restoration' designed to co-ordinate a response to a draft         version of a UK White         paper `The Natural Choice: securing the value of nature' (Feb. 2010)       Policy changes endorsing landscape-scale, process-driven approaches to         biodiversity         restoration and their importance in underpinning ecosystem services in         UK White paper         `The Natural Choice: securing the value of nature' (DEFRA 2011)          (iv) Increasing the influence of conservation NGOs and their           capacity for advocacy by         enabling the measurement of ecosystem services at protected wetland           sites threatened         with land use change.
The Toolkit for ecosystem services       measurement (TESSA) began in       2010 as a collaboration between academic and practitioner partners in       response to a demand       by protected area managers for a toolkit that could measure ecosystem       services and provide       data for use in advocacy where choices about land use had to be made.
It       enables non-experts to make state-of-the-art assessments of ecosystem services in all       habitats, including       restored wetlands.
TESSA has been tested or is being tested at 32 sites       worldwide by       numerous national and international NGOs, (e.g.
15 sites across Africa       through the Tropical       Biological Association; 9 sites owned or managed by the RSPB plus 2 in UK       Overseas       territories).
Its application at the Wicken Fen Vision project led to the       discovery that the       economic value per hectare of restored wetland is higher than the       pre-restoration use of the       land for intensive arable agriculture.
Evidence for its impact includes:            The NT is able to defend its conversion of arable land to restored         wetland in the Fens at a         time when food security is high on the political agenda       The RSPB can demonstrate the value of landscape-scale wetland         restoration projects in         the fens where it has converted arable land and former aggregate sites         to wetland       1500 hard copies of the TESSA introductory document were requested by         Birdlife         International's partner organizations during 2012       Over 35 electronic requests for copies of the TESSA toolkit during its         testing phase         (January 2011-July 2013)
