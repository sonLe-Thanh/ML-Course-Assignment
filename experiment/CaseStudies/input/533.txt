     Research by the Liverpool School of Architecture Lighting Group has made       a significant and active contribution to the formulation of national and       international design guidance, and hence on the design practice of the UK       and international lighting industry.
In addition the methods developed       during the research were taken up in the R&amp;D test protocols for the       lighting industry.
The development of lighting design for interiors to take account of         room contents       Research on lighting of building interiors, which are obstructed by room       contents, commenced in 1983 and early work on light loss assessment and       luminaire layouts led to the effects of obstruction being included in       lighting design for the first time, with results from the research being       incorporated into the 2009 and subsequent Society of Light and Lighting       Code for Interior Lighting.
The significance of this is that internal       obstructions account for approximately 10% light loss.
Although lighting       designers know of this effect they traditionally over-design the system in       compensation, with resultant unnecessary energy use and costs.
The       research permits that over-design to be eliminated.
Active collaboration       with Thorn Lighting in the UK and Toshiba Lighting and Technology       Corporation, Japan, extended the design methods to take account of a wide       range of building types and lighting equipment.
Both companies used the       results to inform their lighting design procedures.
The report Lighting design for obstructed interiors from the       Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) Technical Committee TC 3-31,       Chaired by Carter, drew heavily on the Liverpool work and the report       continues to act as specialist reference for national and international       design codes.
Of particular significance to this case study is the related research on       obstructed interiors, which has led to the development of methods used for       field measurement of task and planar illuminance in occupied interiors.
This work is incorporated into the current (2012) Society of Light and       Lighting Code for Interior Lighting (used in the UK), and also into the       CIE/ISO Interior Code (Lighting of work places Part 1: Indoor 2001) which       remains the main code world-wide.
Involvement of the occupant in the control of light levels and         electricity usage       The research on lighting control investigated the manner in which people       use individual systems to create a satisfactory visual environment.
The       research demonstrated that users with individual control select lower       light levels than those specified in codes and the resulting lower       electricity usage is beneficial for the environment.
This research was       funded by, and in collaboration with, the Building Research Establishment       and supported by ECS Lighting Control and the results were incorporated       into the lighting control element of the current revision (2010) of Part L       of the UK Building Regulations.
The replacement of electric lighting with guided daylight systems       The initial Liverpool research on electric source guidance was supported       by Simplex Lighting, a manufacturer of luminaires for industrial       applications.
It developed both methods of analysis of the photometric       performance of these devices and methods of extraction and redirection of       delivered light, both of which were applied to the development of the       Conductalite luminaire, marketed by Simplex.
This research was the basis       for a study of tubular daylight guidance systems - devices which collect,       transport and distribute daylight deep into buildings - undertaken with       the two UK market leaders, Monodraught and Solatube.
The impact of the       work has been threefold:            The results formed the scientific basis both for understanding the         photometry of the devices and their relationship with the building they         light, and for the design procedures used by the manufacturers and         installers.
Dr Carter was appointed Chair of Commission International de         l'Eclairage Technical Committee TC 3-38, concerned with tubular daylight         guidance systems.
Dr Carter was co-author of the present UK guidance document on fibre         optic and remote source lighting, produced jointly by the Institution of         Lighting Engineers and the Society of Light &amp; Lighting.
In addition, current research on hybrid lighting systems, undertaken in       cooperation with two companies, Parans Solar Lighting and Limitless,       continues to inform the design procedures for hybrid systems of both       companies.
