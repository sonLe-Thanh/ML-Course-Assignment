     This case study concerns the impact of Imperial College research since       1993 on the CFD codes       marketed by CD-adapco.
The company has grown steadily over this period;       its turnover has grown       more than 30 fold since 1993 and by over 250% since 2008 to currently ~       $190M pa [A].
Its       principal offices are located in London, Nuremburg and New York and it has       numerous worldwide       sales offices, for example in France, Germany, Italy, USA, Japan, Korea,       China, India, Brazil and       Russia.
It employs nearly 750 staff of whom roughly 80 are located in the       London office.
The       company won a Queen's award for exports in 1997.
The impact of CD-adapco's       CFD products       STAR-CD and STAR-CCM+ is wide-ranging and of considerable benefit to UK       and worldwide       industries, by improving competitiveness via substantially reducing the       costs and time for product       development and enabling innovative design.
Indeed, one of the key selling       points of these       products is the ability to offer a substantial return on investment       through these savings.
STAR-CD, the original general-purpose code is now a bespoke internal       combustion engine       simulator, where it is undoubtedly the world `number one'.
It is used by       most major manufacturers       including Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Fiat, GM, Jaguar Land Rover, Hyundai,       Lotus, Mercedes, Nissan,       Renault, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo e.g.
[7].
Mercedes, Ferrari and       Renault also use it       extensively in Formula 1 for engine design.
Successful though this product       was, it became       apparent in the late 1990s that due to its age and architecture it was not       a suitable platform to       accommodate the improvements and expansions into new application areas       that CD-adapco       wished to make and also to exploit recent research advances at Imperial.
Accordingly, it was       decided to develop an entirely new general-purpose code, STAR-CCM+; and to       specialise STAR-CD       for reciprocating engine applications.
STAR-CCM+, first released in 2004, is the company's current flagship       general-purpose CFD code,       that also has electromagnetic, electrochemical and stress analysis       capabilities.
It is employed       worldwide by a large number of companies in a very wide range of       industries, e.g.
aerospace       (airplanes, rockets, UAVs [8 ]and [9], batteries/battery-powered equipment       [10], chemical process,       defence, food processing [11], fossil-fuelled and renewable (nuclear [13]       and wind/solar) energy,       electronics cooling [13], ground transportation (cars [12], trucks,       trains), marine (ships, offshore       structures [15], oil/gas production and processing [16], pharmaceutical,       etc.
The CFD software       market is extremely competitive and there is a continuing need to develop       more powerful and       flexible numerical solution techniques and new and improved models for a       variety of physical       phenomena.
Developments in these areas at Imperial have assisted in       CD-adapco maintaining a       competitive edge throughout the lifetime of the company.
This has been       particularly true during the       past two decades of rapid growth, due to the following:            Implementation in both codes of the unstructured mesh methodology,         including the         associated numerical solver extensions [1, 2].
These have endowed both         STAR-CD and         STAR-CCM+ with fast transient solution and unique and powerful         complex-geometry-handling         capabilities that, when combined with automatic mesh generation         methodology         developed by the company, offer decisive advantages over the competition         in terms of         speed, capability and ease of use.
In particular, it is no longer         necessary, as in other codes,         to simplify complex geometries in order to mesh and perform a CFD flow         solution; and the         mesh generation times are typically faster by an order of magnitude.
Examples of the         degrees of complexity that can be handled are shown in [3], [8], [12]         and [13].
The additional         benefits to STAR-CD of improvements of engine physics modelling at         Imperial are described         and illustrated in [4] and [7].
Exploitation in producing the new-generation STAR-CCM+, of the proven         advantages         described in Ref 6 of the object-oriented C++ programming language.
The         first version of         this code was released in 2004.
In addition to the benefits of being         easier to develop and         maintain, the object-oriented architecture has facilitated the         introduction of some novel         features including multi-physics and CAD-to-results capabilities.
The         former comprises         additional solid stress, electrochemistry [10] and electromagnetic         solvers, which can be         applied either individually or in a fully-coupled fashion with one or         more of the others &#8212; for         example, to perform fluid/structure stress and/or thermal interaction         simulations.
The latter         feature refers to the ability of STAR-CCM+ to: (a) import or generate,         using an internal solid         modeller, a CAD description of the application geometry; (b) repair any         defects in the         description and isolate the fluid volume on which the analysis is to be         performed; (c)         automatically mesh this volume; (d) perform the required CFD and/or         other physics analysis;         and (e) manipulate, display and output the results in the desired form.
Example applications         are shown in [3], [8], [12] and [13] among others.
STAR-CCM+ is unique         in offering these         features in a single code, as compared with the multiple code offerings         of other CFD         companies.
Implementation in both codes of the multiphase flow methodology         developed at Imperial,         notably the free surface capturing technique [5] which has been         particularly attractive to the         marine and oil and gas industries, the former for ship design and the         latter for offshore         structures [15], pipelines and separation equipment [16].
The growth outlined above means that since 2008 there has been       significant on-going impact       underpinned by the research.
The benefits of all of these developments are       collectively reflected in       the general-purpose STAR-CCM+ code, which has attracted favourable       comments from many       users.
For example, in relation to the unstructured mesh and expanded       modelling features, the       Chief Engineer at Atkins [B], one of the world's leading design,       engineering and project       management consultancies, states that: "The powerful geometry-handling         capabilities of STAR-CCM+,         together with its wide range of physics models, make it an ideal tool         for the diverse         applications we have to deal with."
These same features, together       with the all in one CAD-to-results       architecture facilitated due the use of C++, have been especially valued       by the automotive       community, where in a number of application areas they have enabled       testing to be substantially       reduced or even replaced by simulation, as reflected in the following       remarks by Suwhan Kim, a       senior engineer at Hyundai Motor Corporation in South Korea:"The         automation of underhood         cooling performance analysis is a breakthrough in the field of automated         systems.
At Hyundai,         thermal flow design engineers are very satisfied with the module         [STAR-CCM+].
It has allowed         them to cut down the preparation and design time by about 70%, and has         shown no particular         difficulty in simulating the overall cooling performance for the diverse         range of Hyundai-Kia         automobile models."
[17].
In Formula 1 where speed of turnaround is also important, the Head of CFD       at Lotus Renault GP       Limited [C] comments: "The first thing that separates CD-adapco from         the competition is STAR-CCM+:         it's a state-of-the-art CFD code and since we introduced it we have         managed to massively         increase our simulation throughput.
STAR-CCM+ is a massive step forward.
The code itself is fast,         robust and extremely easy to use so people new to the software can pick         it up very quickly."
It is also particularly noteworthy that over the past 5 years the       CD-adapco group turnover has       increased by more than 15% per annum, a remarkable achievement in times of       economic hardship       and directly attributable to the substantial and proven return on       investment which CD-adapco       products offer, due to their unique features.
