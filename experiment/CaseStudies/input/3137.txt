     The pathway to impact in this case study has two strands.
The first       strand relates to the co- production of the research during the       excavations at Caistor, with Bowden and Bescoby providing the technical,       scholarly and methodological framework, and volunteers participating in       the excavations and the creation of research data.
As such, the research       (and the processes that underpin it) is a primary impact outcome,       equipping the community of volunteers with new skills and providing       valuable personal and professional experience.
The second strand relates       to the concomitant high public profile of the project (supported by media       and public engagement activity) which has highlighted its value to a range       of policy makers whose remit encompasses heritage management.
This has       been recognised in the embedding of the project in their development       strategies.
Community archaeology as citizen science &#8212; co-producing knowledge and         gaining skills       The co-production of knowledge is at the heart of citizen science: From       its inception in 2006, the Caistor Project has been designed and executed       in a way that has directly linked the research process and results with a       range of user communities and organisations.
Their work has contributed to       the advancement of knowledge, and in turn they have developed skills         and experience that have sometimes been of a transformative nature.
To-date over 200 volunteers from the Norfolk community (of which around       100 are actively involved in the research at any time), have contributed       35,000 hours to the research programme.
Coming from a range of       backgrounds, from lawyers to builders, the volunteers form the bulk of the       excavation and finds processing team, undertaking an extensive regional       field survey project between autumn and spring.
The survey constitutes a       significant research initiative that could not be carried out without       community involvement and the relationship between the project and Norfolk       County Council (NCC).
The volunteers' work is explicitly acknowledged in       the outputs in section 3.
The impact of their involvement on volunteers ranges from the       emotional: `I found my very first (and only) Roman coin and I can still       recall the elation I felt at finding and holding in my hand something that       had last been in the hand of a Roman so many years ago', to the       professional and practical: `It has been very beneficial for me, in terms       of career development and improving my skill-set'.
Many participants also       highly value the social element of their involvement in the project (5.1).
Through the establishment of a charity (Caistor Roman Project Ltd (CRP))       in 2009, of which Bowden is a Trustee, a sustainable future for the         volunteer group is being secured.
The charity has already supported       volunteers in using their new skills and experience to undertake further       community activity including running events for the Young Archaeologists       Club, using the Caistor project's methodologies to develop their own       community research projects and advising other community groups on setting       up archaeological research projects (5.1).
The project's value to the       Sustainable Community Strategy 2008-18 of the South Norfolk Alliance       (local Strategic Partnership for South Norfolk comprising statutory,       voluntary, community and business organisations) was recognised in the       Alliance's funding of the volunteer programme and public outreach       programme for 2010-2011.
Adding to the public understanding of history and the environment       In addition to the new knowledge and skills developed by volunteers       participating in the project, there has also been a focus on sharing the       research results with a wider public through broadcast and social media       and public talks and thus contributing to a wider public understanding         both of archaeology and of Roman history: The project was the focus       of a Channel 4 Time Team special in 2011 which received 2,321,000       viewers on its first showing and has been regularly repeated since.
It       also formed a major component in an episode of BBC's The Flying         Archaeologist, viewed by 723,000 on its first showing (06.05.12)       (with 43,000 i-player viewings in the following week).
The project       maintains a strong media profile, featuring on BBC Radio 4, BBC Look East,       ITV Anglia, Radio Norfolk, Radio Nottingham, and in the Eastern Daily         Press and other local print media within the assessment period.
Reporting by livescience.com of the findings published in Bowden 2011 was       picked up by multiple internet newsfeeds including discovery.com, msn.com,       dailymail.co.uk and the Huffington Post and was subsequently reposted in       multiple internet fora, including three audience-generated Youtube videos,       demonstrating sustained public engagement with the research (5.2).
The excavations were open to the public 7 days a week, resulting in       15,000 visitors over 12 weeks in 2009- 2012.
Visitors were provided with a       site guide and an exhibition (sponsored by the Foyle Foundation) while       excavations are explained by project volunteers.
Activities were also run       for visiting school parties together with workshops for volunteers in       ceramic studies and faunal remains (run by post-graduates from the Dept.
of Archaeology).
In 2011 two activity days were run in conjunction with       the BBC's Hands-on History project and these were repeated in       2012.
The success of these events encouraged South Norfolk Council to       revive its own Caistor Family Day in 2013.
Bowden has done c. 35       lectures to the public/local societies (ranging from BBC Hands-on History       events to the Algarve Archaeological Society) reaching an estimated 2200       people (5.3).
A YouTube video about the project has been viewed over       72,000 times (63 likes and 52 comments) (5.2).
The scale of this media and public engagement with the research project       represents a significant contribution to enhanced cultural         understanding of archaeology and its methods, and of (Roman) history.
Informing and influencing heritage management strategies       The Norfolk Archaeological Trust's Ten-Year Site Management Plan (2013-23)       for Caistor noted that "the project's research has transformed our       understanding of Venta Icenorum and its suburbs, both for the       Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods" (5.4).
This changed understanding and the       associated media and public engagement have been significant drivers in       the project's partner organisations' subsequent development of revised       management strategies towards the site, which are in turn factors in the improved         management and conservation of cultural heritage.
The Norfolk       Archaeological Trust (site owners), Norfolk County Council's Historic       Environment Service (HES), South Norfolk Council (who manage public access       to the site), Norfolk Museums Service and English Heritage have all used       the results of the project in the development of management strategies       towards the Roman town.
Examples include:            The NAT Ten-Year Site Management Plan for Caistor (2013-23) in which         the project results will form the basis for an entirely new         interpretation scheme for the Roman town.
In 2013-14 this will include         new interpretation panels (funded by Natural England) and a new         guidebook (funded by the Trust) (5.4).
The research contributed to English Heritage's decision to         significantly extend the area protected as part of the Scheduled         Monument (5.5).
Norfolk HES uses the results of the project to inform management         strategies towards the site and its surrounding landscape (5.6).
Project results have informed new content for tourists, thereby enriching         the tourist experience: a revised display relating to the site at       Norwich Castle Museum has been visited by up to 180,000 people per annum       since 2009, while Project volunteers have carried out extensive work on       early archives relating to the site held by the Museum, resulting in this       archive material being put on display to the public for the first time.
The research also informed a mobile-phone tour of the site trialled by       South Norfolk Council in 2008-10.
The increased public profile of the site       resulting from the project has also resulted in greater visitor         numbers and greater use of one of the most significant green spaces       in South Norfolk Council's portfolio (5.7 &amp; 5.8).
The increased uptake       of heritage resources by tourists described here has tangible economic         and prestige benefits to the sites, and also serves to further the       public engagement mission of the Caistor project by extending its reach.
Contributing to the wider preservation of cultural heritage       The project's public engagement activity has helped partner         organisations to secure further funding, thereby contributing to the       wider preservation of public cultural heritage: The project was       specifically referenced by the Norfolk Archaeological Trust in its       successful 2011 application to the National Heritage Memorial Fund for       emergency funds (c. &#163;380,000) to purchase an additional 60 acres of the       archaeological site (5.9).
The application cited the public benefit       evidenced by volunteer involvement with the Caistor project, visitor       numbers to the excavations and the transformation in understanding of the       site through the research.
Similarly, the research and outreach value of       the project were also cited by Norfolk's HES service in support of a       successful bid to English Heritage to extend the National Mapping       Programme (digitising all crop-mark data for the region) (5.10).
