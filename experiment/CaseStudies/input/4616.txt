     Implementation in the UK of SIDS risk reduction programmes based on UoB       research findings was followed by a 67% fall in SIDS rates by 1992; the       number of SIDS deaths in England and Wales fell from 1597 in 1988 (2.3       deaths per 1000 live births) to 531 in 1992 (0.77 per 1000 live births).
As the Figure below shows, the number of deaths fell by a further 54% to       244 by 2011 (0.34 per 1000 live births), the last year for which national       data is available.
Publication dates (number of studies): &#8216;CESDI&#8217; study - 1995(1), 1996(2), 1999(3), 2000(3), 2001(1), 2002(2), 2003(2), 2004(2), 2006(3) and 2007(1).
&#8216;SWISS&#8217; study - 2009(1) and 2010(1).
This further fall was not due to any change in prone positioning in       England but concomitant with changes in other identified risk factors (see       Table in Section 2).
If death rates had remained the same as 1992 over 10,000 infants would       have died in England and Wales between 1993 and 2011 rather than the 6434       SIDS deaths that did occur.
Over 2,100 would have died from 2008 to 2011       rather than the 1075 deaths that did occur.
The persistent year on year       fall in SIDS rates over the last two decades has been instrumental in the       halving of the post-neonatal infant mortality rate in England and Wales       over the same time period (from 2.2 deaths to 1.2 deaths per 1000 live       births).
At every stage of this process the UoB researchers have been closely       involved: generating the findings; developing the risk-reduction messages;       changing statutory law in 2008 on how child deaths are investigated (see       below); and collaborating with national and international organisations to       ensure families are given accurate information to care for their infants       in ways that lead to the lowest possible risk of SIDS.
In the last 5 years       they have been particularly involved in the translational work of getting       their evidence-based findings implemented into public health policy.
In UK [a] and Australian [b] parent information leaflets, every       recommendation to reduce the risk of SIDS is based partly or fully on the       results of the UoB studies.
Collaborative work with other groups in       Germany, New Zealand, and Scandinavia has led to the development of       standardised protocols for data collection in the investigation of       unexpected infant deaths, which in turn have allowed more rapid       identification and evaluation of significant changes in parenting       practices and their effects.
UoB studies on infant thermal balance have produced charts of optimal       thermal conditions adopted by both manufacturers and parents in many       countries, and sequential studies show a clear reduction in covering       (infant clothes and bedding combined) from an average of 8 tog (unit of       thermal resistance) 20 years ago to just 2.4 tog more recently.
[4 &#8212; page       8]     Fleming and Blair recognise that findings from their studies need to fit       with current evidence of infant care practices outside the field of SIDS       so that consistent public health messages can be given to parents and       health professionals.
They have worked closely in the last five years with       UNICEF UK [c, d], who are currently promoting breastfeeding in Baby       Friendly Hospitals, to produce a leaflet `Caring for your baby at night'       which encourages breastfeeding, acknowledges some parents may want to       bed-share but outlines the circumstances in which bed-sharing may be       unsafe.
An evidence-based guideline for health professionals [e, f]       accompanies the leaflet (lead author Blair).
The leaflets and guidelines,       printed in January 2012, have proved popular &#8212; over 210,000 have so far       been distributed, mainly to NHS hospitals, trusts and health visiting       teams.
Blair is a regular invited speaker at health care professional       conferences and seminars (see a selection of UK and International lectures       since 2008 [g, h, i]) to promote the UoB-based findings.
The UoB approach to the investigation of unexpected infant deaths and the       care of families was adopted by the Kennedy Committee which was set up by       the Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Paediatrics and       Child Health to improve the quality of such investigations after a series       of miscarriages of justice in 2003, and was subsequently incorporated into       the Children Act 2004, becoming a statutory requirement throughout England       from 2008.
This process of child death reviews (in which Fleming was       centrally involved) has led to a major change in the way medico-legal       agencies involved in providing services to children interact, with a       resultant improvement in the quality of such investigations and services       to bereaved families.
[j, k]     Fleming was elected as Vice Chair of the International Society for the       Study and prevention of Perinatal and Infant Deaths (ISPID) in 2008,       succeeded in that role in 2010 by Blair.
The Society is instrumental in       the delivery of SIDS public health campaigns in different countries.
Both       have been involved in developing risk reduction messages on the ISPID       website (http://www.ispid.org/) which       receives around 300 visits a day.
Blair currently helps co-ordinate the       website activities and chairs the epidemiology group working towards       consensus positional statements on safe infant care practices.
Both       researchers have worked extensively on the development of internationally       agreed policies for parent education and support, and on advice about       parenting practices, which have been adopted in many countries.
In 2006 Fleming was included in the "Eureka UK" publication celebrating       the 100 most important research achievements of British Universities.
In       2009 Blair was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by UNICEF for work in the       SIDS field and in 2012 both Fleming and Blair were awarded the UoB       Vice-Chancellor Impact award for their translational research in this       field.
This work has also been instrumental in the UoB receiving the       Queen's anniversary prize for Higher and Further Education in the field of       Obstetrics and Neonatal practice in 2012-14.
