     There have been two important pathways to impact for this research.
1.
The provision of social impact inputs to an economic           cost-benefit model for migration in the formulation of an immigration           policy framework [see Section 5, C1]:     Ministerial advice changed from a claim that the measured social impacts       were broadly negative to agreement that, for cost-benefit analysis       purposes, these were zero.
Findings were presented to Home Office ministers and MAC officials       (23/9/2011), with the MAC Secretariat praising the report: `We are         very pleased with the content of your report and the contribution that         it makes to the literature in this area... [I]t will be useful         for the MAC and policymakers to be able to draw on [your] discussion         of this issue and the distinctions that you make in future' [C1.3].
The report [C1.2] was subsequently published on the Home Office website       (1/2012), forming part of a widely cited and highly regarded set of       evidence-driven academic reports from MAC to policymakers.
The report led       to an important shift in the policy recommendations submitted to       ministers, switching from an emphasis on negative social impacts to an       emphasis on the limited impact of migration on social cohesion, and a call       for greater focus on economic deprivation [C1.1].
2.
Impact through opinion-formers in think tanks, commentators,           experts and journalists:     These users have digested the findings and conclusions leading to       better-informed public policy.
This latter path has been widely punctuated       by use of the research by third parties [C2].
The MAC study has enabled the team and individual team members to       continue to influence senior policy-makers and thought leaders in regard       to the shape of immigration and integration policy reform.
Examples       include:            Involvement of two team members (Saggar and Somerville) in the         Advisory Group for the IPPR's Progressive Migration Project (launched         July 2013) [C2.1].
Key outcome: key pillar of IPPR's final report, `Fair         and democratic migration policy: A principled framework for the UK'         (January 2013).
Presentation of a joint paper (Saggar and Somerville) on `The UK model         of integration' to the Transatlantic Council on Migration (November         2011) [C2.2].
Key outcome: elite buy-in of policy-makers and opinion         formers to the model identified in the MAC study.
Involvement of one team member (Saggar, as a Demos Research Fellow) in         the Demos Integration Index project (launched June 2013) [C2.4], and as         a member of the Advisory Group of the IPPR project on Everyday         Integration (begun September 2013) [C2.1].
Key outcome: underpinning the         intellectual and practitioner rationales for both highly visible         projects and influencing elite opinion formers concerned with migration         and integration policy.
Involvement of one team member (Saggar, as a British Future Trustee)         in the Integration strand of work of British Future [C2.5].
Key outcome:         underpinning the integration strategy and supporting strand of project         and campaign work of BF.
Presentation of key findings to a COMPAS Breakfast Briefing event &#8212; including key UKBA officials and NGO representatives (March 2011).
Key         outcome: agreement that the study demonstrated the key, replicable         elements of a robust empirical analysis of social impacts [C2.6].
Involvement of one team member (Saggar) as Chair of the ESRC         Understanding Society Ethnicity Advisory Committee (May 2013 onwards).
Key outcome: influencing the locus of the new ethnic minority boost of         the US study.
Involvement of one team member (Saggar) as a member of the BSA         Immigration Attitudes Advisory Board (May 2011 onwards).
