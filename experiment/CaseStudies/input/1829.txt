     The research has raised awareness about, and sensitized policymakers,       journalists, researchers, activists and civil society organisations to,       the circumstances of the older urban poor, leading to changes in state       policy on pensions in Tamil Nadu, and to more effective campaigns for       older people's pensions, livelihoods and rights within India and       internationally.
By demonstrating how social discrimination impinges on       older people's livelihoods, rights and well-being the research highlighted       the need for a major shift in programmes addressing old age poverty.
Specifically, as a consequence of the widespread dissemination of the       findings of the research: 1) pensions in Tamil Nadu were increased by 25       per cent in 2010 and 100 per cent in 2011; 2) a new campaign network, the       Pension Parishad (PP), was set up and pensions rights became a key issue       in Indian national politics in 2012; 3) HelpAge International developed a       new livelihood security agenda between 2010 and 2012.
From the beginning, the research was embedded in partnerships with       research users, including HelpAge International (HAI) and HelpAge India       and, from 2010, with the Right to Food and Work Campaign (RTF), an       influential national coalition of food security activists and campaign       groups.
HAI, HelpAge India and PP provided additional funding in cash and       kind for the research projects.
Vera-Sanso, together with the project       partners, disseminated evidence as it emerged to policymakers and in       public forums, which steadily expanded interest in, and recognition of,       the issues highlighted.
The research challenged common assumptions and       proposed alternative approaches to policy development which stimulated       debate among opinion-formers, activists and journalists, catalysing new       policy initiatives.
During the project Vera-Sanso, the research team and project partners       organised a series of events and participated in public hearings, policy       briefings, campaign conferences and rallies in India.
These included a       two-day international conference in Chennai in 2010, a photographic       exhibition/ essay, `We too contribute!
', and a series of public       meetings in Chennai (November 2009 &#8212; March 2010) involving eminent public       figures (including the Member Secretary of the Chennai Metropolitan       Development Authority and the Supreme Court-appointed National       Commissioner on Food Security: sources 1, 2, 3).
Vera-Sanso also       presented the research findings to conferences between 2010 and 2013       attended by NGOs, policy advisers and academics in Chennai, London,       Dublin, Paris, Barcelona, and Maastricht.
The photographic       exhibition/essay has toured widely in Tamil Nadu (2009-13), Delhi (March       2013) (sources 1, 2) and internationally (London, 2010, and Dublin,       2012).
At the project's international conference in Chennai, The Hidden         Contribution of Older People: Rethinking Age, Poverty, Opportunity and         Livelihoods (19-20 March 2010), the research findings and the       photographic exhibition were presented to academics, campaigners and       policymakers (sources 1, 2, 3).
The research team were subsequently       invited to the Fourth National Convention of the Right to Food and Work       Campaign (Rourkela, Orissa, India 6-8/08/2010) where &#8212; after hearing the       research findings &#8212; 2,000 representatives from across India passed a       unanimous resolution demanding a universal, index-linked, up-lifted social       pension (sources 2, 6).
The team drafted two policy notes &#8212; one       presented to the government of the State of Tamil Nadu and parties       contesting the 2011 state elections (2010) and one for the National       Advisory Committee, Government of India, Prime Minister's Office (2011) (sources         1, 7).
All project events were widely reported in the Tamil and English language       press, on television news and in digital media, and the team was highly       effective in getting newspapers such as The Hindu and the New         Indian Express to publish stories that presented older people as       workers, contributors and rights holders (source 8).
By raising awareness among the public and policy makers the research led       to a significant shift in thinking about older people in Tamil Nadu and,       more broadly, in India.
As an ESRC research user evaluator wrote: `This         study has had impact at a number of levels.
In Chennai and Tamil Nadu it         has directly contributed to both enhanced understanding of and action to         support economic security for older people.
The study and related         dissemination have played a key role in the campaign for a universal         basic pension in Tamil Nadu state' (source 4).
This was also       evidenced when the India-wide campaign network Pension Parishad (PP) was       established in August 2011 by members of the Steering Group of the RTF       2010 Convention (mentioned above), including the influential social       activists Aruna Roy and Kavita Srivastava, HelpAge India and others, to       campaign for a universal, index-linked, uplifted social pension (source         1, 2).
The research led to a number of policy changes.
During the 2011 election       in Tamil Nadu, an enhanced pension became a key electoral promise across       the main parties, and in April 2011 the Tamil Nadu government raised the       social pension (for people aged 65 and over, widows and disabled people)       from Rs500 per month to Rs1000 per month, benefiting over 2.3 million       pensioners (sources 1, 7).
More widely, in India, for the first       time, the idea that older people have a right to a universal index-linked       non-contributory old age pension gained acceptance among influential       activists and MPs as a consequence of the PP's campaigning.
The PP       continues to campaign for a significantly increased, universal pension       using the `We too contribute!'
exhibition during its five day rally       in Delhi 4-8 March 2013 to raise awareness about the position of older       people in the Indian economy and society (source 2).
In March 2013,       the PP won acceptance from Central Government of the principal of index       linked universal pensions and proposed a 50% increase in the pension to be       put in place in two years' time (sources 1, 2, 8); however this       falls below the PP's demands and their campaign continues.
That the research outcomes continue to capture attention and influence       thinking in India is evidenced by the agreement of The Hindu, one       of India's most widely read English language newspapers, to support The         Hindu National Photographic Competition on the Working Elderly,       launched in June 2013.
By 31 July 2013, The Hindu had created an       online gallery of nearly 3,000 photographs taken across India, attracting       34,000 votes and judged by Aruna Roy of the Pension Parishad (source 9).
Finally, the research influenced international perspectives on ageing,       leading HelpAge International, the most significant international NGO       working on ageing and development, to undertake a major review of its       global work on livelihoods and to establish a new livelihood/income       security agenda (source 3).
The organisation invited her to join       its team to present her research to the Human Development Report Office of       the UNDP, New York (February 2011) and to discuss her work with UK       parliamentarians at an informal event on the Post-Millennium Development       Goals agenda hosted by their sister organisation Age International in       December 2012 (source 3).
As an ESRC research user evaluation       states: `At a global level the study has provided important evidence in         dialogues with a number of UN entities.
In particular I am aware of its         role in discussions with UNDP on their inclusion of an ageing theme in         future HDRs' (source 4).
To sum up, in the words of the Supreme Court-appointed Special       Commissioner on Food Security, Member of the National Advisory Council       (Government of India, Prime Minister's Office) (2010-12), and Member of       the National Social Assistance Committee on Pensions Task Force (2012-13),       the research of Vera-Sanso and colleagues sparked `a paradigm shift         regarding old age poverty' in India, igniting `an acknowledgement         of the economic contribution made by older people to the Indian economy         and an acceptance that enforced dependence on family, or on body and         soul destroying work, corrodes dignity and wellbeing' (source 1).
