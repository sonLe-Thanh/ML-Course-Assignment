     Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological disease       of young adults in the UK, affecting 1 in 800 of the population.
It is       associated with high health care and socioeconomic costs and a markedly       reduced quality of life.
The first available disease-modifying treatments       &#8212; beta interferon and glatiramer acetate &#8212; were introduced in the 1990s       but proved to have only limited effectiveness in preventing relapses and       with only equivocal effects on related disability, and there remained a       pressing need for more effective treatments.
Furthermore, a NICE       technology appraisal in 2002 found that these first-line treatments were       not cost effective for use in the NHS and since then they have only been       available to treat MS patients through a unique Department of Health Risk       Sharing Scheme that was designed to ensure, through long term monitoring       over ten years of a large patients cohort (2002-15), that cost       effectiveness is achieved.
Following the pivotal phase 3 trial of natalizumab described       above, a full UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence       (NICE) technology appraisal of natalizumab was undertaken in 2007.
The       outcome was that natalizumab became the first NICE-recommended       disease-modifying treatment for MS available in the UK National Health       Service.
The drug was also approved by regulatory authorities for the       treatment of active relapsing remitting MS in many countries around the       world (see full details below).
Key impacts: benefits for MS patients     The following major clinical benefits of natalizumab for people with MS       were identified in the phase 3 trial [see 5, above]:            Relapse rate was reduced by two thirds in natalizumab-treated compared         to placebo-treated patients; in a subgroup of patients with highly         active relapsing remitting MS (who had had at least two relapses in the         prior 12 months), the reduction in relapse rate achieved by natalizumab         was 81%; furthermore, natalizumab reduced the rate of hospitalisations         by 64% and the need of steroid treatment for relapses by 69% [a].
50% fewer people treated with natalizumab developed a persistent         increase in disability when compared with those treated with placebo.
This reduction in disability accrual was even higher at 64% in the         subgroup with highly active disease.
Natalizumab is the first treatment         for MS to show a large and unequivocal effect in preventing irreversible         disability.
A substantial number of natalizumab-treated patients         actually experienced a reduction in their level of disability when         compared with their status before entering the trial.
Clinically significant visual loss during the trial was reduced by 35%         in natalizumab-treated patients compared to placebo, and overall visual         function remained stable in natalizumab-treated patients whereas it         deteriorated in placebo-treated subjects [b]        Health-related quality of life, which is often substantially impaired         in people with MS, was significantly improved in patients treated with         natalizumab [c].
The improvements were seen in both physical and         mental components of quality of life measures.
Natalizumab also reduced the risk of a confirmed worsening of         cognitive function by 43% compared with placebo [a].
Licensing and prescription of natalizumab     Following the phase 3 clinical trials, natalizumab (trade name Tysabri)       was granted regulatory approval in the United States (FDA, 2006) [d],       European Union (EMEA, 2006) [e], Canada [f] and Australia       [g].
It was recommended in 2007 by the UK National Institute for       Health and Clinical Excellence as a clinically and cost effective       treatment in the NHS for patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing       remitting MS [h].
The Medical Director (UK) at Biogen (the       manufacturers of natalizumab) has confirmed that there is "No doubt         that the input from Dr Miller's research collaboration was an important         contribution to the regulatory license application for Marketing         approval by the relevant regulatory authorities" [i].
As a result of these approvals, natalizumab is now widely used to treat       patients with highly active relapsing remitting MS. By December 2011, over       99,000 people worldwide had been treated with natalizumab [j].
Since that time, usage has continued to grow, with Biogen reporting sales       of $1.6bn (an increase of 8%) for 2012 [k].
By July 2013, over       115,000 patients had been treated [l].
As well as the direct financial benefits to Biogen in terms of sales, the       licensing of natalizumab has resulted in increased employment and economic       benefits in the US and Europe [m].
Contribution to guidelines     Due to the rare complication of PML, natalizumab is largely used as a       second-line treatment in highly active MS.
Guidelines have been developed       for treatment and monitoring of people who are treated with natalizumab       and Yousry and Miller have contributed to these guidelines [n].
A       key part of clinical monitoring of patients treated with natalizumab is to       perform regular MRI scans looking for evidence of PML.
Yousry has headed       an international panel that has identified the radiological features       typical of PML in natalizumab-treated patients; the panel has also       recommended MRI protocols for monitoring patients [o].
