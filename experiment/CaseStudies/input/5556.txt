     Context       Very much a public intellectual and respected figure of the British Left,       Professor Newsinger's       research has been disseminated through books, articles, reviews, lectures       and debates.
Often       controversial, his work has been influential in shaping modern political       culture by contributing to an       assertive, Leftist critique of modern British and American history,       especially in light of recent       political and military events, including the `War on Terror'.
Newsinger has, throughout his career, been committed to asking incisive,       often uncomfortable,       questions of established power structures &#8212; state, military, and       commercial &#8212; in order to explore       intellectual currents and expose the machinations of power.
His research       serves to enhance public       understanding and provide intellectual underpinning and analysis, which       improves the quality of       evidence, argument and expression regarding major issues.
His impact       extends beyond academe       through:            inclusion in the popular Leftist press (domestic and international);       an active programme of public speaking engagements which take on major         national and         international issues and contribute to public discourse and civil         society.
These range from         lectures at such local institutions as the Bath Royal Literary and         Scientific Institution (2002,         2004, 2008) (attendance 50-100 ea.
), through talks to such special         interest groups as the         London Socialist Historians Group         (http://londonsocialisthistorians.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/reminder-upcoming-events-at-bookmarks.html)         (2012), to lectures to an international public, alongside with leading         figures of         the global Left, such as Noam Chomsky;       via crossover into policy and defence/strategy thinking, international         secondary and HE         education, and the creative industries.
As an academic, Newsinger's work inspires visceral responses.
Denigrated       in The Independent by       John Rentoul for espousing `feeble-minded punk Marxism' (2/10/12), he is       simultaneously praised       in English Historical Review for `vigorous left-wing restatement       of the inequities of empire ... in the       tradition of George Orwell and V.G.
Kiernan'       [http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/CXXII/499/1350.short       (23/11/12)].
Impact on the public discourse on global politics     While these are difficult to quantify, Newsinger's engagement with       audiences beyond academe is       extensive, particularly through his public engagements and through       on-going contributions to the       Leftist political press (book reviews, think-pieces and articles).
It is a       testimony to his reach and       significance that his works are quoted by, and used to support the claims       of, such leading       journalists of the mainstream British Left as George Monbiot and feature       in considerations of       global politics, such as `Captive Nation &#8212; Egypt and the West', MediaLens       (09/02/2011) and blogs       such as `Orwell, Power and the "Totalitarian" State': YDS: The Clare Spark       Blog (15/10/2012)       [http://clarespark.com/2012/10/],       and Rania Masri's Green Resistance (teaching, organizing and       eco-thinking) [http://greenresistance.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/crimes-of-the-british-empire-the-blood-never-dried/]       (18/04/2012).
Newsinger's reach and significance is also evidenced by his contributions       to public debate.
He       appeared at a crowded Oxford Union debate on colonial reparations       alongside Professor the Lord       Parekh and Toyin Agbetu against a panel consisting of Count Nikolai       Tolstoy, Dr Tiffany Jenkins       and Philip van der Elst (audience c.400, 26/11/2009).
The debate was       widely advertised, including       on Nyansapo, an online community radio station hosted by the Ligali       Organisation:       http://www.ligali.org/newsletter/nyansapo_17nov09.htm.
This debate was followed by a panel       discussion with former Guardian journalist, Richard Gott, and Dr Tom       Lawson at the Institute of       Commonwealth Studies workshop on `Imperialism, Empire and Genocide'       (04/03/2011) and,       internationally, by an invitation to speak alongside Noam Chomsky at a       public colloquium,       `Rationalit&#233;, v&#233;rit&#233; et d&#233;mocratie : Bertrand Russell, George Orwell, Noam       Chomsky', at Coll&#232;ge       De France, Paris (audience c.200, 28/05/2010; online at: http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/jacques-bouveresse/colloques.htm#|p=../jacques-bouveresse/colloques.htm.
It is a       mark of the breadth of Newsinger's reach and the various audiences which       find his work       significant that he was asked to address the Socialist Workers' Party       event, Marxism 2012 (05-09/07/2012; 	  online at:       http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lldIsjKWLv0&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlldIsjKWLv0&amp;gl=GB) 	  and, in 2013, to deliver the closing plenary on British       Counterinsurgency, Kenya and the Mau-Mau 	  at the Journ&#233;e d'&#233;tudes, Universit&#233; des Sciences Humaine et Sociales &#8212; Lille 	  3 (25/01/2013, attendance c.50).
Inter-disciplinary impact on defence studies       Newsinger also has crossover impact in other disciplines, particularly       through his work on       counterinsurgency, which extends his reach into the realm of professional       military education and       strategic and defence studies in both the UK and the USA.
As a result, he       was invited to speak at       Sandhurst and to 3 Commando Brigade at the Brigade Study Week (12/05/08),       as part of the       preparation of 8,000 servicemen and women for deployment to Afghanistan.
While he was unable       to take up this invitation due to personal circumstances, his work       features in Royal Military       Academy, Sandhurst's Bibliography on Counterinsurgency (2010), and is       referred to frequently in       such journals as Small Wars and Insurgencies (1992,1995, 2006),       the Journal of Strategic Studies       (2009), the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Journal (2007),       Defence &amp; Security Analysis       (2009), the RAF Air Power Review (2010), and the Defence Academy       of the United Kingdom       Defence Academy Yearbook 2011.
It is also cited in Jochen Hippler,       Counterinsurgency and         Political Control: US Military Strategies regarding Regional Conflict       (INEF Report 81/2006).
It is a       mark of the breadth of his reach and significance that his work on       counterinsurgency is referred to       by postgraduate US naval and air officers training at the Naval       Postgraduate School in Monterey       California and at Air Command and Staff College, Maxwell Air Force Base,       Alabama.
Impact on teaching curriculum       The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire has       had impact both in and       outside of academe.
Praised by Vinay Lal (UCLA) in The Times of India       (15-01-07) for       `unimpeachable politics, wide canvas, and quest for justice', it features       as a set text for Grade 12       students at the International School of Tianjin, China, on the       undergraduate syllabus for       `Comparative Colonialisms' taught at the Department of History at Jadavpur       University, India, and       as one of four core textbooks for `The Worlds of the British Empire,       1700-1960' on the King's       College London Preliminary Reading List for First Year's, 2011-12:       http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/history/study/ug/prelim.pdf.
Cultural and economic impact through theatrical interpretation       While it informed Ed Hill's       eye-witness documentary, `Return to Palestine' (2006), The Blood Never         Dried: A People's History         of the British Empire's most quantifiable cultural impact was on       Anna Chen's play, The Steampunk         Opium Wars, which featured a cast of ten plus two musicians.
Chen       reflected: `I already shared his       [Newsinger's] perspective on the imperialist morally bankrupt nature of       the Opium Wars and [The         Blood Never Dried] filled many gaps.
The most useful ... were the       eye-witness accounts of the       devastation which I incorporated into speeches for the character, Captain       Ironside.'
The play was       performed at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich (16/02/2012) to an       audience c.300, as       well as being live-streamed.
It was followed immediately by a Farrago       Poetry Slam with c.10       participants reading poems inspired by the play's themes.
The video of the       winning poem is       available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcaoDcfJc8A.
The play was performed again at       the St Ives Arts Club for the St Ives Arts Festival in September 2012 to a       capacity audience of       60+.
