     The "time triggered" approach to building embedded systems is a new       paradigm enabling the       development of a new class of high reliability embedded systems where       guarantees of meeting       timing deadlines are crucial from a safety perspective and therefore in       many cases certification.
The benefits of the research are a large collection of design patterns and       engineering knowledge       demonstrating how such systems can be constructed, and a set of software       tools supporting the       construction and development of deterministic hardware and processors       supporting the       requirements of these systems.
Impact is on the way safety and reliability       of embedded systems is       considered in automotive and avionic sectors.
The above research was primarily exploited through the formation of TTE       Systems Ltd (a spin-out       company from the University of Leicester) using two commercial activities:       the "TT" product family,       and training courses.
Since it began trading in 2007, TTE Systems       attracted total investment in       excess of &#163;1m with an annual turnover of approximately &#163;0.8m.
On average       in that period, there       were 10 technical and training staff working with a number of customers in       the UK, Europe, US,       and Asia.
From 2008-2013, professional training courses attracted approximately 100       current industrial       practitioner customers from UK/Europe, and a similar number in South East       Asia.
Significant       customers for these activities include Rolls Royce, Aero Engine Controls,       Smith Electric Vehicles,       [text removed for publication] Mira, [text removed for publication].
The       training activities are       currently being supported by UoL as an ongoing activity.
Smith Electric Vehicles (SEV):     SEV manufacture and market zero-emission commercial electric vehicles       that are designed to be a       superior performing alternative to traditional diesel trucks due to higher       efficiency and lower total       cost of ownership.
They have research and development centres in the UK       and USA.
SEV have       exploited the technology in embedded applications for battery systems.
The       use of time-triggered       methodologies and tools has increased speed to market and lowered       development costs.
"Using the skills learnt on the Reliable Embedded Systems course we         have been able to design         and write embedded applications for our new battery system.
These         applications were written         using time triggered methodology allowing us to increase our speed to         market, lower our cost of         development and enhance our team skills base.
These advantages have had         a small but         demonstrable impact on our new battery system, leading to a $10,000 cost         saving on the parts list         (BOM) for one of our electric vehicles.
", Ross Cooney,       Engineering Software &amp; Telemetry       Manager, Smith Electric Vehicles (A).
It should be noted that this       is a $10,000 cost saving on       each vehicle at a time when there is a major focus on reducing the cost of       electric vehicle.
Aero Engine Controls (AEC):     AEC are part of the international Rolls-Royce Group, with research,       development and production       centres in the UK, USA, UAE, and Singapore.
They provide a single solution       to the design,       manufacture, procurement, testing and support of high-integrity, harsh       environment control       systems, including safety critical software, electronic, electrical and       hydro-mechanical products.
"The technology has been directly applied to in-house testing tools         for the generation of test cases,         SCADE model simulator, and AdaTest code generation.
This has a direct         technical, certification,       and cost benefit as it enables the same use of procedures to test         design and executable code for         compliance with DO178B industry regulator standards."
Duncan Brown,       Chief of Systems       Capability, Aero Engine Controls (B).
"Since 2010, AEC have invested a total of &#163;1m in development and         training in high reliability and         time triggered architectures via TTE Systems resulting in the creation         of more than 14 full-time         engineer positions in this area with more to follow in 2014.
This         represents approximately 5% of         the total AEC capability in the Embedded Systems area.
This has         significantly accelerated         capability development within AEC in the embedded systems area."
Duncan Brown, Chief of       Systems Capability, Aero Engine Controls (B).
MIRA:     MIRA is a UK-based international independent vehicle engineering       consultancy providing       engineering innovations and testing/certification solutions in the field       of vehicle and systems       technology.
MIRA offer services ranging across commercial vehicles,       defence, UAV, intelligent       transport systems, aerospace, rail, and motorsport.
"The principles of Time Triggered Embedded Systems design have been         used in several         developments of bespoke embedded systems and have enabled dependable         systems to be         created in a shorter timescale than using traditional techniques.
The         basic platform developed         using such techniques has been reused with minimal redesign in several         subsequent applications."

Other impacts:     Embedded Systems Demonstrator Laboratory (2007 - 2013).
The ESDL, funded       by the East       Midlands Development Agency opened in 2007.
The facility enabled       researchers, end users and       other interested groups including Midlands-based SME's to trial new       embedded time-triggered       technologies.
