     In Stranger Magic Warner reads the Arabian Nights as a       case study in the contact zones of history,       thus offering a path towards changing prevailing preconceptions about       Arabs, Islam, and the       history and civilisation of the Middle and the Near East.
Warner has used       her high public profile as       an intellectual to challenge such preconceptions through a variety of       channels, addressing non-specialist       audiences in many different countries.
She has also used her expertise in       world literature       of myth and fairy tales to act as an advisor on an innovative library       project run by New York       University Press.
The impact has been to raise public awareness of the       history of East-West       cultural links and thereby influence public opinion, to contribute       cultural capital in the UK and       elsewhere, and to guide the selection strategy of a major publishing       house.
Warner's research on relations between Western and Arab cultures has been       extensively       disseminated through her media appearances.
She has been interviewed on a       variety of national       and international TV and Radio programmes, including BBC radio, US, Irish,       and Australian radio       stations.
She has also been interviewed for magazines with a predominantly       Middle Eastern       readership.
These include a magazine in the United Arab Emirates       [corroborating source 1] and a       New York based Middle East arts and culture magazine [corroborating source       2].
Across these       platforms Warner has reached over 3.8 million people.

Warner has collaborated with a major publishing house to create the first       comprehensive library of       classic Arabic texts in modern, lucid translations, with the goal of       introducing Arabic literature to a       general audience of readers.
In October 2010 she was appointed to the       International Advisory       Board of the newly founded Library of Arabic Literature (LAL) to advise on       the LAL's selection for       translation, leading to a major new project to translate The Hundred         and One Nights.
Warner also       advises the LAL by editing its English translations.
Her contributions to       LAL have been       corroborated by its General Editor [source 12], who adds:     Marina has made a valuable contribution to the work of the LAL and the       success of the Library       is undoubtedly due in part to her advice.
For its part the LAL executive       board is delighted and       puts great stock in the nature of the endorsement that Marina Warner's       membership of the       Advisory Board lends the whole project.
