     Impacts on wildlife crime law enforcement       The successful and novel application of genetic markers in a forensic         context led to a Bangor University spin-out company in 2003 called       Wildlife DNA Services.
Its cofounders (Ogden and McEwing) went on to       establish the NGO TRACE Wildlife Forensics Network in 2007.
Through       expansion of the TRACE Network, and in association with Bangor University,       its Programme Director, Ogden, has applied the outcomes of the Bangor       research (3.1-3.3) in major international wildlife forensics initiatives       that have been instrumental in expanding this pioneering field and in improving         the effectiveness of the enforcement of wildlife crime law.
For       example, DNA-based sexing markers developed at Bangor (3.3) are being used       for identification of poached rhino carcasses in South Africa and are       incorporated in the Rhino DNA Index System (RhODIS): a database where,       since 2011, DNA profiles for all South African rhinos are being       accumulated.
In its first year, over 5000 rhinos had been profiled and       1900 test kits including the Bangor markers were distributed as part of       the programme to halt poaching.2 These markers are also       included in the Scottish database launched in April 2013, that aims to       include every rhino (artefact) at Britain's zoos and museums to counter       the growing criminal threat of these horns being stolen for the black       market through increased risk of detection and successful prosecution2.
Additionally, global organisations such as the Royal Society for the       Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Partnership for Action against       Wildlife crime (PAW) use the research in prosecutions against wildlife       crimes such as poaching and illegal trade1,10.
Bangor research       on birds of prey in particular (3.1) has been fundamental for the Animal       Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), in prosecutions         linked to the illegal capture and breeding of endangered birds and       investigations on the legitimacy of ownership of birds of prey in the UK.
Between 2009 and 2012, the work has led directly to two convictions (2009,       2010)10, and 220 samples have been analysed in so-called       compliance cases that did not proceed to court.
Of these, 61 were from two       interlinked cases but a total of 39 keepers had birds tested, with a         well-recognised deterrent effect on illegal trade.
The Bangor method       was chosen because of the quality of the markers, ease of use and       transparency and the DNA analyses were crucial in determining the       legitimacy of ownership of the birds.
The method (3.1) has further been       used to develop tests for golden eagle, peregrine falcon, merlin, goshawk,       barn owl, common buzzard and palm cockatoo: advances which further empower       restriction of the illegal bird trade1.
Impacts on IUU regulation and sustainable fisheries management       The traceability tools created by the FishPopTrace (FPT) research have directly         impacted international stock management of fisheries.
The Marine       Stewardship Council (MSC) uses the regional identifiers for Atlantic         cod (Gadus morhua) developed by FPT to provide assurance         that MSC-certified products are correctly labelled, and to identify       any areas of concern in the supply chain9.
In 2012, 86 products       were tested using the FPT identifiers, verifying correct labelling of 99%       of MSC-labelled cod.
Furthermore, the DNA testing program also helps to       deter MSC-certified companies from mislabelling products, which lowers         the likelihood of fraud in the supply chain.
The MSC will continue       to carry out an annual DNA testing program using the FPT markers and is       collaborating with TRACE (since 2011) to expand the range of tests.9       Further evidence for the importance of the Bangor work for MSC efforts on       sustainable fishing, comes from their recent (2013) appointment of       Carvalho as an independent advisor on DNA testing in relation to fisheries       certification.
Key mechanisms by which FPT has had constructive, political impact on         individual member states decision-making to apply novel technologies to         fisheries regulations are through the provision of data,       information, and dissemination of infrastructure directly resulting from       the FPT proceedings.
For example, in April 2012, the UK Government       launched a novel Defra-funded programme to implement the use of FPT       research outputs to improve fish traceability in UK stocks of four       economic priority fish species (Geographic traceability tools for       commercial fish and fish products - FA0118).
The programme transfers the       FPT novel forensic DNA marker systems directly to stocks relevant to       government, industry stakeholders and non-governmental organisations in       the UK, enabling self-regulation, monitoring and enforcement of the       fishing industry at a scale not previously possible.
Impacts on EU Council regulations through the FishPopTrace project       In line with its commitment to engage with policy, the FishPopTrace (FPT)       consortium translated its research and technological advances into policy       recommendations and accessible information to managers and stakeholders.
The consortium created a concise policy document which analyses the         current policy framework for traceability of fish and fish products to         their geographic origin, tackling fish piracy and consumer fraud       (available on the FPT website).
Specifically targeting policies and       legislation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) on the key CFP aim of       promoting sustainability through conservation of genetic resources, the       consortium further submitted two contributions to the public consultations       launched by the European Commission (EC) for the CFP Control Reform and       the CFP Reform.
These contributions have had a demonstrable direct         impact on the reform of the policy: the EU's decision to endorse the       use of advanced genetic and morphometric tools for fisheries management.
The project is specifically highlighted in the Impact Assessment report       that followed the consultation and underpinned the major proposal for       reform of the CFP control regime3-5.
The project's methodology       and findings are also cited throughout in the 2011 reference report of the       Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) on deterring       illegal activities in the fisheries sector6.
Impacts on policy debate and pathways to impact       Additional impact of Bangor research on EU fisheries policy comes from influencing         policy debate through FPT's highly valued participation in       international meetings and workshops on traceability and control in the       fisheries sector, organised by JRC, Food and Agriculture Organization       (FAO) and other global authorities on fisheries management.
Here, the       potential of advanced technologies and appropriate strategies for transfer       into more efficient fisheries control schemes was discussed directly with       relevant authorities on fisheries management at a political and industry       level7.
Because of the perceived importance of the project's       findings, EU and FAO policy makers subsequently attended FPT meetings,       adding further reach to the project findings7.
A         recommendation from the 2009 FishPopTrace consultation document [p.       6,13] that was taken up by the EC is exemplified by the JRC decision in       2009 to establish an Expert Group on new ways to comply with Data       Collection Regulation and integration of sustainability programmes       (kick-off meeting March 20128).
As a direct impact of the       expertise developed through FPT, the group has engaged two population       geneticists, including Carvalho, to work on developing new integrative         tools for data collection8.
