Background: Advances originating in Cardiff lead to biocompatible PD fluid development The novel discoveries and testing methods developed in Cardiff made key advances that drove and enabled new biocompatible solution development.
Test systems developed in Cardiff established that the combination of low pH and high lactate concentrations inhibited host defence and cell viability and established the cellular mechanisms responsible for the negative impact of high glucose concentrations.
This research led directly to the production of physiological pH PD solutions, e.g.
Physioneal&#174; (Baxter), Balance&#174; (Fresenius), and the use of lower lactate concentrations by replacement with bicarbonate in commercial solutions, e.g.
Physioneal&#174;, Bicavera&#174; (Fresenius).
Identification of the negative consequences of high glucose concentrations and osmolality led directly to the implementation of glucose sparing therapies using glucose polymer&#8212; and amino acid-based solutions such as Extraneal&#174; and Nutrineal&#174; (Baxter) [5.1] in which Cardiff also played a leading role in pre-clinical development.
Cardiff contributed to the establishment of glucose degradation product research that underpins new PD solution design (Physioneal&#174;, Balance&#174; and Trio&#174;).
This body of work was critical to establishing a new field of PD solutions research, and led directly to the iterative development of new products in which Cardiff played a direct role [5.2-5.4], for example "The critical contribution of Prof Nick Topley's research group at Cardiff University in the development phase of the PD solutions Physioneal 35 and 40" (Professor Peter Rutherford, Medical Director (Renal) &#8212; Europe, Middle East and Africa Baxter Healthcare SA [5.2]).
Williams, Coles and Topley acted as scientific advisors to Baxter and Fresenius (the leading PD solution manufacturers worldwide), guiding them in the composition of new solutions to reduce their detrimental effects and in the design of relevant clinical trials [3.5,3.6].
The biocompatibility and clinical trial data from Cardiff was used for the worldwide registration of Physioneal [5.2] and in all (including current) regulatory submissions for new PD solutions by Fresenius [5.3].
Professor Simon Davies, who runs the largest PD unit in the UK and is one of the foremost authorities on PD, dedicated in 2011 an international journal publication to the Cardiff's team contribution to PD research.
Amongst many testaments to Cardiff's leading transformational research in this area the article states: "The hallmark of the Cardiff contribution to our understanding of PD has been their translational approach to research, combining strong basic science with intelligent clinical questions...resulting in the development and testing of more biocompatible solutions.
More than any other group, they have held the torch for basic science in PD research.
These observations led to the conceptualization of biocompatibility as a local intraperitoneal process distinct from the systemic effects of PD...and became the gold standard approach to assessing the biocompatibility of newly developed PD solutions" [5.4].
Biocompatible PD fluids improve patient outcomes and quality of life Following early clinical trial work by Cardiff, independent studies from other centres have provided endorsement of the benefits of biocompatible fluids, and data continues to accrue in this area.
In 2012 a randomised study in Australia and New Zealand compared conventional and biocompatible PD therapy in patients for two years and observed a 40% reduction in peritonitis rates.
When infection did occur it was more likely to be classed as mild, and the length of stay in hospital was halved from 11 to 6 days [5.5,5.6].
In 2012, an observational study of 2163 patients in Korea noted a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality in patients using biocompatible solutions compared to a cohort using conventional fluids.
The absolute risk of death per year in this study was 5.93% in the group treated with biocompatible solutions and 8.86% in those treated with standard therapy, suggesting that one life may be saved per year for each 38 patients treated with biocompatible fluid [5.7].
Biocompatible fluids are recommended in clinical guidelines The growing recognition of the benefits of biocompatible PD solutions is highlighted by the 2011 publication of the European Paediatric Dialysis Working Group Guidelines [5.8].
The document, distributed to over 800 paediatric nephrologists worldwide, advises that biocompatible solutions with the lowest possible glucose concentration should be used in all childhood patients.
The guidelines also state that solutions formulated to reduce glucose degradation and with bicarbonate as a buffer should be used to reduce systemic toxicity.
Development of biocompatible fluids has had economic impact The peritoneal dialysis (PD) market was valued at $1.7 billion in 2008 and is expected to grow at 7% per annum to reach $2.9 billion in 2015 [5.9].
Biocompatible PD solutions are currently available worldwide for clinical use [5.2,5.3].
Marketing authorisations have been granted in territories including Europe, North America and Australasia and are currently being sought in many other countries.
The Cardiff research and clinical trials provided key data for the worldwide registration and marketing authorisation for new biocompatible PD fluids [5.2,5.3] with the prescribing of biocompatible PD fluids increasing year on year.
In 2010, across 17 European countries 60% of all Baxter's PD fluids prescribed were biocompatible products, translating to 38.5 million litres of Physioneal realising product sales of over &#163;100 million.
In certain European countries, including Sweden, Finland, Norway and Spain, biocompatible products have completely replaced standard glucose PD solutions and conventional fluids have been withdrawn [5.2].
Biocompatible fluids reduce healthcare costs The use of biocompatible PD solutions generates significant healthcare cost savings.
According to Kidney Health Australia, the average in-patient cost of treating PD-related peritonitis is ~AU$16-22K (~&#163;10-15K) for an average 11.5 day admission.
The Johnson studies [5.5,5.6] show that the use of biocompatible fluids halved the length of stay in hospitals to 6 days.
With a rate of peritonitis hospitalisation at 1 per 24 patient-months of therapy cost savings of $50-75 million p.a.
worldwide are possible if ~60% of patients were treated with biocompatible fluids.
In the UK, NICE estimates the costs associated with treating peritonitis exceed &#163;100 million p.a.
A 40% reduction in peritonitis rates from the use of biocompatible solutions [5.6] would equate to a cost saving of &#163;24 million p.a.
A robust methodology for measuring peritoneal membrane changes The highly cited (Section 2, [3.4]) description of the stages of peritoneal fibrosis and vascular degeneration is now accepted internationally as the scoring system to grade the effects that modifications to PD therapy have on peritoneal membrane damage.
The methodology forms the basis of most comparative histopathologic studies of the peritoneal membrane in PD patients.
