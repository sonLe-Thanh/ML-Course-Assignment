     The 1.57 million disabled and older people receiving social care support       in England and Wales rely heavily on extensive support from 6.5 million       unpaid carers.
Legal reforms since 2008 are removing the disabling       barriers of legal complexity and ensuring that services for disabled and       older people as well as their carers focus on the promotion of independent       living and of `dignity'.
Clements' research has helped bring these changes       about in three ways:            Drafting and amending earlier social care Bills which have informed         the legislation passed since 2008 and currently under scrutiny;       Impact on the Law Commission recommendations now included in the Bills         passing through Parliament and the Welsh Assembly;       Direct advice given to the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee         scrutinising the Care and Support Bill 2013.
Pathway to Impact     Before the REF period Clements was retained by a number of       Parliamentarians to help draft and amend social care legislation to       address the unmet needs identified in his research of elderly and disabled       people and their carers.
Commitments included the drafting of Bills which       became the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 and the Carers       (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004.
Clements' draft of the latter included an       attempt to prohibit "associative discrimination", which did not survive       into the Act.
In 2006 Clements was retained: as an expert adviser by the       Disability Rights Commission on the Independent Living Bill 2006, which       asserted among the guiding principles carers' rights to independent       living; by Ed Balls MP in drafting the Disabled Children's Assessment and       Services Bill 2006, which provided for respite care for family carers; and       by Paul Burstow MP in the drafting of the Care of Older and Incapacitated       People (Human Rights) Bill 2006 which sought to increase local       authorities' powers to protect vulnerable people at risk of harm or       exploitation.
In 2007 Clements was retained by Barbara Keeley MP in       drafting the Carers (Identification and Support) Bill.
These interventions       influenced subsequent legislation within the REF period.
Law Commission recommendations     As a direct outcome of Clements' 2007 briefing to the HM Government's       Office for Disability3.4 - the Law Commission was requested to       add the reform of Adult Social Care to its list of projects.5.8,5.10       This resulted in a 2008 scoping report5.1 by the Commission       that made extensive reference to Clements' research (including the above       briefing3.4) as did the Commission's 2010 Consultation Paper       (No 192: Adult Social Care)5.2.
These fed into the Commission's       formal report in 2011 (Adult Social Care: Law Com No 326: HC 941)5.3       which concluded that the codification and the reform of the law was an       imperative.
Clements' research was a leading influence on the Commission's formal       report.5.8,5.10 For example, the Law Commission recommended       that the reformed legislation should: commence with a guiding principle       concerning the promotion of personal well-being (para 4.37); and contain a       single assessment duty and a single set of eligibility criteria for       services (paras 5.23 and 6.17): requirements first identified by Clements'       in his 1997 paper3.2.
In addition the report recommended that       assessment and support for carers should be integral to any proposed Bill       (para 7.9) and that carers' support needs should be put on the same legal       footing as those of the people for whom they provide care (para 7.75):       repeating Clements' 2004 paper3.3.
The Law Commission       recommended that adult protection provisions should be contained within       the legislation (similar to the proposals in the Care of Older and       Incapacitated People (Human Rights) Bill 2006 (above) (para 9.51)); and       that the chilling effects on the `ordinary residence' provisions should be       addressed (as identified in Clements' HM Government's Office for       Disability3.4 and in the Social Care Portability Bill (see       above) (para 10.22).
All the above recommendations have now been included       in the English and Welsh Bills passing through Parliament and the Assembly       respectively.
Advice to Joint Parliamentary Select Committee     Following the Law Commission's call for reform the English Government       published a draft Bill for scrutiny (the draft Care and Support Bill       2012).
In 2013 Clements was appointed Special Adviser to the Joint       Parliamentary Select Committee that scrutinised this Bill.
Clements'       `expertise in the law and practice of care and support' was considered to       be `invaluable' by the Committee and its final Report (March 2013)       identified approximately 90 matters relating to the draft Bill that       required attention5.4, for example: the vital importance of       retaining, unchanged, the legislative boundary of responsibility with the       NHS (known as the NHS continuing care boundary) (para 11.16); the       importance of ensuring that the law did not create barriers to disabled       children continuing to receive services on their transition into adulthood       (para 11.79); the rights of `young carers' to support from adult services       (para 11.85); and the maintenance of protection for local authority       supported residents under the Human Rights Act 1998 (para 11.93).
In May       2013 the English Government introduced the Care Bill which incorporated       many of these suggested matters 5.9,5.10.
The Welsh Government       had published a similar Bill in January 2013.
Legislative changes     Principles drawn from Clements' research and outlined in previous draft       Bills were enacted after 2008.
The provisions within the Disabled       Children's Assessment and Services Bill 2006 concerning respite care for       family carers were subsequently enacted (in amended form) as section 25       Children and Young Persons Act 2008.5.5 Provisions of the       Carers (Identification and Support) Bill concerning NHS responsibilities       to provide information for carers became law in the Carers Strategies       (Wales) Measure 2010.
Provisions in the 2004 Carers (Equal Opportunities)       Bill to amend the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to prohibit       `associative' discrimination on grounds of disability were finally       realised in the Equality Act 2010 (section 13).
In 2012 Clements was       retained by Baroness Jane Campbell in the drafting of the Social Care       Portability Bill 2012, providing for transfer of support between local       authorities.
Care Bill 2013 ( England) and Social Services and Well-being           (Wales) Bill 2013     Clements' research has impacted in several ways on these two Bills, still       undergoing scrutiny in the UK Parliament5.6 and Welsh Assembly5.7       as of July 31st 2013.
The `underpinning principles' in clause 1       of the Independent Living Bill 2006 formed the basis for much of the       subsequent discussion concerning the need for such provisions and resulted       in `well-being' proposals in clause 1 of both the English and Welsh 2013       Bills.
The adult protection provisions within the Care of Older and       Incapacitated People (Human Rights) Bill 2006 have been incorporated in       part in the Care Bill and to a greater degree in the Welsh Bill (clause       105).
The Social Care Portability Bill's key proposals for transfer of       local authority support appear in clauses 36 - 37 of the English Bill and       clause 40 of the Welsh.
Both the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act       1995 and the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 have been incorporated       in codified form in both the English and Welsh Bills (clauses 19 and 15       respectively).
All the Law Commission recommendations based on Clements' research       (detailed above) appear in both Bills.
Specifically: `principle' led       legislation (clause 1 of each Bill); a single assessment duty (clause 9 in       England, clause 10 in Wales); a single set of eligibility criteria for       services (clause 13 in England, clause 19 in Wales); assessment and       support for carers placed on the same legal footing as those of the people       for whom they provide care (clauses 10 and 18 in England, clauses 10 and       26 in Wales); adult protection provisions (clause 42 in England, clause       105 in Wales); and the portability of care packages (clause 36/37 in       England, clause 40 in Wales).
The English Care Bill included many of the suggestions made by the Joint       Select Committee on Clements' advice.
Specifically: retaining the       legislative boundary of responsibility with the NHS (clause 22); the       importance of ensuring that the law does not create barriers to disabled       children continuing to receive services on transition into adulthood       (clause 55); the rights of `young carers' to support from adult services       (clause 60); and the maintenance of protection for local authority       supported residents under the Human Rights Act 1998 (to be dealt with by       way of a consequential amendment - Hansard House of Lords 22 July 2013 :       Column 1118, Baroness Northover).
