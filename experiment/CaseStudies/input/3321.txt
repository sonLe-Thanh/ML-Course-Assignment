     Solomon's research at the UoL has been pivotal in changing the way a life       threatening illness is understood, diagnosed and prevented across Asia.
Through a partnership with a consortium of Governments, Academic Partners,       and Health agencies, facilitated by a series of meetings ranging from WHO       small working groups to large international conferences, critical       information on the prevalence, diagnostics, treatment and prevention of       Japanese Encephalitis has been disseminated to at risk populations       supported by guidelines and awareness campaigns.
For example, the UoL Team       developed the online e-learning tools for Clinical Assessment of Children,       and for using the disease outcome score UoL developed (now known as the       Liverpool Outcome Score).
By tackling each of the core issues relating to       the lack of vaccine uptake, the impacts of Solomon's research have been       felt throughout the entire REF period; this has benefited individuals in       at risk areas by massively limiting the number of cases, which has in       turn, benefited governments by significantly reducing the economic burden       of caring for individuals disabled by this devastating disease.
The JE surveillance guidelines that the UoL developed on the back of its       clinical-epidemiological research, have been used across Asia since 2008,       and are helping with disease recognition.
In 2012, 18 (75%) of the 24       countries with JE virus transmission risk conducted at least some JE       surveillance [8].
The UoL rapid diagnostic kit for diagnosing JE was the prototype for kits       developed by the UoL, and others, some of which have gone through to       commercialisation, such as that produced by Venture Technologies,       Singapore, and since 2008, Pan Bio, Australia, and Excyton Diagnostics,       India [9].
Such kits are now widely used across Asia, through the JE       laboratory diagnostic network that the UoL helped establish [10].
This is       playing an essential role in helping recognition of JE so that the disease       burden can be ascertained.
The Liverpool Outcome Score has been disseminated widely through the WHO       and PATH partners, and the biannual WHO JE Regional meetings in Southeast       Asia.
It is publicly available (www.path.org/vaccineresources/details.php?i=677)       and is used in many Asian countries to help quantify the disease burden of       JE [11,12,13].
In the 1990s, other than China which had developed its own vaccine,       sustained JE vaccination programmes were restricted to wealthier Asian       countries.
The UoL work on establishing the disease burden through       improved surveillance, diagnosis and quantification of disability has       played a major role in helping Governments decide on JE vaccination       programmes.
The UoL team had a leading role in the JE control partnership       which included other HEIs, Governments across Asia, WHO, and       non-governmental organisations.
Together, with US$ 14m funding from the       Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the partnership supported vaccine roll       out [14].
The UoL research was disseminated by way of participation in all       the main WHO working groups, committees, meetings and conferences,       advising, for example on vaccine development, and surrogate markers of       vaccine efficacy [15].
The impact of this research can be examined through the new vaccination       programmes across Asia, which the UoL has catalysed and supported.
In the       summer of 2006, 19 million children were immunised in India, and by the       end of 2013, 88 million Indian children had been vaccinated.
By 2013       vaccination had begun in 11 countries outside China (eight of them since       2008), and the vaccine had reached more than 200 million people;       approximately 170 million since Jan 2008.
The public health benefits can be estimated from a health economic       modelling study: in a cohort of 100 000 unvaccinated children followed up       from birth to 30 years of age, the model predicted 488 cases and 122       deaths associated with JE [16].
In the absence of JE immunization it was       estimated that the treatment of acute JE would cost US$ 483,672 and that       7,441 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) would be lost because of JE.
Relative to the no-vaccination strategy, the use of the vaccine would       result in 427 fewer JE cases, 107 fewer deaths, and 6556 fewer DALYs lost.
For the 170 million people vaccinated since 2008, this equates to 660,000       cases and 165,000 deaths avoided.
The estimated total direct costs       associated with the treatment of JE and disability during the 30-year       follow-up of 100 000 neonates who were not vaccinated is US$ 738,315, and       the corresponding costs of using the vaccine are US$ 225,859 [16].
The       savings per 100 000 neonates are thus US$ 512 456, or US$ 791m for the 170       million people vaccinated since 2008.
