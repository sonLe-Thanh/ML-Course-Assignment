     Through the creation of a widely read blog in 2011 (see Section 5, C1),       Dr Hall has had a major impact on public understandings of international       crime fiction.
MPI has become a dynamic forum for the non-academic crime       fiction community to interact (readers, bloggers, authors, translators,       publishers, cultural commentators), and in the process has generated very       significant interest and activity.
It has global reach, with users       from over 130 countries, and is hosted by 'Mrs.
Peabody', a       friendly persona encouraging maximum user-participation.
Its posts have       generated over 220,000 hits (average 6,500/month, 1,500/week,       225/day) and over 2,500 comments (WordPress statistics;       blog-curator's hits excluded, C2).
MPI is built around two novel innovations: a researcher `opening up' her       on-going critical reflections on emergent crime fiction genres to a wide       audience, and making accessible a growing database of research texts (C3).
Over 50 'Detecting         the Past' texts are examined in the blog (click hyperlinks in C3 for       relevant posts), showcasing Nazi-themed and German/European/international       crime.
Dr Hall's academic expertise underpins reviews, themed posts,       author interviews, and conference/ convention reports, with users invited       to access the project database and research articles on MPI's         'About' page and in relevant         posts.
Blog discussions involving readers, bloggers, authors,       translators and publishers (such as Bitter Lemon, MacLehose and Hersilia       Press) explore crime fiction's capacity to offer       social/political/historical critiques, and core themes such as guilt and       justice.
The quality of debate is often extremely high and incorporates       discussion of Nazi-themed and European texts (see threads on 'Violence         and Women in Crime', 'Would         the real Finland please         stand up', 'Arne         Dahl', and `Philip         Kerr').
MPI is a mutually beneficial space for the blogger and its users.
By       discussing texts iteratively with a highly motivated non-academic       audience, Dr Hall has captured a host of new insights about the production       and reception of crime fiction that inform her research.
Non-academic       impacts are also significant and include the following:            By sharing her critical reflections on high-quality crime fiction, Dr.         Hall has had a notable impact on user reading practices.
In a         July 2013 user-survey (C4), over half of the respondents         felt that their `reading habits had been influenced or changed by the           blog'.
Comments include: `introduced to many new European crime           writers'; `pointed towards writers, particularly German, that I           might not otherwise have encountered'; `have read a lot more           since following Mrs P'; `have become more adventurous in what           crime fiction I read'; `have purchased titles I wouldn't have           done without your recommendation' (Users 1-5, C4).
Users' lives are enriched by Dr Hall's expert interpretation of           cultural capital.
85% of survey respondents felt that `the         blogger's academic expertise adds value to the blog' and 70%         that `the blog introduces me to crime fiction that enriches my life'.
Comments include: `I really appreciate MPI.
There are many book           blogs, but this one really stands out in terms of the quality of its           reviews.
The fact that the blogger is an academic is very apparent in           the breadth and depth of the analysis'; `I enjoy the blog           because it is more than a compendium of reviews.
I like the way it           gives an insight into the culture and background of the novel, which           enriches my reading'.
(Users 6 and 7, C4).
Crime is often consumed unreflexively as entertainment.
MPI has successfully           encouraged users to explore the thematic and ethical complexity of the           genre more deeply: `I feel encouraged to be an active reader,           drawing comparisons with other crime novels/films rather than simply           reading the text for the story'; `I've learned new ways to           think about crime fiction'; MPI `has made me think differently           about crime novels I've read' (Users 8-10, C4); `Mrs.           Peabody's analysis encouraged me to read the book, as she dealt with           critical moral questions that arose during WWII and its aftermath'         (User 11, `Reactions           to Reading' blog, June 2013).
Cumulatively, Dr Hall has had an impact on wider public discourses about       crime fiction.
By creating so much informed dialogue and debate through       her blog, she has influenced how discussion about crime fiction is framed       in more mainstream media.
In October/November 2012 she contributed to two       episodes of Mark Lawson's BBC           Radio 4 series, Foreign Bodies: A History of Modern Europe       through Literary           Detectives (C5), in which she explored the engagement       of Friedrich D&#252;rrenmatt's and Jakob Arjouni's crime fiction with the       legacy of National Socialism (aired between World at One and The         Archers; Radio 4's weekly audience figures for the fourth quarter of       2012: 10.75 million (BBC/RAJAR),       C6).
In 2013 Dr Hall was invited to judge the international Petrona       crime fiction award (C7), to contribute to The Times       crime-fiction critic's new Euro Noir book (C8), and to       attend a programming meeting with the Head of BBC Wales Drama.
MPI's       companion Twitter     account (C9) has over 800 followers including a number of       crime writers (Ann Cleeves, Arne Dahl, Mons Kallentoft, Ernesto Mallo,       Derek B. Miller, Stuart Neville, Jason Webster), publishers/publishing       contacts (Penguin Books; Bitter Lemon Press; Hersilia Press; MacLehose       Press; Alison Hennessy, Harvill Secker Commissioning Editor), and critics       (James Kidd/Independent; Barry Forshaw/The Times).
These       broader activities evidence MPI's influence and its recognition within the       industry as `a ground-breaking blog that is transforming readers'         understanding and appreciation of international crime' (The Times       crime-fiction critic, C8).
