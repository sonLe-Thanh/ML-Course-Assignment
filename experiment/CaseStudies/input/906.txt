     Technologies flowing from Cranfield's research on ethylene-supplemented       storage of non-climacteric produce (such as onions and potatoes), are       already exploited by the Restrain Company.
They are being used in the       storage facilities of major suppliers, such as Moulton Bulb Company and       Stourgarden who service Waitrose and Tesco respectively.
The technologies       are also having influences beyond the UK, as many of these companies are       international businesses.
Enhanced storage has prolonged storage lives for       onions and potatoes by six weeks, reducing waste and reducing dependence       on synthetic chemical sprout suppressants.
The annual value of onions going to retail and food manufacturing is       estimated at &#163;200 million, of which 54% are produced in the UK (Defra       2009).
The UK potato industry also delivers sales value of &#163;947 million at       the farm gate and &#163;3.8 billion at consumer level (Potato Council       Statistics 2013).
Ethylene supplementation is having a positive effect on       the economics of onion and potato supply by improving the timing of       produce release from storage.
Prolonging storage is avoiding volatility in       supply and contributing to the maintenance of produce prices.
Unit waste       levels during storage are between 3-10% for onions and potatoes in the UK       [1].
A 25% reduction in waste due to enhanced storage is therefore valued       at &#163;5 million for onions alone.
Such improvements in storage also have a       positive impact on the UK's self-sufficiency agenda through greater       displacement of imports of onions sourced from overseas.
E+&#8482; Ethylene Remover     The E+&#8482; Ethylene Remover, based on Cranfield research, was launched       commercially in 2009 and is now in use in packaging for most mainstream       supermarkets in the UK (Tesco, Waitrose, M&amp;S) and USA, where it has       been shown to reduce wastage of a range of fruits and vegetables.
The       relevant patent is held by Johnson-Matthey Plc.
[2,3], and is licensed to       It'sFresh!
[4], who stated in 2013 that `based on current commercial         roll-out, It'sFresh!
typically saves around 50% of in-store waste and         adds a minimum of two days' product life' [5].
It'sFresh!
has       invested more than &#163;10 million to bring to market a range of simple       products to reduce waste, protect food and increase quality [6], and       created overseas exports for the E+&#8482; Ethylene Remover.
The timeline from       research to exploitation of the E+&#8482; Ethylene Remover was less than five       years.
