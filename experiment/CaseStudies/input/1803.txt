     4a: Reframing the paradigm of smoking cessation     One cumulative impact from 20 years of research at TDRU has been a shift       in professional (and, to a lesser extent, public) understanding of the       problem of persistent smoking.
Doctors and others are now more likely to       acknowledge that giving up smoking is not a simple issue of willpower;       people who do not quit readily on brief advice are likely to have complex       physiological, cognitive or social circumstances that militate against       successful quitting.
This paradigm shift was recognized in 2008 when the       official US guideline on tobacco control was updated: "Tobacco         dependence is a chronic disease that often requires repeated         intervention and multiple attempts to quit.
Effective treatments exist,         however, that can significantly increase rates of long-term abstinence"       [1].
The justification of this statement was argued in a parallel       editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine [2].
4b: Improving treatments for dependent smokers     This research has contributed to advances in pharmacological and       behavioural treatments of dependent smokers used worldwide.
For example:       pivotal trials contributed to the licensing approvals of nicotine lozenge,       varenicline (reference 8 above) and mouth spray; and the trial of       varenicline pre-loading (reference 7 above) is changing clinical practice       currently.
The `Maudsley' Model of intensive stop-smoking treatment       refined and piloted within TDRU is now used across NHS-SSS and abroad.
More effective treatments of intractable smokers are contributing to the       reduction in smoking-related morbidity and mortality in this group.
Because tobacco dependence is closely linked to social disadvantage, this       is also contributing to reducing health inequalities.
4c: Clinical and policy clarity on what does not work     Some TDRU trials and reviews have shown negative or ambiguous results,       curtailing widespread implementation of ineffective interventions.
For       example, the RCT of brief intervention in routine hospital admission       (reference 5 above) showed no significant improvement in quit rate.
A       similar study showed negative impact of midwife-led advice in pregnant       women.
The effect of these negative studies is that, increasingly, busy       clinicians are not expected to deliver smoking cessation efforts to       persistent smokers in settings where such interventions would be       ineffective [3].
4d: Change in NICE guidelines and other official advice            Hakek was co-opted onto the Programme Development Group for the NICE         Public Health Guidance for smoking cessation (PH10).
He undertook a         rapid review of non-NHS treatments for smoking cessation as part of the         guideline development process, incorporating the various reviews done by         TDRU and others [4].
PH10 superseded previous NICE reviews of individual         therapies and aimed for the first time to review the totality of         possible therapies.
Hakek advised the guideline development group for Public Health         Guidance 34 Quitting Smoking in Pregnancy and Following Childbirth [5].
He wrote a 'Rapid review of interventions to prevent relapse in pregnant         ex-smokers', which was appended to the NICE guidance.
The series of studies on long-term use of nicotine replacement         treatments (eg refs 10 and 11 above) were instrumental in relaxing NRT         licensing and allowing long-term NRT use.
Prior to this research it was         believed that NRT should be prescribed only for short periods.
Research from TDRU has influenced smoking cessation policy beyond the         UK.
For example, the World Health Organisation Policy Recommendations         cites Hajek's research [6].
4d: Policy investment in specialised smoking cessation services     This work contributed to significant policy shift towards specialist       smoking cessation services.
NHS-SSS, established in 1999, is unique       internationally as a support for smokers motivated to quit but unable to       do so unaided [7].
The service provision framework employed by the smoking       cessation clinics was originally based on the Maudsley model developed by       Hajek et al and subsequently refined by him at QMUL in       collaboration with others.
It consists of regular meetings (group or one       to one) with a trained adviser using structured, withdrawal-oriented       support with smoking cessation medications.
The NHS-SSS, which treats       800,000 smokers annually, operates in dialogue with a number of specialist       teams, including TDRU, who continue to undertake studies whose findings       directly inform the refinement and extension of the clinical service.
