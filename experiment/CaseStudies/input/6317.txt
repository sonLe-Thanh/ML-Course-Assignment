     The impact of the research has primarily emerged from the REFLECT project       (although as       highlighted above this project was the culmination of a body of earlier       research).
The project was       designed to directly inform the practice of VET practitioners through the       fieldbook.
The fieldbook       was produced in 5 languages (Bulgarian, Dutch, English, Italian and       Romanian).
It was made open       access from the outset through the project website to ensure that it was       as widely used as possible       (Source A).
It has also had a wider influence on professional standards and       guidelines for training in VET:       specifically it was identified as one of a small number of good practice       projects by QALL (Quality       Assurance in Lifelong Learning), a project bringing together 15 Quality       Assurance (QA) agencies       across Europe which ran from 2010-13.
The aims of this project were: to       highlight good practice in       the field; mainstream this practice; and provide recommendations for       development of QA in VET       and Adult Education to policy makers, social partners, stakeholders and       national authorities.
Quality assurance in VET and Adult Education is one of the European       Commission's current policy       priorities in education, training and lifelong learning.
The QALL project       was one of five thematic       networks set up to increase the impact of innovative projects in the       sectoral lifelong learning       programmes run by the European Commission.
It compiled a compendium of       good practice       projects funded through the European Commission's Leonardo da Vinci and       Grundtvig       programmes for the period 2003-2008.
Out of the several hundred projects       funded over this period       just 39 are identified in the compendium (Source B).
The compendium       identifies the specific       relevance of the project for QA, how it relates to the EQAVET (European       Quality Assurance in       Vocational Education and Training) Cycle &#8212; a common framework and tools       for EC member states       to improve, monitor and evaluate their quality assurance policies and       practices in VET &#8212; and the       potential for disseminating the project outcomes to other sectors.
In its       overview of the REFLECT       project (Source C), it highlights:            the value of the fieldbook in the QA process as "an evaluation tool         which involves thinking         about and critically analysing one's actions with the goal of improving         one's professional         practice";       emphasises its relevance to the evaluation and review stages of the         EQAVET Cycle;       identifies it as setting out good practice for developing         facilitators' work.
The REFLECT project is also highlighted in the QALL Project report as       part of the section on Self-evaluation/self-assessment       (Source D).
In 2013, the QALL project published 10 recommendations derived from the       good practice projects       in the compendium (Source E).
These recommendations addressed both       implementation issues       (aimed at practitioners and providers of VET and Adult education) and       policy issues (aimed at       European and national agencies and policy makers).
The importance of       reflective practice (and       associated self-evaluation) is highlighted in a number of the 10       recommendations:            Under the heading "Quality Culture" recommendations include:                Instil QA and evaluation into the daily practice of VET and AE           professionals;           promote collaboration and reflective practice.
Enhance reflective practices using a (self-)evaluation culture and           peer review           methodologies as a central tool.
Under the heading "Methodologies" recommendations include:                Use bottom-up self-evaluation as an important element of quality           culture; raise           awareness for its benefits and do not restrict it to a bureaucratic           procedure for           compliance with formal requirements.
These recommendations have been widely circulated by the project team and       are intended to feed       into QA policy at the European level.
