     Routes to Impact     Through Buchanan's `Silents Now' project [cs 12] - improving       contemporary audiences' access to silent cinema and enriching their       experience of it &#8212; her research has impacted on cultural life, economic       activity, creative practice and the preservation of cultural artefacts.
In       collaboration with partners she has exhibited silent films publicly and in       performatively innovative ways; encouraged new forms of creative       engagement with them; and enhanced viewers' understanding of them through       expert commentary.
Thus she has transformed films that might otherwise       have seemed remote and inaccessible into both historically illuminating       viewing experiences and touching, funny and inspiring parts of our       continuing cultural landscape.
One key partnership, with Thanhouser, usefully illustrates the project's       quality of impact and range of local, national and international       beneficiaries; it is cited here as a stand-alone, first section.
Thereafter the impact is detailed by specific category of beneficiary &#8212; viz: cinemas, theatres and festivals; children; industry professionals;       higher education institutions beyond York.
The Buchanan/Thanhouser partnership: economic and creative practice         enhancement     Thanhouser, an influential early American film production company, made       `qualities' from 1910 to 1916.
Having researched the work of Thanhouser       for many years, in 2012 Buchanan formed a multi-faceted partnership with       Ned Thanhouser, founder and President of Thanhouser Company Film       Preservation, Inc. and grandson of pioneering filmmaker Edwin Thanhouser.
This has facilitated a range of collaborative activities which have helped       to preserve, promote and interpret Thanhouser's unique early film archive.
The Thanhouser President writes: `Judith has used her research expertise       to make a variety of silent films, including Thanhouser films, more         accessible and intelligible to contemporary audiences...Through [the       Buchanan-Thanhouser partnership], more UK audiences were given access to       the work of the Thanhouser studio, were able to take pleasure in these       wonderful surviving films...and were provided with helpful ways of       understanding the place of these films in the development of the film       industry.'
[corroborating source (cs) 1].
In June 2013, Buchanan organised a 2-date tour of `Thanhouser's Early         Cinema Adaptations' &#8212; a public screening of films from the       fascinating but little known Thanhouser archive.
Event venues: 1) British       Film Institute (BFI)'s prestigious National Film Theatre (NFT) on South       Bank (London) (attendance: 96 paid + 16 comps = 112) [cs 3.i, 3.iv, 3.v];       2) Hyde Park Picture House (HPPH), Leeds &#8212; one of the oldest and most       beautiful working cinemas in the North of England (founded 1914)       (attendance: 98) [cs 3.iv, 3.vi].
A Q&amp;A with Ned Thanhouser about the       company preceded the screenings.
Buchanan introduced each of the films       which were also animated by specially commissioned live musical       accompaniment.
In a mixed-media performance strategy, for one title, The         Winter's Tale, Buchanan had scripted and rehearsed professional       actors in live, synched `voice-to-screen' performances &#8212; a       performance strategy whose innovative quality is confirmed by both BFI and       HPPH [cs 3.v, 3.vi].
The Thanhouser President writes: `The way in which       Judith choreographed the actors to work in collaboration with the film brought         it to life in a genuinely new way and made the film both more         intelligible, and more touching for contemporary audiences as a       result' [cs 1].
Audience feedback cards are universally enthusiastic and       appreciative.
Sample comments, illustrating impact on the audience,       include: `An exceptional opportunity to see rare footage';       `Introductions/commentary + Q&amp;A were very insightful.
Really       enjoyed!!
'; `Thrilling to have Thanhouser grandson actually present';       `Terrific to have introductions given with such knowledge, detail &#8212; and       passion!
'; `Brilliant idea for The Winter's Tale; opened up a real area of       imagination of interpretation'; `I knew nothing of these films before       this.
Fascinating &amp; enlightening' [cs 2.i].
Buchanan's interview about       Thanhouser films for BBC Radio Leeds was picked up for `Best of BBC Local       Radio' show and subsequently aired on 27 further stations around the UK       [cs 5], further widening the reach of impact of the events.
This media       coverage, writes the Thanhouser President, `gave an enhanced profile to         the work of Thanhouser in recuperating and preserving these early       films thereby contributing to the aims of the Thanhouser Company Film       Preservation, Inc.' [cs 1] HPPH report that in the process it helped to       raise their profile too [cs 3.vi].
Buchanan recorded expert voice-over commentaries to The         Winter's Tale and Cinderella for the `Thanhouser's Early       Cinema Adaptations' DVD on sale at the event [cs 3.ii].
These films, with       accompanying Buchanan commentaries, have been posted for free-to-view         online access [cs 3.iii].
Her expertise on the Thanhouser qualities       has been harnessed for a 50-min TV documentary entitled `The       Thanhouser Studio and the Birth of American Cinema' &#8212; for the Pordenone       Film Festival, and transmission on television (USA) in 2014 [cs 6].
Impact       claimed here is on the work of Thanhouser, Inc. not on future viewers of       documentary.
Impact achieved:     i) London &amp; Yorkshire audiences delighted, enriched and educated         by screenings [cs 2.i].
ii)profile of Thanhouser Company Film Preservation, Inc and of its         archive enhanced through public screening events and media appearances         to publicise [cs 1, 3.i, 3.iv, 3.vi, 5, 6].
iii) audiences' viewing of the films enhanced through expert         interpretive aids in the form of in-person introductions and Buchanan         commentary for DVD &amp; online publication [cs 1, 3.ii-iii, 6].
iv) creative new ways of presenting and appreciating the films for         contemporary audiences developed by Buchanan in collaboration with         actors and musicians [cs 1, 2, 3.v, 3.vi     v) BFI's mission to curate film from the full historical range         assisted by rare event showcasing very early cinema [cs 3.iv];         and programme of both BFI and HPPH broadened and enriched through the         pioneering multi-media presentation combining silent film with live         actors [cs 3.v-vi].
vi) HPPH's profile and heritage credentials raised via enhanced media         exposure [cs 3.vi, 5].
Other Beneficiaries     1.
Cinema, Theatre and Festival Programming       In addition to her work with arts cinemas (York City Screen, Leeds Hyde       Park Picture House, NFT South Bank), Buchanan's silent film work has       impacted separately on York Theatre Royal's (YTR) and on the Festival       Shakespeare Buenos Aires's (FSBA) programming for the 2013/2014 season.
YTR commissioned Buchanan to rehearse the actors from its stage production       of Richard III for a multi-media `performance' of a silent film of       Richard III, for which she wrote the voice-to-screen script and       commissioned a new John Sweeney score [cs 10].
FSBA has programmed a       silent Shakespeare show for its 2014 Festival line-up, which constitutes       `a welcome expansion in the activities of the Festival'.
The FSBA Director       accounts for the inspiration for this thus: `we are glad to have become         aware of....this possibility for festival programming through Judith         Buchanan's work' [cs 4].
The impact claimed here is not for the       shows themselves (which fall post 31.7.13) but on YTR (vision,       programming, contracting of actors), on FSBA (programming) and on       Sweeney's musical composition &#8212; all within the designated impact period.
Impact achieved: Expanding regional theatre's &amp;         international Shakespeare Festival's multi-media vision and specific         programming to include silent Shakespeare events [cs 4 &amp; 10].

Industry Professionals     i) Industry Professionals Shakespeare on Silent Film is       appreciatively cited in multiple blog posts by John Wyver (producer of the       David Tennant Hamlet DVD, Anthony Sher Macbeth DVD, RSC Julius         Caesar DVD).
He cites her work specifically and in detail to       historicise his discussion of prospective Shakespare Quartercentenary       celebrations, of the Doran/Tennant Hamlet he was then producing       and of contemporary biblical releases [cs 7].
ii) Filmmakers Filmmaker Kit Monkman (The Knife That Killed Me)       with innovative production company Green Screen are making a short       documentary film 'inspired,' as they write, `by Judith         Buchanan's research work on silent cinema and contemporary       audiences' participation in silent cinema' [cs 8.i-ii].
In Spring 2012 Green         Screen invested &#163;5k in this project.
The resulting short will be       released in 2014 for the short film festival circuit and for Pordenone.
As       part of its subject, Buchanan (co-producing) has commissioned a cinematic       reworking of particular silent film scenes employing a modern, creative       sensibility and the full technological resources of contemporary       filmmaking.
Green Screen reports that Judith's work has enabled us `to         intervene upon, and collaborate with...early film in stimulating and         provocative ways.'
[cs 8.i] Impact claimed here is on Green Screen       (within designated impact period), not on future viewers of film.
Impact achieved:     i) Buchanan's work informs contemporary discussion by industry         practitioners [cs 7].
ii) Her work inspires contemporary         filmmakers in both documentary and (re)creative projects in which they         invest creatively and financially [cs8].
3.
Children     i) School Curriculum: Buchanan has run a series of Shakespeare       workshops incorporating silent film activities for children from local       state primary and secondary schools.
The impact is evident in the       children's and teachers' universally enthusiastic reviews of the         eye-opening effects of positive exposure to an unfamiliar medium.
Sample student and teacher comments include: `Really helped me think about       what is sensational about the end of Othello &amp; why this is important';       `Thank you for giving our pupils such a rich experience, many new things       to think about...&amp; exposure to material they would certainly never       have encountered elsewhere!
We have all really...benefited from...all the       wonderful new material on silent cinema' [cs 2.ii].
ii) Leisure-Time Activities: As part of the York Festival of       Ideas, `Silents Now' ran 'Voicing Villainy', a participative silent         film workshop for York families.
Community participants of all ages       developed their own villainous performances in touching, earnest and/or       skittish collaboration with famous on-screen silent `villains' (including       Richard III, Count Orlok and Fantomas).
Participants' feedback was very       enthusiastic.
Parent comments include: `Really good to...[get] involved       with [the films] rather than just thinking them a little weird'; `Terrific       to see so many children taking pleasure in old, silent films'.
Workshop       numbers across afternoon: 67 [cs 2.iii].
Impact achieved: i) Deepened learning experiences of         performance interpretation and historical understanding through multiple         schools workshops [cs 2.ii].
ii) Rendered silent films         accessible, educative and fun for all ages through `Voicing Villainy'         workshop [cs 2.iii].
4.
Higher Education Institutions beyond York       Buchanan's introduction to and expert voice-overs for the 7 films on the       2004 BFI DVD Silent Shakespeare [cs 9] (BFI sales figs: c.3k in       UK, c.4k in North America) and her CUP monograph Shakespeare on Silent         Film have together provided primary and secondary materials       sufficient to make silent Shakespeare now a viable inclusion on university       syllabi.
As selective illustration of curriculum expansion in area,       silent Shakespare, drawing on Buchanan DVD and/or monograph, is now on       syllabi at: Birmingham, Nottingham, KCL, de Montfort, Leicester,       Roehampton, Keele, Sheffield, Lancaster, Malaga, Cologne, Cornell, UPenn,       Cornell College, Notre Dame [cs 11].
