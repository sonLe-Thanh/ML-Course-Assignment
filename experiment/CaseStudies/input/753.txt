     In 2011, 21,484 people in Wales lived in sheltered housing, residential       care and nursing homes (as       defined in the Census).
Thus, the research of the CIA has potential to       impacted on around 2.8% of       the older population (60 years and over) in Wales who reside in supported       living environments.
The research has been wide reaching and has had significant impacts on the       organisational       activity of extracare sheltered housing providers, local authorities, and       policy-making (through the       adoption of the amended `escalating concern' guidelines that were produced       as a result of the       closure of residential care project) in Wales.
In November 2010, Prof V Burholt and Dr P Nash gave a briefing on the       Extracare project to WG       members at the Senedd.
This influenced the thinking of at least two       Assembly Members in 2010       (Dr Brian Gibbons AM, Andrew Davies AM) who remained engaged in an email       dialogue after the       briefing to acquire further information on the project.
The opening speech       by the former First       Minister (Rhodri Morgan) on 9 Feb 2012 (Public Services 2025) acknowledged       the strength of the       research-policy links that have been developed through this (and other)       research "Our strong         relationship with the Centre for Innovation in Ageing at Swansea         University, backed by a 3 year         research agreement, underpins what is widely recognised as a         world-leading approach to policy         and delivery for older people."
The Older People and Ageing Research and Development Network Cymru (a       WG-funded thematic       network hosted by the Centre for Innovative Ageing), with the Office of       the Older People's       Commissioner in Wales organised regional seminars for practitioners and       policy makers with an       interest in supported living environments.
The seminars presented findings       from the closure of       residential care facilities in Wales project and an overview of       recommendations of changes to       extracare based on the research.
The seminars were delivered in both north       (1 March 2011) and       south Wales (29 March 2011), and were attended by practitioners, Care and       Social Services       Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW) and policy makers from Welsh Government.
In       2010 and 2011, Prof       Burholt and Dr Nash presented the recommendations from the Extracare       project in meetings with       the South East Wales Improvement Collaborative (SEWIC).
Dissemination of the research findings has directly:     Impacted on the reconfiguration of services in Wales.
Swansea Social Services have developed a strategy for extracare for         older people in the         authority based on the evidence provided (contact details supplied).
Specifically, in the         early formulation of this strategy, the work of the CIA has been used by         the Social Services         Department to challenge the assumptions that they had about the ability         of extracare to         meet the functional and social needs of frail elders.
The Local         Authority Commissioning         Plan states that in 2012/13 the authority will use this information to         develop a position         statement around extracare or housing with support including proposal         for options.
Vale of Glamorgan Council in partnership with Hafod Housing         Association is currently         building its first extracare housing scheme (contact details supplied).
Led to organisations changing the allocation of social care `hours'           to Extracare schemes to       ensure a balanced mix of older people with different levels of care       needs/frailty.
In Wrexham, the Head of Adult Social Care and the Commissioning         Manager for older         people have testified that the research led to consideration of the         importance of, and need         to create meaningful communities within extracare (contact details         supplied).
To achieve         this, a small team of Care Managers have been housed within the         extracare facility and         work with individuals to explore opportunities for social interaction         including enabling         people to engage with their former local communities and social         networks.
The South East Wales Improvement Collaborative (SEWIC) have used the         evidence to         rank extracare housing as the third option within a program of work to         begin to address the         challenges facing the social care and health economy of south east Wales         [C3].
Influenced public policy debate in Wales and WG policy [C5].
Recommendations from our Closure of Care Homes project have been         included in a report         issued to the First Minister under Regulation 16 of the Commissioner for         Older People in         Wales Regulations 2007 in relation to the Commissioner's general         function of promoting         awareness of the interests of older people in Wales and the need to         safeguard those         interests [C6].
The Social Care Committee of WG used the CIA evidence (also reported         in C7) to feed into         the Social Care Review on Residential Care [C1,C2,C4].
Key recommendations arising from the WG Social Care Review on         Residential Care are         built on the CIA evidence, and endorse our suggestions that         significantly improve older         people's lives: 1 (access to effective advocacy); 2 (advice and         information to support long-term         care decisions); 8 (raising skills and awareness of staff about         dementia); 9 (financial         scrutiny of care homes) and 11 (strengthening escalating concerns         guidance) [C4].
As a result of our research, WG policy has changed:         recommendations 1, 2 and 11 in the         WG Social Care Review on Residential Care have been accepted by the         Minister, while 8         and 9 have been accepted in principle [C8].
The former Deputy Director of Social Services Policy and Strategies in         the Welsh         Government has noted that our research "led the Deputy Minister to ask         the Commissioner         for Older People to review our Guidance on Escalating Concerns and         Closures of Care         Homes in respect of local authority commissioning practice" [C9].
Subsequently, an         Independent Advisory Group on Local Authority Closure of Care Homes was         convened to         advise the Deputy Minister for Social Services on how the Escalating         Concerns Guidance         should be updated.
The Chair has noted that the advisory group have         recommended that         many of our amendments to escalating concerns should be adopted in         relation to care         home closing due to strategic/policy reasons [C10].
Subsequently, work         is underway by the         Welsh Government to publish revised guidance in relation to care-home         closures based on         our research.
