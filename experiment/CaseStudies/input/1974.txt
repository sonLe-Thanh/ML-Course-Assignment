            Building Information Modelling (BIM) research at the University of         Salford has contributed to the concept and development of an integrated         approach towards improved efficiency in the UK construction sector.
According to the UK Government, "the initial estimated savings to UK           construction and its clients is &#163;2bn pa through the widespread           adoption of BIM" (UK           Government, 2012).
By 2016 the UK Government will require Level 2         BIM as a minimum in the delivery of public procured projects: "The UK           Government has embarked with industry on a four year programme for           sector modernisation with the key objective of reducing capital cost           and the carbon burden from the construction and operation of the built           environment by 20%.
Central to these ambitions is the adoption of           information rich Building Information Modelling (BIM) technologies,           process and collaborative behaviours that will unlock new more           efficient ways of working at all stages of the project life-cycle"         BIM Task Group.
University of         Salford research has supported the development of this strategy through         developing integrated approaches to improved efficiency in the         construction sector, through:                Establishing the concept of `nD modelling';         Developing and demonstrating the concept of integrated multi-user           distributed construction project databases;         Developing and demonstrating the virtual workspace for concurrent           engineering and collaborative working;         Developing the `Process Protocol';         Supporting the development of the international standardisation for           the representation and exchange of building information.
Context: 1993-1998: Early pioneering research demonstrated the         concept of building information integration through the development of a         shared project database in supporting the project lifecycle, influencing         early work on the development of the international standardisation of         effort for the representation and exchange of building information         through Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), by buildingSMART (formerly         the International Alliance of Interoperability).
The WISPER project was one of the first projects to         implement the IFCs and, together with other projects such as Gallicon,         contributed to their on-going development.
Further industry         collaboration led to a commercial project collaboration environment         being established  4Projects,         now widely deployed across the global construction industry to         facilitate collaboration with 18 of the top 20 UK construction         contractors and 3 of the top 5 construction organisations currently         using the system, along with the development and deployment of bespoke         organisational collaboration systems such as iCosnet used within         Costain.
In addition, the `Process Protocol' has been widely recognised         and adopted by the UK construction sector in facilitating industry         process improvement.
2008-2010: A number of key leading industry figures engaged in         these projects have deployed the approach and demonstrated its benefits         on live projects, such as Heathrow Terminal 5, PalaceXchange, Sellafield         and the Royal London Hospital.
Moreover, the long-term relationships         established with these key leading industry figures have formed the         basis of the collaborative effort of driving BIM(M) forward within the         construction industry and in leading to the recent UK Government BIM         Strategy.
2008: Salford researchers developed the Uniting Construction         Information (UCI) initiative sponsored by the UK Government (DTI/BIS)         towards uniting the various construction IT network/membership-based         organisations under 'one voice' in creating closer collaboration between         industry and Government and facilitating diversity, while avoiding         duplication by pursuing common goals.
A number of collaborative         activities continue drive progressive change in the industry,         establishing BIM(M) training/CPD courses focused on increasing the         awareness and uptake of BIM(M) in the UK construction sector.
Many of         these activities form part of the seven work stream activities which are         on-going and are continuing to inform the UK Government's BIM strategy.
2011: The BIM Academic Forum (BAF) was set up by Salford         researchers and brings together the academic community in the UK to         focus on supporting the education and training task group activities of         the UK government strategy.
"At this point in the evolution of the           UK BIM strategy it is of increasing importance that our teaching           institutions are equally well informed of the progress that is being           made across those Government departments which are spearheading           implementation on projects and across its asset base.
The BAF has           taken great steps by bringing together and providing a focus for UK           academia.
The agenda supports that of the BIM task group in promoting           UK BIM adoption and leadership both home and abroad to ensure that the           UK is at the vanguard on new, more efficient ways of working"         Professor David Philp, Head of BIM at Mace, currently seconded to the         Cabinet Office as Head of BIM Implementation 2012.
2012: The CIB Integrated Design and Delivery Solutions (IDDS)         Working Commission and Task Group has been established and is currently         co-ordinated by the School of the Built Environment at Salford, while         two recent major European (TEMPUS) funded projects synergised Salford's         research competence in this area with those of comparable EU experts to         develop unique Research, Learning and Enterprising excellence in a         designated developing country: "Industry [is] already recognising the           business benefits of pursuing research into how BIM can help bring           improvements to the life cycle of an asset in their own parts of the           industry.
For example, the British Council of Offices has established           a programme with Salford University and HOK Architects to work with           investors, designers and constructors to establish the knowledge-base           and benefits of BIM across the design, build and operations of           offices."
(Industrial           strategy: government and industry in partnership Building Information           Modelling, HM Government, 2012)       The formal engagement of leading industry figures is maintained, such         as Mark Bew, Chairman of both the UK Government BIM Group and         buildingSMART(UK) and currently undertaking a PhD, while Martin Simpson,         Associate Director at ARUP, a leading global professional services         organisation, and Peter Rebbeck, former Chairman of BSI-KSA and         Construct IT For Business and former Strategic Director at BAA are         Visiting Professors.
