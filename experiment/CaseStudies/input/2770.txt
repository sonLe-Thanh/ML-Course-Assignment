     While SCI is infrequent (in the UK approximately 1200 people per year are       paralysed from a spinal cord injury), the implications of SCI for       patients, society and the health services are immense.
It is estimated       that around 30,000 people in the UK are currently living with SCI, with a       significant cost associated with their care (depending upon their age at       the time of trauma, the cost of each patient's care may be as much as &#163;2M       over their lifetime).
In addition, 21% of those discharged from SCI Centres go to nursing       homes, hospitals or other care institutions rather than their own homes.
20% of people leave SCI centres with clinical depression.
The spinal cord       injury and associated disability will affect a patient for the rest of       their life.
This results in a duration-of-care commitment most often       ranging from 30-40 years.
For these reasons, research carried out by the       University of Glasgow's CRE has focused on improving the health and       quality of life of SCI patients, resulting in a reduced burden on carers,       families and the health services.
Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for cycling and abdominal         stimulation: The University of Glasgow team refined the concept of       FES for cycling and abdominal stimulation, establishing the technology for       routine medical practice by defining its benefits to patients.
This       enabled the transition of FES into widely-used care scenarios across the       UK and internationally, throughout Europe, North America and Asia.
The       researchers in Glasgow also worked with industry to develop specialised       cycles, making FES cycling a commercial reality.
Health benefits resulting from the research: SCI patients suffer       from muscle atrophy, affecting their breathing and balance as well as       reducing any remaining functionality in their limbs (making it more       difficult to retain independence).
By using FES, a series of electrical       stimuli are sent to the muscle groups to create a pattern of contraction       that is similar to that of an able-bodied person.
This results in       functional movement (e.g.
enabling cycling or supporting breathing)       thereby provoking a cardiovascular workout.
The University's FES cycling technology allows SCI sufferers to use       adapted exercise bikes to maintain and build up their muscle mass       throughout their lives.
The use of FES cycling results in improved general       fitness and health, delivering a range of benefits including decreased       risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, decreased       anxiety, pain and depression, as well as reductions in the prevalence of       obesity, diabetes and bone demineralisation.
Abdominal FES improves lung       function and reduces the risk of respiratory infection.
All of these       outcomes reduce morbidity and mortality, evidenced by a reduction in rates       of secondary hospitalisation and the associated medical costs.
The       increased physical activity results in greater strength, providing the       patient with enhanced independence.
Patients also experience improved       levels of energy, improved social interaction, and a better quality sleep.
Two typical case studies from the CRE research involving QENSIU patients       illustrate the health and quality of life benefits of FES:            A paralysed patient started weekly FES cycling therapy with the aim of         improving his health, an activity that lasted for over a decade until         2011.
The patient reported increased muscle mass, improved body image         and, after the FES exercise, felt physically fatigued and had reduced         spasticity.
Prior to the therapy he and his partner had been unable to         conceive, however regular exercise improved his health sufficiently and         through assisted conception, the patient's twins were born in 2011.
A ventilator-dependent tetraplegic patient was given FES abdominal         stimulation as part of a four-week weaning programme.
The patient         continued to wean but only managed to breathe 12 hours/day         ventilator-free.
With a further course of 4 weeks' abdominal stimulation         therapy the patient was ventilator-free, greatly improving his quality         of life and reducing long-term care costs.
Commercial benefits resulting from the research: In 2007, in       collaboration with Hasomed GmbH (Magdeburg, Germany) and Anatomical       Concepts UK Ltd (Clydebank, UK), the CRE team incorporated the FES cycling       technology into commercial products, making participation and access for       end-users a realistic option.
This has led to the production of a range of       FES cycling products, including the RehaBike and a related FES cycling       ergometer, the RehaMove (www.fescycling.com).
The RehaMove is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and       is available in the USA.
In the UK, Anatomical Concepts sell on average       30-40 FES systems each year.
Hasomed's RehaBike and RehaMove are used by many hundreds of people at       home, in clinics and in physiotherapy sessions in spinal cord injury       centres across the world.
Hasomed is the market leader in Europe, selling       approximately 500 FES systems worldwide annually.
Hasomed has over 50       distribution partners, including in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia,       Mexico, Russia, UK, USA and Taiwan.
Hasomed are currently integrating the       abdominal stimulation technology with their existing stimulation system       (Rehastim) for release to the market.
Neuro-feedback for treatment of Central Neuropathic Pain (CNP):       SCI often leads to an intractable and difficult to treat neuropathic pain       that is both severe and incapacitating.
Until recently, treatment was       limited to drugs, with significant side effects.
However, Dr Vuckovic, in       the CRE, has developed training protocols for neuro-feedback that provide       patients with information about their brain activity so that they can       voluntarily modify their brainwaves.
Five patients who were not responding to standard medication treatments       have participated in Dr Vuckovic's initial clinical trial, receiving up to       40 neuro-feedback treatment sessions each.
These resulted in a clinically       meaningful pain reduction of &gt;30% for four out of five patients.
The       benefits of neuro-feedback in the treatment of CNP are illustrated by the       following case study:            An incomplete SCI patient walking with crutches described his pain as         "having two legs full of angry wasps".
He felt benefits after three or         four sessions of neuro-feedback treatment.
His pain reduced from 7 to 3         on the visual analogue scale (1 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable)         and the effects lasted for two to three days.
Prior to treatment,         walking was impaired with spasms, and after each treatment he was         spasm-free for several hours.
After additional training sessions, he had         developed sufficient understanding of the techniques required to manage         his pain and could do this at home without the device.
This degree of         benefit has a significant clinical effect, can improve quality of life         and leads to a reduction in medication.
