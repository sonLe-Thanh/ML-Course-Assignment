     Lung transplants represent the last hope for cystic fibrosis patients       with end-stage lung disease.
By demonstrating that colonisation of the airways with the majority of the       closely related       Burkholderia species of bacteria does not adversely affect the       outcome of lung transplant,       Newcastle research has resulted in many seriously ill young people now       being offered transplants       that had previously been considered too risky.
The mean survival rate for       these patients is as       good as that of non-infected patients.
In a situation where median       lifespan is around 37 years,       good-quality lifespan post-transplant can exceed five years (EV a).
Approach to patient treatment in major research centres     As noted above, in the 1990s most centres stopped listing cystic fibrosis       patients for transplant if       they had any Burkholderia infection because of the risk to the       patient's life.
However, some large       research centres, including Newcastle and centres in France, the US,       Canada and Australia,       continued to consider for transplant patients colonised by these bacteria.
Since 2001, all patients       in Newcastle have been assessed for risk posed by Burkholderia       infection by ensuring that those       carrying the dangerous Burkholderia cenocepacia infection are       identified (R1).
If the dangerous Burkholderia cenocepacia was found then a revised       pre- and post-transplant       treatment protocol was implemented.
Over time the protocol changed as       virulence factors were       identified (R4) and researchers sought to improve results for their       patients.
In 2008, the continued       poor outcomes for these patients, even with the amended treatment, led       Newcastle and most of       the other centres finally to stop transplanting patients with the       dangerous Burkholderia         cenocepacia (see R5).
Nonetheless, patients with non-cenocepacia       infections continued to be       transplanted during this period (1990s-2008), but only in the large       research-active centres.
The significance of the Newcastle findings (R1-R4), especially the good       outcomes for patients with       non-cenocepacia infection, has been disseminated widely through       professional networks and via       the guidelines of the International Society for Heart and Lung       Transplantation, of which Corris was       an author (EV b).
Guidelines into practice     The publication of the International Society for Heart and Lung       transplantation guidelines in 2006       brought Newcastle research findings to the attention of transplant centres       worldwide.
Transplant       centres that had stopped listing patients with any Burkholderia       infection for transplant began to       revise their policies after 2008.
The Medical Director of the Texas       Transplant Centre confirmed,     `Implementation of the recommendations suggested, with risk         stratification in 2008, led to         significant and meaningful changes, not only in our clinical practice,         but for the rest of the         North American Continent in lung transplantation.'
(EV c)     Further evidence of the Newcastle approach to risk stratification       affecting global practice has come       from a number of organisations.
The President of the International Society       for Heart and Lung       Transplantation has confirmed that:     `Since the ISHLT guidelines were published the majority of transplant         centres have, to the         best of my knowledge, implemented them in practice.
Hence it is fair to         say that the current         local, and International, policy and clinical practice in relation to         lung transplantation of         cystic fibrosis patients has largely been informed by the Newcastle         research.'
(EV d)     The President of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society in 2013 confirms:     `The incorporation of [Newcastle] research findings into the         ISHLT Guidelines, and the         subsequent implementation of risk stratification by the majority of         transplantation centres in         the past 5 years has led to significant changes in clinical practice         throughout Europe.
This         stratification of B. cenocepacia patients, who have very poor         outcomes compared to         patients with B. multivorans and other species, has ensured that         the precious resource of         transplanted lungs are directed effectively.'
(EV e)     The Chair of the Association of Lung Transplant Physicians UK has also       confirmed that `Most if not         all European Transplant centres' stratify patient risk based on       Newcastle's research and noted:     `This important finding has been instrumental in informing listing and         organ allocation         practices in an era of continuing critical donor organ shortage to         ensure better use of this         scarce resource and effective transplantation in people with Cystic         fibrosis.
Having         previously been denied access to transplantation, many cystic fibrosis         patients with non-         cenocepacia infection have since undergone successful surgery.'
(EV       f)     While work continues to help patients identified as having the         dangerous Burkholderia         cenocepacia, the Newcastle findings have largely benefited cystic       fibrosis patients with non-       cenocepacia Burkholderia complex infections.
The Newcastle research       paper from 2010 (R5)       highlighted the success of transplanting such patients and this data       (disseminated widely in       abstract form from 2008, the year the paper was first submitted to the       journal) has proved       influential.
The President of the International Society for Heart and Lung       Transplantation has       confirmed that,     `The ISHLT registry does not record infection data stratified by         organism, however studies         by ISHLT members revealed the prevalence of Burkholderia complex         species among cystic         fibrosis patients on transplant lists to be around 10%.
Just under half         of these will be         colonised by Burkholderia species other than B. cenocepacia.
Consequently it would be         reasonable to conservatively estimate that more than 30 patients (adults         and children)         worldwide per year now receive transplants who would otherwise not have         been listed, the         majority of those who could benefit.'
