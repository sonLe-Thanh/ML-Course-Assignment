     Impact on Policy     The research associated with the development and evaluation of ASSIST has       had a substantial impact on policy.
In February 2010, the UK government published `A Smokefree Future',         its White Paper on tobacco control.
It outlines future policy and         focuses on the use of evidence-based policies in three areas, the first         of which is `To stop the inflow of young people recruited as smokers'         [a].
The review of evidence into smoking and young people which informed         this White Paper identified ASSIST as a `potentially important         intervention' [b].
ASSIST has been cited as an example of good practice in another         Government White Paper, Healthy Lives, Brighter Futures: The           Strategy for Children and Young People's Health [c].
It was also flagged as an example of an effective preventative         strategy aimed at young people in the NHS Stop Smoking Services:           Service and Monitoring Guidance [d].
Guidance published by NICE, `School-based Interventions to Prevent           Smoking',[e] which was informed by four separate reviews [f, g],         has a specific recommendation on peer-led initiatives.
It states that         those commissioning health care should `consider offering         evidence-based, peer-led interventions aimed at preventing the uptake of         smoking such as the ASSIST (A Stop Smoking in School Trial) programme'         and refers the reader to the main trial results published in The           Lancet.
The Tobacco Action Plan for Wales, published in February 2012,         has, as one of four strategic action areas, `reducing the uptake of         tobacco use, especially amongst children and young people.'
It restates         the Welsh Government's continuing commitment to providing the ASSIST         programme to 40 to 50 schools per year, focussing on areas of         deprivation.
[h]          Implementation of ASSIST     The research intervention was faithfully translated into a practical       model that can be implemented by national, regional and local bodies with       health and education responsibilities.
The major vehicle for dissemination       has been DECIPHer (the Centre for the Development and Evaluation of       Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement), the UKCRC (UK       Clinical Research Collaboration) Public Health Research Centre of       Excellence jointly established by the universities of Bristol, Cardiff and       Swansea.
In order to ensure effective support for the implementation of ASSIST and       to maintain its integrity, the universities of Bristol and Cardiff created       DECIPHer Impact Ltd, a `not for profit' company, limited by guarantee       which aims to maximise the translation and impact of evidence-based public       health improvement research and expertise.
Its first product is ASSIST,       which is trade-marked as the DECIPHer-ASSIST smoking prevention programme.
Licences are sold by the company and purchasers receive DECIPHer-ASSIST       materials, training, support and ongoing quality assurance.
This ensures       that DECIPHer-ASSIST is implemented in a high quality way and maximises       the likelihood that the effects found in the RCT are reproduced in real       world implementation.
There has been substantial demand for DECIPHer-ASSIST from local       healthcare purchasers [i].
To date 25 health bodies in England and the       Channel Islands have been issued with licences costing up to &#163;34K each.
A       more substantial licence has also been issued covering the whole of Wales,       where ASSIST is being implemented at a rate of 40-50 schools per annum.
Company turnover in the year ending July 2013 was &#163;240K [i].
In its recent       tobacco control policy the Scottish government committed to pilot ASSIST       and discussions are ongoing with state and educational institutions in       France and Germany about implementing ASSIST.
[i] To date over 350 UK       schools have been involved in the programme and over 150 staff from former       primary care trusts and local authorities have been trained to deliver the       programme.
Impact on teenagers     The use of ASSIST is growing every year.
In the academic year 2012/2013       over 25,000 Year 8 students (via more than 4,500 peer supporters)       were involved in DECIPHer-ASSIST.
By summer 2013 more than 60,000 Year 8       students and over 11,000 peer supporters were involved in DECIPHer-ASSIST,       resulting in 1674 fewer teenagers taking up smoking.
[i]     Recognition of the impact on health     In 2011 DECIPHer-IMPACT was the overall winner of the Bristol Health       Partners Health Innovation Award [j] which recognises outstanding health       innovation achievements.
In 2013 DECIPHer- IMPACT won the Innovation in       Healthcare Award as part of Cardiff University's Innovation and Impact       Awards 2013[j].
