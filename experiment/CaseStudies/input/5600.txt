     The production of Guantanamo Boy constitutes an original         artistic UK output produced and created by Hingorani's company,       Brolly, a BME cross arts organisation       (www.brollyproductions.com).
Hingorani's work thereby delivered direct benefits to the Stratford Circus       Arts Centre theatre, where the play was staged, through its use as the       basis for Hingorani's development of programming for a new teenage       audience.
The impact of this use of his research is evident in the fact       that Guantanamo Boy attracted audiences of which 70% were       estimated by the theatre to have been new.
As such, it engaged         significant new audiences both with theatre generally and, more         specifically, with the complex socio-political topics raised through       the play's production, performance and review, including issues of       representation, cultural identity and diversity [a].
The play was purposely located within mainstream theatre with the       explicit aim of attracting new and diverse young audiences to the theatre       by actively contesting the lack of representation of `other' voices and       bodies on the British stage, as espoused by Arts Council England.
In so       doing, it responded to pressing public policy relating to the current         lack of diversity and representation in the Arts, including that set       out in the 2008 McMasters Review (`Supporting excellence in the arts; from       measurement to judgement'), which states `we live in one of the most       diverse societies the world has ever seen, yet this is not reflected in       the culture we produce, or in who is producing it'.
Furthermore, the       creation of a British Asian Muslim as the central character of Guantanamo         Boy was intended to redress the more specific lack of emotionally       challenging theatre work for a diverse teenage audience.
As such, it       addressed the Arts Council England's 2010 goal for every child and young       person to have the opportunity `to experience the richness of the arts by       improving the delivery of arts opportunities for children and young people       and raising the standard of art being produced for, with and by children       and young people'.
The production was initially scheduled for fifteen performances, but high       demand from students from local FE college led to a further three       performances in 2012.
The piece played, on average, to 92% capacity       houses, selling 1387 of a total 1469 tickets available across the duration       of its run between January 2012 and February 2012.
This represented a very       significant achievement in relation to teenage audience development for       the Stratford Circus Arts Centre theatre.
The majority of the audience       were from schools and colleges in Newham, and many were from minority       communities.
The play also acted as a teaching and learning resource,       supporting pupils' attainment of curriculum criteria including those for       Key Stage 4 Citizenship (whose guidelines emphasise a need to understand       concepts of democracy and justice, rights and responsibilities, identities       and diversity through critical thinking and enquiry) and the English       syllabus (which requires students to critically analyse a production and       articulate this effectively) [a].
Eight workshops (total of 80 attendees) and seven post-show discussions       (total of 610 participants) delivered by Hingorani between January 2012       and March 2012 to accompany the production of Guantanamo Boy       further enhanced and extended its impacts on theatre participation among       young and culturally diverse audiences.
Workshop participants ranged from       secondary school and FE students.
The sessions were held in boroughs such       as Tower Hamlets and Stratford, which are among the most diverse boroughs       in the country; as a result, a high percentage of participants came from       minority community backgrounds.
The sessions enabled students to engage       directly with the ethnically diverse professional cast and production team       of Guantanamo Boy, and encouraged them to remain open to taking       part themselves in future performing arts events [e].
The use of Hingorani's research to engage young and ethnically         diverse audiences with human rights issues through theatre promoting       the representation of minority voices is similarly evident in his       establishment in June 2011 of the Performing Human Rights       symposium, which featured a performance of the play and a post-show panel       discussion.
Attended by 135 young people, this was the first of a series       of symposia organised in association with the Human Rights Lawyers       Association (HRLA), Amnesty International and Penguin Books to accompany       the production of Guantanamo Boy [b].
The event allowed its young       participants to discuss their views on the issues arising from Guantanamo         Boy concerning human rights and their representation.
This,       according to an HRLA barrister involved with the Symposium, led to       `vigorous and eager interaction and engagemnet from the young       audience....I was approached by a number of them afterwards to ask       questions and a number...even wanted to apply for work experience in the       field of Human Rights' [c].
Running alongside the production and tour of Guantanamo         Boy, the symposia brought together representatives of young people's       schools groups, Penguin Spinebreakers, and Youth Amnesty to provide       opportunities for agency and engagement.
A further Performing Human Rights       symposium, sponsored by Middle Temple Hall and Blackstone Chambers, will       be held at Middle Temple Hall, Inns of Court to launch the national tour       of Guantanamo Boy on November 17 2013.
Guantanamo Boy was reviewed and featured in several local and       national press outlets, including the British Theatre Guide, Time         Out, Metro, Sunday Times, Eastern Eye and Reuters       [d].
These ensured the contribution of the play itself (and of the       research underpinning its production) to media discourse both       about British Asian Theatre and about the political issues invoked by the       performance.
The media coverage also helped to extend the reach of the       play's impacts by raising awareness within a wide new constituency of the       existence of theatre work for young audiences addressing the serious       issues raised in Guantanamo Boy and representing the often       marginalised perspectives of characters from the British Asian Muslim       community.
The production tours nationally in November 2013, when it will       appear at the Half Moon Young People' Theatre, London; Hat Factory       Theatre, Luton; Middle Temple Hall, Inns of Court, London; Mercury       Theatre, Colchester; Burnley Arts Centre, The Drum Theatre, Birmingham;       Albany Empire, London.
It aims to attract approximately 3,000 audience       over 32 performances, extending the reach of these benefits to audiences       across the UK.
Hingorani's experience as an actor, writer and theatre director, as well       as his expertise and insights resulting from his academic research, has       also allowed him to lead professional development for emerging theatre         artists from minority community backgrounds through his transfer to       them of expert skills and knowledge.
Since 2008, his expertise in this       field has led to invitations from influential partners including the Royal       Court, the Tamasha Theatre Company [f] and the Old Vic programme to       develop and work with more than 120 emerging theatre practitioners from       minority communities.
Many of those practitioners have since gone on to       create their own theatre work and have it produced.
Projects via which Hingorani has delivered this transfer of expert skills       and knowledge from academia to theatre practitioners have included:       directing rehearsed readings for the Royal Court's 2012 studio and writers       programme; contributions to the Tamasha Theatre Company Developing Artists       programme (2011) and Developing Artist commissions (2012); and leading       Director/Designer workshops through Old Vic New Voices (OVNV), which aims       to nurture talent, develop new work and grow audiences at The Old Vic.
These projects shared a common commitment to the development of work by       artists from minority communities.
A recent conference organised by Hingorani and supported by PALATINE       (Performing Arts Learning and Teaching Innovation Network) facilitated the       further exchange of specialist knowledge between academic researchers from       a number of HEIs, including UEL and Rose Bruford College, and nationally       respected performing arts practitioners in theatre for young audiences,       such as Anna Ledger and Chris Elwell of Half Moon Young People's theatre.
Between February 2011 and July 2011 Hingorani provided expert         consultancy to the Theatre Royal, Stratford East based on his       expertise in critically framing and describing the theatre engagement with       minority communities.
This involved his evaluation and dissemination of       the practice of a verbatim theatre production Mad Blud (2010),       which examined the issue of knife crime and based specifically within the       Black community within Newham.
The consultation was funded by JP Morgan       (sponsors of the theatre production) and the document produced by       Hingorani was used to disseminate Theatre Royal's community theatre       practice to a wider audience as a model for community engagement and       action on social issues.
