     Dr Philip Devine, employed on the Variwave project at Leicester between       1995 and 2000 and then at [text removed for publication] and subsequently       [text removed for publication] states:     `The goal of the "Variwave" project was to advance, what was at the time,       predominantly old fashioned, inefficient, sluggish and large electrical       hardware used to energise ESP's (electrostatic precipitators)...There were       several manufacturers around at the time who were beginning to explore the       issue however, we (Leicester) differed in that     We weren't just "bolstering" an old system by introducing new technology       here and there hoping the net result would be mild improvements in       efficiency and performance like some manufacturers at the time seemed to       be doing (for example introducing inverter technology yet being limited by       low/medium frequency transformer/rectifiers).
Leicester offered a completely innovative solution to the       problem.....(pressurised SF6 gas insulation technology utilised       instead of traditional oil insulation, high frequency ferrite technology       instead of low frequency iron core based technology, innovative       transformer bobbin geometry and materials to minimise lossy parasitic       elements and mitigate against electrical breakdown phenomena , high       frequency (&gt;20kHz) semiconductor switch operation ).
The culmination and goal of the project was to install a high power       prototype in a "real world" installation (...at Didcot power station in       1998...) and conduct successful field trials.... which we did...with       outstanding results......Other teams seemed to be producing only low       power, small scale (purely academic) prototypes without stepping up to the       challenge of addressing the myriad of technical obstacles that realistic       high power, practical systems would need to overcome.
We provided a robust, economical solution.
We ( Leicester ) seemed to       overtake several commercial organisations in that we designed on ( in       comparison to industry) a shoestring budget, on time and delivered a fully       functional prototype solution to industry which proved its potential for       helping shape the technology that would eventually be adopted by key [text       removed for publication]     The approval we received from National Power to install our prototype at       a working coal fired power station and conduct trials was unprecedented       and a major milestone' [A].
Dr Devine further states:       `In 2001 I was approached by [text removed for publication] who were, at       the time, starting to develop a commercial version of an ESP power supply       with all the key qualities that had been previously and independently been       identified by the team at Leicester and built into our prototype.
I was employed by [text removed for publication] purely on the basis of       the research I had undertaken at Leicester.
Although there were       differences between the Leicester prototype and what [text removed for       publication] were hoping to achieve in a commercial product , there was       also striking similarities between the two and [text removed for       publication] were keen to learn how we had approached and solved the same       technical challenges....The [text removed for publication] power supplies       are now in full production.
Later on I worked for [text removed for publication] (2002-2004) both in       the UK and [text removed for publication], I was recruited again, purely       due to my work with Paul (Lefley) at Leicester.
[text removed for       publication] also market a high frequency switched mode ESP supply' [A].
He adds:       `It is fair to say that [text removed for publication] was underpinned by       research at Leicester, via the expertise I contributed to them when I       worked at [text removed for publication] [A].
[text removed for publication] now have 200 units in operation worldwide       [ii].
Leicester's expertise has fed into the development of [text removed       for publication] product, as can be seen from the design of the high       frequency ferrite cored transformer in comparison with the design in our       key paper in 2001 [1].
The Didcot power station prototype proved       conclusively that Leicester had created a robust product with decreased       emissions and an efficiency rating of more than 95 per cent, compared with       around 60 per cent for the previous conventional technology.
Mr Stuart Morgan, Managing Director of [text removed for publication], a       UK-based manufacturer of switched mode power supplies, states [B],       "Power supplies for industrial electrostatic precipitators are a       particular challenge for any designer, combining high frequency and high       power in the power electronics but also with very high voltages.
The       successful combination of these three parameters all at high levels has       been a `Holy Grail' for the power electronics industry.
Through       publications made by the University of Leicester from the late 1990's, we       were interested to learn how the team at Leicester designed their high       voltage transformer, and how that transformer operated with the high       frequency, high power switched-mode electronics.
They achieved that `Holy       Grail' combination in a 70 kW switched-mode power supply running at 20 kHz       and at 50 kV.
The publication in the IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery       was very helpful, and enabled us to choose the direction when pushing the       design boundaries in developing our own high power, high voltage       technology for electrostatic precipitators."
[text removed for       publication]     Switch mode power supply technology has been adopted by [text removed for       publication] since the University of Leicester's research was completed.
In retrospect the University should have patented rather than published in       2001.
High frequency, high voltage, high power SMPS technology has now been       installed in a large number (at least 5000-see [E]) of major       industrial complexes worldwide, and the impact on industrial emissions &#8212;       and therefore air quality surrounding the complexes &#8212; has been       significant.
Exemplar data from one company on the associated reduction in       emissions achieved by 195 switch mode power units installed at boiler       plants worldwide has been around 60 per cent.
(A 60% reduction in       emissions is equivalent to a reduction from 40 mg.m-3 to 16       mg.m-3 of flue gas particulates) [D].
The main points of evidence:     1) Leicester was the first to produce a switched mode power supply with a       combination of high frequency (20 kHz), high voltage (50 kV), and at high       power (70 kW).
(Statement by Genvolt Ltd. [B] and the journal paper       in the IEEE Transactions of Power Delivery 2001 [1]).
2) Dr. Philip Devine's employment with [text removed for publication] [A].
3) Close similarity between the design of the transformer in current       units with the original design in the 2001 journal paper.
