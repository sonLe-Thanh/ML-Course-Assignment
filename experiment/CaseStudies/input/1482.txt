     Overall, the research team's work has promoted awareness of the benefits       of applying novel, `high-end'       techniques in computational modelling to help unravel the complexities and       causalities in the       cited areas of biomedicine.
The group's research described here has had a far-reaching effect, not       just on the academic       community, and not just in the field of mathematics, changing the way       different specialisms can       work together.
Recognising that research papers do not necessarily attract       the attention of medical       practitioners, and the actions of medical practitioners are circumscribed       by protocols overseen by       regulators, our contacts with colleagues, described in more detail below       and cited in Section 5,       have been used to facilitate access to and interaction with clinicians.
In       affecting the perceptions       and approaches of our collaborators we have had an impact on       practitioners, not least by       identifying potentially relevant programmes of testing.
Prof Dr Burkhard Ludewig (one of our co-authors and collaborators) is       Head of the Institute of       Immunology, which is part of the medical research centre and is an       independent research unit of       the Kantonal Hospital St. Gallen, Switzerland.
Research activities are       focussed on       immunopathological processes in the cardiovascular system, the development       of new       immunotherapeutical approaches against cancer, and the biology of       coronaviruses.
The Institute       also supports basic research projects of physicians from the clinical       departments.
Prof Dr Andreas Meyerhans (another collaborator and co-author with       Bocharov) is group leader of       the Infection Biology Group at UPF, Barcelona with research interests in       virus evolution;       lymphocyte responses in persistent human infections (HIV, HCV, CMV and       Mycobacterium       tuberculosis).
His group's work is in two main areas:            describing fundamental features in virus evolution i.e.
the         characteristics of HIV quasispecies,         HIV and HBV hypermutation and HIV multi-infection of single cells in         vivo.
quantifying human T cell responses in viral (HIV, CMV, poliovirus),         bacterial (Mycobacterium         tuberculosis) and yeast (Candida albicans, etc.)
infections directly         from the blood of patients.
Part         of the work is funded by 2 international grants from the Bill and         Melinda Gates foundation and the         EU euco.net programme.
Burkhard Ludewig (see Section 5) wrote of the ongoing joint work:     "Changed perceptions arising from the work of Bocharov and his         co-workers [...] relate to issues of         cause-and-effect in the complex pathological states encountered in real         life illness.
Ultimately,         though (because of the natural conservatism in applied medicine) not in         the short term this should         lead to increased understanding of the effects of clinical treatment         procedures and the discovery of         new or changing forms of medication in specific therapeutic         interventions.
The recent FDA approval of the prostate cancer drug PROVENGE       [approved in 2010] shows that         such developments are possible.
A recent paper "A model of dendritic         cell therapy for melanoma",         by DePillis, Gallegos, and Radunskaya (2013) in Frontiers in Oncology         was based heavily on the         model that was introduced in the paper Ludewig et al.
(2004) cited above       [in Section 3]; this will         further extend the impact of our work."
Likewise, Andreas Meyerhans (see Section 5) expresses the view that that       the Chester group's       work has contributed to changed perceptions.
The HIV-1 research (Bocharov et al., 2005) has had an impact on       biomedical researchers working       on the design of therapeutic interventions in HIV infections.
Firstly, it       has directed attention towards       a closer examination of the role of multi-infection/recombination in the       viral evolution in infected       individuals.
Secondly, it has identified the scenario in which the       recombination may accelerate the       emergence of multi-drug resistance by 10-fold, and thirdly, it has led to       the establishment (since       2008) of a research initiative for further integrative analysis by a       multi-disciplinary consortium       based upon two teams in Barcelona.
Both involve mathematicians and one       includes specialists in       clinical aspects of HIV infection.
Beyond direct interaction with clinicians and immunologists, further       tools for securing an impact of       the research on the community include: (a) a series of well-advertised       public lectures, which       induced interest in this cross-disciplinary activity at the University of       Chester, was delivered to an       audience including medical practitioners, (b) related research       publications (Section 3 details six       papers on this theme).
