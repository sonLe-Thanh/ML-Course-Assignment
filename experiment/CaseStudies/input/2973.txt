     Research Impact via Cadbury: The research commissioned by       Cadbury/Kraft presaged       significant changes in Cadbury's strategies and the support provided to       cocoa farming       communities, alongside wider spillover impacts for cocoa cooperatives,       farmers, consumers, allied       companies and UK Fairtrade sales.
In the words of Kraft's VP       (Sustainability and External Affairs) it       "provided a catalyst for a number of changes in the strategy of         Cadbury/Kraft, with important         implications for the cocoa farmers and communities from whom we source"       [1].
Findings from the       Ghana project were presented by Cadbury in 2008, receiving over 100 press       citations       internationally including: the BBC [2], the Economist [3] and the       Financial Times [4].
The       Dominican Republic study was publicly announced by Green &amp; Blacks       (owned by Cadbury/Kraft) in       2011, and cited in the Guardian in March 2011 [5].
The India study and       Overview Report was       made publicly available in 2013.
Impact 1: Intervention Fund: Based on Barrientos's research       findings and recommendations,       Cadbury launched the &#163;45 million Cadbury Cocoa Partnership (CCP) to       support cocoa growing       communities over the following 10 years [4].
Pointing to [C] in       particular, Cadbury/Kraft's Director of       Agriculture and Conformance, at the time, confirms that:     "The breadth of scope within the research was valuable in building the         broad strategy while         the methodology of the research helped create the stakeholder engagement         in Ghana         which ultimately led to the Cocoa Partnership with the Ghanaian         Government, farming         organizations, farmers, development experts and Cadbury working together         to strengthen         the cocoa sector...
The report was essential to the Board of Cadbury in         2008 in deciding to         commit &#163;45m million over 10 years to the Cocoa Partnership and         Fairtrade, and in         positioning agricultural development as core to Cadbury and now Kraft         Foods wider supply         chain strategy."
Moreover, he notes that CCP followed the researchers' recommended `bottom       up' approach,       "develop[ing] into a great working example of a         multi-stakeholder program that increasingly         development commentators are advocating... fundamentally driven from the         research findings and         methodology" [6].
The CCP involved Cadbury working in partnership       with local government and       non-government organisations and via the identification of initiatives for       support at local and       community levels, providing initial support to 100 villages/communities in       Ghana, with further       expansion planned to 200 communities [1][7].
In Ghana, Cadbury estimates       CCP has contributed       to a 20 percent increase in cocoa yields, a 200 percent increase in       household incomes and an 80       percent increase in government-backed development projects in the first       phases of the project       (2009-2011) [8].
This was accompanied by allied increases in local       training and investment [6] with       CCP later rolled out in the Dominican Republic and India [1].
Impact 2: Fairtrade Sourcing: Based on commercial value chain       analysis the research       recommended the generation of greater value chain returns to farmers.
In       2009 Cadbury converted       its main chocolate lines to certified Fairtrade, including Dairy Milk and       Green &amp; Blacks in 2011       [6][7], with Kraft "now the world's largest buyer of Fairtrade         Certified cocoa and Fairtrade Organic         cocoa", buying over 20,000 tonnes of Fairtrade cocoa from Ghana       alone, as well as expanding       Fairtrade cocoa sales from Cote d'Ivoire [1].
Moreover, Cadbury       now pays over &#163;3 million per         annum in social premiums to Kuapa Kokoo &#8212; a Fairtrade       certified Cooperative with a membership       of 50,000 small-scale farmers in Ghana [1] with Cadbury/Kraft Fairtrade       chocolate products now       sold to worldwide market (including the UK, Ireland, Australia, New       Zealand, Canada and South       Africa) [1][7].
Research Impact via Kraft/ Mondel&#275;z: Following Kraft's 2010       takeover of Cadbury, the       incorporated company organised a workshop in London attended by Kraft       Foods at which UoM       and its country researcher partners presented findings and recommendations       from the three       studies.
This helped to persuade Kraft of the importance of the research       findings, the uniqueness       of the approach, and the significant contribution of the CCP [6].
It was       attended by 45 invited       participants including senior representatives from Kraft in the USA,       Cadbury, CCP, government       and NGO stakeholders.
As Cadbury's Director of Agriculture and       Conformance, at the time, later       confirmed: "The event was successful in that it had the effect of         helping to persuade Kraft to         continue supporting CCP, as well as seeking to embed `good practice         throughout its supply chain"       [6]; and as Kraft/Mondel&#275;z noted some time after the event: "[the]       Cadbury Cocoa Partnership         commitment has been maintained by Kraft and forms [the] basis for         new cocoa strategy within         Kraft.
Programmes will be extended to other key origins for the Kraft         business e.g.
Cote d'Ivoire,         Brazil... [with the] Ghana report in particular used to inform         Kraft and secure their support for the         investment" [1], with the Director of Mondel&#275;z International's       `Cocoa Life' programme adding that       the roundtable event had the effect of "demonstrating that the         partnership was founded upon         robust and independent research" [9].
Impact 3: Additional Support in Dominican Republic: Based on the       Dominican Republic study,       Kraft Foods committed a further &#163;400K per annum &#8212; for the next       eight years &#8212; to support cocoa       farmers supplying Green &amp; Blacks under the Cocoa Partnership [5], In       2011 it converted Green &amp;       Blacks full range of chocolate and beverages to Fairtrade, increasing the       percentage of Fairtrade       sales from Dominican Republic sourced cocoa [1].
Impact 4: Launch of `Cocoa Life' Following corporate restructuring       by Kraft Foods in 2011/12,       Cadbury now came under the Mondel&#275;z International branding.
Based       upon ongoing research       evidence, generated by Barrientos and colleagues, the CCP continued to be       supported, and in       2012 Mondel&#275;z launched the `Cocoa Life' programme, a US$400       million initiative that builds       directly on the CCP, and aims to extend support to over 200,000 cocoa       farmers and 1 million       people in their communities internationally over the period 2012-2022 [8].
It was recognised by       Mondel&#275;z that "the reports on the Dominican Republic and India         have added to the initial 2008         work in Ghanaian cocoa production...
The reports by Professor Barrientos         and her team provide         the foundation for Cocoa Life in terms of the principles, approach and         goals for the program... We         look forward to continuing to work with Professor Barrientos, on our         Cocoa Life journey" [9].
Impact 5: Spill-over Impacts for Fairtrade Chocolate: The impact       of UoM research has been felt       across the industry as a whole, demonstrating its broad applicability.
Nestl&#233; and Mars have       launched cocoa programmes similar to CCP, and have converted parts of       their product ranges to       Fairtrade (including KitKat in 2010, and Maltesers in 2011) [7].
This       replication was recognised by       Kraft who noted that: "Following [the] Cadbury Fairtrade         commitment, Mars and Nestle made         commitments to Fairtrade and other certification," and more       specifically: "Cadbury Cocoa         Partnership was the first major chocolate company commitment to         long-term investment in         sustainability.
Mars, Nestle and other companies have since upped their         focus on sustainability         and their public commitments" [1].
Jointly, Cadbury/Kraft, Nestl&#233;       and Mars have contributed to a       more than 8-fold increase in Fairtrade cocoa products sold in the UK, from       &#163;25.6 million in 2008 to       &#163;320.9 million in 2012.
In addition, UK sales of Fairtrade chocolate rose       from 1% of total chocolate       sales in 2008 to 12% in 2012 [7][10].
Moreover, the Fairtrade Foundation       recognise:     "The decision by Cadbury to work with the Fairtrade movement, we         believe has created a         wider catalytic effect in a number of ways...
It enabled Fairtrade to         start to reach a wider         consumer base, beyond the `ethical shopper'...
It sent a signal to the         chocolate industry         that Fairtrade could indeed work at scale... and demonstrated Fairtrade         as a credible         partner to major multinational brands on sustainability initiatives with         a reach of tens of         thousands of farmers.... For Kuapa Kokoo, it has enabled them to         reposition themselves         within the Ghanaian cocoa industry as a major player in cocoa production         and export, no         longer a niche/alternative supply chain partner.
It has provided them         with a significant         revenue stream that enables them, for example, to become a partner in         the Government's         Swollen Shoots cocoa agronomy programme."
[7]     Barrientos and Mondelez are currently planning future research       around gender and cocoa       production.
[9].
This has implications for the wider research field, Kraft       recognising that: "the         research has fundamentally shifted the way development experts see the         development agenda,         specifically in Ghana but arguably now beyond in terms of working with         smallholder famers and         engaging with those most marginalized and not likely to be in any framer         organization" [6].
