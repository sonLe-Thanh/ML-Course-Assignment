     The Independent Review Body (IRB) research [1] impacted upon legislation       and policies, and upon       strategies for flood prevention and response, at both the national and       regional scales.
In national legislative contexts, the research impacted with significance       and reach:       Coulthard briefed Pitt and his team formally, at length and in person on       their Hull visit in 2007.
The       IRB reports fed directly into the subsequent Pitt Review (2008) [2].
Coulthard also influenced       legislation via evidence to a House of Commons select committee on       flooding (on 14 November       2007) [3].
As a result of this input, IRB recommendations can be traced       through `The Flood and       Water Management Act' (2010) and into subsequent government initiatives.
In particular:            the formation of the &#163;7.7 million National Flood Forecasting Centre         (FFC) in April 2009 provided         a mechanism for warning of surface water (pluvial) flooding.
The IRB's         first recommendation         highlighted the lack of a robust national system for pluvial flood         warning [1, p.3].
This         recommendation was repeated in the Pitt Report and then addressed by the         creation of the         FFC.
In December 2008 the Government also provided &#163;8.5 million to         improve the Environment         Agency's flood warning and mapping, and &#163;7 million for other flood         protection [4];       the Flood and Water Management Act (2010) also gives the Environment         Agency overall         responsibility for all flooding (including surface water flooding) in         the UK.
Local authorities are         now responsible for the control of regional surface water drainage         (under the Environment         Agency's auspices).
This change responded to the IRB's third         recommendation that there         should be one lead agency for flood events [1, p.3].
This shift in         responsibilities is implemented         through the production of `Surface Water Management Plans' (SWMPs):         coherent, integrated         plans to address flood risk and management in areas of high flood-risk         [5].
The Government's         December 2008 funding package also provided &#163;15 million to improve         coordination between         local authorities in flood response [4].
The beneficiaries of these changes are potentially all communities and       infrastructure at risk of any       kind of flooding.
Indeed, public interest in this topic is considerable       and the IRB attracted significant       national media attention including coverage by the BBC 1 6 o'clock       and 10 o'clock News (24       August 2007; 21 November 2007); three documentaries, including Channel 4's       Dispatches (3       December 2007); and BBC 1 Look North (25 September 2009; 25 June       2010; 13 June 2011).
This       coverage also demonstrates the reach of this research's impact.
In term of flood prevention and response strategies, the IRB research       also impacted with both       significance and reach at the regional scale.
Hull City Council adopted all recommendations of the final IRB report,         with implementation from         1 January 2008 [6].
New measures include regular meetings by         stakeholders in regional flood         risk (including Hull City Council, adjacent local authorities, the         Environment Agency and         Yorkshire Water).
Hull City Council consulted the IRB authors         extensively about this process         and Coulthard participated in early rounds of this local flood         governance and management.
The IRB also shaped a report into the floods by OFWAT &#8212; the national         water regulator.
The         OFWAT report drew heavily on the IRB research and noted that it was         "committed to review the         issues that the Hull Independent Review Body report raised" [7].
OFWAT         therefore demanded         responses from Yorkshire Water about their failure to prevent the         flooding.
This public scrutiny,         and the explanation, accountability and actions that OFWAT demanded from         Yorkshire Water,         were driven by the IRB research [7].
In turn, Yorkshire Water had advance sight of the final IRB report         and, on 23 November 2007,         two days after it was published, they made a public promise of a &#163;16         million investment to         improve Hull's pumping stations (investment began in February 2008) [7].
We believe our         scrutiny of Yorkshire Water in the high profile IRB report prompted this         quick response.
The Surface Water Management Plans (SWMPs) required by `The Flood and         Water         Management Act' (2010) also generated local impacts.
Hull was one of         five SWMP trial areas         (and Coulthard sat on the steering committee) [8].
SWMPs responded to         the call for connected         governance and planning that the IRB advocated (and which informed Pitt         and the 2010 Act).
As a result, the Hull SWMP is a robust plan for regional flood risk and         management [9].
The         document includes information directed at investors and developers so         that they may         incorporate flood risk into their planning.
The SWMP also notes the         projected savings in future         floods, if the SWMP recommendations are adopted.
For the Derringham Ward         in Hull alone         these savings range from &#163;1 million to &#163;15 million [9: Hull SWMP 2009,         p.40].
The IRB also recommended creating `Aqua Green' sites of open space         that would temporarily         retain surplus water in flood scenarios.
Hull City Council adopted this         recommendation and         commenced a &#163;330,000 pilot project to produce these sites in December         2008 [10].
The UK floods of 2007 damaged over 55,000 homes and cost an estimated &#163;3       billion in insurance       claims and costs [2].
In Hull, one person died and the community, public       and business sector all       suffered financially.
Damage to council houses and schools totalled &#163;200       million, 1,300 businesses       were affected and school closures cost an estimated &#163;2.4 million for       114,400 lost school days [1,       p.5, p.16].
The changes to regional flood defences and pumping stations       recommended by the IRB       resulted in more than &#163;16 million being invested into Hull's       water-management infrastructure.
These measures reassured the insurance sector and, by extension,       development can continue in       this flood-risk area.
This will all benefit local communities and       businesses &#8212; but this very significant       impact is outweighed still more by the savings promised by preventing       future floods and their costs.
Although the IRB research might at first appear limited to the region, it       nevertheless impacted on       national policy and legislation.
This happened due to the IRB identifying       deficiencies in the       structures of UK-wide flood management, and due to its recommendations       being included in the       Pitt Report and leading to major changes in national flood risk management       and governance.
The       IRB research was designed to be policy relevant.
Our impact therefore       stretched across the       national and regional scales and had both reach and significance at each.
