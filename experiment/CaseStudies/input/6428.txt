     Principal beneficiaries: Those who develop policy and guidance on       issues such as internet safety, bullying and PSHE; teenagers and their       teachers; wider society, particularly parents and families who face new       challenges in understanding and supporting young people's ethical uses of       mobile technology in an increasingly digital culture.
Date of impact: 2008-13, with particularly high impact in 2012,       with the NSPCC `sexting' study and, in 2013, with the influential speech       by Diane Abbott MP to the Fabian Women's Network critiquing and       challenging the `pornification' of British society.
Reach and significance: The research struck a popular chord       because so little was understood by the adult world about youth, gender       and sexuality in the digital age.
Ringrose's findings made it clear that       school policies and curriculum, including PSHE sessions, needed to do       more.
The research has raised awareness of these issues across the UK and       internationally, inspiring further studies in several countries and       considerable debate &#8212; including substantial media coverage in UK, USA,       Canada and Australia.
It has informed guidelines, resources, government       and third sector reports and ministerial thinking.
Ultimately, it could       help girls and boys to resist sexual bullying and pressure.
Its impact has       been instrumental1 (affecting policy and practice) and conceptual         (sparking public debate and greater political awareness).
Conceptual impact: Ever since her research on teen girls and       social networking was first profiled in the TES in 2008 &#8212; and followed up       in a range of national broadsheets &#8212; Ringrose has walked a careful and       successful path through the media minefield.
Given the nature of her       subjects &#8212; which could easily spark salacious coverage &#8212; she has       overwhelmingly achieved the `right' kind of impact.
Working with press       officers at the IOE, and later the NSPCC, she has led a sensitive public       discourse on uncomfortable subjects, resulting in generally positive       messages about the need for gender equality in schools and society.
Partly       because of this responsible and measured, but substantial, press coverage,       she developed a profile as expert adviser on girlhood and `sexualisation',       leading to much of the impact detailed below.
Public engagement: Diane Abbott: Ringrose was       invited to meet the MP after an aide drew Abbott's attention to the Huffington         Post's report on her book Postfeminist Education (R1).
Drawing heavily on Ringrose's research and recommendations, the then       shadow health minister called for a "revolution" in sex education to       combat Britain's emerging "hypersexualised culture".
"We need to start a       national conversation between parents and their children about sex,       pornography and technology", she said.
Abbott credited Ringrose's ideas:       "Today's speech was inspired by academic Dr Jessica Ringrose who argues in       her book Postfeminist Education that sexually active school girls       are often `slut shamed' and bullied by their peers", noted at least one       newspaper (see impact source S6).
A Google search finds       tens of thousands of references to Abbott's `pornification' speech,       including coverage in every major UK news outlet, worldwide coverage and       intense debate in the blogosphere.
The BBC's report alone received 579       comments and the Guardian's report a further 255.
The Huffington Post       article attracted 336 comments on its website.
The speech resulted in       extensive public engagement with Ringrose's findings and ideas.
Media and seminars: Ringrose has appeared in such outlets       as BBC Radio Woman's Hour and Elle Magazine (UK), and was academic adviser       to a Panorama television programme, which also interviewed her.
She has participated in numerous seminars and conferences, speaking to       multiple stakeholders.
These include keynoting for a Welsh Government       conference for teachers and students on `Children, Sexuality and       Sexualisation' (2011), the UK Council for Psychotherapy's child and       adolescent therapy conference (2012) and the All Wales Sexual Health       Network conference (2013).
She convened a cutting edge international       conference for practitioners, campaigners, activists and academics on       `pornification' at the IOE in 2011.
Impact on policy: Ringrose has advised on reports and reviews in       the UK and Europe since 2008.
Her research was cited 16 times in the 2010 Home Office report, The           Sexualisation of Young People, on which she was an Expert Advisor         (S5).
Its author, Linda Papadopoulos, confirms that Ringrose's         research (e.g.
R5) and advice helped shape recommendations for         schools on sexualisation, sexual bullying and gender equality.
"Her         groundbreaking research on how young people use and interact on social         networking sites and her discussions of how to address sexual         cyber-bullying through the views of young people helped shape the         recommendations around new media technology", Papadopoulos adds (S4).
The Sexualisation report had a significant influence on policy         and government attitudes to sexualisation.
Ringrose served on the Advisory Group for the Scottish Parliament         report: Sexualised Goods Aimed at Children (2010).
She was a founding member of the Equalities Office 'Campaign for Body         Confidence' which has influenced policies on health and gender and         well-being in schools (since 2011).
Ringrose has also advised many charities on these issues, as outlined       below.
`Sexting': In 2011, because of her growing       reputation as a Government adviser on childhood sexualisation, she was       invited to lead a project for the NSPCC (R2).
The research was       launched in Parliament through invitation from Claire Perry MP and       Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone and was widely reported.
By July 31       2013, the report had been downloaded nearly 2000 times from the NSPCC       website and was posted on many others.
The charity re-drafted its policy       recommendations in its wake, calling for "all professionals to receive       training in the latest technology so that they are better equipped to deal       with sexting" and arguing that "secondary schools and the communications       industry should give young people better protection through education       which promotes considerate, respectful relationships".
The study's finding       that young people would value more opportunities to discuss these issues       with their parents helped to inform an NSPCC campaign designed to help       parents help younger children stay safe (S9).
In addition:            The UK Safer Internet Centre has cited the research as critical in         understanding how younger children are using digital media, while         participating in the report's launch prompted the Child Exploitation and         Online Protection (CEOP) Centre to call for research with younger         children.
The study is a resource on Public Health England's Child and Maternal         Health Intelligence Network, which supports policy-makers,         commissioners, managers and regulators.
Vodafone's Digital Parenting website and magazine cite         Ringrose in their `sexting' advice (S7).
NSPCC discussed the report's findings in its submission to the Home         Affairs Select Committee's inquiry on E-Crime (2012-13).
Ringrose advised on the Family Lives report, All of our concern:           commercialisation, sexualisation and hypermasculinity (2012),         which made extensive use of the findings.
YWCA Scotland used the research in its submission to a Scottish         Parliamentary select committee inquiry into teen pregnancy.
The Australian government linked to the report on its Institute of         Family Studies website (S1).
The study is cited in several submissions to a legal `sexting' inquiry         in Victoria, Australia (S2).
Impact on practice and resources: Ringrose's work has underpinned     school resources, national guidance and an OU teaching film.
TeenBoundaries:     As a consultant for the UK charity Family Lives, Ringrose's body of research     has influenced its TeenBoundaries sex and relationships education workshops,     which have benefitted more than 7,000 young people aged 11-18.
In 2012, the     charity used the NSPCC report to re-tool its resources for schools,     designing two new workshops to address `sexting' and pornography, "two of     the biggest challenges facing young people in today's society", according to     the charity (S3).
By July 2013, these lessons had reached more than     2500 students and 400 professionals attended workshops.
National guidance: Ringrose's research helped underpin the       first government-supported guidance for schools on `sexting', published in       March 2013 and she was also consulted.
The pack, which was prepared by       CEOP and Securus, the manufacturer of child protection software, in       collaboration with the DfE, Medway Council and several teaching       organisations and charities, points to the double-standards highlighted in       the NSPCC study (S8).
Additional resources: The PSHE Association published a       briefing on the NSPCC report; the Sex Education Forum (UK) cites it as a       resource; and Optimus Education, an online hub for school leaders,       published an extensive review of the study in its news bulletin (S10),       recommending that its readers "download the full report and use it for       staff meeting discussions".
The report informed freelance trainer Aylssa       Cowell's workshops, attended by some 50 teachers, social workers, youth       workers and school nurses between July 2012 and May 2013.
Cowell used the       research to create a card game for discussing relationships and sexuality       in a safe way.
Organisations linking to the report include Digital       Disruption, an education project promoting digital judgment skills, and       CRUSH, a charity supporting young people suffering or at risk of domestic       abuse.
In spring 2013, teaching union ATL commissioned Ringrose and a       colleague to help develop new video resources on `sexting', heralding the       next generation of materials on this important topic.
