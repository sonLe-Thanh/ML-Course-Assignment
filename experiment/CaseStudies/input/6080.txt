     Underpinning of impact:       The set of discoveries, technical and aesthetic, arising out of being a       pioneer in the project of using the naturally diaristic possibilities of       the Internet to create and distribute a coherent yet diverse sequence of       moving image works.
An increasing facility with digital techniques and equipment used for       this and the experience of the use of a wide range of soft and hardware       including pocket devices.
Extent of the impact:            Parts of the sequence have been shown offline in a wide variety of         contexts, both galleries and screenings, at venues including the Hong         Kong Contemporary Art Fair, as part of the UK Cultural Olympiad and at         film festivals including the Festival Internacional de Videoarte in         Argentina, the Madatac festival in Madrid, the Cologne Conference and         several Berlin Director's Lounge events in Germany (see REF2).
Work on the sequence has "seeded" other projects, both         personal/artistic and "applied".
In particular the "applied" projects         include a number of Arts Council/Creative Partnerships/A New Direction         funded projects in London schools.
The outcomes include &#8212; the use of         short videos as part of a series of maths centred computer games made         together with young people, a documentary, made in collaboration with a         single class of primary school children, and following their science         education over the course of a year and an adaptation of an Icelandic         Saga to make a film using the very grown up methods of Straub/Huillet to         work with two classes of 8/9 year olds.
Approximately 250 children, 25         members of staff and 500 parents were directly involved in either the         activities or viewing their outcomes, a figure multiplied by the         distribution of the pieces on DVD and CD ROM.
Copies of the DVDs of         these outcomes are available on request.
Particular educational (outside of HE) outcomes of the         application of these techniques and experience have been that the         technology has proved to make inclusiveness easier.
The work has also         impacted upon fully comprehensive groups i.e.
children with leaning         and/or behaviour difficulties, children with little or no command of         English have always been fully engaged.
The bulk of this work has been         in London schools but Szpakowski has also conducted moving image based         work at the 20-21 visual arts centre in Scunthorpe working with various         groups from families to young offenders.
Feedback collected from young         participants from Primary Schools has been very positive and they have         stated that their participation in the work has aided them to improve         their learning.
The work has fed into "applied" video work for Tell Tale Hearts         Childrens' Theatre Company both in the use of video within         performance and in creating video pieces that both document and extend         footage of performances, to be used by the company for archiving         and publicity purposes.
The touring piece `Beneath the Waves' used video         projection within the performance in quite complex ways including         interaction of the performers with pre-recorded video.
Being able to         conceive and troubleshoot this sort of work was made a great deal easier         by the wide palette and experience arising from the Scenes of Provincial         Life.
Particularly , the piece `Beneath the Waves' toured to an audience         of approximately 2,200 on the pilot (Yorkshire) tour and 7,200 on the         subsequent national tour       In terms of personal/artistic work the "Scenes of Provincial Life"         have in turn fed into the video component of another of Szpakowsi's         project "12 remixes" (see REF2) and has inspired Szpakowski's         journalistic work as co-curator and editor of the online resource         DVblog: http://dvblog.org/?author=2         ( 60 more pages follow by using "prev" link).
Since late 2006 to the         date of writing (7th November 2013) there have been over 32,000,000         successful page requests on DVblog and a summary of the long-term report         for the site from December 2006 is as follows (figures in parentheses         refer to the 7-day period ending Nov 06 2013 at 2:46 AM):                 Successful requests: 32,073,396 (44,801)       Average successful requests per day: 12,663 (6,400)       Successful requests for pages: 23,763,929 (35,938)       Average successful requests for pages per day: 9,382 (5,133)       Failed requests: 5,892,040 (374)       Redirected requests: 269,479 (201)       Requests with informational status code: 1 (0)       Data transferred: 7.88 terabytes (15.81 gigabytes)       Average data transferred per day: 3.19 gigabytes (2.26 gigabytes)          It's important to emphasise that the success of DVblog has depended          directly upon informed commentary on new work by those (Szpakowski       and co-curator, Israeli artist Doron Golan) themselves involved at the       cutting edge of making related work.
In Szpakowski case the discoveries       from "Scenes of Provincial Life" have created a conceptual and       terminological framework for a new area of critical activity.
