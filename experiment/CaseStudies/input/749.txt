     Our research has been influential on the YJB.
For example, in 2008 the       YJB published `Assessment, Planning Interventions and Supervision:         Source Document', to accompany YJB guidance on the `Assessment,         Planning Interventions and Supervision', citing two criticisms from       the Swansea work (citing R2 page 93; in YJB 2008 page 12), asserting that       risk assessment in the YJS has become: too individualised `by focusing         on individual, family, school and peer group influences and neglecting         the role of wider structural and socio-political factors.
'; and too       insensitive `to individual, social and temporal differences relating         to age, gender, ethnicity, socio- economic status, local area, country,         type of offending...and cultural, political or historical context.'
Making direct further reference to R2, the YJB encouraged practitioners       and managers to improve their assessment and intervention practice by       taking `more account of the social and cultural context of young         people's lives' (YJB 2008 page 12) and through `the qualitative,         appreciative investigation of young people's experiences, aspirations'       (R2 page 102; in YJB 2008 page 49).
In 2009, Haines and Case's critique of RFR and the application of the       RFPP in youth justice was published as a monograph under the title `Understanding         Youth Offending: Risk Factor Research, Policy and Practice' (R1).
Prior to and post publication we engaged with the Chief Executive of the       YJB in a series of informal discussions about the findings emerging from       the research underpinning the book, which precipitated his decision to       instigate a review of current policy and practice.
In an email dated April       1st, 2010, the Chief Executive of the YJB stated that,       following his reading of R1, he now believed that `Clearly this is a       moment to pause and think about the fundamentals that underpin our [YJB]       approach to assessment'.
This was followed in June 2010 with invitations       to Haines and Case to contribute to a `YJB Seminar' (along with six other       academics and the Chief Executive, Director of Performance and Director of       Strategy for the YJB) to explore the future of the YJB's assessment and       intervention framework.
As a consequence, in April 2011, the YJB initiated       a formal review of the existing assessment and intervention framework for       the YJS, in which Haines and Case were subsequently invited to       participate, including reviewing a draft of the YJB's proposals for a new       assessment and intervention planning framework entitled `Assessment and         Planning Interventions: review and redesign project.
Statement of         intent: Proposed framework' (YJB 2011).
Culminating in its new `AssetPlus' assessment and intervention framework       (YJB, 2011), the YJB proposes to abandon the RFPP and its reliance on RFR.
In doing so the YJB now rejects the central propositions of RFR that it is       possible to identify risk factors in the lives of young people and target       these factors to reduce (re-)offending &#8212; the central critique we advanced       in R1.
To replace the RFPP, the YJB's new framework proposes that       interventions with young people should be based on, inter alia,       enhanced levels of engagement with them in assessing their needs and       aspirations, a clear focus on current life circumstances and interventions       which are focused on supporting young people in achieving positive future       outcomes &#8212; the arguments we have advanced in several publications (e.g.
R1-R6) A letter from the Chief Executive of the YJB to Professor Haines       (dated June 17th, 2011) stated:     `The research and publications of Haines and Case ...made a significant       contribution to the YJB's review of the Scaled Approach.
Your critique ...       was influential in the review process...your research was particularly       important in highlighting the potential pitfalls of relying over-heavily       on limited research evidence and in adopting a too deterministic framework       for youth justice policy and practice...Your research, alongside some       other key pieces of research, was also extremely informative in re-shaping       the YJB's new proposed framework for youth justice'.
A wide range of specific proposals in YJB (2011) can be directly traced       to outputs from the Swansea research, including: a) the YJB's new emphasis       on the strengths of young people and on factors which support/hinder       desistance from offending, notably `interventions targeted on those       aspects of young people's lives that promote positive and pro-social       behaviour', is, in part, drawn from Swansea research, which evidences the       importance of interventions that enhance enabling factors/strengths and       promote positive behaviour (e.g.
R1, R3-R6), b) the YJB's recognition that       there should be a clearer distinction between the identification of need       and the likelihood of reoffending, such that `need and risk should be       separately considered and both addressed', draws on our critique of the       ill-advised conflation of criminogenic needs with welfare needs (e.g.
R1,       R2), c) that the `link between assessed level of risk and the scale and       nature of intervention [is] too prescriptive' is based on Swansea research       which demonstrates the methodological weaknesses of a wide corpus of RFR       and the inability of RFR to demonstrate causal linkages between risks and       offending (R1), d) the need for `redefining and clarifying the notion of       `risk'' follows from Swansea research which has provided a critique of the       definitional ambiguities surrounding the conception and measurement of       risk and how this produces a false confidence in the validity of empirical       research evidence from RFR (e.g.
R1, R2), e) recognition that `the `one       size fits all' approach is too restricted and greater flexibility in the       assessment process is required' and `the range of risk factors included in       Asset and the Scaled Approach are overly limited and that       non-individualised factors should be taken into account', draws on Swansea       research which has evidenced the consequences of the overly-prescriptive,       inflexible, psycho-social, aggregated and decontextualized approach to       assessment and intervention pursued within RFR and by the YJS (e.g.
R1,       R2, R5; see also Case 2010), and f) the need for assessments of young       people which are far more iterative and dynamic than at present, offering       `greater scope for professional judgment and assessment', such that       `assessments and interventions should be.. part of a dynamic process' and       a `greater recognition of the importance of the views of young people' in       the assessment and planning process, draws on Swansea research which has       evidenced the value of increasing practitioner discretion and in assessing       young people in a more holistic, contextualized and qualitative manner       based, in part, on enhanced participation by and engagement of young       people (e.g.
R1, R2).
The YJB's `Assessment and Planning Interventions: review and redesign         project.
Statement of intent: Proposed framework' (YJB 2011), now       named `AssetPlus', rejects the over-reliance on RFR and notions of risk       that have hitherto dominated youth justice policy and practice.
In its       place a new framework focused on individualisation and promoting positive       behaviour based on future oriented objectives has been proposed.
Swansea       research has been instrumental in bringing about both of the above       changes.
The YJB's proposal and the case for change has been accepted by       Ministers and the Ministry of Justice (in June 2012) and on 28/02/2013 the       YJB announced formal Cabinet Office approval for `AssetPlus'       implementation in YOSs &#8212; piloting commencing in March 2013.
When fully       implemented, the new framework and AssetPlus will radically change the       orientation of the work of staff in Youth Offending Services across       England and Wales, and will significantly alter interventions with the       approximately 50,000 (59,335 young people were sentenced in 2011/12) young       people who enter the YJS every year, bringing about a shift away from       retrospective risk onto a clear focus on enhancing positive outcomes for       young people.
