     This case study considers the evidence of reach and impact on teacher       professional development, educational decision-making and classroom       practice in the schools directly involved at the time, as well as on       organisations that adopted the approach after reading about the project.
Dissemination strategy: Immediately after and during the project       lifetime (2005-7), dissemination took place at the local level through the       following channels:            Ongoing development of children's and teachers' practices related to         children's participation and decision-making through meetings at the six         schools directly involved.
In Service Training Sessions in local schools given by teachers in the         research team.
The project team published a report (see reference 3) and organised         conferences attended by head-teachers and teachers to disseminate ideas         and approaches.
A conference was organised by the children, teachers and researchers         in order for children in the six different schools to share the research         findings.
The UEA researchers were interviewed by local radio about the project.
In 2007, in order to reach a national audience, CfBT Education Trust       commissioned the team to produce a guide for teachers/educational decision       makers across the UK (distributed in hard copy and on CfBT Education       Trust's website:       http://cdn.cfbt.com/~/media/cfbtcorporate/files/research/2007/r-children-decide-2007.pdf).
The project was also profiled in a Times Educational Supplement feature       (`From tiny decisions, great leaders grow', April 2007, see source 2).
In       2007, Cox shared the approach with teachers and children in six primary       schools in New Zealand.
In 2006, Cox and Robinson-Pant obtained ESRC       funding for a seminar series on `Children as Decision Makers', bringing       the project into international policy and practice contexts through       involving researchers, activists and policy- makers (including       Non-Governmental Organisations: Forum for Popular Education Nepal, Oxfam       GB, People's Action Forum Zambia, EveryChild, and Diganter India).
A       substantial set of materials was developed into an edited book published       by Continuum (reference 5).
Nature of the impact: In the period 2008-2013, we identify the       impact of Children Decide in relation to its two differing but       interconnected aims.
With regard to enhancing children's participation         in educational decision-making, there is evidence of on-going impact       on how teachers involve children in decision-making within their schools       and classrooms in the local area.
This was particularly so in schools       where the research was intensively carried out: a teacher commented that       the approach is embedded as it still influenced school council activities,       with children taking more responsibility for their own learning (source       3).
Impact after 2008 was also noted by those who had attended       dissemination events, read the CfBT report or engaged with the research at       the later ESRC seminar series.
A head teacher who attended a dissemination       conference in 2007 reported the impact of the approach on the development       of their Early Years curriculum (see source 4).
The director of an       educational NGO working in Zambia who attended the ESRC seminar series       noted that the work had led her to explore children's participation       further, particularly in relation to school governance (source 5).
Evidence of the impact on methodological approaches to working with         children as researchers has come from NGO practitioners,       international policy makers, teachers, head teachers and teacher       educators.
The significance of this impact, within the policy context, is       that international development organisations have adapted the research       approach for planning and evaluation purposes.
In 2011, the Education       Chief of UNICEF Bangladesh noted the influence of the `Children Decide'       approach on the development of their Child Friendly School Initiative       (source 7).
An environmental researcher working with an indigenous       community in Mexico drew on the approach to involve children in developing       a participatory environmental education curriculum for a small NGO (source       8).
In 2008 Camfed International commissioned Robinson-Pant and Cox to       conduct a child-led baseline study incorporating research methods from the       `Children Decide' project, in order to monitor their development education       programme in Cambridgeshire schools (source 6).
The project also continues to have an impact within schools and higher       educational institutions, beyond Norfolk.
Within a School of Education in       the Midlands, a teacher educator described how the ethos and activities       described in the research reports had been incorporated into the BA course       for classroom assistants.
Since she left the university, certain elements       which she designed on the basis of the Children Decide project have been       retained in the course (source 9).
A head teacher in Cambridgeshire       commented on the impact on her current work in schools, enabling her to       develop her own practice methodologically (source 10).
