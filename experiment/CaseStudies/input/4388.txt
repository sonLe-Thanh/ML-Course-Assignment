     Pace's impact can be evidenced in three ways: (i) informing EU policy       decisions; (ii) influencing the EU's policy agenda; (iii) contributing to       public debate.
Informing EU policy     Pace was invited by IDEA in Stockholm to share research findings and       insights from her British Academy and ESRC funded research grants in 2008.
This gave rise to two commissioned papers (source 1 below) and involvement       in a series of meetings between 2008 and 2010 under the heading of Global       Consultations on the EU's Role in Democracy Building.
The Senior Advisor       to the project is clear that Pace's research input was influential &#8212; she       states that it provided the project `with deeper insights and additional       legitimacy &#8212; and made a very important contribution to the credibility         of [the] project report' (source 2).
Under the auspices of the       Swedish Presidency of the EU, the report that emerged from the IDEA       initiative was subsequently `used to inform EU member states and         institutional deliberations, and with its substance inspired the         EU Council conclusions adopted' (source 2): the EP's Resolution of       22 October 2009 on Democracy Building in the EU's External Relations (www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-         //EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2009-0056+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN) and the 17 November       2009 European Council Conclusions on Democracy Support in the EU's       External Relations       (www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/111250.pdf).
Influencing the agenda of the EU     Pace's research has challenged conventional wisdom about the type of       political reform that the EU has been promoting in the MENA region.
Her       research has stimulated policy debate and has improved EU policy         makers' understanding of some of the deeper social issues within       MENA societies.
Pace has engaged with policy makers in a number of ways.
In February 2012, she co-organised a Public Hearing under the auspices of       the European Parliament's (EP's) Committee on Foreign Affairs, held at the       EP building in Brussels (source 3).
This followed an earlier invitation by       the EP for Pace to present critical feedback on the Review of the European       Neighbourhood Policy to Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighbourhood       Policy (&#352;tefan F&#252;le) at a Public Round Table on Making Democracy Promotion       Work in June 2011 (source 4).
One MEP involved in both events noted that       Pace's 'research produces factual solutions and approaches that can and       have influenced and guided real life policy making in the European         Parliament and beyond' (source 5 &#8212; see also sources 6 and 7, which       confirm the position that Pace's research has been translated into       `tangible, effective policy' and has influenced individuals' `inputs into       the EU's policy making process').
Pace's research also led the EP to select her as an expert to deliver a       commissioned briefing on the Social, Economic, Political and Geo-Strategic       Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories in October 2011 at the       EP in Strasbourg.
Further, Pace was commissioned to write a paper on `The       End of EU Democracy Promotion and of the Two-State Solution?'
for the       extended research arm of the Council of the EU, the EU Institute for       Security Studies (EUISS) in Paris (source 8).
The EUISS Chaillot         Papers Series in which her contribution was published was mentioned       in the Jerusalem Post and Le Monde and cited by Biladi       and Publico in February and April 2011 (source 8).
Contributing to public debate     Following Pace's published research work, and her appearance at the EP,       she was contacted by a number of funding bodies in the UK and       international media representatives for her views on political       transformation processes in the MENA region.
This latter contact has had       an impact on the way in which journalists report on democratization in the       MENA.
The following are examples of these sorts of activity:     - In 2009, the British Academy Review commissioned Pace to write       a piece on `Democracy in Palestine and the Middle East Peace Process'       aimed at a non-specialist readership.
- In December 2009, Pace was interviewed by Danish National Radio       during an International Conference held at the Centre for Contemporary       Middle East Studies, University of Southern Denmark, Odense (at: http://www.dr.dk/P1/orientering/indslag/2009/12/03/183739.htm).
- That same year, Pace's research acquired affiliation status with the       Council for British Research in the Levant in Jerusalem and was included       in the ESRC's Catalogue of Projects with Research Impact.
- In February 2011, she was interviewed by the Times of Malta on       the political unrest in the MENA (at: http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110203/local/eu-has-lost-all-credibility-on-democracy-in-middle-east.348320).
- In May 2011, Pace was interviewed by the Brazilian newspaper A         CR&#205;TICA.
- In June 2011, after Pace's contribution to the EP's Round Table on the       Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy, she was interviewed by the EUobserver       (at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFGeEJAD7RY).
- In June 2011, she was interviewed by the BBC Arabic Service following       her contribution to a workshop at Westminster University on `Islamism and       the Arab Revolutions: The Promise and the Pitfalls.'
- In June 2011, Pace was interviewed by Arild Foss on the `Arab Spring'       for the ESRC magazine, Society Now (at: http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Society%20Now%20issue%2010_tcm8-16400.pdf).
- Demonstrating continuing contribution to the public debate with an       article in The Conversation in July 2013 (http://theconversation.com/morsis-authority-ebbed-away-but-egypt-is-dangerously-divided-15774)
