     4.1 Overview     Sainsbury and colleagues have influenced the development of welfare       reform policy in the UK since 2005 up to the enactment of the Welfare       Reform Act in 2012.
The main immediate beneficiaries have been policy       makers within government and organisations interested in welfare reform.
Indirect beneficiaries will be the recipients of Universal Credit as it is       implemented from October 2013.
The route to this impact can be traced through the following (taken from       the REF document "Panel criteria and working methods", REF 01.2012):            Citation in (a) public consultation and (b) policy documents       Reference in Parliamentary debates       Use by Parliamentary Select Committees          Other evidence includes:            A letter of endorsement from Lord David Freud, currently Minister for         Welfare Reform in the Coalition government since 2010), confirming the         influence claimed       Invitations to speak at relevant events       Meetings with key politicians and advisers.
Appointment as Specialist Adviser to the House of Commons Work and         Pensions Select Committee for its Inquiry into Benefits Simplification       The widespread adoption of the phrase `single working age benefit' in         policy debate, before the current alternative title Universal Credit         replaced it.
This case study is put forward as an example of the following (again       taken REF 01.2012):            Influence or shaping of legislation       Shaping or influence on policy made by government       Change in policy direction       Stimulation of policy debate          The introduction of the notion of the `single working age benefit' is       also an example of two of the criteria for four star quality rating.
It is       "outstandingly novel in developing concepts..." and has been a "major       influence on the intellectual agenda of a ...field".
4.2 Narrative     In July 2005, Margaret Hodge, Minister at the Department for Work and       Pensions, invited Sainsbury to discuss ideas on benefit reform.
He left a       paper "The reform of incapacity benefits &#8212; thoughts towards a new         `working age benefit'".
Hodge wrote in September to thank him for       contributing to her ideas about future policy proposals (letter available       for scrutiny).
Some of the ideas in the paper were reflected in the Green       Paper, A New Deal for Welfare (DWP 2006), in the chapter, `Long       term benefits reform'.
The paper was the basis of an article (Sainsbury 2006) that introduced       the phrase `single working age benefit'.
During 2006, this idea of       a single working age benefit fed into policy making through:            Speech by Sainsbury at Labour Party Conference       Meeting with John Williams, Special Political Adviser to Secretary of         State, John Hutton       Meeting with Government adviser David Freud to discuss radical benefit         reform and the single working age benefit.
The Freud Report published in         March 2006 contained a chapter "Benefit reform &#8212; towards a single         system" reflecting many of the ideas discussed with him.
In March 2007, Sainsbury was appointed Specialist Adviser to the Work and       Pensions Select Committee for its Inquiry into Benefits Simplification.
The Committee's report contains a chapter on fundamental changes to the       benefit system discussing the single working age benefit in detail.
In       July 2007, a key paper by Sainsbury and Stanley set out a revised version       of the single working age benefit as a blueprint for radical benefit       reform.
In 2008, the Labour Government published two important Green Papers.
No         One Written Off (DWP 2008a) contains a chapter on "Simplifying and       streamlining the benefit system" and Raising Expectations and           Increasing Support " (DWP 2008b) reaffirms "we remain       attracted to the idea of a single working age benefit ..." (p.35).
Both       Green Papers cited Sainsbury and Stanley (2007).
In July 2009, DWP       commissioned SPRU to conduct research on public attitudes to the single       working age benefit (published as Sainsbury and Weston 2010).
In February 2009, David Freud became welfare reform adviser to the       Conservative Opposition.
He introduced radical benefit reform to Iain       Duncan Smith (currently Secretary of State for Work and Pensions) who had       established the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ).
In September 2009, CSJ       published Dynamic Benefits, which developed the single working age       benefit idea further, citing Sainsbury and Stanley (2007).
After the 2010       Election, radical reform became a priority of the Coalition government.
It       published a Green Paper, 21st Century Welfare, in July based on Dynamic         Benefits, citing Sainsbury and Stanley (2007), and a later White       Paper, Universal Credit &#8212; welfare that works, that cited both       Sainsbury and Stanley (2007) and Sainsbury and Weston (2010).
[text       removed for publication]     The Welfare Reform Bill reached the Committee stage in March 2011.
Sainsbury was invited to give oral evidence referred to in a subsequent       Committee hearing: Kate Green (Lab): "I was also very struck by       the evidence that we received from Professor Roy Sainsbury last       week, when he said that the public as a whole favour individual assessment       and individual arrangements."
(Hansard Minutes of the Standing Committee       on the Welfare Reform Bill, 29 March 2011: Col 176).
It was also cited in       the House of Lords debate on the Bill: Baroness Lister: "Indeed, Professor         Roy Sainsbury told the Public Bill Committee in the other place that       in research with claimants, "individual assessment spontaneously arose as       a thing that people were very keen on"."
(Hansard House of Lords Debates,       13 Sep 2011: Column 727).
Further evidence of impact comes from House of Lords debates.
One       demonstrates how the Labour government had accepted the single working age       benefit: Lord Knight: "When we were in Government, we were committed to a       single working age benefit."
(Hansard House of Lords Debates, 13       Sep 2011: Column 721).
The other, from a senior Liberal Democrat peer       recognised as an authority on social security, Lord Kirkwood, serves as a       summary of the impact claimed in this submission: "I counsel the coalition       Government about over claiming.
...
It is said that this is all a great       revolution but people such as Professor Roy Sainsbury at York have       been talking about it for years."
Hansard House of Lords Debates, 13 Sep       2011: Column 685.
