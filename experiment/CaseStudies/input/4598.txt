     Processes of conservation and digitisation have allowed public access for       the first time to a rare       collection of Soviet war posters &#8212; unique in the UK and one of the largest       internationally.
As part of       her research interests, Marsh sought access to the posters through the       University's Manuscripts       and Special Collections (MSC) team, thus setting in motion a chain of       events that would eventually       lead to their physical exhibition and subsequent transformation into a       permanent, digitised, interactive       online resource, preserving an element of Soviet cultural heritage whose       physical fragility had       previously precluded the public from accessing it directly.
10,250 people       have thus far visited the       exhibition in either its physical or online form (5.1).
Initiated and curated by Marsh in close collaboration with the MSC team       at the University, Windows         on War: Soviet Posters 1943-45 took place at the Weston Gallery (the       University's public-facing       Lakeside Arts Centre, which draws 90% of its audience from beyond the       University) from       December 2008 to March 2009.
The exhibition was underpinned by Marsh's       pre-1993 published       research on poetry and painting and on the ways in which painting inspired       pictorial passages in       Russian 19th-century prose, and her more recent exploration of       visual culture (3.1 &amp; 3.4), bodily       presence (3.2) and spatial awareness (3.2) in the theatre; and the       translation of culture through       the medium of theatre (3.4 &amp; 3.5).
This was complemented by recent, as       yet unpublished research       on the nature of the ephemerality of the posters arising from their       fragility as artefacts of material       culture.
This research shaped the focus of the exhibition in terms of the       topics highlighted, the       manner in which the material was displayed and the captions created to       guide visitors' under-standing.
The exhibition attracted nearly 5000 visitors (substantial for the       recorded footfall of the venue) and       provoked national and local press interest, attesting to its role in       raising public awareness of and       contributing to a wider public understanding of this previously       un-exhibited aspect of Soviet cultural       heritage.
It was recommended for several weeks during December 2008 and       January 2009 in The         Times, The Independent and The Guardian as a top 5       exhibition.
The extent of the collection, its       rarity, and specifically its Nottingham location also stimulated the       interest of the local press (5.2).
Visitors to the exhibition found it to be an 'excellent living memory of       war childhood' and a 'peep       into history through war posters'.
There were also comments on how the       posters' combinations of       image and text affected Russian emotions toward the enemy, and their       sentiments about home.
A       primary school teacher commented that his/her charges learned (after       stencilling in teams) `how       mass production of images can be quite uncreative!'
(5.3).
Linked public lectures and education activities engaged children, adult       learners and a broader       general public, contributing to increased knowledge about, awareness of       and interest in Soviet       visual culture, and specific issues such as preservation through       digitisation, and the processes       involved in the creation of the posters.
Feedback has been referenced       where this was sought at       the time (5.3):             Public lectures, such as `The Soviet War Posters in the Context         of History', by Professor Steven         White (Glasgow) ( 27.01.09; 120 attendees) traced the Russian poster         tradition's frequent reference         to history (e.g.
the Napoleonic invasion) providing insights into the         specifically Russian,         rather than Soviet, sense of history in WW2.
A lunchtime talk attracted an audience of 40 people and covered         topics such as preservation         and digitisation as a repair tool; the provenance of a collection saved         by chance; reproducing         posters en masse in wartime conditions; and the paradox of the posters'         war role.
School education days (for 386 children and their teachers)         were organised by the Lakeside         Education Officer.
Children were introduced to an archive, had a guided         tour of the exhibition,         and made their own posters.
They learnt how to stencil and how teams         created the original posters.
Teacher comments: 'the children gained an insight into the poster         collection, and were         especially aware of how violent and aggressive the anti-Nazi campaign         was in Russia.
They         produced very striking, if bloodthirsty, graphic images in black and red         paint' (23.2.09).
Transforming         their existing knowledge, the children learnt about `persuasive picture         making' (23.02.09);         and also ' learnt a few words of Russian' (23.02.09).
Adult study day (28.02.09; 35 attendees, organised by Marsh).
Speakers gave a comprehensive         overview of the posters' role in war, their artistic inheritance as         against contemporary art policy         and their cultural legacy: The day concluded with a guided tour of the         exhibition.
Participants         found the day to be `excellent', answering `a good number of questions'.
The material was utilised by a professional trainer in her         acculturating programme for businessmen         visiting Russia who considers it to have had `a great impact on me and         my work'.
The trainer         was preparing a speech on `Russia at War' and subsequently visited the         archive to undertake         further research on the posters which she considered `too striking to         omit!'
She has subsequently         embedded the material into three specialist talks she provides (to lay         audiences and the national         Arts charity National Association of Decorative &amp; Fine Arts         Societies (NADFAS)) (5.4).
Using digitisation to widen access and to ensure conservation     Digitisation and online display have provided the ideal medium for the       exhibition of the fragile posters,       addressing what can otherwise be the opposing needs of public access and       conservation.
The online       resource (5.1) has transformed the reach of the material, attracting new       audiences to this unique       element of Soviet cultural heritage.
Its development called more deeply on       Marsh's research, since       each of the 45 posters has been fully annotated with comments on       provenance, on its role in the       war situation, on the artistic roots of the image and on the artist and       writer (where appropriate), as       well as commentary on the visual and verbal content of each poster.
Interest and use of the site       has been further stimulated by press coverage (5.2).
According to MSC's Digital Development Officer, the resource is proving       to be `exceptionally self-sustainable'       (5.5), already generating interest from educators (5.6), and from a       diverse range of       cultural organisations.
It has been endorsed by groups including,       Nottingham Contemporary, the       Irish Association for Russian, Central and Eastern European Studies, the       Russian Embassy in       London, the Soviet Space Program and Academia Rossica &#8212; the Russian Arts       and Culture       Foundation.
Between its launch date on 26 March 2013 and 31st       July 2013, it had 5,249 visits from       the UK, US, Russia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Australia, Ukraine, France and       Finland (5.7).
The       AHRC is featuring this `fantastic' site in its on-line gallery as a model       of best practice in creating a       website and presenting rare materials: `It is witty, informative, and       really gets to the heart of what       images mean and what they do &#8212; which is perfect' (5.8).
