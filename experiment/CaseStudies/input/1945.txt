     Cambridge Cognition7 was spun out in 2002 with its main       product being the CANTAB battery, licensed from the University of       Cambridge.
Part of the economic impact has been sales to research       institutions: it is currently used in more than 1000 departments in over       700 universities and clinical research institutions internationally and       has an extensive bibliography.7 The software was revised by Cambridge         Cognition in 2003 to comply with pharmaceutical regulations for data       encoding.
Real-time data streaming from numerous international clinical       trial sites was introduced in 2011.
In 2012 Cambridge Cognition       released CANTABmobile&#8482;, a portable version of PAL, to provide a diagnostic       to detect Alzheimer's disease more accurately and at an earlier, and       therefore more `treatable', stage.8     Clinical and Pharmaceutical Company Impact: The main clinical       application of the CANTAB battery, including PAL, has been to diagnose       cognitive impairment and assess novel pharmaceutical treatments.
Following       the underpinning research, a series of industry-led trials using       CANTAB-PAL e.g.9 determined a `cognitive signature' identifying       people at risk for dementia and their likely rate of intellectual       deterioration.
Normative data collated from &gt;8000 individuals       (augmenting reference 1 above) provided a baseline stratified by age,       gender and educational attainment.
The test has 100% sensitivity and 92%       specificity in detecting Alzheimer's disease and is superior to the       standard ADAS-COG.
More than 120 studies involving clinical trials have       used the software (77 since 2008;10 57 currently listed on the       U.S. National Institutes of Health clinical trials website11),       with the largest proportion being trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's       disease sponsored by 10 of the 12 major pharmaceutical companies and by       biotech, device and nutraceutical companies.10     Commercial impact: The CANTAB battery is the main product of Cambridge         Cognition7 which employs around 50 staff in its Head       Office near Cambridge, U.K., and has two US-based business development       staff.
A large proportion of the science and software teams are ex-PhDs       from the University of Cambridge (several from the Robbins and Sahakian       laboratories).
As standalone reportable segments, the sale of the battery       to clinical research academic groups and pharmaceutical companies for use       in drug trials has been profitable since 2009 and Cambridge Cognition       is listed on AIM7 (previously funded by venture capital).
A new       product, CANTABmobile&#8482;, was launched in May 2012 as a Conformit&#233;         Europ&#233;enne (CE) approved Class II medical device.8 In       September 2012, the company was listed number 92 in the Sunday Times list       of the 100 fastest growing private technology companies in the UK, on the       back of annual sales growth of 40%, (achieving revenues of &#163;5.8M in 2012).12     Additionally, in November 2012, Cambridge Cognition, the medical       imaging company IXICO and other partners received a grant of &#163;3.3 million       from the Government-funded Biomedical Catalyst Programme to build and test       a prototype national dementia early diagnosis service using CANTAB.
The       service involves GP referral of patients needing further assessment for       possible dementia to a Brain Health Centre, following an initial       CANTABmobile&#8482; test.
Once referred, patients receive an MRI brain scan and       more detailed cognitive assessment comprising CANTAB tests on an iPad.
Computer algorithms based on machine learning analyse the brain scans to       assess signs of atrophy, combined with an assessment of blood vessel       damage in the brain and the results of cognitive assessment.
The initial       aim of the project is to demonstrate increasing rates of diagnosis and       reducing time to diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from 18 months to three.
Clinical services including NHS impact: Research suggests that       earlier diagnosis is cost effective due to more effective interventions       and prolonged independence.13 The UK Primary Care Trust       Commissioning Board has started trialling CANTABmobile&#8482; with a small       number of GPs.
CANTABmobile&#8482; currently has 166 licensed users including       six clinical commissioning groups implementing the national initiative for       early diagnosis, and private healthcare groups, a pharmacy chain and a       customer in Germany, the first sale for the Company outside the UK.14     The Brain Health Centres project (2012), including CANTAB-PAL, is       endorsed by national clinical director for dementia, Professor Alistair       Burns: "I am very impressed by the Brain Health Centre project which has       the real potential to contribute to making the UK a world leader in       dementia care by raising diagnosis rates - a key ambition of the Prime       Minister's dementia challenge.
Combining innovative technologies in this       way should help us to spot early signs of dementia, giving us time to       offer patients better support and care"; (press release on Cambridge         Cognition website7).
