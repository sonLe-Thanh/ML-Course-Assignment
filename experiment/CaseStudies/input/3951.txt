     Nicholls' work on creating a digital reconstruction of the entire city of       ancient Rome has generated       very considerable impact in the following areas:     Commercial publication and broadcast work     Articles about the model have appeared in international publications Dossiers         D'Arch&#233;ologie       (December 2009) and Storica National Geographic (May 2011), as       well as the UK's BBC History         Magazine (February 2011, circulation 73,000), in which Nicholls'       research was described as       `groundbreaking' and `the world's most up-to-date model of ancient Rome'.
It has also been used       to illustrate commercial and academic publications in the UK and overseas.
Nicholls' work led the BBC to commission a series of digital       reconstructions for broadcast in the       programme Rome's Final Frontier (7 December 2012, initial viewing       figures 164,000), for which the       director wrote: `The reaction from the BBC has been extremely positive.
Graphics are         commonplace in television, yet your work brought a weight of academic         credibility to the project'.
The digital model was also used for the documentary Strip the City:         Rome, appearing at several       points throughout the programme to enable viewers to understand the       architecture and layout of       the city.
The programme was transmitted by Discovery Canada in October       2012, by Discovery       Science and Quest in February 2013, and on terrestrial channels throughout       the world.
The UK       production company, Windfall Farms, writes that the work `has now been         shown in several         countries and all to very high critical acclaim ... your model has         proven a real success at         increasing public awareness!
I'm quite sure many of the key stories in         the programme would not         have been possible without it'.
This demonstrates that Nicholls'       model has achieved impact both       through its value to the production firms involved and through improving       understanding among       huge international audiences.
Paedagogical impact     The digital model is now used for teaching purposes at UK universities       such as Durham, St       Andrew's, and Nottingham, where it has been used to illustrate       undergraduate modules and to       provide pictorial material for use in examination papers since 2011.
It       has also been used       overseas, in undergraduate teaching at the British School at Rome (c.80       students 2008-11), and in       a workshop on digital modelling at Venice International University in       collaboration with Duke       University, North Carolina.
In addition, it was the subject of a lecture       at the Higher Education       Academy's annual Humanities conference in May 2013, generating further       speaking invitations       from the HEA's Discipline Lead for History who wrote "your presentation       ... last May was a       highlight, if not the highlight for me"'.
Outside the higher-education       sector the model has been used       to illustrate talks to around 50 schools, museums and societies over a       five-year period, reaching a       total audience of c.3,000 mostly GCSE and A-level pupils and adults.
Reaction has been uniformly       positive and includes comments such as the following from the Head of       Godolphin and Latymer       School: `Many of our students ... found it really inspiring.
They have         also uniformly commented on         the usefulness of the models and illustrations to their understanding         ... and have been able to         comment thoughtfully on the central tenets of the lecture.'
Impact within the travel industry     Nicholls' work lends itself to use in the tourism industry, as there is a       large public appetite for visual       representations of the ancient past.
He has worked in particular with the       two travel companies       described below, offering holidays to ancient sites in the Mediterranean,       achieving an impact both       on the activities of these companies and on the customers they serve, by       providing a unique       experience which enhances their clients' understanding of the architecture       and archaeology of       ancient cities and monuments, especially those of Rome.
Nicholls' lectures       are advertised in the       promotional material for both companies and help to generate sales.
a) Voyages to Antiquity: Nicholls has worked with this company on       five tours around the ancient       Mediterranean (2010-present, addressing a total of c.1,600 passengers),       and as a consultant.
The       firm's Enhancement Programme Director, writes: `Dr Nicholls' lectures         on board our ships on a         variety of topics have been very well received, often using his         innovative digital architectural         models and research work to add to our passengers' understanding.'
b) Westminster Classic Tours.
Nicholls has worked with this       company, which arranges niche       tours for over 200 customers per year and has a turnover of more than       &#163;0.5m, on tour design and       lecturing since 2007.
On the basis of customer interest in lectures       drawing on his research, he was       asked in 2012 to join the firm's Board of Directors.
The cumulative worth of these areas of impact, and in particular       the consistently positive       reactions to Nicholls' work from the tourist and education sectors, led       Cambridge University Press       to offer him a contract in June 2013 for a print book and package of       digital products (such as e-books       in various formats), drawing on his work in digital modelling of ancient       Rome.
This       demonstrates the scholarly validity of this research project and will       sustain, broaden and deepen its       global impact.
Impacts from related work     Beyond this, Nicholls' work on ancient books and libraries has led       directly to his participation in       BBC Radio 4 programmes such as In Our Time (initial listening       figures of two million) and `Our         Libraries: the next chapter', a documentary on libraries.
He has       also taken part in a number of       television programmes, such as BBC4's Mothers, Murderers and         Mistresses, (viewing figures of       575,000 per episode) and Rome: A History of the Eternal City.
Feedback from producers, listeners       and viewers demonstrates that Nicholls' work has helped to change public       awareness and       understanding of this aspect of ancient history.
