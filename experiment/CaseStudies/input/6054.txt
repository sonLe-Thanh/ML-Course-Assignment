     The central impact achieved by firms adopting the WLC approach is an       increased awareness of, and control over, the flow of work through the       production process from tendering/ bidding onwards.
Collaborations with       industry and with international researchers in the USA, Europe and China       have generated successive cycles of problem formulation, theory-building,       research design and problem-solving.
As such, management practice has been       influenced in the early stages as well as the later stages of the research       programme.
Specifically, adoption of the WLC approach has had a significant       impact on companies as it makes it much easier for managers and shop-floor       staff to work on the right jobs at the right time, thereby reducing lead       times, and allows the sales/marketing function to confidently quote       delivery lead times for new orders.
It also informs decision-making on       where extra capacity is needed as the order mix changes over time.
Apart       from improving delivery performance, the approach has been demonstrated to       reduce the amount of reactive `fire-fighting', which in turn means an       organisation can devote more attention to quality improvements and       innovation.
This iterative research process has resulted in a WLC software       package that is mature and ready for commercialisation in the UK.
Regional impact &#8212; PDS Engineering:     In recent years clear-cut and significant industrial impact has       been made through longitudinal, in-depth collaboration with PDS       Engineering, a small precision engineering company in the North West of       England.
PDS produce a wide range of complex, high-specification       components, mostly on a MTO basis, and often to short and changing lead       times.
Implementing Lancaster's WLC system led to increased clarity of       production and capacity planning, giving PDS a much better understanding       of shop-floor priorities, of how and when to adjust capacity, and of what       delivery lead times they can confidently quote to prospective customers.
The Operations Director at PDS has stated that `the LUMS WLC system has         improved our performance at PDS significantly ... therefore contributing         to our profitability'.
Specific evidence of the impact on       quantitative performance improvements since 2009, as published in Hendry et         al.
(2013), includes:            64% increase in order-winning performance (% of tenders converted into         definite orders)       50% reduction in manufacturing lead times, due to reduced         work-in-progress       11% reduction in delivery lead times (total time from order         confirmation to delivery)       27% reduction in the mean tardiness of deliveries to customers          Further information about this case, including evidence from employees is       available in the brochure `Workload         Control at PDS Engineering'.
Impact on PDS supply chain:       In addition to the impact on the competitiveness of PDS Engineering, their       improved performance has had an impact on the supply chain in which they       operate.
The impact has been felt by key customers &#8212; such as Unison Engine       Components (formerly Smiths Aerospace Components) &#8212; and, in turn, by one       of Unison's key customers, Rolls-Royce.
An independent supply chain       consultant working for Unison corroborates that Lancaster's WLC system has       made PDS `fit for purpose' to supply leading aerospace companies.
In particular, the consultant confirms that WLC has led to improved       on-time delivery performance, and that: `the adoption of the Workload         Control system was fundamental to the improvement seen at PDS         Engineering, and I often use this as an example of best practice in         industry'.
Among a set of ten suppliers participating in a supplier       development initiative run by the consultant, PDS were one of only two       firms that continued to make considerable progress in spite of the recent       financial crisis.
Commercialising WLC in the UK:       In order to extend the reach of this approach further, Lancaster       staff have developed a WLC software package that is ready for       commercialisation in the UK.
It provides a solution tailored to the needs       of MTO companies that is better aligned with their production environment       than typical, alternative commercial Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)       packages.
The Operations Director of PDS Engineering, for example,       confirmed that `The alternatives ... were lacking the production and         capacity planning that was so essential to us yet they had lots of other         functions which we wouldn't have used'.
The Access Group, a provider       of ERP software to the midmarket in the UK and Ireland, has audited       Lancaster's WLC software and visited PDS Engineering to observe its use.
The Supply Chain Divisional Manager of the Access Group has confirmed that       `there appear to be no other solutions which provide its specific         functionality'.
He went on to describe the software as `a unique         solution which has been shown to work well ... and has many other         potential areas of application.'
Adoption of WLC approach in Europe and China:       The reach of the industrial impact has not, however, been       restricted to PDS and its supply chain, nor indeed to the UK.
The       combination of the underpinning research and the exemplary impact of its       implementation at PDS have resulted in the uptake of similar projects       internationally.
Europe:       Through an EU-funded project in the Netherlands, ten companies, including       Corus Perfo B.V. and Lapack B.V., have collaborated with researchers from       the University of Groningen to implement WLC.
Improvements claimed by       Corus Perfo B.V. include increased transparency, leading to more       predictable lead times.
Meanwhile, Lapack B.V. highlighted that WLC       provides `a very simple means to maintain our guarantees for delivery         within 24 hours'.
A firm of consultants, Langhout &amp; Cazemier,       provided a piece of production planning and control software known as       Elance&#174; to support the EU project.
As is evidenced by researchers at the       University of Groningen, this software incorporates many of Lancaster's       WLC ideas and has since been implemented in a large number of other Dutch       companies.
WLC ideas have also been adopted by consultants in Belgium       (Sirris) and by two companies working with the University of Coimbra in       Portugal, including Navarra S.A. Navarra S.A. highlighted improved       production-marketing integration and reduced work-in-progress, cutting       costs and increasing profits, while a representative of Sirris states       that: `By applying the principles of WLC, we have been able to reduce         the lead times at several companies, often by a factor of 50%'.
The       representative of Sirris also confirms that meetings with Lancaster staff       inspired this WLC knowledge transfer, stating that the 'work of the         University of Lancaster has been of great importance for our own         thinking' and describing Lancaster's researchers as having `set         themselves apart as a world leading group in the field of WLC'.
China:       After reading papers by Lancaster academics (e.g.
Kingsman, 2000;       Stevenson, 2006), researchers from the Guangdong University of Technology,       China have implemented WLC in several mould manufacturing companies,       including Greatoo Inc, with funding from the National Natural Science       Foundation of China.
Greatoo Inc benefitted from production-marketing       integration and reduced work-in-process, but also from shorter lead times       due to reduced waiting times prior to final order assembly and a better       matching of workloads to capacities.
