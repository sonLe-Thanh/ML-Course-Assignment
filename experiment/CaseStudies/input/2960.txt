     Pathways to Impact: Research findings have been widely       disseminated by the authors in both academic and non-academic settings;       the latter including an invited talk at the British Embassy in Athens.
A       number of media engagements have also provided timely contributions, in       the context of Greece's ongoing economic and political turmoil.
Since May       2010, Papadimitriou has made thirteen separate media appearances,       including: the BBC Breakfast show, discussing EU budget negotiations (24       November 2012); a radio interview on the BBC Five Live `Double Take'       programme, discussing the Greek crisis (20 May 2012); and an interview on       CBC Radio (Canada) on the Greek election (26 April 2012) [1].
Nonetheless,       the principal pathway to impact has been through direct engagement with       key political actors within the Greek executive.
Background: By illuminating the paradox of a constitutionally       powerful Prime Minister who lacks sufficient resources to effectively       coordinate government business, the research has had a major impact on       applied policy.
As confirmed by the former Greek Minister of Finance: "I         consider the collaborative research by Featherstone and Papadimitriou an         important example of policy-relevant academic work which has contributed         in a concrete manner to the re-thinking of government practices in         Greece" [2].
More specifically, the work has directly shaped two new       laws on the operation of the Greek core executive, in 2011 and 2013, as       well as highlighting structural deficiencies at the centre of Greek       government.
These latter observations are particularly important in the       context of the country's second EU `bailout package' in 2012 - in which       the strengthening of governance structures within the Greek core executive       became an explicit conditionality &#8212; and have attracted the attention of       Greece's international creditors.
Chronology of impact: On 14 March 2009 Papadimitriou and       Featherstone interviewed the then leader of the opposition (PASOK) in       Greece, George Papandreou, regarding his experiences as a senior minister       in previous governments.
The interviewers elaborated on their argument       that a significant discrepancy existed between the formal powers afforded       to the Greek Prime Minister and the institutional resources available for       supporting coordination at the centre of government.
Papandreou expressed       a strong interest in the findings of the project and asked both       interviewers for their support in reforming the system, later noting that:     "I was very pleased that you joined our informal discussions on party         political reform in 2009, prior to my election victory.
My colleagues         and I were already aware of your extensive research and academic work on         this theme, and your unique insight into the challenges of reforming the         Greek state's governance structures since the fall of the dictatorship         in 1974.
Indeed, your observations concerning the long-term constraints         on the Prime Minister's office were consistent with my own thinking."
[3]     On 14 April 2009 Papadimitriou was invited to submit a blueprint       on reforming the Greek core executive to senior members of PASOK [4].
Those present at the meeting included Tina Birbili, Papandreou's senior       advisor and subsequent Minister of the Environment, and PASOK spokesperson       and subsequent Minister of Finance, George Papaconstantinou, who noted at       a previous meeting with Papadimitriou and Featherstone (9 February 2009)       that "we agreed that it would be beneficial to implement some of these         ideas if PASOK won the forthcoming elections (October 2009)" [2].
Papadimitriou promoted the idea of a stronger Office of the Prime Minister       and a larger (and permanent) General Secretariat of the Government headed       by a permanent civil servant, to improve the coordination of government       business.
He argued that the institutionalisation of the then Greek `core       executive' was exceptionally weak compared to those of similar sized       countries across the European Union.
The main thrust of his advice was       that Prime Ministerial oversight over disjointed `ministerial fiefdoms'       ought to be strengthened.
On 9 May 2009 Papadimitriou and Featherstone presented their main       argument on the weakness of the Greek core at a conference in Yale       University on the lack of public policy reform in Greece [5].
Based       on a wealth of primary material, the authors demonstrated the fragmented       nature and poor institutionalisation of the Greek core executive since the       country's transition to democracy in 1974.
Their data conclusively       established that Greece stood as a clear outlier from the European       mainstream in the way in which core government business was managed.
On 30 September 2009, five days before the coming general       election, Papandreou and Professor Papadimitriou exchanged email messages       confirming the importance of strengthening the core executive.
Papandreou       reiterated his wish for Papadimitriou to help with the reform of       government business [3].
On 4 October 2009, PASOK won the general       election, and Papandreou became Prime Minister.
In March 2010 George Papandreou established a 5-member       international advisory committee (comprising non-Greek academics and       senior policy makers) for reforming the Greek core executive.
Featherstone       is appointed its Head and main rapporteur, and Papadimitriou is asked to       comment on each major draft of the recommendations.
In September 2010 the       Advisory Committee submits its report.
The main proposals, informed by       Papadimitriou and Featherstone's prior research, include the creation of a       new Ministry within the Office of the Prime Minister to help coordinate       government business.
The Committee also advocates the creation of three       General Secretariats (GS): GS of the Prime Minister, GS of the Government       and GS of Human and Capital Resources [6].
IMPACT 1: On 19 January 2011 the Parliament votes on the       creation of a General Secretariat to the Prime Minister (Presidential       Decree 2, 11 January 2011) [7].
The bill that is presented to Parliament       includes the key aspects of the Committee's recommendations, including the       main organogram (albeit with fewer staff than originally envisaged by the       Committee) prepared by Featherstone and Papadimitriou.
As Papandreou later       confirms: "Your collaborative research... helped us to move forward         with this agenda, so that central government could exercise more         effective coordination of the work of the various ministries... Several         specific proposals to increase accountability and transparency in         government were adopted, leading to the introduction of new legislation         on government coordination...
In short, your policy-led research has         made a concrete contribution to rethinking government practices in         Greece...
I remain convinced that your diagnosis of the inherent         problems in Greece's governance system remains as relevant as ever"       [3].
On 11 November 2011 Papandreou resigned as PM and was       replaced by Lucas Papademos.
During the six month tenure of Papademos, the       structure of the core executive remained unaffected.
In January 2012, the OECD publishes its `Review on the Central       Administration in Greece', with Featherstone and Papadimitriou's work [A]       the only academic publication referenced.
The report notes that: "Although         there was, in principle, unprecedented convergence between the main         political parties on the country's reform agenda (Featherstone and         Papadimitriou, 2008), in practice the EMU's favourable economic and         financial conditions became opportunities to expand the state's umbrella         without showing too much concern for its inefficiencies.
The result is a         public governance agenda in sore need of renewed momentum and of a clear         and complete strategic vision, to be rolled out without further delay"       [8].
This was the first time that a major international organisation had       highlighted the weaknesses of the Greek core executive as a threat to the       sustainability of the country's governance structures.
On 9 March 2012 Greece signed its second bailout agreement with       the IMF.
Amongst other conditions, the IMF demands that the Greek       government creates "a directorate of planning, management, and         monitoring of reforms" at the centre of government [9].
Similar       guidance was issued by Horst Reichenbach, the Head of the EU Task Force       for Greece (TFGR), the office set up for assisting administrative reform       in Greece.
As TFGR confirm: "Featherstone and Papadimitriou (2008) was         one of the information sources used by the TFGR to gain initial insights         on the functioning of the Greek administration.
The book was         particularly useful to the TFGR as a complement to the OECD review...
While the OECD review provides a synthetic vision of the current         situation of the administration and recommendations for improvement, the         Featherstone and Papadimitriou book contains more detailed information,         such as for example the historic developments leading to the current         situation of the administration or about the relations between the         central and regional administration...
The lack of central steering and         inter-ministerial coordination was mentioned as a major weakness of the         Greek Administration in both reports" [8].
IMPACT 2: Following fresh general elections on 20 June 2012,       Antonis Samaras becomes Prime Minister, leading a `grand coalition'       between the centre-right New Democracy, centre-left PASOK and reformist       left DHMAR parties.
In January 2013 the Parliament passed a new       law (4109, 23.1.2013) on the creation of a General Secretariat for the       Coordination of the Government, answerable directly to the Prime Minister.
The new service is staffed by 63 permanent civil servants, headed by a       Secretary General appointed on a 5-year term [10].
The provisions of the       new legislation are nearly identical to the recommendations by Professor       Papadimitriou back in April 2009 [4] and very close to the report by the       Advisory Team in September 2010 [6].
