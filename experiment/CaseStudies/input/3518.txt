     In 2007 the School started to collaborate with Brady Haran, then a       freelance BBC journalist, who had worked previously with the Nottingham       School of Chemistry on the production of short videos on the chemical       elements.
This initiative arose from interest within the School to engage       with the wide and diverse audiences which can be accessed through new       forms of social media and mobile technology.
Following the success of a       pilot phase in which several Physics-focused videos were featured on       Haran's Test Tube YouTube channel, which is aimed at a general       science audience, a decision was taken to launch the Sixty Symbols       YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols)       and website (www.sixtysymbols.com),       devoted entirely to physics-related topics.
This activity serves the       strategic aim of providing a route through which the public can become       engaged with our research.
Since its launch in February 2009, Sixty Symbols has amassed       21.2M views and 266k subscribers and there are now 212 freely-available       videos (all figures quoted are up to 31st July 2013), each of       which consists of a commentary on a particular scientific topic by a       researcher from the School.
Sixty Symbols was designed to present       the workings of a research-led physics department in a manner that engages       the viewer by giving them a sense of membership through the development of       themes, familiar faces, and a common informal style.
This feeling of       community is reflected by the rapid growth in the number of Sixty         Symbols' subscribers and the high proportion of returning viewers,       evidenced by large numbers of comments and channel subscriptions.
Sixty         Symbols is now ranked within the top 0.01% of the tens of millions       of YouTube channels by number of views.
For comparison, the viewing       statistics for Sixty Symbols compare favourably with the highly       acclaimed CERNTV, the YouTube channel of CERN, a major       international organisation which attracts wide media interest: CERNTV       has attracted 3.3M views and 36k subscribers to 179 uploaded videos since       its launch in 2007.
The Sixty Symbols videos and viewing figures (31st July       2013) related to the topics discussed in detail under the research section       on scanning probe microscopy (Section 2.1) are: Gold Nanoparticles       (72,627), Electrons (74,842), Nano (41,082), Wavefunction       (111,012), Vacuum Cannon (87,785), and Atomic Switch       (49,608).
Those related to Galactic Astronomy (Section 2.2) are Plus         or Minus (54,451), Milky Way's Twin (41,370), Redshift       (47,248), Dark Matter (142,422) and Spiral Galaxies       (52,040).
The videos may be readily accessed through an internet search on       `Sixty Symbols Videoname' and the viewing figures confirm the       effectiveness of this dissemination route for our research.
To assess further the impact of the Sixty Symbols project, the       School commissioned an independent evaluation by management consultants       O'Herlihy &amp; Co [A] which was completed in 2013.
This report is used       extensively below to provide supporting statistics and analysis of       audience interaction with Sixty Symbols.
The report is based on:       data extracted from viewing statistics, audience comments appended to each       video [B], social media conversations, newspaper reports, stakeholder       interviews, teaching resources, and a student survey.
The report confirms       the viewing figures above and makes the following additional points,            99.4% positive feedback, quantified by viewers `liking' (positively         rating) the video content.
Geographical analysis of viewer statistics shows that Sixty           Symbols reaches a global audience across all continents with a         particular concentration in Australia, North America and Europe.
Prior to university study, 1st year undergraduates         reported that Sixty Symbols significantly raised their interest         in Physics (74%) and also raised their understanding of Physics (77%).
The large number of comments (over 7000 for some videos) provides         clear evidence of debate between the public and the researchers         themselves (including 100s of direct emails).
Scientific debates arising         from Sixty Symbols videos are often followed up through other         social media sites such as Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/sixtysymbols)         and Twitter.
Sixty Symbols has been used as a formal educational resource,         positively referenced by numerous teachers' support networks including;         Times Educational Supplement (TES), the California Learning Resource         Network and the Northern Illinois University [A].
For a specific example of inclusion in core teaching material, see       reference [C] from a UK teacher in a secondary school who highlights the       importance of the link with research (in this case the topic of scanning       probe microscopy discussed in Section 2.1) in stating:     "....greatly enjoyed throughout our student population, around 130 at         A level studying for Physics.
A key element of Sixty Symbols is the         symbiotic content of real research carried out with a physics         department, such as nanoscale microscopy, supported by discussion of the         underlying physics."
The educational influence of Sixty Symbols has also steered other       organisations in their approach to outreach and investment in new media.
In 2010, STFC commissioned a series of videos under the title of Backstage         Science (http://www.backstagescience.com)       to present their facilities using an approach similar to the Sixty         Symbols format.
The open call for an STFC contract to shoot these       videos was won by a consortium headed by Merrifield (&#163;70.5k,       2010), with further support (&#163;18k) in 2012.
These videos have had over       0.5M views, and the Backstage Science channel has 24,000       subscribers.
STFC have estimated that this channel has been used by 3,000       teachers [A; see page 19].
The success of Sixty Symbols in delivering videos of high quality       and with educational value has been recognised by the invitation to Merrifield       to speak at the BrainSTEM `unconference' on YouTube science held       at the Perimeter Institute in 2012.
Recognition has also come from Google:       "Sixty Symbols provides quality educational content on YouTube.
The         videos have theories in physics and astronomy put forth so passionately         by experts in the fields, they serve as a very effective way to         propagate this knowledge."
Global Head of Education Partnerships,       Google [D]     In an initiative to raise the quality of content on YouTube, Google [E]       funded Brady Haran to establish several new YouTube channels including Numberphile       related to mathematics and, in collaboration with the astronomy       researchers in the School, Deep Sky Videos.
These new channels,       which build directly on the success of the Sixty Symbols project,       have already attracted over 30M views and 400k subscribers.
To support       this additional activity, Brady Haran has recently formed "Periodic         Videos Ltd" (2011), securing the future for this style of       disseminating scientific research.
Haran himself [E] notes the importance       of the role of research in the success of the videos:     "I believe this "real life researcher" discussion is what makes Sixty         Symbols so successful.
The people in these films are "the real deal" at         the cutting edge of research &#8212; and viewers respond to that!"
4.1 Comments and critical review by leading scientific communicators      Physics World [F]     "This is what online physics should look like.....professional but not       too slick...explained thoughtfully.
The scientists skilfully avoid either       confusing or patronizing their audience".
Henry Reich, Perimeter Institute (producer of Minute Physics) [G]     "..Sixty Symbols is a particularly important channel because it shares       the real "on the ground" stories....increase public awareness and       understanding, but also to make science a more approachable and desirable       path for young students around the world."
Simon Singh (science writer) [H]     "Sixty Symbols is an excellent example of science engagement, reaching         large number so people (sic), using the internet in an effective manner,         and working within a modest budget.
Others should pay attention and         learn from this model.
With millions of videos viewed and over 100,000         comments, the project speaks for itself.
Part of the reason for its         success is that the people behind Sixty Symbols regularly update with         fresh material, thus bringing cutting edge research direct to the         public.
Perhaps the site's greatest achievement, after sheer volume of         traffic, is its ability to strike the right balance between serious         content and a flair for entertainment"       	 Audience comments       	 Comments uploaded by the audience reveal inspiration, and motivation to       study physics.
