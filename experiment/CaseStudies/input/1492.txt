     The two phases of Payne`s research discussed above have led to high       demand for her       involvement in policy making around the world.
Most significant among       these are presentations to       policymakers in Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, and at global fora.
Brazil: In 2009, Brazil`s government was deliberating whether to       establish a commission to       investigate crimes committed under military rule (then shielded by an       Amnesty Law).
At this crucial       juncture, thanks to the team`s established networks and the       appropriateness and relevance of the       research, Payne was identified as one of only a handful of international       experts on transitional       justice to present her findings and influence the policy debate at three       venues.
First, a seminar       sponsored by the Brazilian Ministry of Justice and organized by the       President of the Amnesty       Commission (`When Transitional Justice Works`, Rio de Janeiro, September       2009), which was       attended by the Minister of Justice along with other Ministry staff.
Second, a conference sponsored       by the National Association of Human Rights (`Human Rights, Democracy and       Diversity`, Bel&#233;m,       September 2009), which was attended by policy-makers including the       Minister of Human Rights.
Third, an International Conference on the Right to Truth, sponsored by the       Ministry of Justice and       the N&#250;cleo de Estudos da Viol&#234;ncia (S&#227;o Paulo, October 2009).
Payne spoke       of the findings of her       research [R1-R3] indicating that Brazilian democracy and human       rights would be enhanced by       adding trials to the mix of transitional justice mechanisms currently       debated in the country.
Although the country has resisted any justice for past human rights       violations, Payne`s research       reinforces the findings by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that       have condemned the       blanket amnesty law and reinforce the claims made by victims` groups.
Indeed, as the Chairman of       the Amnesty Commission recalls, Payne`s research reinforced and amplified       the domestic and       international pressure for trials [Section 5: C1] to complement       the amnesty law and truth       commission.
He notes that the victim groups at the truth commission       meeting added "and Justice"       to the nametags that had previously read "The Right to Truth."
[C1].
They thus used Payne`s       team`s finding that truth, justice, and amnesties in Brazil would likely       lead to stronger results for       democracy and human rights as a way to promote their demand that the       government not limit the       process to an amnesty plus truth commission, but also considered the       possibility of human rights       trials [R1-R3].
Payne et al.
have written about this event and its       impact [R5].
Colombia: Payne presented her research [R4] at an       international seminar in Colombia, on       `Negotiation with the Guerillas: Between Peace and Justice' (Bogota,       November 2010).
As part of       this visit, Payne was also asked by the Ideas of Peace Foundation and the       International Centre for       Transitional Justice-Colombia to discuss her work in private meetings with       all sections of the       judicial and political establishment concerned with the peace process:       thirty public prosecutors       involved with paramilitary cases, twenty clerks of the Supreme Court,       three Justices of the       Supreme Court, and the Chair of the Congressional Committee on Peace [C2].
According to a       member of the National Commission of Reparation and Reconciliation,       Payne`s `comparative       empirical analyses of the balance between justice, amnesty and other       mechanisms of transitional       justice have had an enormous impact on introducing a sense of reality into       the debates about the       justice policies that should be adopted to guarantee the success of the       transition' [C3].
Payne was       also invited to present her research in a conference aimed at adapting the       "Colombian model" for       Tunisia, "Rule of Law and Transitional Justice" sponsored by the German       government agency GIZ,       European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation       (EIUC), Venice Lido, 11-15       November 2012.
Uruguay: Payne`s team used the findings on amnesties [R4]       to successfully influence Uruguay`s       policymakers.
In May 2011, Uruguay`s Supreme Court of Justice had       determined that enforced       disappearance was an ordinary crime rather than an international crime       against humanity.
The       Court`s reasoning, when applied generally, made it impossible to prosecute       retrospectively any of       the crimes committed during the previous dictatorship, because they were       immune under the       statute of limitations stipulated by the criminal code.
In response to       this decision, Lessa contacted       Amnesty International`s legal adviser in Buenos Aires and offered the       resources of Oxford`s       Transitional Justice Database.
Using evidence from the research [R4],       Amnesty International`s       report (Sept. 2011) argued that international crimes are not subject to       statutes of limitations [C4].
The report was launched at a press conference in Montevideo that attracted       widespread public       attention.
This led Amnesty International to meet with the President of       the Supreme Court, with the       association of prosecutors, and with victims` lawyers, to lobby for       change.
Bowing to public       pressure, the government passed a law in October 2011 that overrode the       statute of limitations,       and redefined these crimes as crimes against humanity.
According to a       Member of Parliament in       Uruguay, Lessa and the team`s research `had an important impact on       discussions on how to come       to terms with the past ..., by offering her expertise on the topic and       directly contributing to debates'       [C5].
Payne`s research [R6] also informs international efforts to       foster peace.
The Royal United Services       Institute invited her to discuss her research at a workshop for       policy-makers in Whitehall (`Ending       Colombia`s Internal Conflict', January 2013).
She was also included in the       International Expert       Forum (IEF) on Peacebuilding and Post-Conflict Recovery on 23 May 2013 to       discuss her findings       [R4].
The IEF is a collaborative initiative of the Folke Bernadotte       Academy (FBA), the International       Peace Institute (IPI), the SecDev Group, and the Center for International       Peace Operations (ZIF),       and brought UN and NGO practitioners together with 60-70 scholars to       discuss peacebuilding.
One       of the comments after Payne`s talk emphasized how her research [R1-R6]       had overcome the       simplistic arguments `between those who advocate the use of war crimes       tribunals to punish evil to       deter such acts in the future versus those who argue for amnesty in order       to persuade all sides to       end the war in a negotiated settlement.'
This participant went on to say       that the value of Payne`s       research is that it provides `real data on the consequences...of       tribunals, truth commissions, and       amnesties rather than anecdotes about particular cases.'
[C6] The       chief organizer of the IEF       added that Payne`s presentation offered "policy-makers and       practitioners...the "big picture" instead       of case specific and selective anecdotes (which they usually come       across).`
