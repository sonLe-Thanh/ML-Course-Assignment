     The research and follow-on projects have had a major impact on special       and additional support needs policy in Scotland, England and Europe in       terms of raising awareness of parents' and children's rights and         methods of avoiding and resolving disputes.
The projects' findings were communicated in: i) a series of six working       papers and two briefings published on the website of the Centre for       Research in Education Inclusion and Diversity; ii) academic papers and a       book; iii) articles in publications aimed at practitioners such as Mediation         Now and Children in Scotland Newsletter; iv) a dissemination       conference, think tanks and a launch event at the Scottish Parliament       which attracted media coverage (Times Educational Supplement, 3rd       February 2012, `Pupils need a greater say in disputes over schooling, say       experts', URL 1); and v) a glossy publication aimed at parents and       practitioners distributed in a variety of ways including the website of       CREID and Enquire (the ASN Advice and Information Service for Scotland)       (URL 2).
Impact in Scotland     Recommendations were incorporated into the Education (Additional Support       for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009, including new duties on local       authorities to gather data on all children with additional support needs       plans and to improve access to information for parents and young people.
Evidence submitted to the Scottish Government's consultation on the       legislation by the National Deaf Children's Society cited the research       [5.1].
Findings were also cited in HMIE's report to Scottish Ministers on       the operation of the Additional Support for Learning Act.
The Review of       the Additional Support for Learning Act (HMIE, November 2010, page 10, URL       3) cited findings from research undertaken by CREID on behalf of the       National Deaf Children's Society.
The CREID research report, entitled The Impact of the Education         (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 on Deaf Children       explored levels of satisfaction with support services amongst parents of       children with hearing impairments.
The statistical analysis of the       relationship between ASN, looked after status and attainment level was       cited in the Equality and Human Rights Commission's Triennial Review       [5.2].
Findings were cited in the Strategic Review of Learning Provision for         Children and Young People with Complex Additional Support Needs,       known as the Doran Review, (Scottish Government, 2012) [5.3].
The paper by       Riddell and Weedon (2010) was used to illustrate the tensions over access       to information and services which frequently characterise the       relationships between parents and authorities (Section 1, para 1.1, p.15).
Data gathered by Resolve Mediation, a major provider of mediation       services in Scotland and a partner in the follow-on funding project,       indicate that the projects led to an increased take-up of mediation         services [5.4].
Their records of full mediations conducted by the       organisation reveal an increase from 12 mediations per year in 2005/06 to       49 in 2011/12.
Following the launch of Communication Matters, the glossy       publication aimed at parents and practitioners, a Parliamentary Question       was lodged requesting information on actions taken by the Scottish       Government to implement recommendations with regard to improving       communication and resolving disputes effectively.
The Parliamentary       Question and Government response is Question 10 under the Education and       Lifelong Learning Committee Question Time [5.5].
Impact in England     The ESRC project had an impact on the development of English policy with       regard to the resolution of SEN disputes.
For example, a standard       letter issued to all parents who lodge a tribunal appeal with the       First-tier Tribunal (Health, Education and Social Care Tribunal) in       England now includes a statement advising them to consider mediation prior       to launching an appeal.
Professor Harris was advised that the       recommendation to use mediation prior to appeal had led to an increase of       the overall annual settlement rate by 7.3% in 2011 compared with the       previous year.
The Green Paper Support and Aspiration: A New Approach to Special         Educational Needs and Disability (DfE, 2011) referred to the       research, noting that there will not always be agreement on the best form       of special educational provision for children and so there will continue       to be a need for the First-tier Tribunal.
It also identified a need to       develop further non-judicial routes such as mediation which, as       demonstrated by the research, are under-used (DfE, 2011, para 2.61) [5.6].
The research contributed to the evidence used in the Administrative       Justice and Tribunal Council's report Putting it Right &#8212; A Strategic         Approach to Resolving Administrative Disputes (AJTC, 2012).
The       report noted that SEN has been identified as an area of administrative       justice where mediation could play a role.
Paragraphs 89-93 (p.26)       summarise the findings and conclusions of the research concerning the       potential for much greater use of mediation despite its low uptake to date       [5.7].
Impact in Europe     NESSE (European Network of Experts in the Study of Social Aspects of       Education) commissioned Riddell to undertake a major review of literature       on special educational needs and disability.
In 2012, the EU Directorate       General (DG) of Education and Culture published the report, which drew       extensively on the analysis of policy and statistics within the ESRC       project.
In the foreword, the Director-General of the European       Commission's Directorate General for Education and Culture noted that `The       report is written specifically for policy and decision-makers, in       jargon-free language that can be understood and acted upon'.
In an email communication [5.8], an official in DG Education and Culture       reported on a meeting with DG Justice.
He commented that `There was       substantial discussion on the report.
The High Level Group members were       greatly interested, had all read the report in detail and were all       unreservedly enthusiastic about it.
They find it to be very useful for       their work, clear, authoritative, constructive and reader-friendly, at a       level of abstraction rightly pitched to inform and guide policy makers.
This discussion revealed that the report has had a profound impact on       national policy makers in the field of disability.
I communicated this       information to my hierarchy.
The Commission can take some pride in having       commissioned this report and you for having produced it.
It is a       successful contribution to evidence-based policy making at national       level'.
