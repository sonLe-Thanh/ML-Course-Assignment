     (a) General Impact     The research outcomes were first adopted by Ford Motor Company, the       primary sponsor of the work (specific details below).
The overall       methodology has also been adopted globally, with specific aspects reported       by Mitsubishi, Japan (vibro-acoustic approach and metrics for evaluation       of their gear rattle research, using the methodology in [3.6]) [5.3];       AVL, Slovenia (multi-body dynamic analysis with interfacial clutch       friction model for their dual clutch transmissions assessment, using the       methodology in [3.4]) [5.4]; DAF Trucks, Netherlands       (friction and clamp load characteristics in their clutch control work,       using the methodology in [3.4]) [5.5] and Valeo       Transmissions, France (gear teeth impact force analysis and clutch       interfacial friction representation for their drivetrain R&amp;D, using       the methodology in [3.6]) [5.6].
There have been many       other industrial and university teams who have adopted various aspects of       the described methodology; this has led to ~300 citations since 2000.
Graham Hoare (Vice President and Head of Ford Research and Development       Centre, Dunton, Essex) has stated: "Long term collaborative research         between Ford and Loughborough's Dynamics Research [Group] has brought         understanding and direct vehicle improvements with respect to NVH         refinement as outlined in this impact case study".
[5.7]     (b) Specific impacts     Specific impacts made with respect to three NVH aspects mentioned in       section 2 are:     1) Clutch in-cycle vibration (whoop):     Loughborough research identified the root cause of whoop as increased       flywheel conical whirl with crankshaft flexibility because of the use of       materials of lower elastic modulus alongside increased combustion power [3.3].
The impact of the flywheel on the clutch system during pedal actuation       induced natural mode vibration of the clutch lever assembly.
A       mass-damper, known as the "Diehl fix", was traditionally empirically used       as a method of palliation but this added 1-2 kg to the clutch weight,       occupied 100-200 cm3 in the engine compartment and had an       associated cost of $7 per vehicle over an annual production volume of 2       million vehicles Using the Loughborough methodology, optimisation of the       clutch cover compliance [3.3] eliminated whoop and the need for       the Diehl fix, saving $7 per vehicle.
The solution was implemented in a       range of new Ford models including the popular Fiesta and Focus brands       from 2004 onwards.
The modified vehicles used 4-cylinder, 1.8 litre       diesels with manual transmissions.
The implementation work is ongoing for       other vehicle models.
Ford has reported savings, conservatively put, at       $10 M [5.1].
(2) Driveline elasto-acoustic response (clonk):     Impulsive loading of the powertrain occurs with sudden throttle tip-in or       back-out, or by abrupt release of the clutch pedal.
These induce shock       wave propagation onto hollow thin-walled driveshaft tubes [3.5],       causing elasto-acoustic response up to an unacceptable 110 dB(A).
The most       cost effective solution, involving spun cardboard fitted liners, has been       implemented in some light trucks, vans and SUVs including some Transit       models, Galaxy and Escort vans from 2004 to the present day.
Technically,       there is a noise level reduction of 10-20 dB(A) and improved sound quality       through reduced high frequency sharp spectral content [3.1].
(3) Transmission rattle:     The fundamental research through to technological innovations carried out       by Ford and Loughborough for palliation of transmission rattle (2006-2010)       has already resulted in the development of light weight, NVH refined, fuel       efficient transmissions, including:     - 5/6 speed manual transmission (MX65) with a 5 kg reduced mass and 5%       improved fuel efficiency meeting the research specified metric of       impulsion ratio not exceeding unity.
- 7 speed manual transmission (MT90c) with reduced 2 dBA noise level and       5% fuel efficiency gain.
- Ford has invested in volume manufacture of these transmissions with an       investment of &#163;240 M in the UK at Bridgend [5.2].
