     The `value-added' of Lowe and Phillipson to the overall social and       economic impact of the Relu       programme was highlighted by the Independent Evaluation of the programme's       impacts       commissioned by the Research Councils.
Of note here is that it sees       "influence in the research and       science policy arenas, particularly in growth of acceptance of       interdisciplinarity in policy relevant       research and in a shift from a model of "Knowledge Transfer" to two-way       "Knowledge Exchange"       as a significant legacy from the programme, along with "Evidence of a set       of approaches that can       deliver research impacts".
It stresses how the Directorate experimented       "in ways to foster       Knowledge Exchange and related impact-generation" (p.6) (IMP1).
The innovations in knowledge exchange and interdisciplinary research       practice that were       developed and tested as `pathways to impact' by the Relu Director's office       had a significant effect       on many organisations involved in addressing rural land use problems.
The       Relu national       stakeholder forums acted as sounding boards on programme and project       development and       dissemination strategies.
For Wessex Water, a project forum "helped       crystallise our thinking on       how we approached catchment management" (IMP2); for the former       technical director at Marks       and Spencer it "influenced procurement strategies" (IMP2).
The       Assynt Foundation, following       involvement in a Relu Visiting Fellowship, said that it "helped to       encourage me to tackle some of       our practical problems in a more logical and perhaps scientific manner" (IMP2).
Relu's use of       digital technology enabled widespread interaction with stakeholders and       the public.
For example,       Relu's Great Land Use Debate attracted around 100 comments and 4500 hits,       and helped to set       the agenda for the Government's Land Use Futures Project (IMP2).
As their research and experimentation progressed, Lowe and Phillipson       were very active in       transferring their insights into wider science policy with subsequent       downstream impacts on later       research and its impacts.
Numerous high-level presentations and briefings       led to changes in UK       science policy and practice, including to the Government Chief Scientist,       a meeting of all of the UK       Chief Scientists, House of Lords, the G8 Research Assessment Group, Food       Standards Agency,       Natural England, the Food and Environment Research Agency and major       research partnerships       such as the Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) and Global Food       Security (GFS)       Programmes.
A significant briefing of the research councils in May 2012       led to Lowe, Phillipson       and Liddon (Relu Science Communication Manager from 2006) being invited to       work with the Chief       Executives of ESRC, BBSRC and NERC to change their ways of working in the       light of findings       from Relu.
Approaches and tools developed by Lowe, Phillipson and Liddon as part of       the Relu experiment       have been used within ESRC and NERC knowledge exchange and impact best       practice guides       (IMP3, IMP4) and within many national Research Council research       programmes to enhance       practical impacts.
These include mainstreaming of work shadowing and       visiting fellowship       schemes, stakeholder forums, a national Policy and Practice note series,       and highlighting a new       tool for measuring research impact (the Stakeholder Impact Analysis Matrix       &#8212; SIAM) that they       developed and tested.
By linking together engagement and the impact parts       of the SIAM dataset it       is possible to investigate what encourages successful knowledge exchange       and what kinds of       stakeholder relationships are associated with what kinds of impact.
Phillipson has held briefings       with Knowledge Exchange officials in the research councils on its wider       application and it is now       used to inform new research programmes.
Evidence of impact on knowledge       exchange strategy       include the following testimonials:             "building on the success of Relu's workshadow scheme, NERC also now           offers a workshadow           option &#8212; a more bottom-up approach, through which we have supported           some very successful           placements" (Faith Culshaw, NERC Knowledge Transfer team) (IMP2);       "[Relu insights] will be used to highlight the innovative ways in           which Knowledge Exchange and           Communications tools can be used to develop and deliver a pathway to           impact.
In particular,           we found [Relu] evidence that coproduction has a positive           impact on academic researcher as           well as users, particularly enlightening" (Fiona Armstrong, ESRC         Head of Knowledge Transfer)         (IMP2);        "LWEC has learned from Relu that focussing on the aims of research           with stakeholders from           the outset shifts emphasis away from discrete scientific disciplines           and onto the problems that           the research aims to solve" (IMP2).
The insights from the Relu programme also convinced Research Councils of       the value of       interdisciplinary research and provided them with an understanding of the       constraints as well as       knowledge of a range of techniques for enabling this approach.
The design       of major new       programmes, including interdisciplinary commissioning, assessment,       programme design and       decision making have been highly influenced by these insights.
For       example:             "One of the most significant impacts of Relu has been its           facilitation of the engagement of           biologists with social scientists.
BBSRC values the new cross-cutting           approaches,...to the           framing of scientific questions in ways that enhance the relevance of           research to policy and           practice ... [which] now need to be applied to "grand           challenges" such as global food security           and living with environmental change" (Head of Agriculture and         Food, BBSRC) (IMP2).
BBSRC's review of biological research relevant to climate change         recommended: "research           should build on experience from Relu... to study the interactions of           social and economic factors           with management for biodiversity in agricultural systems" (IMP5).
"Experiences with Relu have been very informative in terms of           developing approaches to all           aspects of commissioning interdisciplinary research" (NERC Head of         Science) (IMP2).
Relu is regarded "as a model for future and evolving           partnerships...Essential to creating a           strong environment to allow interdisciplinary research to flourish           under the programme has           been the way in which peer review has been conducted" (Senior ESRC         officer) (IMP2).
In 2012 Phillipson became the first Strategic Land Use Fellow of the         LWEC programme with a         brief to embed experience on interdisciplinary and knowledge exchange         procedures.
In a similar vein, government science funders embedded the findings into       new funding       programmes and science strategies, such as in the Foresight Land Use       Futures Project and in       Defra science policy and sub-programmes.
The Scottish Government's Rural       and Environmental       Research Programme included a commitment to build on Relu's approach to       impact assessment,       and the Social Strategy of the Marine Management Organisation makes       specific reference to       building on Relu, based on insights from Phillipson (IMP6).
Lowe,       through his membership of       Defra's Science Advisory Council, helped instigate a review of Defra       social research, drawing       extensively on Relu research findings.
The review recommended a       significant expansion of Defra's       social science capacity to support greater interdisciplinarity, embodied       in the Defra Evidence       Investment Strategy and influencing many areas of Defra's science policy (IMP7,         IMP8).
Further       endorsement of Relu's insights have been provided by Phillipson's       appointment to the Defra-DECC       Social Science Expert Panel, and to the Strategic Research Programme Board       of the Scottish       Government where he provides expertise in knowledge exchange and the       management of large,       multi-disciplinary research programmes (IMP9).
In conclusion, according to Sir Howard Newby (Chair of the Relu Strategic       Advisory Committee;       Vice Chancellor of University of Liverpool) "The experimentation and       research of Lowe and       Phillipson during the Relu programme have provided science funders and       policy makers with       insights into effective approaches for enhancing the impact of research,       viz, the structuring of       interdisciplinary research programmes and policies, interdisciplinary       research methods, and       collaborative knowledge exchange.
These findings were disseminated widely       during the Relu       programme, and a cultural shift in the approaches of science policy and       key funders of research in       the UK towards further interdisciplinarity and knowledge exchange are not       only apparent but also       acclaimed as emanating from these insights" (IMP10).
