     The DoEng's wholly-owned subsidiary, IfM ECS, has been the main vehicle       for dissemination of the research results to industry, through       publication, training and consultancy.
In the period from January 2008 to       July 2013, IfM ECS has used the research results to:            undertake more than 115 consulting projects both in the UK and         in 26 countries around the world, for organisations such as: AkzoNobel,         AstraZeneca, BAE Systems, BASF, BOC Linde, BP, BT, Caterpillar, GE         Healthcare, Henkel, Mars, PPG, Proton, Rolls Royce, Royal Mail, Rexam,         Sulzer, Syngenta, Unilever, and the UK government (Department for         Transport, Ministry of Defence and Technology Strategy Board [TSB])       run training courses for over 350 delegates from the public         and private sectors in 24 countries (all the courses being led by Phaal,         supported by other researchers)       publish the second of two books on roadmapping techniques         (co-authored by Phaal, Farrukh and Probert), to disseminate the         research-based findings to practitioners who can then apply the         techniques within their own organisations; versions have already been         produced that are tailored for Japanese, German and Brazilian         markets.
[6]          The main impact of the research, realised through these dissemination       activities, has accrued in terms of the improved business performance,       changed practices, and the adoption of new or changed technologies or       processes in the companies and public sector organisations which have       benefited directly from consultancy and training drawing on this research.
The details of the construction and benefits of strategic roadmaps in       major organisations are nearly always kept confidential because such work       is inevitably commercially sensitive, but the following examples       illustrate the benefits gained by organisations and the scale of decisions       influenced:            In 2012 the roadmapping methodologies were used to run workshops for         70 participants representing key interest groups across synthetic         biology.
The roadmapping considered the entire synthetic biology         landscape, covering key trends and drivers that could affect outcomes at         various stages.
Drawing upon this work, `A synthetic biology roadmap           for the UK' was published in July 2012.
The Chairman of the UK         Synthetic Biology Roadmap Coordination Group, commented: "The           roadmapping workshops were valuable to us in many ways.
They enabled           the effective sharing of understanding across the constituent           biological, engineering and social science disciplines, demonstrating           the value of pooling multidisciplinary expertise.
They illustrated the           breadth of issues that must be addressed now to ensure the benefits to           the UK envisaged from this sector can be delivered in the short and           long term.
Furthermore, they enabled us to take important first steps           in establishing an enthusiastically engaged community aligned behind a           shared vision of the future.
The UK is now well placed to develop           synthetic biology towards its goal of becoming a GBP 1bn industry,           delivering important benefits in key areas such as medicine,           renewables and underpinning technologies.
"[7] The roadmap was         cited by Rt Hon David Willetts as the basis for government policy and         investment strategy in January 2013, when he announced a GBP160m         investment "to support implementation of key recommendations from the           UK Synthetic Biology roadmap, including establishing multidisciplinary           research centres as well as a seed fund to support start-up companies.
"[8]       In 2009 IfM ECS used the strategic roadmapping approach with BAE         Systems (the global defence, aerospace &amp; security company with         annual sales of GBP17.8bn and a UK workforce of 33,000) to support the         development of its UK-wide skills programme.
Over 50 structured         interviews and an external review of the skills market fed into a         roadmapping event attended by 30 senior leaders from across the         business; the findings provided the basis of the company's `Skills 2020'         strategy, launched in 2010.
Follow-up work in 2013 will include applying         the roadmapping approach to strategic workforce planning, a key element         of the Skills 2020 recommendations.
The Education Director and Head of         Early Career Programmes, commented: "Skills 2020 is a co-ordinated           skills and education programme which touches every part of our UK           business and on which we spend GBP79 million annually.
The findings           from IfM's strategic road mapping exercise directly informed our           strategy for attracting, developing and retaining the flexible and           customer-oriented workforce that we and other UK manufacturers need in           this critically important decade.
"[9]       In 2011-12 IfM ECS used the roadmapping approach with the TSB to         support the development of its High Value Manufacturing Catapult         strategy (creating technology &amp; innovation centres where the UK's         businesses, scientists and engineers can collaborate to generate         economic growth) through workshops with a wide range of government,         industrial and academic collaborators.
The framework informed the         roll-out of the Catapult strategy which represents sustained public         funding of GBP140m over 6 years with the aim of transforming the UK's         innovation capability.
The approach was also applied to a number of         sector `deep dives' (including the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical         sectors), and the terminologies and themes identified are becoming a         `common currency' across TSB, BIS and EPSRC in the building of         manufacturing strategy.
The Lead Technologist at TSB commented: "The           output from the study was very significant in establishing the TSB HVM           Catapult strategy, and provides the framework for an additional           GBP25m/year investment by the TSB in economic growth through funded           innovation projects in manufacturing.
"[10]       In 2009/10 IfM ECS used the technology roadmapping approach with the         Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Automotive         Technology (AutoCRC) in partnership with the Australian National         University and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research         Organisation on behalf of the Australian Industry Ministry.
Workshops,         surveys and interviews with approximately 220 individuals from 160         organisations enabled the Australian Government to develop a clearly         articulated strategy for the automotive industry, and to set investment         priorities for the AUD1.3 billion Green Car Innovation Fund.
A Lecturer         at Australian National University, in his capacity as Project Manager of         Automotive Australia 2020, commented: "The Australian automotive           manufacturing industry is a significant contributor to the Australian           economy, exporting in excess of AUD3 billion in components and           vehicles, while providing more than 50,000 jobs.
As the global           automotive industry evolves, Australian vehicle manufacturing must           transform to remain competitive and internationally relevant.
IfM ECS           delivered the roadmapping architecture critical to defining the future           direction of this key industry, and bringing industry and research           together to realise key research objectives in lightweighting, gaseous           fuels, and electrification of vehicles.
Funding has included AUD25m           from the Australian government with matching funding from industry.
"[11]          The research has also led directly to GBP 3,479,758 in consultancy,       training, events and publication revenue for IfM ECS in the assessment       period.
