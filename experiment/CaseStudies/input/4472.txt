     The research described above was conducted between 2007-2010 leading       directly to the development of an innovative framework and toolkit of       resources to enable educators in tertiary education to use digital video,       and subsequently other digitised resources, in teaching, learning and       research.
It subsequently had impact on a wider group of educators, beyond       the tertiary sector, which included school teachers and teacher educators.
The framework has had the following four distinct levels of impact outside       of the University of Hull itself.
A. Local/institutional impact     The framework and underpinning research impacted directly on a number of       lecturers and teaching staff from across the UK, who used it as a resource       to structure their teaching approaches and materials.
Over one hundred and       fifty academics attended dissemination events between 2007-2008 and       evaluation data indicated overwhelming support and acceptance of the       approach advocated (1).
Follow up case studies in various UK Universities       conducted a year after these events showed that academics were actually       using the framework in their teaching to structure their use of video       resources (1).
B.
National Impact     Following the completion of the initial research The University of Hull       was commissioned by the Quality Improvement Agency (QIA ) on behalf of the       Further Education sector to develop a set of teaching and learning       exemplars to encourage teaching staff to use and create their own       digitised resources (e.g.
video, newspaper archives, images) for teaching       and learning.
Statistics indicate these have been viewed and downloaded       over 1000 times in the period 2009-2011.
This influenced the practice of       teaching staff in Further Education at a national level since the       resources created were hosted in a national repository on the Excellence       Gateway (4).
Seven FE colleges participated in this project and interviews       with staff demonstrated the model had changed their mind sets and       practices in the use of video.
Exemplars based on these interviews are       available at http://slcresources4adultlearning.net/index.php       (4).
Another impact at national level is the adoption and use of the framework       by EdMediaShare, a national organisation, funded by the JISC, which       promotes the use of media resources in post-16 teaching and learning.
This       service was launched in summer 2011 and includes direct reference to the       framework and the research underpinning it.
It has received over 12,000       visits in the period 2011-2012 (2).
C. European Impact     Outside of the UK the research and the framework itself were used as the       pedagogical basis for a major European project (2008-2011)(EduTubePlus)       which created a portal and a tool to support teachers in 17 countries to       integrate multilingual video clips into their practice.
The framework       became the central element of the EduTubePlus pedagogical framework and       was translated into each of the partner countries national language.
This       resource is available to teachers and other educators at http://www.edutubeplus.info/       Teachers and students from seventeen European countries have used the       resource (6)     D. International Impact (beyond Europe)     The framework produced from this research has gained the attention and       interest of educators at an international level.
The international       website, established in 2011 (http://dial-e.net/),       has been viewed 4631 times (as of July 2013) across 65 different       countries.
The project team have been invited to run workshops and speak       at major international teaching and learning conventions to share the       research with educators.
Two specific examples are included to illustrate       the impact of this research at an international level:            Use by teacher-educators: workshops and seminars were run at the         University of Technology (Sydney) Massey University (New Zealand) and         the Hong Kong University (CITE) in 2008-2009 where teacher educators         explored how the model could be adapted for use by teachers and         trainees.
In the case of (UTS) Sydney the model now forms part of the         programme for trainee teachers helping them to integrate the use of         media resources into their pedagogy (3)       Use by teachers and advisory ICT staff: in addition to teacher         education the model has been used as the basis of an international         collaboration between teachers and students in the USA (Florida) and         China in the Global Partnership Project.
Following a dissemination event         at the DIVERSE conference in Maine (2010) I was asked to provide         consultancy in establishing an international inter-cultural project         linking schools in Florida and China.
The focus of this project was the         DiAL-e model which was used by teachers in their respective schools to         help students understand the use of visual artefacts.
The model is         currently being used by teachers and ICT advisors in both countries.
