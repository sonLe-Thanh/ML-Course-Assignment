     Process from research to impact       Curtice has been a regular contributor to both print and broadcasting       media coverage of elections and voting behaviour in Britain for over       twenty years.
He has also been a consultant to the BBC's election night       programmes at every general election since 1979.
This has ensured that his       work on the British electoral system, and indeed his academic research in       general, is widely disseminated to the general public and comes to the       attention of politicians, civil servants, think tanks, political activists       and journalists.
At the same time, his understanding of the electoral       system together with polling methodology has been called upon in the       development and management of exit polls designed to enable broadcasters       to forecast the outcome of an election as soon as the polls close.
Curtice's research has had three distinct impacts.
A. Informing public debate and understanding of the British electoral         system       In the run up to the 2010 general election, Curtice disseminated the key       finding of his research, that the election was likely to result in a hung       parliament where no one party had an overall majority, and the reasons why       this was the case, to a range of non-academic audiences.
He wrote regular       articles for the The Independent, The Sunday Telegraph,       and The Scotsman newspapers (e.g.
source 1), wrote opinion pieces       for The Economist and Prospect magazine, and made many       broadcasts primarily, though not exclusively, for the BBC.
Curtice's       predictions and explanations of the electoral system were frequently cited       in subsequent newspaper commentary about the likely results.
For instance,       Polly Toynbee in her Guardian column, 7th April 2010, (source       2) drew on Professor Curtice's research in her assessment of the       possibility of a hung parliament: "After all these years of waiting,         the Liberal Democrats are closer to the brink of a hung parliament than         for decades.
There is, says Professor John Curtice, a 50% chance, as         virtually every poll currently predicts it.
There are reasons for doubt:         the marginals appear to be swinging some 2% more in favour of the         Conservatives.
In quarter of those seats the Labour MP is standing down,         losing the advantage a sitting MP usually gets of some 1,500 extra         votes.
But if ever there were a chance of no party winning outright, it         should be now.
The public welcomes a coalition: a Guardian/ICM poll         showed 44% want a hung parliament, with only 29% preferring Conservative         alone and only 24% Labour alone."
Alex Barker writing in the Financial Times, 27th April       2010, (Source 3) made similar points based on Curtice's research:     "Experts are divided over what the rise of the Lib Dems will mean.
Some argue that calculations suggesting Labour's set advantage are         overstated because they are based on a uniform national swing.
Others         such as John Curtice of Strathclyde University say the rise of the Lib         Dems &#8212; as it stands &#8212; will make no difference to the fact that Labour         wins a higher proportion of seats to votes.
Gordon Brown's proposal is         to reform the system by moving to an "alternative vote" model where         electors rank candidates according to preference.
But this could         actually accentuate the system's quirks, further exaggerating the bias         towards the biggest party."
Through these various means his research reached a large audience and       informed public debate in the run up to the election.
In the immediate       aftermath of the election, Curtice contributed to public understanding of       the result and the implications for future elections and the future of the       single member plurality electoral system.
He wrote several articles       explaining how the hung parliament came about in 2010 and why it could       happen again.
The key findings of his research and their implications for       future elections were presented to MPs and others in a lecture at       Portcullis House which was aired on BBC Parliament (source 4).
In that       lecture he explained why the electoral system can no longer be relied upon       to deliver a single party majority in the House of Commons.
Curtice's       research was widely drawn upon by politicians and media commentators in       the run up to the 2011 referendum on whether to change the UK electoral       system to the alternative vote system (Source 5).
B.
Influence on pre-election constitutional planning by the UK Civil         Service       In addition to shaping public debate before the 2010 election, Curtice's       pre-election predictions about a hung parliament were also taken seriously       by government officials.
Following a request by the then Prime Minister,       the Head of the Civil Service published for the first time a detailed       statement on the constitutional conventions that should be followed for       the formation of government after the election.
This statement, which has       since been incorporated into the Cabinet Office manual (source 6), took       direct account of Curtice's predictions.
The then Cabinet Secretary Sir       Gus O'Donnell confirms that:     "As Cabinet Secretary over the period 2005-2011, I was responsible for         coordinating civil service preparations for the outcome of the 2010         General Election and specifically for the eventuality of a hung         parliament and a potential coalition government.
In doing so, we used a         range of scenarios and purposely steered clear of accepting any         predictions from polls.
Nevertheless, we were aware that the polls meant         we needed to ensure we prepared for all outcomes including a hung         Parliament.
We knew, from media reports, of the predictions of Professor         John Curtice that the election was likely to result in a hung parliament         in which no one party had an overall majority and why.
As one of the         leading UK academic experts on elections, Professor Curtice's research         had a significant influence on our recognition of the need to prepare         for a hung parliament."
(Source 7)     C. Contribution to 2010 General Election night coverage on BBC News,         ITN and Sky News       Supported by Fisher and Kuhai, Curtice directed the analysis and modelling       of raw exit poll data collected by Ipsos-MORI and GfkNOP on polling day in       2010 on behalf of all three main UK broadcasting organisations (BBC, ITN       and Sky), using the approach previously developed in collaboration with       Firth.
To an average election night audience of 8.202 million viewers       (Source 8), at 10pm this analysis was broadcast simultaneously by all       three broadcasters, accurately forecasting that: (i) the Conservatives       would win 307 seats (resulting in a hung parliament); and (ii) that the       Liberal Democrats would win fewer seats than in 2005.
Though the first       prediction did not come as a surprise, the second contradicted most       expectations.
The results of Curtice's analysis informed much of the       broadcasting coverage of the initial result of the election including       on-air statements by prominent politicians (Source 9).
Subsequently       Curtice was responsible for providing for the BBC analysis of the election       results as they were declared, including above all their apparent       implications for the likely eventual overall outcome.
Sue Inglish, Head of       Political Programmes at the BBC confirms that:     "Professor Curtice was commissioned to undertake these tasks because         of his expertise in voting behaviour, electoral systems, the geography         of party support and survey methodology.
The work of Professor Curtice         and his team made a significant contribution to the election night         coverage of all three broadcasting organisations in general and the         BBC's in particular.
The exit poll provided us all with the invaluable         intelligence that (a) there was likely to be a hung parliament, and (b)         that the Liberal Democrats' performance was not going to meet most         people's expectations, intelligence that shaped the content and tone of         our coverage, including not least in interviews with senior politicians         during the course of the evening.
Meanwhile, his subsequent commentary         enabled the BBC to explain clearly and accurately to its many audiences,         the significance and implications of the election results as the story         unfolded over the following 24 hours" (Source 10).
