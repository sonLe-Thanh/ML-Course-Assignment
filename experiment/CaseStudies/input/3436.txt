     The SCCS method was widely used in 2008-2013 by health practitioners, and       has been recommended by the World Health Organisation and the European       Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [5.1].
Non-academic       practitioners using the method include public health officials at national       government-funded institutes (notably the US Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention (CDC)) and epidemiologists working in the private sector,       notably the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries [5.2].
The means by       which the research contributed to the impact is primarily the large number       of epidemiological studies using the SCCS method, alone or in combination       with other methods, and relating to pressing public health issues, which       were published in the medical literature over the period 2008-13.
The breadth of applications of the SCCS method demonstrates both its       reach and its impact.
The following two paragraphs document       (non-exhaustively) the range of investigations using the SCCS method that       were published in the medical and epidemiological literature in 2008-13       [5.3].
In vaccine safety studies, the SCCS method was used to study the safety       of off-label vaccines in elderly populations; epilepsy and influenza       vaccine; Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome and influenza vaccines; adverse events       after vaccination of premature children; febrile convulsions and childhood       vaccinations; multiple sclerosis relapse and influenza vaccination;       thrombocytopenic purpura and vaccinations; effectiveness of pandemic `flu       vaccine; emergency admissions and vaccinations; and metabolic disorders       and vaccines.
In non-vaccine epidemiology, the SCCS method was used to investigate       depression in patients with heart disease or diabetes; fracture and       hypertensive drugs; adverse events and proton pump inhibitors; risks       associated with antipsychotics; motor vehicle accidents and drugs; motor       vehicle accidents and medications; falls and antidepressants; vascular       events and invasive dental treatment; oral antibiotic prescribing and       pregnancy; fractures and thiazolidinediones; oral bisphosphonates and       heart problems; and antipsychotics and stroke.
The method was also used to       study vascular events after infections and in chronic respiratory disease.
The benefits of using the SCCS method are:            the ability to rapidly undertake low-cost, high-quality studies of         rare conditions, using computerised databases of clinical records       better control of time-invariant confounders than is normally possible         in other study designs such as cohort and case-control studies       to extend the range of study designs that can be carried out on the         same data set, which, owing to the contrasting assumptions they make,         can help throw new light on causal mechanisms.
This has led to several positive comparative reviews and recommendations       involving non- academic practitioners [5.4].
The methodological advance represented by the SCCS method has helped to       improve the quality and versatility of statistical methods in       pharmacoepidemiology, resulting in better studies and well- informed       medical decisions.
Two specific examples of how SCCS methodology has had       an impact on major public health issues are as follows.
Between 2008 and 2013, the SCCS method was used by GlaxoSmithKline and         the CDC to study the safety of the new Rotarix vaccine against rotavirus         infection, following the withdrawal of the Wyeth RotaShield vaccine         (confirmed by evidence from a 2001 study involving the SCCS method).
The         importance of this impact derives from the fact that, worldwide, it is         estimated that more than 500,000 children under 5 years old die annually         from rotavirus diarrhoea [5.5].
In 2008-2013, several SCCS studies were undertaken to investigate the         safety of influenza vaccination, notably in relation to Guillain-Barr&#233;         syndrome.
The issue shot to prominence in 2009 with the advent of H1N1         influenza A (`swine flu'), and the SCCS method was used by several         agencies to investigate the safety of influenza vaccines against various         influenza strains [5.6].
