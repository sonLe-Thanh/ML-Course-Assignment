     The Chemistry Department's outreach and public engagement activities are       strongly connected to its exceptional research.
Almost all academic staff       have an accessible talk on their research suitable for a range of       audiences.
Public lectures introduce audiences to the fundamental ideas of       chemistry in engaging ways, in an effort to reduce the marginalisation of       chemistry within society and promote general public interest in chemistry.
UCL researchers' ability to engage non-specialist audiences in their       research has led to further invitations to present on chemistry more       broadly.
Promotion of chemistry to school pupils: The department has been       extensively involved in The Training Partnership's A-level student lecture       programme.
Since 2008, 15 sell-out lectures, on topics such as atmospheric       and ice chemistry, have been given to nearly 14,000 pupils (underpinned       by, for example, outputs 1,2,5).
The Training Partnership said: "The         fact that UCL speakers have taken part on several, and in numerous cases         many, occasions indicates a high level of approval from students and         teachers... [The] chemistry department has performed a service of         inestimable value not just to chemistry but ultimately to developing the         nation's skill base and potential for knowledge-driven growth."
[a]     The Chemistry Department regularly holds lectures for schools attracting       400 pupils per year from more than 45 schools.
Since 2008, this series has       included lectures to inform pupils about its research on atmospheric       chemistry (Rowley, output 5), nanomaterials (e.g.
output 9), and materials       design and prediction (Catlow, Lewis, output 6).
Eight schools have found       the talks so useful that they have attended more than four lectures.
Talks       have also regularly been delivered to A-level students through the UCL       Science Centre, with 16 such talks each delivered to between 300-500       students in the REF period.
Talks to individual schools, often       demonstration lectures, are increasingly done by postgraduate students       speaking about research in their supervisor's area.
This provides pupils       with the chance to talk to real researchers of a similar age to their own.
The department's success in introducing its research in schools led to       invitations to present on chemistry as a wider subject.
For example,       Sella's lecture, "How the Zebra got its Stripes", about the crucial role       of chemical feedback mechanisms in natural pattern formation that also       asks profound questions about faith, has been given to over 38,000 GCSE       students at 26 GCSE ScienceLive events held since December 2008.
GCSE       ScienceLive, which takes place across the UK, is a day-long event       consisting of talks from the country's most prestigious scientists to       inspire GCSE students to continue to study science.
Participant feedback       includes: "Before I had attended Science Live I had only chosen to         attend for the chance to miss a day of school (...) I also had no idea         what career path I was going to choose.
But after your words on why I         should become a scientist (which shook my religious beliefs, which I         adhere [to] with conviction) I've decided that you are right, and         consequently for work experience placements I am visiting both Norwich         University Hospital and hopefully something else science-related.
Thank         you so, so much."
[b]     Stimulation of public interest and engagement in science: Sella       has spearheaded much of the outreach work, with the EPSRC awards       specifically enabling him to promote chemistry and establish himself as       the UK's foremost public exponent of chemistry.
The success of Sella's       fellowship is highlighted by an article in New Scientist: "It has often       been said that chemistry needs a champion in the mould of Brian Cox or       Richard Dawkins.
That is starting to happen with the arrival of such       popularisers as Andrea         Sella of University College London" [n].
As a result, he has not       simply presented science directly related to his own research (e.g.
a       video on didymium, which is composed of rare earth metals, has been       watched over 21,000 times since December 2012 [c]), but because of this       underpinning research he has also been instrumental in bringing a broad       range of the department's chemistry to a wider audience, through regular       radio and TV appearances.
The department's research on thermodynamic properties of matter including       phase diagrams [output 4] led to Sella contributing to BBC Four's The         Secret Life of Ice in October 2011, which had 0.47m viewers in the       UK [j].
It also aired in 8 countries, including the USA, Canada and       Australia, helping promote chemistry among a global public audience.
In       late 2012, this contribution was developed into a demonstration lecture       called Strange Ice, which has been delivered to 2,700 sixth-form       pupils through the Training Partnership's "Chemistry in Action" events,       and audiences at Cambridge, Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science festivals.
The Training Partnership stated "the feedback on the most recent UCL       presenter, Sella in autumn 2012 and spring 2013 for `Strange Ice', ranged       from `outstanding' to `motivating' and `exceptional'" [a].
The platform created by presenting departmental research, combined with       Sella's ability to translate complex subjects for the public, led to       repeat invitations to act as consultant and contributor on major       television and radio productions.
This has included ongoing collaboration       with, among others, the BBC.
For example, he acted as consultant and       recorded demonstrations for the award-winning documentary The Secret         Life of Chaos, again utilising his expertise in thermodynamics       [output 4], presented by Jim Al-Khalili and first broadcast on BBC Four in       Jan 2010 (0.53m viewers [j]).
The programme won the Best Film prize at the       International Science Film Festival 2010 and the Association of British       Science Writers' best scripted television programme award [d].
A senior       BBC producer confirms Sella's important contribution to programmes across       the entire spectrum of BBC broadcasting: "He is terrific at translating       the complex and intangible into focused, accessible information which can       be incorporated into science programmes to make them multi-textured,       fascinating and entertaining to a wide variety of audiences."
[i]     Sella also contributed to and appeared on the BBC Four 3-part series Chemistry:         A Volatile History in January 2010, which he ensured contained an       appropriate mixture of historical context and scientific rigour.
This       series holds the record for the highest audience of any science series on       BBC Four and was consistently one of the channel's top 2 broadcasts       throughout the series, demonstrating that the public engaged with the       topic (0.74m viewers tuned in to the first episode) [j].
It was nominated       for a 2010 Specialist Factual BAFTA [h].
It also aired in the USA.
Online       comments were positive, including: "I learnt more in these 4 viewings         than during 3 years of weekly chemistry lessons at college"; "Superb.
The opening episode of this series was simply excellent, with an         engaging presenter, well demonstrated experiments and evocative         locations", and "If only all chemistry lessons were this good at         school, we'd all become scientists" [f].
His other work has included       contributions to the BBC Four 2-part series Everything and Nothing       (March 2011, 0.43m viewers); the 3-part Science and Islam (Jan       2009, up to 0.42m viewers per episode); the BBC Two 6-parter The Story         of Science: Power, Proof and Passion (May 2010, 1.56-2.25m viewers       per episode); and Channel 4's Heston's Tudor Feast (March 2009,       2.6m viewers) [j].
A BBC presenter noted that without Sella's       "fundamental" input, many science series "wouldn't make it to screen" and       was a crucial source for promoting science to young children: without it,       "there would be little chemistry and much smaller audiences on [CBBC]"       [o].
Presentations to general audiences: Sella's engagement activities       extend beyond his media outreach, with talks to the general public, such       as contributions to the Cheltenham Science Festival.
Between 2008 and       2013, he delivered 24 presentations and 4 discussions to audiences of up       to 600 members of the public per session.
These talks consistently drew on       departmental research; for example he curated a discussion between Dr       Lewis and architect Magnus Larsson to draw attention to the parallels       between deliberate design of porous structures such as zeolites and the       design of large-scale structures in which bacteria transform sand into       sandstone.
He brought superhydrophobic surfaces [output 8], supercooled       water [outputs 1,2], phase diagrams and high- pressure science [output 4]       to this and other Science Festivals, as part of presentations including       the Overambitious Demo Challenge, Molecular Mastery, The Science of         Cocktails, and Mercury: Window on the Invisible.
His talk Chemistry         and Architecture was underpinned by Catlow and Lewis's work into       computer-aided materials design [output 6].
A Festival organiser confirms       that Sella's events "all received good feedback from members of the       audience...
The comments included how enthusiastic Andrea is and how it       has motivated them to learn more or increased their understanding of the       topic.
The style of his events, which often include demonstrations, also       helps to draw in audiences that might not want to attend debate or lecture       style events" [g].
Since 2009 UCL researchers have been involved in Bright Club, a monthly       comedy event based on the participants' research (including the work of       Rowley and Parkin), run by the UCL Public Engagement Unit.
Bright Club       brings researchers to a new audience: 20-50 year olds who have no existing       relationship with academia.
The reach of these events is increased further       by free podcasts available on iTunes.
Sella has also played an important       part in the science-based comedy event Festival of the Spoken Nerd       (FoTSN), performing to over 1,200 people over the past three years.
One of       the organisers of FoTSN says: "The chemistry demos are without a doubt the       most talked-about part of the show on the night, on social media, and for       days afterwards."
[e]     Online outreach activities: The department has also undertaken a       number of online activities to engage the public with its research,       helping reach a far wider, international audience.
For example, a 2009       collaboration with Sciencefilms and Labreporter led to the development of       six "Lab Report" short videos on CVD, atmospheric chemistry and       carbon-carbon bonds.
These videos were posted on YouTube and had, as of 31       July 2013, been viewed some 25,000 times [m].
Meanwhile, Hirjibehedin       instituted a citizens' science project titled Feynman's Flowers,       which uses online participatory methods to educate the public about       molecular spintronics; the project webpage received around 1,800 unique       visitor hits from almost 80 countries since Sept 2012 [k].
The interfaces, catalytic and environmental group's exhibit on the       properties of water at the nanoscale, at the 2010 Royal Society Summer       Science Exhibition, included a free iPhone game called Waterfall that       users in 73 countries downloaded 4,265 times.
During the impact period,       the 25+ videos on the group's YouTube channel were collectively viewed       110,000 times [l].
