     The described research shows that the HIF-1 pathway is an excellent       therapeutic target and the potential of gold nanoparticles as an excellent       delivery platform for the specific delivery of the drugs targeting this       pathway.
The research has had an impact on both Industry and the workings       of International Institutions.
Two international institutions have altered       the direction of their work by being influenced by this research       and two SMEs have revised their operational procedures and invested in         the applied research that derives from this work.
Clear       collaborative links with all four organisations have resulted directly       from the research described which has facilitated technical knowledge       transfer.
The European Commission Joint Research Centre, Institute for Health and       Consumer Protection, Ispra, Italy (JRC, Ispra) is a department of the       European Commission.
Its primary mission is to provide independent       evidence-based scientific support to underpin European policies in a       variety of areas including Health and Consumer Protection (5.1).
Following       a presentation of initial elements of this research by Sumbayev at a       Nanobiotechnology workshop organised by JRC, Ispra in 2010, the two groups       initiated a collaborative programme to take the research further,       resulting in joint publications (3.5, 3.6).
In 2011, JRC, Ispra invested       substantial resources into the establishment of a method to visualise the       interactions of nanomaterials with human myeloid cells.
Before the       interaction with Sumbayev and Gibbs, the focus of JRC Ispra's research in       this area was, primarily, a characterisation of the physical and chemical       properties of nanomaterials.
As a result of the research described here       and subsequent collaborative interactions, the department has "expanded         its existing research focus in order to help elucidate the biological         effects of nanomaterials related to inflammation, allergy and leukaemia"       (5.2) with a particular interest in supporting the development of safe       nanomaterials as part of their Health and Consumer Protection portfolio.
The Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina, Bellinzona, Switzerland       (Institute for Research in Biomedicine) is a private, non-academic       research institute led by Professor A. Lanzaveccia, a world-leading expert       in immunology.
It was founded in 2000 with the goal of advancing the study       of human immunology.
Within the Institute for Research in Biomedicine, the       laboratory of Dr. Varani specialises on the generation of antibodies       against highly virulent pathogens.
Following Sumbayev &amp; Gibbs research       and subsequent discussions, Varani's laboratory has "opened a new         field of research on the use of functionalised gold based nanomaterials"       for the "specific delivery of inhibitors" (both direct and       indirect) of the HIF-1 pathway in target cells with a particular focus on       "cells involved in leukaemia allergy and autoimmunity" (5.3).
Varani's laboratory has also "financed and established a system for         production of fully functional human IL-1&#946; and stem cell factor"       to advance this research (5.3).
Two SMEs, IZON Science Ltd (IZON) and BOOST Technologies B.V. (BOOST)       have been influenced by this research and "invested in applied         research as a result".
IZON specialises in the characterisation of       nanomaterials.
They have "invested resources in the characterisation         of gold nanomaterials in order to specifically target leukaemia cells",       in light of the research described here (5.4).
BOOST specialises in the       generation of nanomaterials and have previously focused on the       functionalisation of nanomaterials with peptides.
Now they have committed       resources to generate functionalised nanomaterials and nanovaccines based       on the findings" described here (5.5).
All four institutions (JRC Ispra, Institute for Research in Biomedicine,       IZON and BOOST) have joined together with Sumbayev, Gibbs and colleagues       in Kent and other academic partners in Denmark and Italy as part of the       NANOVAC consortium (5.6).
The consortium is currently in the process of       preparing proposals for the Horizon 2020 EU Framework Programme for       Research and Innovation (value &gt; &#163;4 million) in order to develop       nanoconjugates and nanovaccines for use as therapies against cancer and       allergic diseases.
They have also recently applied for an Asthma UK       Capacity-Building PhD Studentship entitled "Highly specific targeting of       mast cell and basophil function using nanomaterials".
These proposals       arose directly from the findings of the research described here and       subsequent collaborative links between the partners and provide evidence       that the impact that arises is dependent on the research links.
In       addition, the research has clear impact potential for Health and Welfare       with innovative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of allergy,       leukaemia and other autoimmune disorders.
