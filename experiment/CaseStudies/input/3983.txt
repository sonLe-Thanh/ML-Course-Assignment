     The impact of this case study is demonstrated through the development of       local and global       communities, who are reconceptualising the nature of educational research       and theory through (1)       engaging in their individual and collaborative action enquiries; (2)       producing their dissertations and       theses in the form of their personal theories of practice; (3) developing       dialogical communities of       educational enquiry for collaborative knowledge production.
The aim is to       improve education and       serve the public good through developing a new epistemology for a new       scholarship of learning       and teaching.
While much of the research has been conducted with higher       education practitioners,       in this case study the emphasis is on the impact of the research on those       beyond academia &#8212; most       notably teachers, but importantly also health professionals &#8212; who have       come to use her work as a       means of linking practical and theoretical knowledge for individual and       social transformation.
Impact on developing dialogically-oriented institutional         epistemologies     Through working with groups of school, hospital, and university staff,       the research has influenced       the development of new institutional and organisational epistemologies of       practice and cultures of       enquiry.
As far as impact beyond the level of universities is concerned,       this can be evidenced in,       for example:            Norway: where McNiff is Visiting Professor at the University of Troms&#248;         to support faculty in         Health Sciences to develop a practice-based research culture for         improving service delivery         to ensure enhanced patient wellbeing.
The ultimate focus is on improving         the professional         learning of student nurses and healthcare practitioners.
Some initial         evidence of impact is         listed in the sources of corroboration (below).
Qatar: where Professor McNiff headed a team to deliver an action         research-based teacher         professional education programme.
This fulfilled the National         Professional Standards for         Teachers.
This is offered as evidence of significant impact in that a         national education         system has adopted her research approach as a means of improving the         quality of         teaching, and, ultimately, of learning outcomes, in its schools.
Sponsored by the national         government, led by Professor McNiff, the input has ongoing impact in         Qatari schools; the         underpinning research (above) outlines part of what was involved and the         sources of         corroboration (below) include examples of outcomes directly related to         her research         involvement.
United Arab Emirates: where Professor McNiff has worked with school         staff to develop new         inclusional and dialogically-oriented curricula and programmes.
One         venture in Dubai has         been a whole-school approach to action research for improved practice         and student         outcomes.
This is reported in a conference paper listed below as a         source of corroboration.
Impact on new criteria and standards     Through working with workplace practitioners and university faculty, new       criteria and standards       have been developed for judging quality in practice-based research.
For       the purposes of this case       study, the reference to universities is merely to show how it is through       her work at HE level that the       practitioners following McNiff's approach to action research have had       their work validated.
McNiff       has sought successfully, therefore, to work with practitioners examining       their own practice while at       the same time to work with HEIs to have the study of that practice       accepted at postgraduate       research level.
This is evidenced in doctoral programmes and journal       publications, as follows:            South Africa: where PhD theses and journal articles are produced         drawing on her work to         explain how values transform into living criteria and standards of         judgement: from Nelson         Mandela Metropolitan University (e.g.
http://aru.nmmu.ac.za/Home,         http://aru.nmmu.ac.za/Projects/Action-Research-for-School-Leaders);         University of the Free         State (e.g.
http://academic.sun.ac.za/chae/bitzer/ACTA%20%20Academica.2007.%20Submitted%20Action%20Research%20Article.pdf); Stellenbosch University;         NorthWest University).
Ten         practitioners in the township of Khayelitsha have been awarded their         Masters degrees         through action research: see http://www.jeanmcniff.com/kayelitsha.asp.
Ireland: where seven PhD action research theses were validated by the         University of         Limerick (see http://www.jeanmcniff.com/theses.asp)       UK: where nine students studying with YSJ are being awarded their PhDs         for offering their         theses as explanations for their work (the first PhD awarded in 2013).
Impact on collaborative networks and dialogical communities     Through working with institutional communities around the world to       develop collaborative networks       and dialogical communities:            USA: where the new Action Research Network of the Americas (ARNA)         acknowledges the         impact of her work on its philosophy (see         https://sites.google.com/site/arnaconnect/planning-messages/jeanmcnifftodeliverarnainauguralkeynoteaddress         for information about her         keynote address for the inaugural meeting)       Iceland: where she gave the keynote presentation at a new action         research association,         again based on her work (see Gudjonsson, in McNiff (ed.)
2013b)       South Africa: where she collaborated in developing an action research         unit at the Nelson         Mandela Metropolitan University (see above)       New Zealand: where she visited with ten HE institutions, working to         embed action research         in practice-based settings (e.g.
see http://tlcommunityunitec.ning.com/profiles/blogs/a-morning-with-jean-mcniff         and         http://tlcommunityunitec.ning.com/main/sharing/share?id=3664184%253ABlogPost%253A22645)          UK: where she co-convenes the Value and Virtue in Practice-Based Research       International       conference: see http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/education--theology/faculty-of-education-theo/faculty-events/value-and-virtue.aspx
