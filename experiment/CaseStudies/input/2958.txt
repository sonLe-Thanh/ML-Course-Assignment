     Context: Prior to this research, wildfire was barely recognised as       a significant semi-natural hazard       in the UK, despite UK Fire and Rescue Services recording on average 70,000       `grassland' fires a       year [1].
The research outlined above, undertaken alongside PDNP, has led       the way in gaining       recognition by national policymakers of wildfire as a hazard, ultimately       changing the way wildfire is       recorded.
The Cabinet Office acknowledges the importance of this change,       noting that McMorrow       was "one of the first experts consulted by the CCS Olympic Team about         possible wildfire risk to the         Olympics... [her] work has been paramount in getting wildfire and         its management recognised on         the National Risk Assessment" [2].
Impact 1 &#8212; PDNP: More specifically the research has had tangible       direct impacts on fire       preparedness planning in the PDNP.
As they attest, this has led to radical       policy change:     The mapping and forecasting work was based on our unique &gt;37 year         record of wildfires         recorded in the PDNP Rangers fire log.
We have taken up Julia's         recommendations for         improving the way in which we record the geo-location of fires and fire         perimeters, and for         linking our records to Fire Service incident data.
It has added value to         the Rangers fire log for         further GIS analysis, and is an example of how co-produced applied         research can feed back         to improving capacity for future research.
Other local fire groups have         also taken up these         recommendations (for instance, West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service         now record wildfire         perimeters)... We have also published a Research Note on the wildfire         risk mapping as a         way of reaching other practitioners.
[3]     In particular, risk mapping has assisted in three key ways:             Forming the basis for planning the `ranger early wildfire warning           system' which has         already been estimated to have averted five large fire incidents, each         with potential fire-fighting         costs of up to &#163;1M, and threatening &gt;&#163;16M investment in peatland         restoration (&#163;8M to date;         &#163;8M to 2015).
UoM research provided the evidential basis for siting fire         ponds and a full         assessment of water resources for fire fighting [D]; PDNP's Science         Programme Manager         subsequently verifying that: "This best practice in turn is leading           to economic and societal           benefits in operational cost and protection from loss of amenity,           extending well beyond the           Peak District to other National Parks and upland areas of the United           Kingdom" [3].
Recommendations on recording wildfire geo-location and           cross-referencing were           followed, resulting in a more spatially robust, co-ordinated         database [3].
Forecasting and mapping outputs are now being combined by           contractors, towards the         development of an interactive exhibit for the Moorland Centre.
The goal         is to raise public         awareness of the increased wildfire risk resulting from climate change         [3].
Impact 2 &#8212; FIRES/EWWF: Work with PDNP led to the ESRC-NERC funded       Fire Interdisciplinary       Research on Ecosystem Services (FIRES) seminar series, convened by       McMorrow, with the       PDNP's `Moors for the Future' stakeholder partnership as co-investigators.
FIRES brought together       scientists, policy-makers and practitioners, and for the first time       included significant input from the       regional Fire and Rescue Services.
The output from this series was an       influential co-produced       policy brief [1], circulated within the Cabinet Office [2].
As the Chair       of the `Chief Fire Officers       Wildfire Group' confirms: "Such was the quality of the Policy Brief,         that I used it to raise the         awareness of wildfire issues affecting UK FRS's by circulating it to all         Chief Fire Officers and         members of the Chief Fire and Rescue Advisors Unit at the Department for         Communities and Local         Government (DCLG).
This continues to be the case, and the work is as         relevant now as it was         when first produced in 2010.
The FIRES Policy Brief also formed a         cornerstone of the initial CFOA         Wildfire Group's initial Action Plan" [4].
FIRES created impact in the form of social capital, building a wide       community of stakeholders that       ultimately helped the English Wildfire Forum to expand into a new England       and Wales Wildfire       Forum (EWWF) and become a more pro-active `community of practice', unusual       by virtue of its       `cross-sector' composition [4].
EWWF now has &gt;25 members from: English       and Welsh Central       Government (the Cabinet Office, Department for Communities and Local       Government {DCLG},       Ministry of Defence, etcetera); Department for Environment, Food       and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)       agencies (the Met Office, the Forestry Commission, Natural England); Fire       services; NGOs; and       private sector land management groups.
Currently led by the Northumberland       Fire and Rescue       Service, it has quickly become the `go to' body that Government turns to       for advice on wildfire.
McMorrow was one of only two academics invited to join, based on her key       role within FIRES       (including a follow-on survey of stakeholder priorities, emerging from the       key messages within the       policy brief).
In the words of the Cabinet Office: "She has         been an important and influential member         of that group ever since [joining], giving it academic vision and         authority and contributing to many         of the excellent products from the group.
It is clear that her knowledge         and expertise has been         invaluable in moving the group into an evidence-based, cross-cutting         body, on whom the UK may         come to rely during any wildfire outbreak... She has already offered the         Cabinet Office, DCLG and         DEFRA great assistance with regard to wildfire" [2].
Additionally,       EWWF:             Distributed the FIRES policy brief to all Chief Fire Officers         and members of the Chief Fire         and Rescue Advisors Unit at DCLG [4]        Cited recommendations from the FIRES policy brief in their         written evidence to the         Select Committee on Rural Affairs on the Natural Environment White paper         in 2011 [5]          Impact 3 &#8212; FIRES/NERC: One of the key findings of the FIRES policy       brief was that fire reporting       standards were a barrier to evidence-based policy delivery.
This finding       was strongly influenced by       experience gained from stakeholder-driven data collection.
As a result of       this finding, McMorrow       was invited by the Chief Fire Officers Association wildfire group: to work       on improvements to the       FRS Incident Recording System (IRS); to ensure robust wildfire reporting       in support of `Community       Risk Registers' and `Integrated Risk Management Plans'; and to evaluate       IRS data for GIS       analysis of national wildfire risk.
As confirmed, McMorrow is "currently         one of only two experts         invited to advise this group... [her] experience of working with         Incident Recording System (IRS)         data and using GIS to analyse it, has been integral to the current IRS         review process" [6].
This       approach has since been taken up by the Forestry Commission for DEFRA.
This led to subsequent       invitations to join DCLG's Fire and Rescue Statistics User Group &#8212; a group       who advise on changes       to IRS &#8212; as well as the Fire Sector Federation's `Fire Research and       Statistics Forum' [4].
In 2013,       Natural England invited McMorrow to join DEFRA's Best Practice Burning       Group &#8212; the stakeholder       group tasked with developing the `Heather and Grass Burning Code' for       moorland managers &#8212; where       she is currently co-developing a best practice guide on the reduction of       moorland wildfire       risk.
FIRES has promoted a step-change in partnership activity [3], with UoM       setting up a number of       experimental field burns, alongside three regional Fire and Rescue       Services (Northumberland,       Greater Manchester and Dorset) and five UK universities.
This led to KCL's       NERC project and a       new SME (FireLab) [4], which would have been unlikely without FIRES       bringing together Fire       Officers and academics, notably at the FIRES3 meeting on modelling and       forecasting.
Moreover,       the Dorset experimental burns were featured on the CBBC `Fierce Earth'       programme [4].
Impact 4 &#8212; International Influence: Through her research, and the       subsequent links developed       between the policy and practice aspects of wildfire research, McMorrow was       appointed as an       NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellow in order to further exploit her unique       standing [3].
This has       served to progressively integrate research findings into policy and       practice, propagating the       research more widely.
In addition to a treatise on `Wildfire in the UK'       being included in a U.S.       Department of Agriculture, Forest Service report [A], the Irish Forest       service have also noted that:       "the recent direct involvement of Ms. McMorrow with one of our current         wildfire policy actions... led         to a rapid acceleration and completion... and considerable savings to         our department in terms of         time and public resources... a direct consequence of Ms. McMorrow's         knowledge" [7].
Impact 5 &#8212; National Policy: In 2009 McMorrow was asked to assist       in the drafting of a response       to DEFRA's Climate Change Risk Assessment.
This resulted in a change of       national policy, with       DEFRA including wildfire in its National Adaptation Programme [8].
Two       years later, McMorrow's       expertise proved vital after the April 2011 fires across the home nations       (e.g.
Swinley Forest in       Berkshire, Anglezarke in Lancashire and the Highlands and Islands of       Scotland).
In the words of       the Cabinet Office's Civil Contingency Secretariat (CCS): "Fire and         Rescue Services were         stretched to respond.
A select and trusted group of the EWWF were called         upon to advise         government, both to the response and recovery aspects of this event and         Julia was one of the first         people called.
Her mapping skills and knowledge were extremely         important".
In 2012, the Cabinet       Office agreed to include wildfire in the `Olympic Risk Register', and as       noted McMorrow was one of       the first experts contacted by the Government [2].
Finally, in 2013 it was       announced that wildfire       would be included in the `National Risk Assessment' &#8212; a move directly       attributable to McMorrow's       research.
As noted by the CCS, the increasingly use of data from space was       a catalyst for this       decision, with McMorrow's `long-standing involvement' in the UK Earth       observation Community a       key factor [2][4].
Research impact continues to grow as risk assessments       are rolled out through       `Local Resilience Forums' and regional Fire and Rescue Authorities.
Furthermore, McMorrow's       research and knowledge exchange activities around wildfire continue to       influence local practice       and national policy, with an increasing emphasis on the link between       climate change and risk       management, as "the risk of wildfires... is expected to increase in         future, with hotter, drier         summers" [9].
