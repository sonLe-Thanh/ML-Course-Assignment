     In May 2013, Barclays bank announced its decision to close the accounts       of UK MSBs operating in Somali territories, following an international       crackdown by regulators on banks whose intermediaries might link them to       the funding of terrorism (1, below).
As the only remaining large UK bank       to hold such accounts, Barclays' actions threaten to sever the financial       lifeline for millions of Somalis who rely on remittances to meet their       basic needs, and will severely hinder re-building of the region.
Hammond's report and earlier SOAS research have made a significant       contribution to efforts made by charities, NGOs and Somali diaspora       communities to raise awareness of the pivotal role of remittances in the       Somali territories, and the potential humanitarian disaster that could       result from Barclays' decision.
Scott Paul, Oxfam America's Senior       Humanitarian Policy Advisor focusing on East Africa, confirms Hammond's       contribution, stating that her FSNAU report greatly informed Oxfam's       global campaign to persuade banks and policymakers to develop new       regulations for MSBs that would keep the remittance channel open (2):     "Her FSNAU report answered many questions that we were previously         unable to answer, adding depth to the information we had.
We have used         the statistics from it in our top-line messaging, which has helped us to         publicise how remittances are used to meet very basic needs, often in         rural areas.
Her research thus broke new ground and de-bunked the myth         that remittances tend to go to wealthy urban dwellers who could         otherwise survive without them.
Before the FSNAU report, we could not         say with confidence that the threat to remittances was a humanitarian         issue.
It gave us the confidence to put out campaign messages against         the closure of the accounts of MSBs".
The report's findings have also been cited widely by journalists covering       the story, particularly Mary Harper, Africa Editor at the BBC World       Service with a special interest in Somalia, who has relied extensively on       Hammond's research in her own writing and broadcasting on the subject (3,       4):     "The FSNAU report was particularly valuable to me.
The statistics were         very, very useful when trying to break and back up a story on the         closure of remittance services.
Hammond's data adds immense weight to my         journalism and makes what I have to say more credible".
Hammond herself has been directly involved in an international campaign       to protect remittance flows to the Somali territories, together with       Somali community members, the Somali Money Services Association,       journalists and other academics.
A key aspect of the campaign was       Hammond's letter to the FCO urging it to request that Barclays extend the       deadline for closing accounts, to help Somali MSBs find alternative       banking partners, and to convene discussions to develop enhanced due       diligence mechanisms for MSBs.
Over a hundred international academics,       researchers and aid practitioners signed the letter in just 48 hours, and       an online e-petition was signed by over 100,000 people.
Linked to the       campaign, Hammond was cited in and interviewed by BBC World (TV), BBC       Business Report (Radio), BBC London TV, Al Jazeera (TV), The Economist       (6), the Guardian (7), and the Wall Street Journal (8),       among numerous others (9).
Barclays' Chief Executive responded to       Hammond's letter, outlining the reasons for the closure, and the bank       later extended its deadline by one month on two occasions, a decision       partly motivated by pressure from the campaign.
In November 2013,       Dahabshiil successfully obtained an injunction preventing Barclays from       terminating its account, pending a full trial in 2014.
Moreover, in       October 2013, it was announced that DFID will be progressing a pilot       project to secure remittance channels to Somalia, while the UK government       will form an Action Group on Cross- Border Remittances.
Abdirashid Duale, CEO of Dahabshiil, the largest MSB operating in the       Somali territories, attests to Hammond's important role in the campaign       and in countering negative perceptions of MSBs (10):     "Dr Hammond's work and efforts have been invaluable to the Somali         community.
Her research has made a significant contribution to raising         awareness of how remittances constitute a lifeline for receivers in the         Somali territories.
Her involvement in the campaign helped to develop         public understanding of the issue and it definitely contributed to         Barclays' decision to extend its deadline.
Her research also helped to         shed light on how Dahabshiil operates, therefore challenging the view         that companies like ours support terrorism.
Her dedication has gone         beyond the academic and her efforts are truly appreciated".
Hammond's research into the little-understood remittance pipeline to the       Somali territories reveals how money from abroad contributes to the       recovery of one of the world's longest-running failed states.
The       accessibility of her work has facilitated its use by NGOs, charities and       diaspora groups in their fight to protect the remittance flow, thereby       influencing policymakers and banks globally.
Moreover, Hammond's personal       involvement in the campaign illustrates her devotion to her work; as Mary       Harper has noted: "She is more than an academic &#8212; she is able to       communicate with the wider public and is actively involved in the issues       about which she writes."
