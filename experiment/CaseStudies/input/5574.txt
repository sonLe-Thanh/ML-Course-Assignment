     Educational impacts     In 2002, Baily's research highlighted the fragile state of Kabul's art       music, which forms part of Afghanistan's intangible cultural heritage.
The       AKMICA Tradition Bearers education initiatives resulting from the research       report and film cited above have successfully reversed this trend.
Using       his deep knowledge of local music culture, Baily set up the first school       in Kabul and immediately appointed four of Kabul's master-musicians (ustads)       as teachers, asking them to recruit suitable students from hereditary       musician families; later, following his recommendations, AKMICA appointed       a full-time Afghan Coordinator, and in 2006 a second school was opened in       Herat city.
The impact of the programme since 2008 is documented in the       Aga Khan Newsletter of February 2012, with a report of 64 successfully       graduating students at the two AKMICA schools in Kabul and Herat.
[1]       At present the two schools have 157 students (20 of these female).
Their       work is not simply a matter of preserving tradition, but also of promoting       creativity and development within this tradition.
These schools have also       improved the low status of hereditary musicians, who are now seen both as       artists and as music educators.
At Monash in 2009, Baily worked closely with Dr Ahmad Sarmast, who was       raising funds for the co-educational vocational music school in Kabul that       opened under Dr Sarmast's direction in 2010 as the Afghanistan National       Institute of Music (ANIM).
In 2011 Baily was sent by the Society for       Education Music and Psychology Research (SEMPRE) as their Special       Ambassador to Afghanistan, to visit ANIM and informally evaluate its       activities.
While there he videoed material for a 30-minute documentary       film, Return of the Nightingales,[2]       subsequently edited in collaboration with Dr Evangelos Himonides, Senior       Lecturer in IT and Music Education at the Institute of Education,       University of London.
This is now being shown in the UK and abroad to       raise awareness of ANIM's impressive work and to recruit Western interns       for the school.
Baily's research on the global circulation of Afghan music and the       scarcity of teaching materials has led to the development on an online       tutor for the national instrument, the rubab (a short-necked       lute), in collaboration with Dr Himonides.
The Online Afghan Rubab         Tutor has become a major multi-media pedagogical resource for       Afghanistan, with a large collection of notated compositions as well as       audio and video recordings, and a role going far beyond teaching people to       play the instrument.
ANIM's Director wrote: "It is a wonderful idea to         have an online rubab tutor.
It definitely would contribute to the         training of ANIM students and other rubab lovers from all over the         world".
[3] Baily and Doubleday have been invited       to teach and perform Afghan music at ANIM's 4th Winter Academy       in Kabul in January 2014, when the usefulness of the rubab tutor       can be assessed.
Directly related to the Online Afghan Rubab Tutor was a series of       workshops on rubab performance at the Asian Music Centre, Acton,       London (2010-11), and at The Music Room, an Afghan community centre in       Wembley (2012-13).
In addition Baily and Doubleday contributed to events       surrounding the major British Museum Exhibition Afghanistan &#8212;         Crossroads of the Ancient World.
At two Young Friends Events (9       April and 7 May 2011) a presentation of Afghan music and       dance with an Afghan family involved teaching large groups of Young       Friends and their parents to dance the attan, the national dance       of Afghanistan.
Alice le Page at the Museum wrote:     "I would also like to thank you and Veronica for delivering such         wonderful sessions.
It's a real pleasure to have music filling the         Museum and even more so when the families are actively involved with it.
Many of the families commented on how much they enjoyed your workshop         and I hope you did too &#8212; despite the long evening!"
[4]     Recognising that military bands have the potential to engage beneficially       with local Afghan musicians, the Royal Military School of Music (Kneller       Hall) organised an Afghan Music Study Day on 3 May 2012.
Under the       guidance of the AMU, a team of Afghan musicians and dancers worked with       four groups of bandsmen preparing for deployment to Afghanistan, all of       whom learned to dance the attan.
Performance and media impacts     Baily and Doubleday have been giving concerts of Afghan music for many       years.
Their impact has been mainly on Afghan audiences.
Baily's 2006 AHRC       grant involved organising a concert of Afghan music in Goldsmiths's Great       Hall (23 November 2006) in which Baily and Doubleday were key performers       and which attracted a large audience of Afghans.
It was subsequently       broadcast in full by California-based Noor TV (22 October 2008) [4].
Baily       and Doubleday have appeared many times on the BBC Persian Service,       including the Studio 7 radio programme and the TV programme Tamasha.
Their concert in Sydney (22 March 2009) attracted a large Afghan audience,       and was published as a DVD and shown in Afghanistan, on Herat TV.
[5]       Their most recent major concert was in Southbank's Purcell Room (21 April       2013).
In addition to their performance activities, Baily and Doubleday have       taken every opportunity to further knowledge and understanding of Afghan       traditional music among Afghan and wider communities.
In London, they had       frequent contact with the BBC World Service Persian Service, supporting       its promotion of Afghan music among Afghan listeners; a very fruitful       resource was the popular weekly interactive live phone-in programme Studio         7.
In Sydney in 2009 they took part in numerous television and radio       interviews.
The respect in which Baily is held was signalled by an       invitation to speak at the inaugural National Folkloric Music Seminar and       Festival (Kabul, 23-24 October 2011), the only non-Afghan to be so       honoured.
[6]     Public affirmation     Abdul Wahab Madadi, a renowned Afghan singer and writer, and the former       Head of Music of Afghan Radio and Television, spoke at Baily and       Doubleday's Now Ruz concert for the Afghan community in Hamburg       (14 March 2008).
[7] He asserted that:     "[their] contribution to awareness of Afghan music has been much         greater than anything the Afghanistan Ministry of Culture has done         towards [sic] our culture and heritage".
The Noor TV broadcast of the (aforementioned) Goldsmiths concert ended       with viewers phoning in with their comments.
[8] Viewers       thanked Noor TV for broadcasting "one of the best music groups",       who "play the real Afghan music".
One viewer said:     "I have known John Baily and Veronica Doubleday for a long time and         they are people who are in love with Afghan music, culture and heritage.
We must support them for keeping true Afghan music alive."
Baily and Doubleday's work has been praised at length in Nasruddin       Saljoqi's Persian translation and adaptation of Baily's CUP monograph Music         of Afghanistan: Professional musicians in the city of Herat (1988),       published in Kabul in 2010.
[9]     On 10 November 2012 Baily and Doubleday were honoured by the Herati       community in London, when they gave a concert in The Music Room, an Afghan       venue in Wembley.
Among speeches by Afghans praising their work was the       statement by Dr Hamid Simab, a retired psychiatrist and social activist       living in Canada:     "Afghanistan for the last 35 years has been devastated in all aspects:         political, social, economic, spiritual.
But nowhere is this devastation         more keenly felt than in the realm of artistic expression... all of us,         as Afghans who have inherited what remains of our cultural heritage, are         so deeply indebted to [Baily and Doubleday] for their lives' work...         from the bottom of my heart &#8212; as an Afghan who appreciates your work,         and I can say, on behalf of all Afghans &#8212; thank you for what you have         done for us, thank you for what you have done for the culture of our         country."
[10]     In August 2011 Baily received an Illuminated Address from the Ministry of       Information and Culture office in Herat: "Your valuable and tireless         service in the strengthening and growth of the Herat music abroad is         truly appreciated."
