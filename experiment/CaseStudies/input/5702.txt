     Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to be a challenging, clinically       relevant, infective agent in a wide       range of patients, particularly in hospitals.
Of the 300,000       hospital-acquired infections in England       each year, costing the NHS more than &#163;1 billion annually, one bacterium       alone is responsible for       about 10%: P. aeruginosa.
In the UK it is the most common cause of       pneumonia in intensive care       units and the 2nd most common cause in hospitals generally.
It       causes high morbidity and mortality       in neonatal patients, particularly pre-term babies, and the elderly,       causes sepsis in burn wounds, is       the most serious pathogen in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),       colonizes the respiratory       system of up to 80% of patients with cystic fibrosis, and is widely found       in immunocompromised       patients, such as those with AIDS, neutropenia and organ transplant       recipients.
Once established, P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat       effectively due to the intrinsic       resistance afforded by a thick mucus secretion and broad spectrum efflux       pumps and, increasingly,       acquired resistance of this bacterium to many antibacterial agents,       including f062-lactams,       aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, through the transmission of genes       encoding antibiotic-       disabling enzymes or altered outer membrane pores that restrict the uptake       of these agents.
Delays in correctly directed treatment allow the bacteria to colonise a       wound or the respiratory       system and become established, resulting in poor clinical outcome and       increased patient deaths,       along with additional cost burden on the NHS.
The production of       necrosis-causing toxins in approx.
65% of hospital-acquired P. aeruginosa strains places an       additional urgency on the rapid detection       and appropriate treatment of this opportunistic pathogen.
The impact from this work is embodied in the production and adoption of a       new product, ChromID&#174;       P. aeruginosa, launched commercially in April 2008, for the rapid       diagnosis of this infecting agent       in clinical specimens.
It can also be used for the confirmation of       phenotypic results.
Impact       demonstrated by this project includes:            commercial adoption of a new diagnostic technology by bioM&#233;rieux for         the EU, US and         Australian markets;       improved clinical outcomes for patients, with decreased delay in         specific treatment and         increased treatment success and reduced risk of transmission to other         patients;       markers of health have been enhanced with changes to care practice         through the         implementation of the technology in routine testing in hospital         microbiology laboratories;       sales of a new product, resulting from demonstrable collaboration with         a multidisciplinary         team, including industry, academia and hospital;       development of new expertise, e.g.
in in synthetic organic chemistry         and the design of         chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates, for the doctoral graduates         associated with this         project.
Doctoral graduates have moved to employment outside the EU,         translating their         specialist skills and knowledge into new arenas for the benefit of         international health and         commerce.
Other doctoral graduates are using their skills and knowledge         for the benefit of         education and industry in Europe.
To date, the purchase and use of ChromID&#174; P. aeruginosa is       largely limited to the few hospitals       with a specialist cystic fibrosis care unit in the target markets, where       it has proved valuable for the       more rapid and successful treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa       infections in these patients,       preventing unnecessary loss of life and transmission to other patients by       decreasing the response       time to implementation of treatment.
This diagnostic tool remains a       current part of the bioM&#233;rieux       portfolio for bacterial detection and identification.
The success of this multidisciplinary collaboration has encouraged its       continuation into new areas,       generating new intellectual property and leading to further patents and       publications; one patent and       three manuscripts are currently in draft.
Where the potential is not       considered sufficiently       commercial, the new knowledge generated is identified as making a       significant contribution to       knowledge in the field through publication in good quality peer-reviewed       journals.
