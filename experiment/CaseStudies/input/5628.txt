     Since 2008, Baderin's evolving body of work concerning the relationship       between Islamic law and international human rights has resulted in       international recognition of his expertise and its widespread uptake,       notably through his appointment as an advisor to DFID and FCO in the UK,       and as UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the       Sudan.
In relation to UK policy, Baderin was commissioned in 2008 by DFID as a       human rights expert on scoping visits to the Sudan, having previously       undertaken similar work in 2003.
The role involved engaging with the       Government of the Republic of the Sudan and other relevant stakeholders to       identify how the country could be best supported in fulfilling its human       rights obligations.
Baderin's findings were outlined in two reports       submitted to DFID.
More recently, he was invited in 2013 to join the UK       Foreign Secretary William Hague's Human Rights Advisory Group, which meets       regularly to discuss pressing human rights issues and to offer external,       impartial advice on foreign policy practice.
Hague's invitation letter       stated that he felt it `important to have a Muslim perspective on the       human rights issues affecting our foreign policy (...).
We plan to hold a       discussion on human rights in Islamic countries at a future advisory group       and would very much welcome your input.'
(1, below) Baderin has since also       participated in the third Jubilee Dialogue meeting, "How Will Religion       Shape Foreign Policy in the Next Ten Years?
", organised by FCO, assembling       leading thinkers under the Chatham House Rule to debate the key issues       behind global societal transformation (2).
Participants at the third       meeting included the Senior Minister of State Baroness Warsi, religious       leaders, theologians and experts in religious affairs.
However, Baderin's most significant impact has been outside the UK,       through his appointment in 2011 as UN Independent Expert on the situation       of human rights in the Sudan, a mandate renewed for an additional year in       2012 (3).
Similar to his DFID post, Baderin was required to meet with the       Sudanese government, its international partners, NGOs and human rights       defenders to ascertain the technical assistance and capacity building       needs of the Sudanese government for it to comply with international human       rights mechanisms.
Drawing on his research on the relationship between       Islamic law and international human rights in an African context, and his       fluency in Arabic, Baderin was ideally positioned to adopt this post, as       acknowledged in the report of the Consultative Group to the President of       the Human Rights Council:     `Mr Baderin has extensive academic and in-country experiences as a         specialist in human rights and Islamic law.
The Consultative Group was         impressed by Mr Baderin's awareness of the issues specific to the         situation in the Sudan, his ability to express a clear, focused and         practical approach to the mandate and his knowledge of the legal and         cultural context.
The Group remarked in particular his ability to         articulate the relationships between Islamic law and culture within         Sudan.'
To date, Baderin has completed three visits to the Sudan on behalf of the       UN (5, 6).
His findings and recommendations have been discussed in       numerous international press conferences and were compiled in a report to       the UN Human Rights Council in September 2013 (4, 7).
In addition, Baderin's research has impacted upon the teaching of Islamic       law and international human rights in higher education.
It constitutes `a       main source of reference' for the module `Islamic Law and Human Rights' at       the University of Khartoum, for example, as part of the cross-disciplinary       Post-Graduate Diploma in Human Rights.
Mohamed Abdelsalam Babiker,       Assistant Professor of International Law at the University, explains that       Baderin's material was chosen (8):     `because it promotes a harmonious relationship between human rights         and Islamic law.
In this respect, it addresses contemporary and         difficult issues, both in law and practice, that pertain to the Sudan as         a modern Muslim state.
Since 2005 his scholarship has been taught and         there is no doubt whatsoever it generates serious debate, inspires and         engages the minds of our students on contemporary critical rights and         relate them to the Sudan's context.
Many of our graduates are currently         practicing lawyers, judges and human rights activists working in         international and national NGOs.'
Through his direct involvement in monitoring human rights compliance in       the Sudan, Baderin continues to make a significant, practical contribution       to the reform and promotion of human rights in Muslim-majority countries       in Africa.
Moreover, both his ground-breaking research and his advisory       roles ensure not only that a Muslim perspective is considered in the       on-going discussions surrounding human rights policy and practice in the       UK, but also raise awareness of the potential positive interaction between       Islamic law and international human rights.
