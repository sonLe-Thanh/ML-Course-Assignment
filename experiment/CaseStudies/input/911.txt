     Approximately 125 million women in malaria-endemic countries become       pregnant every year, over 32 million of whom live in areas with intense       transmission of Plasmodium falciparum [1].
This is estimated to       result in 900,000 preventable LBW births each year and the deaths of       200,000 newborns and 10,000 mothers.
Since 2007, LSTM research has       contributed significantly to the formulation and maintenance of       international and national policies specifically designed to reduce this       risk.
Thus, policy makers, mothers and their newborns will have benefited       from this research as 37 African countries benefited from continued use of       IPTp (2007-present), and 9 recently updated their policy to more frequent       doses (2012/13), which will have greater impact on LBW.
[7]     LSTM's research to better define the global burden of MiP has revised       WHO's global and region specific estimates of the potential burden of MiP       [8, page 34] and they are the new default estimates in policy documents       [9, page 1 ref 1].
The lack of data on the impact of SP resistance on the effectiveness of       IPTp was a major concern for policy makers in 2007.
The findings of the       meta-analysis [5] were presented by ter Kuile at WHO's African Regional       Office (AFRO), Harare in 2005 [10] and at the Technical Expert Group on       MiP in Geneva, July 2007 [11].
As a direct result, WHO-AFRO issued a       statement in 2005 on the continued use of SP for IPT during pregnancy       [10], and in 2007 WHO-Geneva recommended the continued use of IPTp-SP in       pregnant women, influencing on-going policy in Africa [11], where IPTp       remains the only drug-based prevention regimen today [12].
It is also       cited in a 2013 WHO policy brief for implementers and programme managers       in Africa, stating "In several countries in Africa, some P. falciparum         parasites carry quintuple mutations linked to SP resistance &#8212; which are         associated with in vivo therapeutic failure to SP.
However, recent         evidence suggests that IPTp-SP remains effective in preventing the         adverse consequences of malaria on maternal and fetal outcomes in areas         where a high proportion of P. falciparum parasites carry these quintuple         mutations.
Therefore, IPTp-SP should still be administered to women in         such areas" [13].
The impact of LSTM's research is the formulation       of policy guidelines that, since 2008, have increased the chances of a       healthy pregnancy.
A recent review using retrospective birth cohort data       from national cross-sectional datasets in 25 African countries from       2000-10 estimated that IPTp-SP has reduced neonatal mortality by 18% and       LBW by 20% under routine programme conditions [14].
Increasing SP resistance in parts of Africa led to pressure from       malaria-endemic countries on WHO to provide guidance.
LSTM's meta-analysis       [6] has been crucial in helping WHO update its policy recommendation on       IPTp in 2012 [13].
Ter Kuile presented the findings at WHO's Evidence       Review Group (ERG) for MiP in July 2012 who, in turn, presented their       recommendations to the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee of the WHO in       September 2012 [15].
This led WHO to update its IPTp policy, subsequently       communicated to African Member States of the WHO [12].
Several countries       in East, West and Central Africa have now ratified the updated policy and       a few have begun implementation.
One challenge to implementing MiP policies effectively has been lack of       integration between malaria control and maternal and neonatal health       programmes at global and country levels.
Field studies and reviews of the       barriers to implementation have been presented by Hill at key meetings       where the maternal health and malaria communities have come together, many       of them NGOs seeking guidance to improve practices in endemic countries       [16,17].
Findings contributed to the policy brief by WHO on the updated       IPTp policy in terms of appropriate messaging to simplify the guidance       specifically on the timing, frequency, and safety of taking SP on an empty       stomach [13].
Hill is a member of the core group of the RBM Partnership on       MiP, comprised of donors and technical agencies that support countries to       implement MiP policies, and her research helps develop consensus       strategies to scale-up MiP interventions [18].
One output is the WHO/RBM       consensus statement calling for renewed commitment to fighting MiP, using       the 3-pronged approach including the updated IPTp policy based on LSTM's       evidence [9].
The target audience includes national-level policy-makers,       malaria control and maternal and neonatal health programme managers, and       other health-care providers.
The statement was developed and co-signed by       19 leading global organisations including WHO, DFID, USAID, UNICEF, BMGF,       it was co-sponsored by UNDP, World Bank, WHO and UNFPA [9].
Hill has been       invited by WHO to co-lead the development of a standardized tool to       evaluate effectiveness of MiP programme [15].
