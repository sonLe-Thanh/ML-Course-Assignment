The research has had impact on international policy through       the reach of its theoretical analyses of how sport for development       `problems' are conceptualized and addressed.
Following her 2010 critique of sport for development for the IOC's Olympic           Review, Kay was invited to present her argument for the         reorientation of Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) in an address to         the 2nd International UN/IOC Forum on Sport, Peace and         Development (Geneva, May 2011) [A], attended by the UN Secretary         General, the IOC, the Commonwealth Advisory Board On Sport (CABOS), and         &gt;300 Ministerial and NOC representatives.
Kay's accompanying         5,000-word position paper detailed the case for SDP to adopt the         principles of international development by promoting models of sport for         development that prioritised Global South interests and were locally         led, and set out guidelines for this approach.
The paper was later         circulated by UK Sport to its partner agencies to inform future SDP         work.
Kay has worked especially closely with the Commonwealth bodies.
In         October 2011 she was the academic contributor to the Commonwealth         Secretariat's seminar to assess the potential for sport to be adopted as         a Secretariat-wide development tool, attended by the Deputy General and         lead staff of the Health, Education, Youth and Human Rights divisions.
In December 2011 Brunel convened a two-day symposium to offer a `safe         space' for discussion of the issues and challenges encountered in         research and practice in sport for development.
Fourteen participants         from eight countries took part, including staff of the Commonwealth         Secretariat and UK Sport; the Chair and members of CABOS; and academics         from Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Tanzania and Ghana.
The         Leverhulme Developing Sustainable Sport in Africa project, to         which Kay is an advisor, also participated.
The outcomes of the Brunel         meeting were cited in presentations by Commonwealth Secretariat staff to         the 2012 CABOS meeting, and incorporated in a resource paper provided         for participants in the 2012 Expert Working Group meeting.
In March 2012 Kay was commissioned as consultant and lead author of         the Commonwealth Guide to Advancing Development through Sport         (with O. Dudfield, 2013) for CABOS [B].
The Guide identified         relevant policies, assessed the strength of evidence on the value of         sport to support of them, and provided a framework for implementation.
The Guide was ratified by the Sixth Commonwealth Sport Ministers Meeting         (6CSMM; July 2012) [C].
The meeting endorsed the Guide and requested the         Commonwealth Secretariat to work with identified member countries to         utilise the Commonwealth framework, and other key international policy         documents, as a basis for national action planning projects.
The 2013 annual meeting of CABOS addressed the next stage in         operationalizing the Guide's recommendations through Agenda items to "Note         the production, endorsement and publication of the Commonwealth         Guidelines on Advancing Development through Sport" and "Provide         advice on how Commonwealth Member Governments and other stakeholders         can maximise the use of the Guide".
The Chair stated that "In         recognising the challenge of transitioning policy declarations into         action CABOS highlighted the Commonwealth Guide to Advancing         Development through Sport as an effective advocacy instrument,         guiding framework and analysis tool for governments looking to create an         enabling environment for Sport for Development and Peace.
Concurrently,         CABOS commended the lead taken by the Governments of Barbados, Rwanda         and Sri Lanka in using the Commonwealth guidelines and framework in         national SDP planning efforts supported through technical assistance         from the Commonwealth Secretariat.
CABOS welcomed the Government of         Belize referencing this framework in the revision of their national         sport policy and invited other countries to follow suit".

The research has had direct impact on sport for development at local           delivery level, and this has further which has informed the       policy guidance detailed above.
Work with Go Sisters has increased local M+E and research           capacity.
The project's data collection and research training         needs were jointly identified by Go Sisters, IN and the         researchers, and resources for 10 separate data collection         exercises provided, supported by training workshops in data collection,         data analysis and reporting, delivered by the researchers.
These allowed         Go Sisters staff and peer leaders to obtain 2,406 usable         completed questionnaire surveys and interviews between 2010-13.
Go Sisters has made increasing use of the research         findings and developed a self-critical, reflective organisational           culture recognised within and outside EduSport (e.g.
External         Evaluation report to DFID).
The research partnership approach has         allowed M+E to become integral to programme learning and management and         valued for its contributions.
The annual interpretive research reports         to IN have been reviewed with Go Sisters, and the implications         discussed.
Contributions have been made to work practices, e.g.
extension of the programme to entrepreneurship activities in response to         issues raised in interviews by the most experienced peer leaders.
EduSport and external partners have also noted how the research has         given additional profile to the programme, aiding partnership         building and funding bids.
The Brunel PI collaborated with IN and the Go           Sisters Zambian project manager to develop a successful &#163;546,623         funding bid to Comic Relief for further programme expansion over         2013-18, informed by the research findings from 2009-12.
In August 2013,         the Brunel PI and RA partnered with the Go Sisters Zambian project         manager to deliver a workshop on research and practice lessons from Go         Sisters on the use of sport to empower young women to an international         audience at the Commonwealth Games Conference, Glasgow.
