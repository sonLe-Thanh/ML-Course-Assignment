     Lewis's work has been central in attempts to strengthen advocacy for       community media at both       national and European levels.
During the 1970s the Council of Europe had       an interest in       community media, as did AMARC-Europe during the 1990s, but this had no       discernible effect on       policy.
It was left to the Community Media Forum for Europe (CMFE), formed       in 2004, to take up       the campaign.
The sequence of events leading to the publication of the two       documents cited in       Section 1 (above) began at a joint meeting in July 2006 of the CMFE and       AMARC-Europe in       Brussels attended by community media practitioners from 15 European       countries, to which Lewis       was invited.
The meeting presented the case for community media to       representatives from the       European Commission, the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European       Parliament (EP).
In May       2007 Lewis spoke at a meeting in Budapest about the growing importance of       community media at       both national and European levels.
Present was the Austrian MEP, Karin       Resetarits, whom the       EP's Culture &amp; Education Committee had nominated to research the       issue.
She commissioned a       report from a Brussels consultant, Kern European Affairs (KEA), which       names Lewis in the list of       academics consulted (para 3.1.5 and p.60, accessible at       http://www.cmfe.eu/docs/1166366638_The%20state%20of%20community%20media.pdf).
While the KEA report was still being written, Lewis invited its author,       Jan Runge, to an international       colloquium that he (with Salvatore Scifo) organised at London Metropolitan       University in       September 2007 &#8212; Finding and Funding Voices: the Inner City Experience,       accessible at       http://www.communitymedia.eu/events/finding-and-funding-voices/Finding_and_Funding_Voices-Report.pdf).
At       this event invited representatives of UK government departments, of the       London       Mayor's office and of Ofcom heard examples of best practice discussed by       practitioners and       academics from the UK, Austria, France, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The MEP Karin Resetarits came to London in February 2008 to consult       Lewis.
Her report (       (accessible at http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A6-2008-0263&amp;language=EN)       was the basis for the EP Resolution in September 25, 2008 (accessible       at http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P6-TA-2008-0456&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A6-2008-0263).
During       the same period, Lewis was commissioned by       the CoE's Group of Specialists on Media Diversity (MC-S-MD) to write a       report &#8212; Promoting Social         Cohesion: The Role of Community Media &#8212; which was published in July       2008 (accessible at       http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/Doc/H-Inf(2008)013_en.pdf).
The report reviewed       academic studies and conceptual frameworks dealing with community media,       surveyed       characteristics of European third sector media (enabling legislation,       regulation policies, ownership,       funding, content and relevance for lifelong learning), discussed the       sector's contribution to social       cohesion, and summarised measures to support third sector media.
Key to       the claim for impact       made in this case study was the recommendation in the Conclusions (p.32)       for CMFE and AMARC       representatives to have observer status at MC-S-MD meetings.
As a result,       the CMFE was invited       to assist Council of Europe staff in drafting the Declaration which was       adopted by the Committee of       Ministers on 11 February 2009 (accessible at https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1409919).
Other       recommendations of Lewis's report are reproduced in the final section       (numbered i-v) of the       Declaration.
These two official statements have become important markers for community       media campaigns       across Europe and further afield.
The CMFE says of Lewis's Council of       Europe report: `the study       was very important for us and our members to show to European and national       policymakers a       piece of independent study and concrete examples of the everyday work of       our sector' (Source:       Testimonial from Chair of CMFE)     Of UNESCO's work in South Asia, the Director (2003-2011) of the       Communication Development       Division, UNESCO testifies that the `convincing arguments we were able to       provide to state and       non-state actors [were] based on some of the key research-based       recommendations' of the report       and Lewis's other publications (Source: Testimonial from Director       (2003-2011) of Communication       Development Division, UNESCO).
Academic comment in Telematics and Informatics (Vol.
27, No.
2,       May 2010, accessible at       http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/07365853/27/2)       discusses community media policy       and refers to the Resolution and Declaration, together with Lewis's report       (see articles by Hallett       and Hintz, Jakubowitz, Kupfer, Reguero Jimenez and Scifo, and Santana and       Carpentier).
Kupfer       commented that the report `has become a very important reference in the       discourses on       community media within the Council'.
When the CoE's MC-S-MD Group was phased out, the CMFE was granted       observer status on both       the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communications Services (CDMC,       accessible at       http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/CDMC/default_en.asp)       and the newly       formed Committee of Experts on new Media (NC-NM, accessible at       http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/MC-NM/default_en.asp)       of the Council of       Europe(CoE, accessible at       http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/CDMC/CDMC%282009%29020Rev%20Abridged%20Report%2011th%20JK.asp#TopOfPage     Forty-eight official letters to media authorities by the CMFE and       presentations by CMFE officers       advocating recognition of community media refer to the EP and CoE       documents and are chronicled       on the CMFE website (some are listed in Section 5, below).
