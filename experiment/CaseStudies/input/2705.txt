     Current practices for therapeutic management of asthma and chronic       obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rely heavily on treatment with       corticosteroids and 03b22-agonists, the former to control       underlying inflammatory dysfunction and the latter to afford symptomatic       relief for airway constriction.
However, long-term use of corticosteroids       can produce adverse side effects, and the safety of long-acting &#946;2-agonists       is also currently under scrutiny.
New safer and effective options for the       treatment of respiratory disease are therefore highly significant in their       potential societal and economic impact.
To pursue this goal, in 2000 Kyorin entered into an agreement with       Scottish Biomedical (SB), a technology management company founded jointly       by Scottish Universities in 1994, to set up a PDE biology research       facility, the Kyorin-Scotland Research Laboratory (KSRL), with an initial       project of &#163;5.2M.
Consultancy oversight came from Prof.
Miles Houslay       (University of Glasgow), one of the foremost authorities in the global PDE       biology community, while the medicinal chemistry direction was provided by       Adams.
KSRL functioned to screen compounds initially provided largely by       Adams' medicinal chemistry group and the promising activity of emerging       compounds was central to the success of this initial programme, which       cemented the Kyorin-SB partnership.
According to a senior manager of       Scottish Biomedical:     "Prof Adams' group provided compound series and informed advice on all         aspects of the medicinal chemistry associated with the SB/Kyorin         project.
Prof Adams was one of the academic advisors employed for the         original project.
His role allowed Kyorin to be confident that the         chemistry element of the project was being managed well and that         informed advice for the critical decision stages was available.
Prof         Adams continued to play a vital role in the success of the first PDE         project which allowed a follow up project 3 years later.
Prof Adams         contribution was essential to the success of the PDE programme (that)...         helped cement the partnership between Kyorin and SB."
In July 2002 a second &#163;5.2M project by Kyorin was agreed to extend the       KSRL portfolio to development of therapeutics for type 2 diabetes, and the       respiratory disease programme was extended for 3 years with a further       tranche of funding (&#163;4.5M) from 2003.
Adams contributed medicinal       chemistry support throughout the period to 2006, eventually assisting SB       with the appointment of their own medicinal chemistry team.
This completed       the transition of SB to a fully independent preclinical drug discovery       services company [text removed for publication].
The Adams group played an important role in establishing the PDE       medicinal chemistry research direction for Kyorin, and the success of the       work provided the basis for a major PDE drug development programme at       Kyorin's central Discovery Research Laboratories from 2004 and through the       current REF assessment period, employing 3 chemists and 6 biologists to       develop the work begun at HWU.
The programme has generated 22 patents (18       published within the current REF assessment period) with a direct link to       the foundational work and direction contributed by HWU.
A senior manager       at Kyorin's Discovery Research Laboratory in Japan stated that:     "The work undertaken at Heriot-Watt University provided a substantive         benefit to Kyorin's PDE programme."
Throughout the current REF period Adams has continued to work with       Kyorin, developing a multi- part series of papers to disclose details of       the PDE programme and raise the company profile.1-6 These       papers evince the impact of the work performed in the Adams group in       shaping the direction of Kyorin's PDE programme.
The success of the PDE       programme and establishment of a partnership with SB was also       strategically important to Kyorin in establishing a research network and       presence in Europe.
There is still considerable scope for bringing new best-in-class PDE4       inhibitors to the market as drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side       effect profiles for a range of inflammatory conditions in the respiratory       field and beyond.
The first PDE4-selective inhibitor to reach the market,       roflumilast, was developed by the competitor company, Nycomed.
Roflumilast       is indicated as a treatment for a subset of severe COPD cases and was       approved in the EU only in June 2010.
It was subsequently also approved by       the FDA for use in the US (March 2011).
A second PDE4 inhibitor,       apremilast from Celgene, will be launched in the near future as treatment       for psoriatic arthritis, with predicted annual sales of $1.5-2bn by 2017.
The global market for asthma/COPD drugs, $38bn pa in 2012, is set to rise       to $47bn pa by 2017 [BCC Research].
Kyorin's own PDE programme therefore       remains an important asset in its portfolio of inflammatory and       respiratory disease research.
