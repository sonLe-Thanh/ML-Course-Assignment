 Dr Jones's research has had impact on civil society by raising popular awareness of insular Norman and influencing language revitalization groups in the Channel Islands.
The Senior Language Planning Officer of L'Office du J&#232;rriais states that Dr Jones' `assistance to J&#232;rriais has been of enormous importance, as it has shown native speakers that their language is valued after decades of being told that it was worthless.
Her written work ... is seen here as the standard reference for non-specialists and has made J&#232;rriais accessible to many people,' resulting in `a positive attitude to our language, and ... a new pride in J&#232;rriais within the wider community in the Island.
No-one else has undertaken studies to such an academic depth, and we as a community have derived enormous benefit from this' [5.1].
Impact on public discourse has been similarly wide.
Dr Jones's linguistic studies and monograph have received considerable attention in the Channel Island media (featuring 26 times between 2008 and 2011 e.g.
[5.2, 5.3, 5.4]), appearing also in the French (3 times between 2008 and 2011) and British press (3 times in December 2011, e.g.
[5.5, 5.6]), and in Jersey and (continental) Norman blogs (e.g.
[5.7]).
It has done much to raise awareness within Channel Island communities of the importance of their distinct linguistic heritage &#8212; and of the need for steps to be taken to preserve it: for example, an article of 19 December 2011 in The Guernsey Press quoted Dr Jones on the revitalization of Guernsey Norman French: `this is work that simply cannot wait until a metaphorical tomorrow'.
BBC Radio Guernsey's decision to broadcast a live 15-minute interview with Dr Jones (21 December 2011) exemplifies the resulting public debate [5.4].
Dr Jones was invited by Guernsey's (non-academic) Soci&#233;t&#233; Guernesiaise to present a public lecture on the Martin translations to the local community, attracting a capacity audience (of 70) to the Frossard lecture theatre, Guernsey (8 April 2008) [5.8].
A reception attended by over 60 members of the public (18 March 2009) to celebrate the monograph, hosted by the then Deputy Bailiff of Guernsey (Guernsey Press, 19 March 2009), demonstrates further such public interest.
Through this dissemination programme, Dr Jones has brought to the attention of the local community a body of work, described as `an extremely important part of our linguistic heritage' whose significance can `not be overestimated' (former Guernsey Language Support Officer, Soci&#233;t&#233; Guernesiaise Press Release 2 April 2008 [5.8] and Guernsey Press, 15 April 2008) and `a significant milestone in the study of Guernsey French' (Chair, Coumit&#233; d'la Culture Guern&#233;siaise, Guernsey Press, 7 April 2008).
Through her research, Dr Jones has developed strong links to Channel Islands language support bodies, thereby impacting upon policy making.
As a direct result of these contacts, Language Support Officers from Jersey and Guernsey attended conferences at Cambridge (2011, 2012) where they were able `to contact people working in other minority language areas and for the sharing of new ideas', which has informed their decision making, providing `new strategies to ... achieve the revival of our endangered language' (Jersey Officer).
She will give the keynote address at the States of Jersey's Culture Conference (30 November 2013), attended by politicians and the general public.
Dr Jones was also invited by the States of Guernsey to become the only non-Guernsey member of four founding members of the Guernsey Language Advisory Panel (inaugural meeting 20 March 2009).
This Panel was designed by The States of Guernsey's Department of Culture and Leisure to help create a `strategy' for the development of the language [5.9] and `make important decisions on the shape and form the language needs to take' (The Guernsey Press, 19 March 2009).
Guernsey's last Language Support Officer writes: `Dr Jones's research and publications ... have contributed to raising the profile, status and awareness of the language within Guernsey .....
The knowledge and expertise that she brought to meetings of the Guernsey Language Advisory Panel were of great value and use' [5.10].
Dr Jones's fieldwork on Sark has had impact on cultural life, leading to an invitation by the (non-academic) Soci&#233;t&#233; Sercquaise to act as language advisor for Sark Voices (2009), a CD containing a compilation and translation of extant recordings of Sark Norman French.
Advice given drew on the research undertaken for output 4 (see Section 3); The CD's purpose is to preserve, conserve and present Sark's linguistic heritage before this dialect disappears completely and to make available authentic pieces of data for use by researchers and undergraduates (cf.
Cambridge University Part II, paper Fr13).
To date, this CD has sold some 650 copies (&#163;10 each).
