     Esche and Lewis, in collaboration with the organisation's academic team,       direct Afterall's research       activity through its printed and digital publications and events.
They       have developed an influential       model for rethinking the relationship between artistic practice and the       discourses developed on and       around it, and on the way artistic and curatorial practice relate to wider       cultural and socio-political       contexts.
Art critic and historian, Professor Hal Foster describes Afterall       journal as `a rare         publication that is actively read and seriously considered by artists,         critics, historians, and curators         alike, and in turn this makes it a precious forum where these different         voices can communicate.'
Impact on the work of artists, curators, institutions and audiences is       demonstrated through the       reach of its publications, institutional partnerships, ongoing third-party       financial support, and       participation in high-profile cultural events.
For example, Esche's       appointment as curator for the       2014 edition of the Bienal de S&#227;o Paulo, which he will co-curate       with Lafuente and Galit Eilat       (announced 04/13).
The Exhibition Histories conversations,       organised with the Whitechapel Gallery       in London since January 2013, are four public events per year prompted by       the Exhibition Histories       series and each focusing on the work of an influential curator.
The       Whitechapel Gallery Head of       Education and Public Programmes states that it is `our strong belief         that this partnership         contributes to critically expand the discourse, scope and reach of the         Whitechapel's programme.'
In addition to this, the recent restaging at Fondazione Prada, Venice, of       Harald Szeemann's 1969       exhibition When Attitudes Become Form in 2013 draws on the Exhibition         Histories publication       Exhibiting the New Art: 'Op Losse Schroeven' and 'When         Attitudes Become Form' 1969 (2010),       evident in the invitation of Esche and author Christian Rattemeyer to       contribute to the publication       accompanying the restaging.
Research for Exhibition Histories has       developed into a strand of       pedagogy that brings a new perspective into art history, for example via       the MRes Art: Exhibition       Studies (led by Steeds and Lafuente) at Central Saint Martins, and its       partner institution CCS Bard,       Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.
An indication of the significance of Afterall's impact is its designation       as an Arts Council England       (ACE) National Portfolio Organisation.
The ACE Annual Review for 2011/12       praised its `excellence         of product in terms of content, design and production' and `high         quality contributions selected by         editors who all have an in-depth and diverse knowledge of the         contemporary art scene and related         critical debates'.
The report also states that `continuing         excellence of content, design and         production of the journal is clear from consistent levels of         subscription and advertising revenue and         the renewal of partnerships with noted international institutions'.
Afterall is supported by its       ongoing funding and collaborative relationships with academic and       non-academic institutions.
Core       partnerships have been established with institutions such as Universidad       Internacional de       Andaluc&#237;a-arteypensamiento, Seville, Spain (since 2009) and the Smart       Museum of Art and Open       Practice Committee, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA (since 2012), as       well as with non-academic       organisations such as Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (since       2009)       and MuHKA, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Antwerp, Belgium (since 2007).
Distribution of       Afterall publications is managed by leading international publishers.
Since 2010, Afterall journal       subscriptions have been managed by the University of Chicago Press.
One         Work is distributed by       The MIT Press.
Exhibition Histories is produced in collaboration       with the Academy of Fine Arts,       Vienna; the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College,       Annandale-on-Hudson; and the Van       Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, and distributed by Koenig Books (Europe) and       Distributed Art       Publishers (outside Europe).
Two Afterall publications from the Critical       Readers book series have       been published in collaboration with Tate Publishing including Art and         the Moving Image: A Critical         Reader (2008).
Through these networks and collaborations Afterall       guarantees intellectual       exchange, diverse resources and extensive distribution networks.
In the 2012/13 academic year One Work, Exhibition Histories,       Afterall journal and Afterall Online       were responsible for 70 new commissions.
Afterall Online showcases       contributions from younger       writers, writing about emerging artists.
These platforms give artists and       writers the opportunity to       present their work in a discursive arena independent from commercial       considerations, and within a       contextualised setting that encourages analysis of the relevance of their       work in relation to       changes in the world.
ACE has recognised Afterall's `distinctive         editorial mission' and this fosters       exploration and examination in a way not available elsewhere in the field.
The focus is on writing       that is both in-depth and accessible, in order to bring the analysis of       diverse artistic practices to a       broad audience.
The research reaches artists, academics, art professionals       and art students.
Displays in major bookstores such as Tate Modern, London; Museum of Modern       Art, New York;       Vancouver Art Gallery and many more, reach gallery and museum audiences.
In addition, public       talks are held outside of academic and gallery spaces, e.g.
hosting critic       and curator Lucy Lippard       at the New York Art Book Fair (2012).
Afterall journal is distributed worldwide and stocked by       organisations such as Foyles, BFI Film       Store, National Gallery of Scotland, and Tate Modern in the UK, and       available at major       international museums such as Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Moderna       Museet, Stockholm;       Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; and The New Museum, New York.
It can       be found in       bookshops in cities such as Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Tokyo, Warsaw       and Berlin, as       distributed by Central Books.
Institutional subscribers include Sotheby's       Institute of Art, USA; Getty       Research Institute and Museum, USA; National Gallery of Canada; and the       Guggenheim Museum,       USA.
From June 2012 to June 2013 total print and electronic circulation       for the journal was       210,965, rising from 162,674 in 2011/12.
In the last year, over 8000 books       in the One Work and       Exhibition Histories series have been sold, and early titles       continue to be stocked and sold by       bookshops more than five years after publication.
Since 2008 there have       been 47 reprints of       Afterall articles, by publishers such as Koenig, the ICA, and Whitechapel       and The MIT Press.
Afterall is actively responding to the move to digitisation in       publishing.
E-books complement its       digitisation, which includes online open access to a number of articles       from the journal.
Articles are       available from the online digital library JSTOR, reaching individuals in       over 160 countries.
Data       provided from JSTOR shows that the total for full-text HTML requests from       May 2012 to May 2013       as 7,037 and full-text PDF requests as 12,561.
Afterall offers       e-subscriptions to individuals, has       produced e-books of the One Works series for the last five titles       in the series, and will continue to       do so for forthcoming titles across Afterall Books.
Afterall's work has been the subject of media attention and has been       recognised by prizes and       awards.
Jonathan Jones on The Guardian website (04/09) stated that `Afterall         seems aware that         art exists within a larger world.
That's much more worthwhile than         offering secondary access to a         glamorous "art world" that doesn't exist' and Frieze magazine has       described Exhibition Histories as       `an invaluable resource' (01/11).
David Campany, commissioned by       Afterall to author the One         Work publication Jeff Wall: Picture for Women, received New       York International Center of       Photography Infinity Award (2012) for the publication.
Exhibition         Histories book Making Art Global:         The Third Havana Biennial 1989 (Rachel Weiss et al., 2011) was       shortlisted for the Art Book Prize       in 2012.
Afterall's strong local and international presence is made       evident through its many       collaborations on symposia and screenings.
During the REF impact period it       has collaborated with       institutions and organisations such as: Escola S&#227;o Paulo, S&#227;o Paulo; New       York Art Book Fair and       Artists Space, both New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Frieze Art       Fair, Iniva, Tate, The       Showroom and Whitechapel Gallery, London.
