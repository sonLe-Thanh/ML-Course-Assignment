     A sustained body of work by the named key researchers spanning 20 years       (of which 12 have been at UoN) provided the initial, and strengthened the       current, evidence base in favour of developmental programming effects upon       adult health and disease.
The UoN researchers are among a number of       prominent UK groups that take a lead role in studying the early life       programming phenomenon and shaping the positions and policies of public       health bodies (also Universities of Cambridge, Southampton- where Prof.       Langley-Evans initiated this work- and Kings College London).
The total       body of UK and international work has prompted several expert committees,       global organisations and high impact journals (e.g.
The New England       Journal of Medicine, Source 1) to make specific recommendations       about maternal and infant health.
The British Medical Association       published `Early Life Nutrition and Lifelong Health' in 2009 as a       point of reference with key messages about maternal, fetal and infant       nutrition for healthcare professionals to disseminate to the wider public.
The approach of the BMA Board of Science is to provide a clear synthesis       of the available research, and to develop evidence-based conclusions and       recommendations for policy.
The BMA report was commissioned after a 2007       debate that called upon the BMA's Board of Science to recognise and       promote the importance of fetal and early life nutrition and its       relationship to lifelong health.
The report stated that, "compelling         evidence supports a role for early life nutrition in setting the risk of         other conditions including osteoporosis, asthma, lung disease and some         forms of cancer and that evidence is growing that early life nutrition         can play a role in behavioural and cognitive problems in children and         adolescents, and possibly even in cognitive decline and other aspects of         ageing".
UoN research [4] contributed evidence to support       these assertions (Source 2).
The global company, Nestl&#233; produced a White Paper `Harnessing the         power of epigenetics for targeted nutrition' (Source 3) in       which they outlined how they should consider novel approaches for       harnessing personalised nutrition for use by their end-users, the general       public.
The paper referenced the work of UoN researchers [3] in       order to support their novel, potential nutraceutical epigenetic approach.
The Department of Health (DoH) commissioned the Scientific Advisory       Committee on Nutrition (SACN) to review the evidence for an effect of       maternal, fetal and child nutrition, including growth and development in         utero and up to the age of 5 years, on the development of chronic       disease in later life in the offspring.
Part of the SACN remit was to       identify opportunities for nutritional intervention that could influence       the risk of chronic disease in later life in the offspring.
SACN published       their report, `The influence of maternal, fetal and child nutrition on the       development of chronic disease in later life' in 2011 (Source 4).
Nottingham researchers contributed evidence e.g.
[1, 2] among the       wider body of evidence which informed this review.
In their terms of       reference, SACN stated that, `the evidence associating early life         nutrition with later risk of chronic disease is variable in quality.
Most of the human evidence demonstrates associations that are         susceptible to confounding by environmental and behavioural factors at         different stages of the life course'.
Hence, they also reviewed the       studies in animal models that had contributed invaluable evidence to       support the human prospective and retrospective data, stating; `Experimental         interventions, mainly in animal models, help to ascribe mechanisms that         may explain the associations observed.
As with prospective observational         studies, the length of the human lifespan places limitations on most         existing intervention studies in humans, although markers of later risk,         particularly if validated in animal models, may be useful'.
SACN       made 6 public health recommendations to the DoH.
These included a       recommended strategy to promote, protect and support breastfeeding, to       optimise the diets and body composition of young women and a research       recommendation supporting the use of animal models as a means of       identifying predictive markers of future poor health in humans.
In an       email to Dr Gardner (Source 5), a team leader for nutrition policy       and advice at the UK DoH stated that, "SACN's report confirmed that         maternal diet is an important aspect of fetal and longer term outcomes         of pregnancy.
This reinforced the basis of current Government advice.
...
This is current Government advice that has been taken as a result of         the SACN report".
Following the SACN recommendations and drawing upon the work of UoN       researchers, the UK DoH developed websites providing information on       healthy eating and on good nutrition before, during and after pregnancy (Source         6).
Thus, the scientific context of DOHaD has been encapsulated in       advice Government is offering the general public &#8212; `optimising lifelong       health is a key element of national health education programmes' through       websites such as Change4Life and Start4Life (Source 6).
The UK       Government is not alone in realising the potential health and economic       implications of DoHAD.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) invited Prof.       Langley- Evans to a workshop event in 2004 (Source 7) considering       the impact of DOHaD on WHO global strategy and policy for maternal and       infant health.
The outcomes from this workshop (fed-back to the WHO       officer in charge of their Collaborating Centre on Nutrition Changes and       Development, Dr Chizuru Nishida, Department of Nutrition, WHO Geneva) made       the WHO more aware of the impact of nutritional programming in early life       and subsequently in 2012, WHO proposed global targets and recommendations       for the nutrition of mothers, infants and young children in order to       reduce the prevalence of low birth weight (Source 8).
In addition,       UoN researchers have contributed evidence [6] that has challenged       some of the prevalent views about childhood obesity and which has had an       international impact.
For example, the Australian Government used this       evidence in an advisory paper for the Productivity Commission (Sep       2010; Source 9) on the likely longer-term impact of childhood       obesity.
This document was used to inform their strategy for economic       spend on healthcare.
The ultimate beneficiaries of the ongoing UoN       contribution to global research in this area, are therefore pregnant women       and their children throughout the world, as the research is a springboard       for policy changes that will benefit health across the generations.
