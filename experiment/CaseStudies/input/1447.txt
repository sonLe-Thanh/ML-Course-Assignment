     Our composers have played a key role in bridging the gap between new       music and mainstream       culture.
Their works have reached new audiences and changed expectations,       amplified by       extensive media coverage, critical success and now a growing influence on       advisory panels and       HEI curricula.
Cutler, Wolters, and Skempton (with previous Conservatoire colleague       Richard Causton) were       commissioned for New Music 20x12       &#8212;a fifth of the Cultural Olympiad's total new music       commissions.
Bennett's Jackie's           Taxi was also commissioned for the Olympiad's Southbank       Festival (2012), with NI Opera.
The initiative, led by the PRS for Music       Foundation (PRSF) with all       the major commissioning funders, won the RPS         Award for Festivals (2013).
The PRSF Executive       Director has written: `The [Birmingham Conservatoire] commissions       delivered very strongly on this       objective [to engage new audiences], retaining artistic integrity whilst       composing works which       employed ingenious ways of extending the music's appeal and relevance.
...The [Birmingham       Conservatoire's] contribution has also confirmed to PRSF how important our       commitment to       stimulating audience engagement is to the future development of our       programmes ... [including]       the New Music Biennale.'
Cutler's Ping!
featured in a 10' documentary broadcast by the BBC       World Service and CNN, and       was highlighted in Channel 4 and BBC1 Cultural Olympiad coverage, as well       as a 20x12 preview in       The           Telegraph (10 October 2011) and The           Guardian (22 December 2011); Skempton's Five Rings       Triples was profiled in The Telegraph (29 December 2011),       highlighted on BBC Online and       Guardian Online, and even gently parodied in the BBC2 sitcom Twenty         Twelve.
Our presentation       of the pieces by Cutler, Skempton and Wolters (The Voyage) received       widespread regional       coverage (Birmingham Post, Birmingham Mail, local radio,       etc) and 280 attenders.
All were       broadcast by Radio 3's `Hear and Now' (70,000 audience), with Skempton's Five         Rings Triples       bringing in New Year's Day 2012         and 2013.
All were recorded and made available for download       via NMC Recordings       (Five Rings Triples was the `best seller' of New Music 20x12 with       500       downloads).
The Director of Creative Programmes, Birmingham Hippodrome, has said of       our Birmingham       showcase: `The key change was the attitude to new music which the style of       presentation       engendered &#8212; the works attracted a very broad and varied audience       including families and people       attracted by the theatrical elements of the programme &#8212; and that audience       is now more likely to       attend contemporary music events [in] the West Midlands.'
Hall's Hearing           Ragas won the Sandford         St Martin Radio Award 2013; audiences for the broadcasts       of this work were c. 1,000,000.
Feedback received by the BBC from the       listening public included       comments such as: `I just want to say thank you for the most beautiful       piece of radio in Hearing         Ragas.
Astonishingly moving.
Fabulous content.
And just put       together2028 so well.
Thank you.'
With Wolters' BBC           FOUR World News Today, extensively covered on BBC TV, and Wir         sehen uns         morgen wieder featuring across WDR radio, TV and German print media,       and Joe Cutler's       Guardian piece on Greatest           Hits of Prince Consort Road, alongside the BBC         Online feature in the       context of the 2012 Proms Cage centenary celebration (Cage Music Walk),       this collectively marks       a substantial public engagement with new music, especially considering       mainstream media's usual       indifference (if not hostility) towards new music.
Our composers also involved new audiences directly.
The President of the       Central Council of       Church Bell Ringers reported that c. 200 groups (1,600 performers) took up       Skempton's Five Rings         Triples, each performing it about five times.
Wolters' Wir sehen         uns morgen wieder involved over       300 participants presenting more than 100 pieces in 21 days, whilst Danserye       had 1,373 audience-       participants on its international tour of Germany, Switzerland and the       Netherlands.
Cutler's works       for family audiences have been acclaimed: Chanticleer and the Opera         Fox was shortlisted for a       British         Composer Award (2012), and Pulpable Music reached a       significant family and schools       audience of 463.
The Artistic Director of Birmingham Contemporary Music Group has written:       `...[their       commissioned works,] because of the interdisciplinary interests of the       composers have achieved a       marked impact for us in reaching new audiences, including families, visual       arts, dance and       experimental theatre communities.....
The Conservatoire's composition       department is a key       partner in our ongoing work to offer unique experiences to diverse       audiences.'
Critical response to the composers has been compelling.
This acts as a       grapevine by which       composers, musicians and music managers gauge developments in the sector,       including prevailing       aesthetics and emerging practice, leading to further commissions and       performances.
Bennett's       Dzama Stories was acclaimed in The           Guardian, Jazzwise, and Musical           Criticism (5-stars), whilst       My Broken Machines was Time           Out Chicago's No.
1 Contemporary CD 2011.
This success       led to       a Philip Leverhulme Trust Prize of &#163;70K, and an Akbank Jazz Festival       commission.
Skempton's music was profiled for The           Guardian and Tempo,       both linked to the BCMG         Portrait       Concert       and Ikon Gallery show (1,305 attenders), and well reviewed in The           Telegraph.
A well-respected music critic for The Telegraph and Radio 3       broadcaster has written: `from the       perspective of a critic Birmingham's [composition department] stands out       in two ways.
Firstly the       four principal teachers collectively display a fresh and unusual aesthetic       stance, open to many       things beyond orthodox modernism.
Secondly, the department puts on       enticing public events which       break open the mould of new music, in terms of both format and content.'
The impact of Skempton's work can also be seen through the success of       German DJ Pantha du       Prince's unlicensed (now deleted) `techno' version of his orchestral work       Lento (500,000 YouTube       hits and c.100,000 sales).
A prominent professional composer unconnected       with the Conservatoire       has comented: `Howard's pioneering work ... has opened up the field for       other less `classical'       composers, myself included, which has led directly to more opportunities       to have works performed       and commissioned.
As I have also begun writing for larger ensembles, from       writing `miniatures',       Howard has been a model to follow.'
Our composers are increasingly called upon to advise organizations       looking to reach beyond       concert practice.
Cutler is Advisor to the PRSF (2012-), supports the       artistic planning of the Park       Lane Group (2010-), and sits on two Sound and Music steering groups       (British Music Collection,       with Wolters, and Composers in HEIs).
He was External Examiner for the RAM       (2009-12), RNCM       (2011-) and TCM (2005-), and composition consultant for the Royal Hague       Conservatory and       Rotterdam Conservatory merger.
Skempton is on the NMC Artistic Panel       (2013-), SaM's George       Butterworth Memorial Prize panel (2013), and one of four Institute of       Composers Fellows (2013);       he was selection panellist for BCMG's Apprentice Composer-in-Residence       (2008-12).
Of Cutler,       the Chief Executive, Sound and Music, writes: `Joe has been a valued       member of the steering       group which has helped us develop a brand new programme of work with a       cohort of 12       exceptionally talented composers studying at HEIs.'
The Erasmus programme, led by Wolters with over &#8364;130K funding, is making       a significant impact       on curricula and teaching programmes across the European partner       institutions.
The Verona       Conservatory, Bratislava Academy of Performing Arts, and University of       Music and Performing Arts       (Vienna) all specifically cited the experience of Wolters and Bennett in       shaping their plans to       introduce programmes on collaboration, community and interdisciplinarity       (testimonials available).
