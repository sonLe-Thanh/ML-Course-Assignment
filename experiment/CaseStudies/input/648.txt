     Recent years have seen a growing interest in issues of gender, sexuality       and identity in Greece,       and an expanding and dynamic queer movement; in the meantime, under the       pressure exerted by       the recent socio-economic crisis, there has been a rise in homophobia and       racism that makes       informed discussion and gestures of consciousness-raising not just       necessary but urgent.
Papanikolaou's research is helping to improve public understanding of       international gender       debates, setting policy agendas, and feeding into legislation in Greece.
His work has been used to       legitimize and empower groups (especially lobbyists and activists)       interested in progressing these       debates, nationally and internationally.
Broadening public understanding of gender, sexuality and identity         issues in Greece and         internationally     To contribute to ongoing public debate and to widen public understanding       of the gender issues       explored in his research, Papanikolaou has been commissioned between 2008       and June 2013 to       write more than 40 reviews, essays and opinion pieces, published in the       leading Greek national       newspapers Ta Nea, Avgi and Kathimerini, as well       as the leading essay magazines The Athens         Review of Books, The Books Journal and Unfollow,       with topics ranging from debates on sexual       citizenship, to reviews of queer theory texts.
Many were republished by       websites and       organisations, demonstrating their impact on the newspaper audience and       reaching further       audiences beyond the original beneficiaries.
[1][i]     Through writing much circulated articles and giving public lectures       Papanikoloau both contributed       to public debate and raised awareness of homophobia, racism, biopolitics       and thanatopolitics.
He       wrote, for example, a short article commenting on a homophobic       demonstration organized by the       neo-Nazi party of Golden Dawn, and tackling for the first time the party's       homophobic agenda from       the perspective of institutionalized homosociality and national gender       stereotypes.
Published on 21       October 2012 in Avgi, it was then republished by at least 30 news       sites, blogs and other websites       e.g.
Enthemata, Left.gr, Seisaxthia, Biblioteque.gr, Friktoria[ii].
It was retweeted widely on Twitter       and on 22 October 2012 was one of the most re-tweeted articles in Greece.
"If you haven't read it         already, you ought to read this piece" said one of the most popular       re-tweets [Alina A.

A reader of the article on Enthemata       with       username `geosoi' adds that "these very good thoughts and analysis         [give us a sense of] the big         picture of our society as a whole and [show us] those things that have         to be changed from the         roots".
[iii]     Similarly, on 26 February 2013 in the Cultural Centre of the Athens       Municipality Papanikolaou       delivered a lecture to a capacity audience of 200, entitled `Racism,       homophobia and thanatopolitics       in the current crisis'.
A podcast of the lecture has been posted on Vimeo       and at least 10 other       websites since 28 February and watched by at least 1200 unique viewers.
A       summary was       published in Avgi on 10 March 2013, and has been republished by at       least 20 websites and blogs       since then, viewed by at least 30,000 readers/visitors, widely debated on       social media.
[iv]     Papanikolaou has also influenced international audiences, broadening       understanding of the       theories of sexuality and their significance for a new analysis of Greek       culture.
He has presented       his work in cultural and community events in Britain, the US, Russia,       Switzerland and most recently       in specially organised community events in Australia[v].
As       part of the world celebrations of the poet       Cavafy, Papanikolaou organised a successful `Cavafy week' in Oxford (3-8       June 2013) comprising       public events and an interactive Facebook page.
One attendee from Athens       wrote that "[After my         return] I kept talking to everyone in Athens about the Cavafy Week and         its impact".
The London       correspondent for The Nation and the BBC, said: "to open up the way the         poetry works inside         people's lives, to bring together the heart and the body and the head         like that, was an absolute         triumph"[2].
The event attracted a broad and       international audience and generated significant       publicity and social media attention.
Supporting activist and lobbying groups     Many of his pieces have become core reading and debating material for       queer activist groups and       lobbyists.
Such groups use Papanikolaou's work as an enabling platform, in       order to pursue new       agendas on gender and sexuality in Greece.
For instance, the internet forum of the collective `queertrans', a       radical transsexual and gay rights       activist group, discuss in their forum a lecture Papanikolaou had given: "his         lecture was amazing...         a very strong lecture; I will look into his work further"[iv]       says one post; further posts contain links to       his other articles and references to his work.
The group invited him to       speak to one of their closed       meetings (6 March 2013) where he shared his research insights with the       members.
Similarly, an       article on archives of sexuality and lesbian literature was distributed       and discussed among       members of the Lesbian Group of Athens (LOA; the core Greek lesbian       activist group), who also       commented on Papanikolaou's work in their publications.
Papanikolaou has       also spoken in       meetings with queer activist groups in Athens and London (throughout       2011-13).
Papanikolaou's reflections on Greek new queer cinema (and in particular       the film Strella: A         Woman's Way (2009)) have raised awareness of trans-sexual politics.
He was invited to speak on       queer cinema at an activist event held by the LGBT publishing venture       Polychromos Planetes       (2011)[vii].
Last, but not least, a documentary on `Racism,       Homophobia and Thanatopolitics',       expressly influenced by Papanikolaou's recent work, is in production by a       group of Athenian-based       investigative journalists headed by Augustine Zenakos.
Influencing policy-makers     Papanikolaou's writings on queer theory and politics (including an       article charting the gay marriage       debate from theoretical and political angles, published in Ta Nea,       14/6/2008) have led to       Papanikolaou being consulted by lobbyists and political advisers working       for policy change [3].
As a       result, Papanikolaou was consulted, in 2013, by a group led by MP       Vassiliki Katrivanou, working       on the proposal for a bill on gay marriage and new legislation on       homophobic crimes[4].
Moreover, in May 2013 Papanikolaou was invited to participate in a       consultation event on the gay       marriage bill, gender politics, and the new policy agendas needed to       combat homophobia,       organized by the main opposition Greek party SYRIZA in the Greek       parliament.
According to       shadow minister Rena Dourou, who was present in the event, Papanikolaou's       articles "are         currently having an immense educational impact on MPs, political         activists and policymakers; he is         providing us with a new vocabulary to tackle very important challenges."
Influencing policies of educational and cultural institutions     Papanikolaou's work on the poet Cavafy, has led to a reconsideration of       the queer aspects of the       author's work in Greece (where this issue is still treated as taboo), and       impacted on the official       cultural policies of Greek cultural and educational institutions regarding       this central Greek author.
In January 2013 Papanikolaou was appointed by the Greek Ministry of       Culture to stand on its       Cavafy Committee advising on and distributing funding for new media and       performance activities       for the 150th anniversary of Cavafy's birth.
His input induced the       Ministry to adopt `Cavafy and       communities of readers' as a central policy priority.
Moreover, the       Onassis Foundation, which       acquired the Cavafy Archive in early 2013, has appointed Papanikolaou as       an advisor, and used       his work in the promotion of their celebration of Cavafy's poetry.
`Dr         Papanikolaou's academic work         [...] has inspired and influenced how the Cavafy Archive approaches the         legacy it plays host to and         the events of the Onassis Cultural Centre relating to it.[...]
This         report and Dr Papanikolaou's         overall advice have been stimulating, invigorating and inspiring.
They         have given us important         directions and impacted upon the way we planned our big campaign...'[5]
