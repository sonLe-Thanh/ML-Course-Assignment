     Improved accessibility of genetic testing to couples with a history of         hereditary genetic disease: The major innovation arising from KCL       research is the development of generic tests to identify any genetic       defect in disease risk genes and chromosomes in human embryos.
KCL       techniques can be performed using standard laboratory equipment, and are       sufficiently cost-effective for the NHS to use as a universal, affordable       PGD service.
In the future, it is expected that the number of genetic       conditions for which PGH is available will continue to increase to meet       patient demand.
KCL's PGD techniques licensed by the UK's human fertilisation         regulating body: Since 2008, Guy's and St Thomas' Centre for PGD has       been licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryo Authority (HFEA) to       analyse over 50 genetic conditions affecting single genes.
PGH is       recognised as a solid, reliable technique to identify embryos affected by       such genetic diseases.
The centre has also performed PGD for more than 200 different chromosomal       mutations [7] and carries out more than half of all PGD cycles done in the       UK [8].
KCL's PGD techniques improve pregnancy success rates: Successful       pregnancy rates for couples undergoing preimplantation genetic analysis of       embryos using KCL techniques are higher than rates reported for other       methods of genetic analysis [9].
34% of embryos selected using KCL methods       of PGD go on to result in successful pregnancies, compared to a national       average of 25% [8].
In November 2011, the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS       Foundation Trust celebrated the birth of over 300 babies following PGD       analysis, an achievement that was widely covered in the press [10].
Adoption of KCL's preimplantation genetic haplotyping technique by       in vitro fertilisation clinics worldwide: The       generic applicability of the KCL-pioneered PGH approach to detect single       gene defects in fertilised human embryos has led to the adoption of the       technique by human fertilisation clinics worldwide.
Clinics in the USA       [11], Saudi Arabia [12], Israel [13] and the Czech Republic [14] have all       reported success using PGH.
Large-scale clinical trials are also under way       in Belgium to validate the performance of PGH with a view to ultimately       replacing existing labour-intensive and costly PGD techniques [15].
KCL researchers recognised as world-class authorities for in           vitro genetic testing: The original research performed       by KCL scientists has been widely recognised by the wider medical       community, and included in publications referred to by clinicians,       embryologists and nurses.
Both Professor Ogilvie and Dr Scriven were       invited to contribute chapters to the second edition of Preimplantation         Genetic Diagnosis, published by Cambridge University Press [16].
PGH       is also referred to in the sixth edition of Essential Medical Genetics,       published by Wiley-Blackwell, as a landmark advance in the field of       medical genetics [17].
KCL researchers also contributed to the Galton       Institute's Guide to Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis [18].
KCL research shapes international genetic-testing guidelines: KCL       research has significantly contributed to shaping international clinical       guidelines.
Consolidated PGD best practice guidelines published in 2011 by       the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) not       only reference original KCL PGD research (see [1], [2] &amp; [4] above),       but KCL researchers Professor Braude and Mrs Lashwood (KCL / Guy's and St       Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, 1991-present) also co-authored the       guidelines dedicated to organising a centre for PGD/preimplantation       genetic screening [19, 20, 21].
A number of specialist genetics charitable groups have also used KCL       research to inform policies and guide patient choices.
These include       UNIQUE [22], Genetic Alliance UK [23], the Cystic Fibrosis Trust [24] and       the Jennifer Trust [25].
