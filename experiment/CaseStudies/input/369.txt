     The research outcomes above and the related body of research (see       reference 3.1) have been       embodied in the Molpro software (http://www.molpro.net),       which has been developed, supported       and distributed under licence since 2004.
Since 2008, there have been       three major releases of the       software (2008, 2010 and 2012) at which new capabilities have been added       as a result of research       in theory and methods.
Impact on Practitioners and Professional Services     The value of Molpro is that it offers key functionality (in particular       local correlation for large       molecules; multireference methods for chemical reactions and excited       states) that are not available       in Gaussian (the industry-standard general purpose code) or any other code       [5.1].
A wide range of       companies, each operating on an international basis, has opted to use       Molpro, as a new process       that offers enhanced capabilities, to enable the development and       production of a plethora of       products that are marketed to industries including agriculture, aerospace,       construction, automotive,       pharmaceutical, packaging and personal care.
The list includes BASF,       Sasol, Schr&#246;dinger, Bristol-Myers-Squibb,       Mitsubishi Chemical Group and Nissan Chemical Industries.
BASF, for       example       (an organisation that has over 380 production sites worldwide and produces       a range of products       for eight industries), purchased Molpro in 2011.
Ansgar Sch&#228;fer, the Group       Leader in Quantum       Chemistry at BASF, states that "Molpro, and in particular its capability       for very accurate       computations on large molecules, has become a valuable tool for estimating       thermochemical and       kinetic data for substances and reactions involved in our development of       new materials and       processes" [5.2].
Similarly, Bristol-Myers-Squibb (BMS), which has 26       facilities in 10 countries and       manufactures prescription drugs to treat diseases such as cancer,       HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular       disease, diabetes, hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis, acquired Molpro in       2008.
Dan Cheney,       Group Leader at BMS, commented that "In the Bristol-Myers Squibb CADD       group, we believe that       effective drug design rests on an affordable and acceptable level of       scientific rigor.
Among       quantum chemistry programs, Molpro is unique in enabling us to do this by       offering coupled cluster       code that can be applied to drug-like systems using reasonable       computational resources" [5.3].
No       other package is competitive on this basis.
Molpro has significantly       progressed industrial       knowledge and capabilities.
Economic Gain     Molpro has resulted in significant economic gain, manifested in a) the       number of licences sold, and       b) the augmentation of corporations authorised to resell the software.
a) Licences sold     Between 1/1/2008 and 31/7/2013, 780 paid-for Molpro licences were issued.
Total sales, including       those effected by sales agents and net of their commission, amounted to       &#163;1,783,714.
As a result       of this, several posts have been created in Cardiff to support the work,       to achieve further sales and       to develop activities in Stuttgart, Lund, Regensburg, Bristol and Uppsala.
Sales are continuing to       increase, as demonstrated by the six monthly income figures; in October       2012, the amount was       &#163;179,535, but by April 2013 this had risen to &#163;290,132 [5.4].
b) Companies reselling the software     There are presently twelve authorised resellers of the software that have       reaped considerable       financial gain from the sale of Molpro.
Examples are Beijing Hongcam       Software Technologies Co.       and Ryoka Systems, Inc. Ryoka Systems have stated that, during the REF       period, sales of Molpro       amounted to &#163;145,143 [5.5].
Molpro sales have continued to increase; there       was a 19% increase       for the period 2008-2010 compared to 2005-2007, while in the last two and       a half years the       software has remained a source of ongoing profit for Ryoka.
Similarly,       Beijing Hongcam Software       Technologies has accumulated sizeable financial benefit from distributing       Molpro; during the REF       period, sales amounted to &#163;82,705 [5.4].
