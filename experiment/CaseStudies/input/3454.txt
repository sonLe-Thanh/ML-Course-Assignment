     Impact on industry     At an early stage of Huddersfield's thorium research programme (2009)       Cywinski and Barlow created ThorEA, initially as the Thorium Energy       Amplifier Association, currently extended in scope to the Thorium Energy       Association.
ThorEA is a learned, not-for-profit, society that brings       together academics, industrialists and politicians to discuss all aspects       of thorium deployment technologies.
Meetings with 30-50 participants are       held twice annually at venues around the UK, often attracting overseas       attendance.
Siemens, Jacobs E&amp;C Ltd, the Norwegian company Thor       Energy, NNL, and the Nuclear Institute have participated.
As a result       Cywinski was invited to address the Nuclear Institute's Midlands, Cumbria       and North East branches, and in 2012 gave the NI North West R V Moore       memorial lecture.
These interactions have showcased Huddersfield's       research and led to a publication with Thor Energy and Jacobs [6], with       the latter confirming that our research has "...had an impact on our         own designs for the ADTRTM which won the         prestigious IChemE 2010 Innovations and Excellence Energy Award."

Impact on government and policy makers     Given the current position of the nuclear industry, the public and       governmental perception of that industry, and issues involved with the       scale of financing, licensing, and build time, it is clear that influence       on policy is a crucial first stage in exploiting our research.
Following ThorEA's inception in 2009 Science Minister Lord Drayson       requested a report on our research on thorium technology, defining the       financial investment necessary for the UK to deliver the enabling       technologies for the construction of a thorium-fuelled ADSR, whilst       additionally appraising the commercial opportunities arising for the UK.
The report [1], edited by Cywinski, showed that the technology would allow       the UK to compete aggressively in existing nuclear markets, open up new       nuclear markets, directly impact other high technology industries       including medicine and enable the UK to meet carbon reduction targets.
The       Government left office before the report, delivered in late 2009, could be       acted upon.
However the report has been recognised and supported by IAEA       as "...a positive contribution to the international effort to secure         eventual global deployment of sustainable thorium fuelled ADSR power         generation systems."
[1].
In 2013, under Cywinski's chairmanship, ThorEA was granted full       membership of Europe's Sustainable Nuclear Technology Platform &#8212; SNETP &#8212;       in recognition of its reputation for bringing academia and industry       together.
Our strong engagement with politicians and policy makers, for example       through the All Party Parliamentary Group on Thorium, has "...significantly         informed the UK debate on clean, low carbon, but safer and more         sustainable, nuclear power."
[B] whilst assisting "...in DECC's         consideration of possible future scenarios for nuclear power         generation..." [C].
We are also informing policy, as demonstrated by       the inclusion of the thorium fuel cycle in the recent Beddington Review       document "Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap: Future       Pathways" [D] recognising that thorium fuel could play a key role in the       future pathways to nuclear power in the UK and is worthy of further       research &#8212; a remarkable turnaround with respect to an earlier negative NNL       policy statement on thorium.
We have also interacted closely with the Weinberg Foundation (an NGO       operating from Somerset House) and its patron, Baroness Bryony Worthington       (Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change) [B], since its launch in       2011.
The WF recognise that our research has been "...instrumental in         changing scientific, political and public opinions on thorium energy..."       [E].
In the US our ADSR research on waste transmutation carried out in       collaboration with PAC has led to "...a legislative bill in the         Illinois State General Assembly based on the Huddersfield-PAC ADS model         that would permit construction of a pilot plant to demonstrate this         approach to dealing with nuclear waste.
This bill has passed out of         committee with bipartisan support and is now up for vote in the full         Illinois House of Representatives."

Internationally, we are represented on the programme committee, alongside       Carlo Rubbia and Hans Blix, of the international thorium energy conference       THEC13.
This conference series successfully brings together academics,       industrialists, politicians and policy makers.
Huddersfield has given       invited lectures, and chaired sessions and discussion panels, at this and       previous THECs.
Media impact     Our research on thorium has generated significant media interest in       thorium, starting with The Times science supplement Eureka in October 2009       which featured our ADSR as one of the 15 projects researching technologies       of tomorrow which ".....promises to change the way we live for the         better......".Since then Huddersfield's research has featured many       times in national newspapers including the Guardian, Telegraph, Financial       Times, a major colour supplement article in The Mail on Sunday [G] and       even featured in House and Garden (8/2012).
Internationally we have been       asked to write an editorial for The Australian and have been featured in       many international newspapers and blogs, always attracting tens and       sometimes hundreds of feedback comments.
Our research has featured       prominently on the BBC [H]: in Radio 4's Material World       (15/9/2011), and "Costing the Earth" (29/2/2012), whilst on       television it featured in the pre-election Politics Show (April       2010), and other news items.
BBC World's Horizons Business in 2013       broadcast a whole programme dedicated to Huddersfield's thorium ADSR work       (viewing figures ~100M).
In October 2013 Cywinski was interviewed live on       Australian ABC News (reach 2M viewers).
We are often asked for live       comment on nuclear issues on local BBC radio news programmes.
A Google search for Huddersfield and thorium generates 218,000 hits       linking to articles, blogs, comments, and interviews.
Public Engagement     We have given dozens of invited talks at Public Lectures, Caf&#233;       Scientifique, TEDx, Philosophical Society, Schools and other public events       across the UK, including an invited lecture at the British Science       Festival in September 2011 where we also partnered Jim Al-Khalili in a       public debate on nuclear power, and an invited appearance at Beacons Rock       Festival in August 2013.
Each event has drawn audiences of between 50 and       200.
Feedback at and from the presentations is always positive with each       presentation invariably leading to several new invitations to speak.
Finally, recognising how much our thorium research had attracted the       attention of the public and was impacting perceptions of the potential of       alternative nuclear power and waste management, the Science Museum in       London launched a 3 month exhibition in the Antenna Gallery in October       2012 dedicated entirely to our research programme.
Visitor numbers       exceeded 775,000, and the associated Topic Zone stimulated 464 visitor       comments and an article in the Dutch Newspaper NRC Handelsblad       (22/11/2012) [I].
