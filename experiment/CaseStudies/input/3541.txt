     The research had a significant impact on the 2011 Model Law on Public       Procurement of UNCITRAL, &#8212; a substantially revised version of the 1994       Model Law.
UNCITRAL is a UN agency concerned with trade.
Inter alia, it adopts       `model' laws on commercial matters for use in national laws: governments       simply copy the UNCITRAL text (suitably adapted) into national       legislation.
The model laws' purpose is to help states adopt sound       regulatory frameworks without unnecessary effort, whilst also promoting       standardised rules to assist trade (since companies find it easier to       operate abroad if the legal framework is familiar).
The Model Law on procurement deals with regulatory rules on public       procurement &#8212; that is, the acquisition of goods, works and services by       governments (from simple items such as furniture to complex infrastructure       such as power stations).
A sound regulatory framework is considered       important to avoid wasting resources; ensure high-quality infrastructure;       secure adequate services in areas such as transport and health; and fight       corruption.
Procurement is also a vehicle to achieve other policies, such       as reducing environmental damage, promoting competitive markets and       encouraging e-commerce.
UNCITRAL's Model Law on procurement provides a       template that aims to help states to achieve and balance these objectives       whilst also facilitating trade.
Intended ultimate beneficiaries are those       affected by the above interests including governments; taxpayers; citizens       and businesses using government services; suppliers, including those in       international markets and small businesses; and beneficiaries of social       programmes implemented through procurement (such as minority groups).
In 2003 UNCITRAL launched a review of the 1994 Model Law to: i) adapt it       to new practical and technological phenomena; and ii) improve its existing       rules.
The resulting new Model Law was adopted in July 2011.
New phenomena       addressed include matters essential for an effective modern purchasing       system, in particular e-procurement &#8212; including electronic auctions &#8212; and       framework agreements (sophisticated methods for procuring repeat needs,       such as maintenance and consultancy).
Arrowsmith's research as described       in section 2 above substantially influenced the 2011 Model by analysing       precisely both which issues to address and how to address       them.
As stated by the UNCITRAL Secretariat in item 5/3 (which confirms       the statements below): "..... [the] short description of her work         [below] does not do justice to the very significant influence that her         research has had on both the initial choice of issues for reform and in         the nature and quality of the final outputs".
Arrowsmith was also       appointed a member of UNCITRAL's Experts Committee on procurement,       responsible for advising the UNCITRAL Secretariat throughout the reform       process (2003-2011).
More specifically, the 2011 Model includes:     i) Extensive provisions on the "new" areas analysed by Arrowsmith       in items 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 and 3/5.
As recommended in these items, the Model authorises broad use of new       mechanisms (see item 5/2).
These are found in Article 7       (e-communications), Articles 53-57 (electronic reverse auctions), and       Articles 58-63 (framework agreements, authorising certain categories of       framework agreements, but not others, as per recommendations in item 3/5).
The templates developed in Arrowsmith in research items 3/2, 3/3, and 3/5       &#8212; based on her analysis of the complex practical phenomena involved and       her comparative research into regulation and practice &#8212; formed the basis       of the Secretariat's presentation of these novel issues to the Working       Group, to ensure the Group's understanding of the practical situations,       policy options and regulatory distinctions: see items 5/3 and 5/4.
As the       Secretariat states in item 5/3:     "[Item 3/5] was particularly significant in dealing with those areas         such as electronic communications, electronic auctions and framework         agreements in which very few states had actually adopted regulatory         rules.
Without Professor Arrowsmith's research in carefully classifying         the variations in the phenomena to be regulated, identifying the issues         for regulators, and explaining the options to address them, it would         have been impossible for the Secretariat to draft comprehensive material         for consideration by the Working Group...; for the Working Group to         engage in focused discussion; and for the Group and the Secretariat to         produce the final high- quality text that was adopted by the Commission         in 2011.....the contents of the Model Law reflect many of the specific         recommendations made in the papers, both on matters of principle and         matters of regulatory detail".
The above Articles of the 2011 Model Law also include numerous controls       and other detail on the new mechanisms, based on recommendations in items       3/4, 3/5 and 3/6.
A couple of examples (amongst many) are inclusion of       specific controls over communications which, as recommended, do not       explicitly distinguish between electronic and other means (Article       7(4)-(5)); and regular publication of aggregate information on awards       under frameworks (Article 23) (not found in existing regulatory systems       but recommended in the above work to fill a gap in transparency).
ii) Reforms on other areas, as specifically recommended or identified         for consideration, in items 3/4, 3/5 and 3/6 (see item 5/2 for       corroboration).
A few examples are: a standard approach to services and       goods/works, instead of provision of different procurement methods       specifically for goods/works, on the one hand, and services on the other       (Articles 27 and 28(1)); explicit provision for social and environmental       award criteria (previously absent) but accompanied, as recommended by       Arrowsmith, by control through specific authorisation in national       regulations (Article 11); removal of previous exclusions from supplier       review (exclusion existing in the 1994 version are no longer found in the       2011 version); and new provision for an independent body to review       supplier complaints in all systems.
The Model Law is an international regulatory model of global relevance,       designed for use in any country (with options within it to take account of       differing national conditions).
To give just a few examples, the 2011       Model has already been used:            by Mauritius in enacting its latest revisions to the Public         Procurement Law 2006 (2010-2011) (these were based on the draft 2011         Model Law): see http://ppo.gov.mu/Englis/documents/ppo2006.pdf e.g.
s.2 definition of "framework agreement" and s.29, introducing         provision for frameworks for the first time, based on the 2011 Model Law       as the basis of the Bill currently before Parliament for the first         comprehensive procurement law in India (see the first draft by Planning         Commission of India, preface, s.6 stating "The Public Procurement Bill         2011 draws substantially from the UNCITRAL Model Law of July 2011" (http://infrastructure.gov.in/pdf/public-procurment-bill.pdf))         and the final Bill  http://164.100.24.219/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/asintroduced/58_2012_LS_EN.pdf         (which is modelled on the 2011 version of UNCITRAL in most of its rules,         and includes electronic auctions as added by the 2011 Model Law);       for an UNCITRAL-EBRD joint reform project for the Commonwealth of         Independent States and Mongolia (see generally www.ppi-ebrd-uncitral.com/index.php/en/the-initiative).
The UNCITRAL Secretariat has already commented on draft legislation         prepared by the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and legislative         revisions are currently being drafted by Armenia with the Secretariat's         assistance (item 5/6)       to draft reform proposals for the Public Procurement Law of Ghana         (currently based on the 1994 Model), including to add new provisions on         remedies and social/environmental issues from the 2011 Model and         introduce measures on e-procurement and frameworks (currently before the         Cabinet in a Cabinet Memorandum): see item 5/5.
to draft legislation for several Caribbean countries e.g.
new         legislation based on the Model Law is before the Legislative Review         Committee of Trinidad and Tobago for 19 Aug 2013: for details of this         and other Caribbean reforms see corroborating item 5/6.
The 2011 Model is also being used by OECD in revising its methodology         for assessing systems for development aid, and in assessing compliance         with Art.9 of UN Convention on Corruption: item 5/6.
Given that the 2011 Model Law referred to here was only adopted two years       ago and the length of legislative processes, it is too soon for the       changes to the Model Law to be reflected even more extensively in national       legislation.
However, its inherent importance can be gauged from the fact       that the 1994 Model Law was used as the main basis for procurement       legislation of more than 30 countries (para.226 in item 5/1 below) and to       some degree in many more (e.g.
in Africa in Botswana and Zimbabwe).
Use of       the Model Law's provisions is a World Bank requirement for Bank-funded       reform of states' own procurement systems (World Bank, Note for         drafting public procurement regulations (March 2002)); this means       that although it is not legally binding on states, developing countries       are often effectively required to use it given that the World Bank       provides or contributes to procurement reform programmes.
The 2011 Model       is likely to be similarly influential.
