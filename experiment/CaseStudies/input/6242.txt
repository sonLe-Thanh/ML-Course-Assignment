     Memory Maps is a living archive of regional memory.
It responds to       aesthetic, cultural, social and environmental concerns in a distinctive       and novel way.
Its primary impacts have been (1) to stimulate creative       writing in and about Essex; (2) to inspire prominent professional writers       and aspiring writers to contribute to the genre of psycho-geography.
The Memory         Maps team has achieved these impacts through the following avenues:     Collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum     Warner worked with the V&amp;A to create a website specifically designed       to inspire creative activity according to psycho-geographical principles.
The website hosts an extensive set of catalysts for writing about place,       in the form of paintings, photographs, artifacts, exhibition articles,       poems, essays, and songs.
Each of the items featured is designed to       provoke the visitor's imaginative interaction with the physical       environment of East Anglia.
The website now contains an archive of over       200 images, including Essex-related paintings from the V&amp;A's own       collection by Gainsborough, Constable, Nash, Moore and others (V&amp;A       Memory Maps website: http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/m/memory-maps/).
Since 1 January 2008 the website has received over 103,000 views and over       73,000 unique visitors [corroborating source 1].
The most notable result       of the project has been the new work produced by prominent writers, who       were invited to respond to materials selected for the website from the       V&amp;A's collection.
It now hosts psycho-geographical works by 19       contemporary writers, among them, Iain Sinclair, Kenneth Worpole, Robert       MacFarlane, Ronald Blythe, Mich&#232;le Roberts, Lisa Appignanesi, and the       singer Billy Bragg.
It also features `memory mapping' writing by current       and former University of Essex academics, including by the founder of the       department, Donald Davie.
The website contains supporting material, such       as personal `trails' and historical contributions, and suggestions for       further exploring and reading.
An additional web presence for Memory Maps     In addition to the presence on the V&amp;A website, Memory Maps       has also developed its own distinct presence on the University's domain,       with a two-way link between the sites.
It was established in February 2013       in order to grow Memory Maps, and extend the V&amp;A's call for       contributions, specifically encouraging amateur writers to submit their       `memory mapping' work.
For this most recent stage of the Memory Maps       project, two well-known authors were appointed as Genii Loci of the       project: Rebecca Solnit, author of thirteen books about ecology,       landscape, community, and memory; and Ronald Blythe (OBE), dubbed by The         Independent as `England's greatest living country writer', who has       spent much of his life in and writing about Essex and Suffolk.
Extracts       from their works are included alongside contributions from members of the       public, vetted by the project team.
In the brief period from its inception       to the end of the impact period the website received 1584 page views and       484 unique visitors [corroborating source 2].
Public Programme     The Memory Maps team has actively sought to promote the project       and its ethos in public fora such as book festivals, concert halls,       galleries, and through dissemination in the media.
Over the last three       years the team has collaborated with the organisers of the Essex Book         Festival to annually host a public conference as part of the       Festival.
In 2011 Warner, Terry, and Pretty organised `A Conference of         Birds', which explored the threats from climate change to local       birds, and brought together writers and ecologists including Tim Dee,       Tobias Hill, evolutionary ecologist Claire Spottiswoode, and Hilary Hunter       from the RSPB.
In 2012 Warner, Terry, and Adrian May organised `Trees         Shall Be Our Books', an all-day event that included talks, walks,       readings, workshops, and children's activities with poet Hilary       Llewellyn-Williams, naturalist Richard Mabey, and artist Miles       Thistlethwaite.
In 2013 the team organised `Talking on Water' as       well as a day of talks, reading, films, and music by the Aldeburgh       Festival's resident Quartet, and chaired by Lord Philips of Sudbury, to       celebrate the 90th birthday of Memory Maps patron: `Ronald         Blythe &#8212; A Celebration' (supported by the Heritage Lottery) at       Nayland Church, Nayland, Essex.
Other public symposia and exhibitions co-organised by the team to foster       the public's interest in psycho-geography include:             `Memory Maps: Image, Place, Story' (1-3 July 2008), Centre for         Research in the Arts, Social Sciences, and Humanities, University of         Cambridge in collaboration with Kettle's Yard Gallery.
According to its         Programmes Administrator the event was `very well received and the         feedback was extremely positive' from an audience of 60 [corroborating         source 3].
`Margins: Walking Between Worlds', an exhibition held at Art         Exchange, University of Essex (24 September &#8212; 5 November 2011), with         public talks by the curator, gallery tours, and a public lecture by         Warner on Tacita Dean's contribution to the exhibition.
Total visitors:         2754 [corroborating source 4].
`PLACE: Roots &#8212; Journeying Home' (February 2013), a weekend         exploration of the meaning of `place' with readings, screenings, music,         performance, discussion, and walks, at and in collaboration with         Aldeburgh Music, Snape Maltings with Ronald Blythe, Ali Smith, Paul         Kildea and others (covered in The Guardian [corroborating source         5]).
Warner's numerous public talks, including those to practitioners at         the OPUS Psychotherapy Congress (21-22 November 2008), paying         guests at the mega-event commemorating the tenth anniversary of Sebald's         death at Wilton's Music Hall, London (14 December 2011), or the         Stour Valley Lecture she gave on Saint Helena, born in Colchester, at         the Constable Hall, East Bergholt in Essex (15 February 2013), have         helped bring the Memory Maps project to a variety of different         audiences.
In order to reach a wider audience the Memory Maps team have also       engaged with the press and national and international media.
Warner       contributed to Grant Gee's feature length 2012 documentary about Sebald's       psycho-geographical writing, Patience (After Sebald)       [corroborating source 6].
Warner also wrote and read `Wild Ecstasy' for       the BBC Radio 3 programme `Wild Nature' (8 July 2011), the final       in a series of five entitled `Dark Arcadias'.
Pretty's psycho-geographical       work, including his book This Luminous Coast, has been widely       reviewed: Times Higher Education Supplement, The Guardian,       The Financial Times, and BBC Radio [details contained in       corroborating source 7].
