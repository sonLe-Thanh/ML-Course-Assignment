     The impact of Procuring Social and Economic Value through         Construction follows a process of partnership working with and       adoption by practitioners and policymakers:            Guiding progress towards sustainable construction practice, generating         wider social and economic benefit through better informed construction         procurement:                 Revaluing Construction (RC): The RC conceptual framework was           used by the Government of the Netherlands in 2008 and the Malaysian           Government in 2009 to assess progress in their national improvement           schemes for construction.
McDermott was a member of the development team for BS 8534,             Construction procurement policies, strategies and procedures Code of             practice, which responds to industry demand for consistency in           the way construction work is procured and in the engagement of the           supply chain in the project decision making process.
"BSI strongly             believes that the construction industry will benefit from the             introduction of a high level best-practice framework in this area."
British             Standards Institute [a]               Improving the performance of existing construction projects and         businesses and commercialising new products and support services to         construction clients and suppliers:                McDermott worked in partnership with UK local authorities to           establish frameworks arrangements; specifically embodying clients'           values of training, apprenticeships and local employment into the           procurement and management processes:         The integrated supply chain work and ERDF funding enabled Salford to           work with over 70 clients, including 80% of Local Authorities in the           North West, supporting &#163;2,500m of construction and design work           procured (to 2009): A                 Decade of Delivering Excellence in Construction           Report.
McDermott was commissioned as an independent advisor in the           development of the NW Construction Hub, led by Manchester City           Council.
The North West Construction Hub is a move away from lowest           price tendering, replacing this with long-term, collaborative           relationships between clients, professionals and contractors, formed           around shared objectives and common values.
To mid 2013, the North West Construction Hub has delivered over 140           projects to 53 clients with a value of &#163;800m.
The Hub manager           described the presence of Salford as a 'golden thread' throughout the           journey, and that their knowledge, experience, mentoring and support "has             been undoubtedly fundamental to our success."
[f]          The procurement work is supported by two related services.
Firstly,           the development of the Key Performance Indicator Engine, an on-line           tool developed with Constructing Excellence, and used by over 150           organisations, generating over &#163;200K in related licence fees,           consultancy and training, enabling the ongoing performance measurement           of organisations within these frameworks.
Secondly, McDermott et al have developed a local economic multiplier           methodology which enables the wider economic and social value to be           calculated for the projects procured through the NWCH, and other           projects.
KTP with B4Box (2013 to 2015) &#8212; B4Box is an SME construction           contractor that has training and social value as its core values.
This           project was designed to systemise and enumerate B4Box's proven success           in construction excellence and social impact to gain new contracts and           further improve the current competitive advantage.
[h]               Informing public policy through a range of impacts &#8212; most recently the         Government Construction Strategy and the Infrastructure Cost Review (and         Implementation).
[b] McDermott was the independent academic for         the latter, and was invited to remain on the joint steering group when         the Government merged the two strategies in January 2012.
The Government Construction Strategy (Cabinet Office, May 2011)           called for a radical change in public sector construction procurement.
[c]          Objective 10(i) of the Government Construction Strategy requires the           Cabinet Office to assess "the effectiveness of frameworks, in             collaboration with Departments and the National Improvement and             Efficiency Partnership (NIEP) for Construction".
The Strategy           notes at section 2.38 that there is a plethora of construction           frameworks in the public sector with varying degrees of quality: "Evidence             and commentary from a spectrum of clients and contractors point to             the highly effective use of some frameworks, but also to other             frameworks which are less effective".
[d]          The work to assess the Effectiveness of Frameworks, in discharging           that Strategy objective, was directed by a Working Group drawn from Task             Group 1 - Procurement and Lean Client, co-led by McDermott, with           representatives from the Cabinet Office, Hampshire County Council, the           National Efficiency and Improvement Partnership for the Built           Environment (NIEP), the Civil Engineering Contractors Association           (CECA), the Specialist Engineering Contractors Group (SEC Group),           Kier, Partnerships for Schools, HM Treasury, the Department of Health,           the Ministry of Defence, Environment Agency and the Ministry of           Justice.

Public sector organisations in England are now required to take           account of the report in their procurement decision making.
The           Scottish Government is now also building it into their procurement           decision making.
