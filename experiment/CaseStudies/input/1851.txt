     The Cassini Scientist for a Day competition and our Media Space summer       schools have increased the interest, knowledge and learning skills of more       than 300 secondary school pupils from around the UK.
The teaching practice       of school teachers has been transformed by engagement with the AU's       research through our Astrophysics Summer Schools.
These activities support       the government's promotion of STEM skills as a key driver of long-term       economic growth (e.g.
see page 87 of the Treasury document http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf       ).
Cassini Scientist for a Day       Cassini Scientist for a Day is a competition for 11-18 year old school       pupils that inspires participants' interest in science, improves their       knowledge of Saturn and increases independent learning and writing skills.
It was developed by NASA in 2006, in collaboration with AU scientists who       selected competition images.
Since 2007 it runs annually in the UK,       administered by the AU.
Students are given three targets for Cassini to       image.
After watching introductory films they research each target and       provide scientific arguments in favour of observing one of them in a       500-word essay.
Professor Carl Murray acts as judge through his Cassini       role, and the winning targets are imaged by Cassini.
There have been over       240 UK participants, and three annual winners (ages 11-13, 14-16, 17-18).
Winners receive the Cassini image of their chosen target.
Winners of the       senior category have been invited to work on Cassini research with Prof.       Murray.
The 2010 winner is co-author on a conference abstract (http://rings2011.astro.cornell.edu/absbook.pdf),       and will co-author a forthcoming paper.
Competition films, supporting       documents and winning essays are available on our public outreach webpage       [4].
This has been viewed 3760 times since September 2011.
Average viewing       times are in excess of 3 minutes, demonstrating significant engagement       with the material.
When asked about the impact on pupils, one teacher       responded "May I take this opportunity to thank Prof Murray for this         amazing and life-changing opportunity you have created for our         students... Over the last 4 years our students were very keen to         participate.
It has created a lot of interest among students, teachers         and even parents.
Last year alone we had 32 students inspired to do         research about Saturn and Cassini.
Academic impact of this competition         should not be underestimated.
Doing research for the essays helped our         students to gain valuable experience and to improve their independent         learning skills.
The competition has enriched our teaching curriculum         across the year groups" [1].
We conducted a survey of teachers whose       schools participated in the competition, and 100% of responses said they       would encourage their students to participate again.
Selected comments       received from the respondents describing the impact on the pupils who       participated include: "Many of them did gain new knowledge of Saturn         and the mission.
Many gained skills in scientific writing" and "New         set of skills (mainly essay writing) and above all else a huge sense of         achievement".
Media Space programme       Our Media Space programme started in 2007 as a collaboration between QMUL,       the Ideas Foundation and Venture Thinking (two educational partnership       charities), and has increased the scientific knowledge, interest and       aspiration of Year 10 students in Tower Hamlets schools.
It began as a       partnership with Morpeth school and expanded to include St. Paul's Way and       Stepney Green Schools.
The annual programme consisted of a five-day summer       school, attended by 20 students, comprising workshops run by academics and       media professionals, allowing students to explore astronomy research and       science communication.
A key element was the one-day Cassini Science       Planning workshops.
Students attended talks about Cassini research       [R1-R4], and were divided into four "research groups" each with an AU       mentor, studying Atmospheres, Rings, Surfaces, and       Fields and Particles.
They were provided with a model of the       Cassini spacecraft incorporating a camera, a dust detector, a magnetometer       and radar, and a segment of the Cassini tour.
The spacecraft must rotate       for different instruments to take data and downlinks require time       segments.
Each group was tasked to design an observation sequence using       all instruments, maximizing the scientific gain for their particular       research topic.
The final task involved merging the separate sequences       into a single optimal sequence through a process of scientific argument       and debate.
This mimics how Cassini observations are scheduled, and hones       the students' abilities to formulate and debate scientific arguments.
The       students generated films and magazines relating to space exploration       during the Media Space programmes that are available on our public       outreach webpage [4].
Over 10,000 copies of the magazines have been mailed       to schools nationally and distributed at events such as the Big Bang Fair,       generating wider awareness and knowledge of Cassini research.
In 2009 the programme won the London Education Partnership Award for "Excellent         professional practice in curriculum and student support in STEM"       [5].
The Head of Morpeth School said at the time: "Ten years ago we         would never have dreamt that we would be involved in a high profile         project on science supported by leading scientists from Queen Mary         University and NASA and having parents, teachers and students involved         in a live video link with Cassini Mission specialists".
In a later       statement he also writes "The pupils who attend Morpeth come         overwhelmingly from disadvantaged backgrounds with virtually no history         of Higher Education in their families.
For many of the Media Space         participants this was a unique opportunity to engage with high profile         astronomical research and to interact with professional scientists such         as Professor Murray.
The experience provided by the Media Space         Programme, including the awe-inspiring images of Saturn and its rings         that the pupils worked with on their projects, had a massive impact on         our pupils.
It is always dangerous to exaggerate but for one or two of         our pupils it may have been life changing" [2].
Heather MacRae,       Creative Director of the Ideas Foundation and Director of Venture Thinking       commented: "There is no doubt that Media Space achieved its primary         aims.
The numbers of pupils going on to study A level STEM subjects         increased during the time it ran... and the attitudes of the         participants towards astronomy and science in general changed markedly &#8212;         the pupils were genuinely inspired by their experiences...
Some have         gone onto university to study physics or astronomy, and often cite their         experience of Media Space as a prime motivation" [3].
One student       participant has commented: "I found the project to be extremely         insightful, intellectually stimulating and a generally fantastic         experience.
The project gave me exposure into the world of astrophysics         and physics that would have been beyond my realms at the tender age of         15/16, and for that I'm extremely thankful to Professor Murray and all         parties involved in making the project happen...
I'm currently studying         Physics at University College London..." [6].
In 2011 Media Space became Cosmic Futures, a national essay-writing       competition run in partnership with the Metro newspaper, that has had over       300 participants.
There were over 20,000 views of the content for the       Cosmic Futures competition and it was featured in the Metro newspaper six       times (average daily circulation around one million).
Media Space       attendees and competition winners have participated in teleconferences       with Cassini scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and their       achievements have been celebrated at Parliamentary Space Committee       Christmas receptions.
Astrophysics Summer Schools       Our Astrophysics Summer Schools have increased the awareness, knowledge       and interest of secondary school teachers.
By giving them the confidence       to tackle complex issues we have transformed their teaching practice.
Since 1998, as part of The Goldsmiths' Company's Science for Society       courses, the AU has run a five-day residential course on Astrophysics.
Exceptions were 2008, when organiser Prof. Emerson oversaw building of the       VISTA telescope, and during the 2012 Olympics.
Each year approximately       twenty-five secondary school teachers participate in lectures and       workshops run by AU academics.
Each lecture and workshop is based on an       academic's research, and includes background information and material       drawn directly from research outputs.
Cassini-members lectured on the       search for satellites, the dynamics of the rings (with specific focus on       the F-ring) and on Enceladus (between 2009-2013) [R1-R4]; Prof. Nelson       lectured on planet formation, using his own research insights and material       drawn from his research publication in 2000 [R5] to explain the formation       of hot Jupiter exoplanets (2009-2013); Prof. Burgess lectured on space       weather, and used research insights from his publication in 2001 [R6] to       discuss how spacecraft can predict geomagnetic storms (2009-2013).
After       attending, teachers have access to presentations online and each other's       contact details for sharing of ideas.
Attendees give feedback through a       questionnaire, and we conducted a follow-up survey in 2012 to gauge       impact.
The 2012 survey had a 28% response rate and 60% of responses       "strongly agree" and 30% "agree" that the course had an impact on their       teaching practice.
77% responded to say that they used course content in       lessons.
Selected comments from the survey include [7]: "I attended the         course because I wanted to strengthen and extend my knowledge about         current thinking and research in astronomy"; "Some of the         lectures which we were given copies of, I have used some slides in my         lessons.
I felt tremendously valued.
I was flattered that Goldmsith's         were willing to invest money in me and that the speakers likewise         invested their time and knowledge on me.
That has left a great         impression.
"; and "I have taught and taken the GCSE in astronomy         and run it as an after school club."
The questionnaires distributed at the end of each summer school include a       quality rating of the course's utility and training (0=poor to       10=excellent).
Averaging responses from 2009 onward, the percentages given       for each quality score were: 5 (1.6%), 6 (5%), 7 (8.3%), 8 (16.6%), 9       (38.3%),10 (30%).
Questionnaire responses consist largely of written       comments about the course impact.
Analysis shows that in response to       attending the summer schools, five teachers plan to set up a new astronomy       club; four teachers plan to expand the activities of existing clubs; four       teachers plan to use the National Schools' Observatory; five teachers plan       to introduce GCSE Astronomy; 36% indicate that they were motivated to       attend to learn about current research, and/or valued the research content       of the course; 35% indicated that they gained the confidence required to       tackle complex topics in the classroom; 33% indicated that they and/or       their students would be inspired/stretched/motivated because of their       attendance on the course.
Selected answers to questions about the       motivation for attending the course and value gained from it include [8]:       "To obtain an overview of the latest research in this field.
This         objective was wholly met.
"; "I applied for participation in the         astrophysics course in order to gain a deeper understanding of         astronomy.
I did this primarily to assist my teaching of GCSE physics.
I         also wanted to have enhanced knowledge of Astrophysics to assist my         colleagues who teach A-level.
I have without doubt obtained an insight         on concepts I previously had little or no understanding of.
I also feel         I am a better person and teacher for having availed of this wonderful         course at QMUL.
"; "To gain a more detailed perspective of the         extent of new research and to stretch my own knowledge further.
Both of         these objectives have been exceeded.
"; "My personal objectives         were to develop my knowledge of astrophysics...
I have taught the         astrophysics element of A-level and am conscious that I needed an         update.
This course has been superb and has more than exceeded my         expectations.
Indeed, the course has been inspirational."
Since 2008       two teachers have followed up their attendance on the summer school by       enrolling on our part-time MSc in Astrophysics.
