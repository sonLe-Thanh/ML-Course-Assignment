     Strategy for delivering impact.
Urwin, Atkinson &amp; colleagues recognised that their research impacted       on many of the critical issues of food security (maximise production,       minimise environmental impact, address public concerns).
Their patenting       and licensing strategy allowed new product development in collaboration       with multinational agricultural companies and simultaneous independent       collaboration with authorities in developing economies to establish home       grown expertise and capability in GM crops.
They also engaged with       policy-makers and the public to inform and influence the debate concerning       GM safety and use as a solution in food security.
Interactions with Industry:     i) They have been underpinned by patents granted to the University       (&gt;12 granted patents, e.g.
publication numbers: PL362116; HK1032073;       AU6063999; CZ20002005; US2001016954; GR3026133; US2003221209; US5863775;       US5824876; EP1231274; AU691020; US5589622).
ii) Opportunities are international given UK agriculture produces only 1%       of the world crop harvest.
The largest seed company in China (China seeds,       Sinochem) is funding us (2012-2015, value &#163;500k) to develop nematode       resistant cotton [A] (Technology 1) as one of the first       technologies in their newly formed plant biotechnology unit.
Monsanto       bought a licence to key USA crops, under a patent filed by the University       of Leeds (Technology 3) and has made several payments totalling &#163;44,000 to       the University since 2008 [A].
Technology 1 is being put into       crops to confer nematode resistance for pineapple, coffee and flowers in       USA (Hawaii Agriculture Research Center, (HARC), Beltsville Agricultural       Research Center) and aubergine and rice in India (Indian Agricultural       Research Institute, (IARI)) [B].
Influencing Government policy:     i) Our recommendation to have protected national field-trial sites       (Atkinson &amp; Urwin 2008, Nature 453, 979) has led to the Swiss       government establishing such a scheme [C].
We were invited to meet       the Minister for the Environment (August, 2008) who subsequently publicly       supported our research.
The Secretary of State for Environment, Food &amp;       Rural Affairs cited our work in the House of Commons as an exemplar of       research to address the critical questions concerning GM food (namely,       "what is the impact on biodiversity?")
[C].
ii) Atkinson gave evidence to the UK Parliamentary and Scientific       Committee in 2010 concerning the potential of GM crops to enhance global       food security, drawing on Urwin/Atkinson research on GM strategies to       combat potato cyst nematode (references 1-6) [D].
He also       contributed to, and reviewed, a government publication on GM crops [E].
International impact:     i) The expertise has been applied internationally.
Atkinson co-chaired       (December 2011) an evaluation of the 3rd phase of the       Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (2007-2012, expenditure &#163;6.9m,       circa 25 project partners) at the request of the Department of       Biotechnology, The Ministry of Science and Technology, India [F].
The detailed recommendations shaped the 4th phase (2013-) of       this international collaboration.
ii) Drawing on knowledge gained from consents granted by DEFRA to Urwin       and Atkinson for their UK field trials (e.g.
09/R31/01, 07/R31/01;       references 5 and 6), Atkinson was also a major contributor to the       successful submission by The National Agricultural Research Organisation       of Uganda to that country's National Biosafety Committee for the first       field trials of GM bananas and plantains for nematode control [G].
The trials were subsequently planted in 2012.     iii) Strategic work is currently centred on cotton for deployment in       China [A] and, in collaboration with other institutes, plantain       and cooking bananas in Uganda (Technologies 1 and 2, National Agricultural       Research Labs, Uganda) and Kenya (International Institute of Tropical       Agriculture).
Researchers using Technology 1 are developing nematode       resistant pineapple in Hawaii (HARC) [B] and rice and aubergine in       India (IARI).
iv) The work on cooking bananas is central to our effort to develop       public goods (Technologies 1-3).
This crop suffers estimated losses to       nematodes in Africa of 71 &#177;16% and is vital food for 100 million, mainly       poor, Africans.
The crop's sterility and slow improvement by traditional       cross-pollination techniques underpin its value for GM based improvement.
Transgenic bananas with our nematode resistance are in authorised field       trials in Uganda following planting in 2012.
Our expertise (funded by       BBSRC, RCUK, DFID, EU and USAID [H]) has enabled scientists in       Uganda and other developing countries to deliver these benefits.
We have       hosted capacity building programmes for &gt;20 scientists from developing       countries funded by DFID, BBSRC (e.g.
SARID initiative, BB/F004001/1 and       ISIS1873), The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (470529) and USAID       (APSPII).
We donate technology through DFID, USAID, BBSRC and RCUK to       provide public goods for Sub-Saharan Africa and India.
Social impact:     The work has led to numerous radio interviews (e.g.
BBC Radio 4 Farming         Today) and television appearances (e.g.
BBC's Countryfile,       2009, and the Channel 4 programme What the green movement got wrong,       2010).
Our work has been widely reported in newspapers, (e.g.
a major       article in the Sunday Times Magazine [I] and The Financial Times [I])       and included in an exhibition at the Science Museum in London.
