     Importance, relevance and pathway to impact       Increasing human population densities, intensive agriculture, water       consumption, fossil fuel combustion and the generation of waste products       from people, farming and industry, have all led to substantial increases       in the amount of nutrients (C, N and P) flushed from land to water.
In       intensively-farmed areas such as the UK, N flux has increased 5-10 fold       over the last 80 years.
In the USA alone, nutrient enrichment of inland       waters is estimated to result in annual economic losses of $2.7 billion,       due to deterioration of water quality and reductions in the productivity       of both inland and coastal fisheries.9 The impacts of this       enrichment (called eutrophication) are extensive and undesirable,       including excessive production of aquatic plant and algal biomass, loss of       biodiversity, disruption of food webs, the depletion of oxygen (hypoxia)       in the water column with associated fish kills, and the loss of ecosystem       services.
The UN now rates coastal nutrient pollution as the one of the       greatest current threats to the global environment, and the United Nations       Environment Programme (UNEP) Manila Declaration (January 2012)       identified nutrient enrichment of the marine environment as one of the top       3 foci for its Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the         Marine Environment from Land-based Activities.
A series of international agreements require countries to reduce fluxes       of nutrients to waters.
The International Convention on Long-Range         Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) is revising Annex IX of the Gothenburg         Protocol to further reduce the ammonia emissions from land-based       activities; Annex I of the International Convention for the Protection         of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)       requires the prevention and elimination of coastal water pollution from       land-based sources; the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD)       requires nutrient fluxes to be controlled to support good ecological       status in all EU waters, while the EU Urban Wastewaters Treatment         Directive (UWwTD) requires the removal of P from discharges from       major wastewater treatment works across the EU-27.
The cost implications       of delivering these improvements in water quality are significant.
Compliance with UWwTD in the UK alone has been estimated to have cost       &#8364;350m.10 The EU WFD is the single biggest piece of       environmental legislation to be implemented worldwide: costs will be       considerably greater than for compliance with the UWwTD.
To meet these regulatory obligations, government policymakers and water       managers need information on the scale of the problem, the sources of       nutrients and the likely effectiveness of intervention measures.
Routine       water quality monitoring provides some information, but not on the total       nutrient flux, its sources in complex catchments, the pathways that       nutrient fluxes follow from land to water, and how effective different       management strategies might be in reducing the rates, timing and impacts       of this flux.
This knowledge, essential for the development of effective       policy and management, can only be provided through the combined use of       robust field observations and numerical simulation models, tailored to       meet stakeholder needs.
Delivery of these tools and advice, underpinned by       an holistic understanding of the science, is imperative to ensure that       Defra, EA and the other competent authorities in the UK (and comparable       authorities internationally) are able to meet their statutory       responsibilities in the areas of water, food and energy security, in the       wider context of societal needs, government policy and international       agreements.
The Unit's contribution and impact       The Unit has directly addressed policymaker and management requirements       for robust scientific evidence and management tools.
The research has       identified key drivers of nutrient fluxes, and helped characterise the       magnitude and key sources of these fluxes within complex systems, and       clarified both the scale of the management challenge and the sectors which       might be most effectively targeted through specific management       interventions.
Defra, the Environment Agency and the statutory       conservation and management agencies have used our research findings to       develop and test measures to control nutrient and sediment pollution,       support reporting on UK discharges of nutrient pollution to the North Sea       (www.ospar.org) and to develop the UK       national nitrogen budget submitted to the Task Force for Reactive Nitrogen       under the UNECE CLRTAP (www.clrtap.org).
Evidence of impact in the period 2008-2013       In testimonial evidence, Defra11 state that the Unit's "modelling         effort has provided part of the evidence base that has helped Defra         develop and deliver policy on managing water pollution" and that it       "addresses questions that are of fundamental importance to our         prospects of meeting Water Framework Directive targets".
The       Environment Agency12 states that the work in the Unit has       delivered "significant new understanding and evidence" which has       informed its understanding of the dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus       species.
Our science research and modelling tools have both been directly       used by the EA to support the design and implementation of monitoring and       mitigation programmes under the EA- and Defra- funded Catchment         Sensitive Farming and Demonstration Test Catchments programmes and       the development of river basin management plans in Ireland13.
The modelling tools that we have developed for the end-user community have       been based on robust scientific evidence, and tailored to meet specific       evidence and policy needs, so their use has been considerable and       significant.
For example, the export coefficient modelling approach       (originally developed by the Unit as a national-scale tool in the 1998       Environment Agency's Lake Classification and Monitoring programme)       was used by the Environment Agency in the period 2008-2013 to characterise       the baseline nutrient status of UK waters, and the extent to which they       are at risk of failing to achieve Good Ecological Status under the EU WFD.
It was also used to generate the UK N budget submitted to the Task         Force for Reactive Nitrogen, Expert Panel on Nitrogen Budgets of       UNECE (UN Economic Commission for Europe).14 and inform       renegotiation of Annex IX of the Gothenburg Protocol.
An Environment Agency15 report outlines the methods and       evidence used to identify waters which are, or may become, eutrophic.
It       uses our research finding16 that nitrogen is a limiting factor       controlling the degree of eutrophication in standing waters that needs to       be assessed for all waters, and uses our work to identify appropriate       criteria to determine thresholds above which ecologically significant       elevated nitrogen loading occurs17.
This evidence has also been       used in the work of the Task Force for Reactive N (further information in       http://www.clrtap-tfrn.org/webfm_send/284).
A 2012 report by Natural       England18 on Ecosystem Services Indicators recommends that ``subject         to the availability of central funds, the contribution of habitat extent         to water quality should be established through application of a series         of nutrient export coefficients derived from the literature", citing       our most recent publication on this approach.8 Five reports13,19,20,21,22       used the findings of a Commissioned Advice Note3 we prepared       for Defra to inform the development of integrated catchment management       strategies to reduce nutrient loading on waters in throughout the UK and       thereby comply with the EU WFD.
Results from the application of INCA with climate change scenarios,       undertaken under a series of EU-funded projects, have fed directly into       catchment-scale assessments by our research collaborators in Norway and       Finland on behalf of their national environmental management agencies.
INCA was also used by the Environment Agency in the development of the River         Basin Management Plan for the Thames River Basin District.23       This provided evidence that nutrients released from agriculture or from       sewage treatment works in the future could be less diluted, under a       changing climate, with the reduced flows and higher concentrations of       nutrients promoting algal growth and the dieback of important aquatic       plant species; the management plan therefore anticipates a deterioration       of water quality in the future.
