     The overall impact of the programme of research has been that its       conclusion regarding the apparent balance of supply and demand for       graduate labour was drawn upon to inform debate and policy development in       the area of HE expansion and in the careers guidance given to students       prior to and during their degrees.
Key policy makers have commented on its       value to them in helping to formulate policy.
For example, the then Higher       Education Minister Bill Rammell said of the research that it "...provides         compelling evidence that graduates are benefiting from the skills,         knowledge and experiences that they have obtained through Higher         Education.
What is more, graduates continue to earn a substantial return         from their degrees".
Mike Hill, then Chief Executive of the Higher       Education Careers Service Unit (HECSU), said: "With competition fierce         across the whole job market, this comprehensive research shows that         graduates still have the upper hand.
The majority of them are on track         with their longer-term career plans and getting financial recognition         from employers.
[This] evidence suggests that the sooner         students start thinking about careers, the better, emphasising the         critical role careers services must play in students' lives if they are         to make the most of their degrees."
The Class of '99 study       was used in the 2011 Supporting analysis for the Higher Education         White Paper to support its analysis, and is acknowledged within it       (BIS 2011: 74).
In addition, the classification developed and tested as part of this       research stream has become a standard typology of graduate occupations and       continues to be used across a wide variety of analyses and cited in policy       publications.
Deputy Director of Research at HECSU noted that, `The         development of SOC(HE), of which Dr Wilton was an important part, has         been amongst the most valuable and important academic work on graduate         employment in the last 15 years, and we have made extensive use of it in         a range of publications.'
[T2] Analysis of labour market data using       SOC(HE) is used to elucidate the findings from the influential Destinations         of Leavers from Higher Education survey data (for example, Kitchen et         al.
2008: 11 use SOC(HE) as an analytical tool to compare the       occupational outcomes of non-graduates and graduates).
The annual `What         Do Graduates Do?'
report jointly published by HECSU and the       Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS) uses SOC(HE) as       a central point of reference in providing a comprehensive comparison of       early career graduate employment outcomes by degree subject (HECSU/AGCAS       2012: 3).
As such SOC(HE) is integral to the annual report that is         `designed to be used by pupils, parents, students and careers advisers.
It is intended to provide information about the destinations of         graduates from specific academic disciplines so that those considering a         particular degree or currently engaged in a field of study are informed         about the first destinations of recent graduates following that degree'       (ibid.
; 1).
As such, the classification of graduate jobs provided       by SOC(HE) continues to play an important role in the advice and guidance       provided to school leavers by careers advisors across further education       and in their decision-making made about subject choice in HE.
In addition,       the SOC (HE) classification is currently used for analysis by the Higher       Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) on graduates' early careers       (HEFCE 2008: 22; 2010: 49) to help make an assessment, for example, of the       provision of foundation degrees and the occupational impact of academic       subjects deemed strategically important, as the basis for policy changes.
The typology is also cited in relation to developments in wider social       policy.
For instance, SOC(HE) is cited in relation to evidence on       migration policy (Migration Advisory Committee 2010: 249), including in       the analysis of the points-based system for managed migration (Migration       Advisory Committee 2011: 12) to inform the Committee's advice to the       Minister for Immigration on which occupations should be considered       graduate-level for the purposes of granting Tier 2 Visas.
The typology       also informs the position of Universities UK on the current state of the       graduate labour market (Universities UK 2010) as the basis for informing       and influencing policy in the UK university sector.
Moreover, the National       Performance Framework for Scotland utilises the classification to measure       progress towards one of its `Scotland Performs National Indicators'       (`Increase the percentage of Scottish domiciled graduates from Scottish       Higher Education Institutions in positive destinations').
Overall, the       classification has become established as a standard means of assessing       labour market change for graduates and for contributing to and evaluating       the impact of developments in social policy.
