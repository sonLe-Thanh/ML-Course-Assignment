     Context: Diagnostics development and epidemiological studies on       echinococcosis from 2000       have influenced national and international public health policy for       surveillance, prevention and       control of that zoonosis, and the inclusion (2006) of echinococcosis in       the World Health       Organization (WHO) priority list of Neglected Zoonotic Diseases.
The       annual cost of treating       cases and economic losses to the livestock industry probably amounts to       US$ 2 billion.
Research on molecular ecology of the zoonoses toxoplasmosis and African       trypanosomiasis       has altered traditional views on routes of transmission and control       options at farm or rural       community level [a].
Application of the Echinococcus copro ELISA test developed by         Craig to screen farm         dogs in mid Wales showed increased levels of transmission over a &gt;10         year period [b]         and resulted in the subsequent initiation in 2008 by the Welsh Assembly         Government of a         dog-focused pilot echinococcosis control programme in the endemic region         [c].
This         surveillance tool has been recommended for use by WHO since 2001 [d]         and already         copied and applied to epidemiological studies and Echinococcus         control programmes in         Argentina, Chile, Australia and China [e].
Our collaborative based research in western China provided community         data and         surveillance approaches that under-pinned the decision of the Ministry         of Health China to         undertake (from 2006/7) the world`s largest echinococcosis control         programme.
This         National Echinococcosis control programme continues to run in China         through the 2010-           2020 Action Plan with US$100 million allocation wherein         coproantigen tests for canine         echinococcosis, based on our research, are used as a key surveillance         tool across 8         Provinces [e].
In 2010 we formed a Salford-based enterprise laboratory Cestode           Diagnostics as a         testing, development and training unit for cestode parasite detection,         diagnosis and         molecular typing of animal and human derived samples which has also         recently         highlighted pathological problems of larval cestodes in mammals in zoos         or safari parks in         UK [g].
An Echinococcus OIE/ DEFRA licensed reference         laboratory under Craig has         operated in Salford since 1999.
Inter-disciplinary collaboration between parasitologist (Craig,         Salford), mammalian         ecologist (Giraudoux, Franche-Comte) and geographer (Danson, Salford),         to study the         transmission of alveolar echinococcosis in China has resulted in wider         implications and         impact for role of landscape ecology in the emergence of non-vector         borne zoonotic         pathogens associated with small mammal populations [h].
Our collaborative work on the development of molecular tools for         understanding human         and animal trypanosomiasis in Africa (Hide, Salford; S.Welburn,         Edinburgh) has         demonstrated the importance of cattle as a reservoir for human sleeping         sickness [i] and         this has led to the development of the "Stamp out Sleeping Sickness         (SOS)" programme         in Uganda and contributed to the "Research in Use" scheme [j].
2011: The World Health Organisation, Collaborating Center for         Prevention and Treatment         of Human Echinococcosis recently provided an overview           of research on disease         distribution [k] and refers to the impact of Craig et al's         international collaborative work in         China: "This academic initiative, which now focuses on more specific           research issues,           has been followed by a national program for surveillance and           management of the disease           in China (Action Plan, 2010), which involves 14 ministries and is           certainly the most           ambitious state-funded project ever implemented to diagnose and treat           AE in the world."
