     An estimated 62,000 people in the UK develop Alzheimer's disease (AD)         each year, of which         the majority (50-64%) are in the early stages of the disease, and       the latter are now eligible to         receive the drugs Reminyl (Galantamine), Aricept (Donepezil) or       Exelon (Rivastigmine),       according to the revised (March 2011) NICE guidelines.
A fourth       drug (Ebixa) is available for       people in the late stages of the disease and in the moderate stages if       they cannot tolerate the       anticholinesterase drugs.
The earlier rulings by NICE (November 2006)       indicated that the       acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs did not offer sufficient benefit to       patients with early-stage       disease (i.e.
those with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score of       21-26) to justify their       use in these patients (5.1).
However, NICE eventually reversed this       decision (5.2) after much       pressure from various patient groups, carer groups and clinicians, but       most notably from The       Alzheimer's Society, who were particularly vociferous in their support for       change (5.3, 5.4, 5.5).
Some of the arguments for this change centred around criticism of the       economic model used by       NICE to calculate whether the drugs offered value for money, because this       model did not       accurately reflect the hidden economic costs of care for dementia patients       outside of hospital.
However, the publication of further studies into the potential clinical       benefits of these drugs to       patients with "mild" AD in the five years leading up to the NICE       reappraisal also contributed to the       arguments for change.
During this period, research-based evidence for       disease-modifying effects       of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs started to appear, suggesting       that they may not be       purely symptomatic treatments, and that early intervention should be       recommended to gain the       most benefit to patients from these drugs.
The research of Allsop and collaborators into the disease-modifying       effects of Galantamine was       directly funded by The Alzheimer's Society (3.6, 3.7) and the results and       potential significance of       this research, in terms of the recommended early treatment for people with       AD, were well known to       the Society and were widely publicised through their printed literature       and also via their website for       a few years prior to their final publication in 2009 (5.6, 5.7, 5.8).
The following two quotations refer directly to the work of Prof. Allsop,       and are taken from The       Alzheimer's Society Newsletter `The Journal of Quality Research in       Dementia' (5.6):     "There is an exciting piece of research from David Allsop's group in         Lancaster, looking at the       potential therapeutic properties of existing acetylcholinesterase       inhibitors.
These drugs are used       currently for treating symptoms of dementia, but there is lack of       substantial evidence to show       whether or not they may be of therapeutic value in treating disease       progression.
The results of         this current study will highlight important evidence in putting forward         an argument in using         these drugs in a therapeutic context."
"The current investigations into the potential therapeutic applications       of the existing cholinesterase       inhibitor drugs could be groundbreaking if they are found to have       disease-modifying effects on       Alzheimer's disease progression.
This would mean that there would be a         case for prescribing         these drugs at earlier stages of disease and for longer, rather than       just to treat symptoms at       the later stages as is the current state of affairs."
This impact case is supported by a letter (5.9) from the former Head of       Research (2003-2011) of       The Alzheimer's Society, and the following passage is taken directly from       this letter:     "Alzheimer's Society fought a hard campaign during several years to have       the recommended       prescription window widened.
As part of the campaign, the organisation       sought to build the       evidence base through commissioning critical reviews of existing clinical       research literature and       providing research grants to scientists seeking to better understand the       underlying mechanisms of       the active pharmaceuticals' biochemical and cellular activities.
The Amyloid &#946; aggregation starts in the brain many years before symptoms       of dementia appear in       Alzheimer's disease and the search is still on for drugs that can prevent       the aggregation early.
Prof         Allsop's research demonstrating that Galantamine had an additional         biochemical activity of         inhibiting this aggregation was an important supporting argument at the         time of the         campaign.
It seemed to promise that the drug would likely be       efficacious in the early stages of       disease.
Although not evidenced at the time, this result made it more       likely that some of the other       cholinesterase inhibitors might also have biochemical effects in addition       to the inhibition of       acetylcholine degradation....Together with the critical reviews of       existing clinical research it helped         win the case for people with dementia and their carers."
