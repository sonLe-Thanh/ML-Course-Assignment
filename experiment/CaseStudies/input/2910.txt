     Context     Engineering is crucial to the Government's strategy to rebalance the UK       economy.
The sector       accounted for a fifth of UK GDP in 2009 and employs over 4.5 million       people across nearly half a       million businesses representing 24% of UK turnover.
In spite of this,       there is still a shortage of       young people studying STEM subjects, leading to a shortfall in the number       of high-quality       engineering graduates.
Public engagement with our research has led to       impacts in public       awareness of the impact of science on society and in schoolchildren's       interest in STEM subjects.
Pathways to Impact     We have used the state-of-the-art imaging capability developed through       our research activities to       demonstrate the behaviour of advanced materials and components in a new       and exciting way.
Our       3D journey through a jet engine entitled `So You Think You Can           Design A Jet Engine' is an       excellent toolkit for enthusing school children and the general public       about the wonders of       engineering and materials.
The University of Manchester, partnering with       Rolls-Royce, the       Museum of Science &amp; Industry (MOSI), Institute of Materials, Minerals       and Mining, Royal Academy       of Engineering, Manufacturing Institute, NW Aerospace Alliance and NW       Development Agency       have engaged with thousands of schoolchildren, teachers and parents.
The       toolkit consists of:             Interactive 3D stereoscopic journey through a jet engine -         developed in collaboration         with Rolls-Royce and based on our research into X-ray imaging, this 3D         display allows         visitors to explore the interior of a Trent 900 engine from an Airbus         A380.
Short linked         videos explain how the engine design relates to materials research.
Jet engine designer software - reinforces concepts learned         about materials selection in         engines by allowing young people to design their own engines and see if         they can fly.
Materials Top Trump Cards support the jet engine design game by         allowing users to         compare materials, and can also be used as a separate game of guessing         material         properties.
Augmented reality tools show materials superimposed with their         microstructure.
Aviation and Environment debate pack to debate the global         impacts of our science.
Reach and Significance     These public outreach activities have taken place in the 2008-2013 period       with thousands of young       people and hundreds of teachers, stimulating their interest in science and       technology through the       variety of different mechanisms listed below These outreach activities       were recognised by the       Royal Academy of Engineering through the award of its Nexia Solutions       Education Innovation       prize.
The project was also showcased as an exemplar of good practice at       two EPSRC PPE       regional workshops (Manchester and Birmingham, 2008), and was selected for       the Royal Academy       of Engineering Exhibition (2009).
Make It in Manufacturing Campaign [A]     The Manufacturing Institute launched the Make It in Manufacturing       campaign to promote the       breadth of exciting and interesting career opportunities the sector can       offer to the brightest and       best young people.
It is the banner for a whole raft of high profile       education and awareness raising       activities aimed at introducing teenagers to manufacturing and dispelling       the many myths that       contribute to a negative public image of the sector.
In 2009 we       participated in Skills North West       Make it in Manufacturing Campaign at the Reebok Stadium, Bolton.
Of the       15,000 12/13 pupils       attending 2,250 participated in the Design a Jet Engine activity over 3       days.
After visiting the Make       It stand, 70% wanted to know more about careers in Manufacturing and       Engineering, 82% would       recommend a career in manufacturing and Engineering to a friend and 70%       had positively       changed their minds about engineering.
Permanent Interactive Display at MOSI [B,C]     To maximise our accessible target audience we partnered with MOSI to       enable sustainability of the       impact.
How to Design a Jet Engine is now on permanent display at the Air       &amp; Space Gallery of the       Museum of Science &amp; Industry (Manchester).
Exposure of the display       over the period has been       extensive targeting both our primary audience of schools at KS4, as well       as secondary audience of       family visitors.
In the 2010 MOSI report the exhibit was highlighted has       been very popular.
In 2009       MOSI attracted 600,000 visitors of which 50,000 were educational in       nature.
The display has also       acted as a focal point for 3 Meet the Engineer Family days at MOSI (2009)       with 500 visitors       spending over an hour each doing interactive challenges and an Environment       debate day at       Museum of Science &amp; Industry (MOSI), October 2009 for 40 Year 9-11       pupils     Broader Outreach [D]     We have made extensive use of a wide range of different public, school       and teaching engagement       mechanisms.
Examples of these have included large scale public events       including: 6 Air shows       (Farnborough (2008 - 2012), Southport (2009 - 2011)) ~12,000 total       visitors to stand; Big Bang fair       (2009, 2010) in partnership with Rolls-Royce - ~9,000 school visitors; and       2 science shows (2009       and 2010) at `Scientrific', Wrexham Science Festival - ~5,000 visitors.
Manchester Science       Festival Schools Events along with Science days at Schools and Educator       Conferences directly       reached ca.
1,500 students and 200 teachers.
Inspiring the Future [E]     The RAE Ingenious Award funded the training of 30 young engineers in       public engagement.
The       trainees gained practical experience by participating in the public and       schools events above.
Some       97% of the participants indicated that their presentation skills had       improved and that they had       increased their interest in public engagement.
The success of these       outreach activities has led to       the development of a follow-on activity based upon School of Materials       research on materials for       the nuclear power industry: "So you think you know about nuclear energy!"
(2010-2014).
