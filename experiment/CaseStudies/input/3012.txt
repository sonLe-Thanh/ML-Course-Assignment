     The impact of the research has been achieved through three main pathways:             challenging conventional wisdom and improving public         understanding of sustainable consumption and behaviour change;        helping to reframe policy debate on these issues, with ideas         and evidence adopted by national and international policy fora         and non-governmental organisations;        contributing directly to policy innovation through         incorporation into the development of frameworks for devising and         assessing policy recommendations, and associated policy toolkits.
A wide range of public engagement activities was adopted to       influence public discourse and help open up a space for debate.
Examples       include Southerton's public lectures for the Cheltenham Science Festival       (2010) and British Library (2012), with additional lectures and debates       (to audiences in excess of 100) delivered on ten occasions, in six       countries.
Significantly, the research has been covered by several media       outlets, with appearances such as that by Evans on the BBC Breakfast       programme (21st September 2011), highlighting scope for ongoing       diffusion and impact.
The field of sustainable consumption is a broad one, ranging from energy       policy through to transport and food policy.
Nonetheless, this research       has had a particularly wide influence and reach, as indicated by the       National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) who note that       the practices approach "offers us the possibility of a genuine         paradigm shift in the world of behaviour change and disease prevention         in ways that have for the most part to date been unexplored.
It also         offers theoretical purchase in a field dominated by psychological models         with only the most cursory consideration of social context" [1].
Moreover, the potential for ongoing impact is clear, and it is confirmed       that: "The team at Manchester... have been involved in a number of         very important theoretical and empirical projects using the sociological         conception of social practices as a way of describing health related         behaviour change.
This is a very significant departure... NICE will be         exploring with [UoM] the possibilities of developing these ideas         further" [1].
Specific partnerships with policymakers (seeking to       tackle the `value-action gap') are outlined below, offering `proof of       principle' for the ISM approach.
Public Policy: Practice approaches to consumption and behaviour       change appear within UK Government reports from 2008 &#8212; and are emphasised       at the launch of the SCI in 2009 &#8212; but it is the 2011 Scottish Government       (`SG') Report that forms the basis of this case [B].
The Report put in       place a conceptual framework &#8212; the ISM approach &#8212; that was further       refined into an applied toolkit, co-created by Evans and Southerton, and       launched on 5th June 2013.
Together the approach and toolkit       critiqued existing policy initiatives (focused extensively on information       campaigns and financial incentives) and, as the Principal Research Officer       of the SG notes, have "gained considerable currency within the         environmental behaviour change field in Scotland, which is only likely         to grow given the publication of the ISM user and technical guides"       [2].
The 2011 launch of the SG Report was attended by c.100 stakeholders; a       third policy makers, and a similar percentage academic staff.
In noting       that the SG has both `drawn extensively' on the report and `adapted' it       within presentations, the SG's Principal Research Officer, confirms that       both the Report and ISM model that emerged from it "has had a direct         impact on the development of the Scottish Government's approach to         influencing low carbon behaviours" [2] The Report was picked up in       several ways:             Key documents: The SG Report was referenced by the Scottish           Environment Minister in the Scottish Parliament as written         evidence for consideration by the `Transport Infrastructure And Climate         Change Committee'; used as evidence in the report `Regulation of Energy         Efficiency in Housing'; and cited within the `Low Carbon Scotland:         Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027' document [3].
Additional uptake: The Scottish Government's Environment           Research team included substantial reference to the SG Report's         theoretical framework in a number of internal and external presentations         [2], with independent researchers AD Research and Analysis (ADRA)         utilising the SG Report as a framework for devising and assessing policy         recommendations in the report `The Impact of Workplace Initiatives on         Low Carbon Behaviours' [4].
More specifically, ADRA made significant use         of the ISM model to explain critical success factors, leading to best         practice guidance (published separately for internal use) that adopted         `built-in' principles established in the SG report, as ADRA note "ISM           again proved its worth, not simply as an evaluative or analytical           framework, but also a practical way of thinking about policies and           interventions, and one which practitioners and publics seemed to find           intuitive" [5].
Following this engagement, the Scottish Government         drew extensively on the SG Report in `Research Findings from the Climate         Change Behaviours Research Programme' which sets out findings from         across its wider `behaviours programme'.
This document focused on the         need for integrated approaches, moments of change and robust evaluation,         which were all key findings from the SG report [2][6].
Stakeholder focused: In April 2012 the Scottish Government         adapted the SG Report into a presentation for stakeholders on their approach           to behaviour change policy, with its Principal Research Officer         noting that: "This represented an important moment in disseminating           published insights into the practices of policy makers and provided           the `impetus' for the commissioning of an ISM toolkit" [2].
The         subsequent project, entitled `The ISM Model: User Guide', aimed to         provide concrete guidance to policy makers and stakeholders on how to         pragmatically rethink intervention planning.
In applying the ISM         approach set out in the SG report, Evans co-wrote the toolkit with ADRA,         and "Southerton and colleagues then reviewed this draft Technical           Guide."
As ADRA recognised throughout: "ISM provides a way of           thinking and talking about behaviour and practices which policy makers           find instantly easy to grasp, and yet which goes on to challenge the           common assumptions of their profession (e.g.
that information and           incentives are sufficient for lasting change)" [5].
Further afield: It is notable that the reach of the ISM         approach is increasing.
In June 2012 an enquiry was made to the Scottish         Government from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to discuss the SG Report,         with officials meeting to discuss the toolkit [2].
Additionally, the         work has been utilised: by ADRA on a project tackling obesity for the UK         Department for Health "... used as an explanatory device, to analyse           the elements of effective interventions, but also to organise the           complex evidence on the determinants of obesity.
Armed with the           observation that most of the factors influencing weight among young           people fall into the `Social' context, DH are now working up ideas for           pilot interventions, as part of the Change4Life campaign" [5].
The         European Commission `Science for Environmental Policy Future Brief' has         employed the SG Report to summarise key approaches to behaviour change,         borrowing key recommendations for its `policy implications' section [7].
Finally, the work has been cited: in a World Economic Forum report; in         Australia, and by the Queensland Department of Transport [8].
Expert advice: As suggested by the engagement with NICE,       summarised at the outset, UoM researchers have purposely sought additional       avenues for the ISM approach, taking up expert advisory roles when       appropriate, and consistently seeking to influence the framing and       development of future policy and research strategy.
Excluding       general advice or consultancy roles, the following engagements foreground       the application of research findings and the `practices' approach'       developed by the researchers:             Warde: member of the 2008 European Environment Agency panel         advising on sustainable consumption and behaviour change; appointed to         the International Scientific Committee for the Institut National de           la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) instructing on food research         strategy in France.
Evans: ongoing role with the Waste and Resources Action         Programme (WRAP), where he "advised on the implications of `social           practices'... and thinking about possible interventions for waste           reduction.
The insights... have also influenced the design of WRAP's           interventions to tackle food waste and the targeting of these           interventions" [9].
Southerton: appointed to the Department of Energy and Climate         Change (DECC) expert panel on `Energy Behaviours' (2012-date), where he         has been instrumental in re-directing policy and research strategy in         the area of behaviour change, a former DECC manager noting that         Southerton's first workshop "led our team to reconsider our approach           by drawing more attention to the complexities of the issues and           highlighting potentially more productive avenues to explore" [10].
