     Although the impacts of the research began outside the current REF       period, the recommendations in the report to DEFRA on the Regional Food       Strategy (RFS) have left a significant and enduring legacy that has       continued into the period 2008-2013.
This is in spite of a change of       government policy and the withdrawal of state financial support for its       delivery.
Additional impacts have also arisen as a result of recent       research with the new EU Member States, thus spreading the reach of the       impact beyond the UK.
Implementing recommendations from the evaluation of the RFS       The recommendations of the evaluation were accepted by DEFRA and       implemented from 2006 onwards.
Additional funding of &#163;2 million was       provided to FFB to support a programme of activities (years 2006/7), with       the study cited as justification (IMP1&amp;2): "Following an         economic evaluation of its Regional Food Strategy, Ministers announced         during the year that Defra would continue to support producers of         quality regional food and drink through a programme of activities aimed         at creating trade development opportunities, raising consumer awareness         and improving business competitiveness" (IMP2p129).
The       study was also cited in parliament by Lord Bach, the Parliamentary       Under-Secretary of State responsible for Sustainable Farming and Food, as       part of a justification for additional resources to deliver the RFS (IMP3).
Continuing the impact in a changed policy environment       Government funding for FFB was withdrawn in July 2008 (and FFB ceased       operations in 2009) but support for the sector continued at a regional       level, thus continuing to deliver on the recommendations of the       evaluation.
An important legacy of the RFS remains in the existence of the       eight Regional Food Groups (RFGs) (IMP4&amp;5) that continue to       support the activities of the sector via initiatives such as the       development of local food supply chains to supermarkets (IMP6).
The Chair of TASTECLUB, the legacy organization of the north east RFG,       commented that "the [Newcastle] research informed the sustainable food         and farming policy that led to the establishment of the RFGs" (IMP4).
The reach of this impact can be further evidenced by comments from       TASTECLUB's users, such as: "At last there is an organisation really         promoting North East produce!"
and "I am sure that all of the         producer members will benefit from the increasing awareness of local         food which is being created by their enthusiastic use of social media         and the other marketing endeavours which are being undertaken'' (IMP4).
Users of other food groups confirmed the efficacy of this approach: "The         food group also introduced me to a contract manufacturing company that         can help boost production capacity so that we can fulfil our exciting         new listing with Booths supermarkets" (Food NorthWest) (IMP5p4)       and "Taste of the West is a very professional organisation with really         good routes to market."
(IMP5p7).
Another important recommendation was that the UK government should take       applications for protection of origin for regionally distinctive food       products more seriously.
Evidence that the revised policy has been       effective can be seen in the fact that since the evaluation, the number of       applications for protected status in the UK has roughly doubled (IMP7)       and DEFRA is actively supporting capacity building among producers to make       further applications with staff dedicated to this task (IMP8).
The       evaluation was also influential in justifying the inclusion of support to       the regional food sector within the Rural Development Programme for       England (RDPE) (2007-2013) (IMP9), a major programme of support       for food, farming and rural development funded by the Common Agricultural       Policy (CAP).
The RDPE programme document specifically mentions the       evaluation and makes clear recommendations for measures to support local       value added production in the delivery of the &#163;5bn programme (IMP9).
Extending reach to the New Member States       As part of the FOCUS Balkans project (2008-11), Newcastle has contributed       its strengths in consumer research to the analysis of the consumption of       regional and other types of foods.
Post-project, a Balkan Network for Food       Consumer Science has been established, of which Newcastle is a founder       member (IMP10).
The network brings together academics, policy       makers and industry practitioners to stimulate regional and       interdisciplinary co-operation and knowledge exchange in the field of       consumer science.
It thus helps to develop an alternative economic model       for food production and marketing that supports the competitiveness of the       small farms, which are the bedrock of the rural economy of the Balkans.
A       representative of Zvijezda, a company specialising in edible oil products,       commented "all the findings that have been presented to us...are         useful to us to better understand food consumers and their needs.
In         this way, we can know how to better respond to those needs and who are         the clients we target and what is the way to project our products" (IMP10).
