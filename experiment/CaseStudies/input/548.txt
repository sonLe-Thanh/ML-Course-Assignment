     The above research has had impact both on the ways in which issues are       discussed in the public sphere and on placing particular issues in the       public domain.
Pathways to impact       Work with Soundings has put this research at the forefront of       public debates which focus on challenging dominant political frames.
After         Neoliberalism: The Kilburn Manifesto has been featured twice on The         Guardian's Comment is Free blog with over 1400 user-generated       comments.
A series of four linked events organised by Little and chaired       by Littler have been regularly oversubscribed with audiences ranging from       40 to 300 attendees and transcripts appearing on Open Democracy's Our         Kingdom blog site (see video:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIVxeJX-3qU).
Collaborations of this kind are typical of the group's work, reaching       large audiences through strong links with media outlets as well as civil       society, public policy and party political groups as appropriate to the       nature of their work.
A spokesperson of the New Economics Foundation       stated that such collaborations `represent[ed] an excellent example of         the interaction between a university, think tanks and civil society'.
We identify three specific examples of impact below.
a.
Public perception and discussion of the financial crisis and the         future of political economy     Rutherford's work is highly influential in public policy debates.
He was       involved, through Soundings, in coordinating numerous       impact/engagement activities including the `Class and Culture' series of       talks in 2008 (online debate edited by Little) and After New Labour (2008)       with The Guardian (http://pennyred.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/after-new-labour-report-on.html).
These       activities brought together academics, NGOs, journalists, activists and       politicians from the Treasury, TUC, War On Want, the Family and Parenting       Institute, as well as universities of Essex, Jiao Tong, Jawaharlal Nehru       and Cambridge to work on alternative cultural economies.
Rutherford has       been described as one of the Labour Party's 'leading thinkers' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rutherford)       and has had articles published across a range of well known high       circulation media outlets while working at Middlesex, including The         Guardian, New Statesman, Total Politics, and others.
b.
The emergence of intergenerational politics     Little's edited e-books Radical Future (2010) and Regeneration       (2012) on the identities, politics and predicaments of people under 30 had       been downloaded over 60,000 times and over 90,000 times respectively by       June 2013 (data provided by publisher, July 2013).
The books helped to       establish the discourse of intergenerational politics in the UK.
Radical         Future was featured in a Guardian election special as well       as on the Comment is Free blog.
Attendance at the launch event for       Regeneration (http://www.if.org.uk/archives/1826/regeneration-book-launch-at-foyles)       demonstrated the level of public interest (this was oversubscribed with       capacity for 150).
The books have also acted as the hub for a network of       young activists, campaigners and journalists.
The chair of the leading think-tank Compass acknowledges the       impact of this project stating: `The work that Dr. Ben Little has done         around intergenerational politics helped us develop our thinking around         youth policy, directly informing the proposals advanced in the manifesto         entitled "Plan B: a good economy for a good society", launched in London         in October 2011, which received the support of over 100 leading         economists.'
This approach to intergenerational politics also informs more general       `youth' issues.
One of the co-directors of Intern Aware       collaborated with Little on a project that helped them to collect over       1,500 letters addressed to MPs.
This initiative resulted in a       parliamentary debate on the issue of unpaid internships, a debate that is       still ongoing with further discussion planned this year.
A global       campaigner for Oxfam GB who collaborated with 100 of Little's       students for the production of a high quality video on the issue of tax       justice reports that `the experience was valuable to me in my role as         organiser as it was an opportunity to find modes of communicating         current issues in ways that were relevant' for young people.
Little has organised a range of political briefing events on this subject       and he was invited to brief the leader of the Labour Party as part of a       group of young activists in November 2012, with a follow-up meeting in       July 2013 and more planned for the future.
c. New ways of thinking about consumption     This was facilitated by Littler's collaboration with the `Church of Stop       Shopping' and participation in ESRC-funded seminars with staff from the       Fairtrade Foundation and the AHRC-funded Ethical Consumption seminar.
The       Chair of Compass describes how: 'The research of Dr. Jo         Littler has forwarded our engagement with consumer politics, lending us         an effective conceptual framework linking radical politics with consumer         society.'
