     Danson et al provided the first clear evidence that landscape change       affects the spatial       distribution of the Em parasite, and that the spatial organisation of       landscape elements,       including parasite host habitat, dogs, and human populations, creates       local-scale patchiness to       transmission risk.
This understanding has impacted directly on disease       prevention, and control       of the parasite, which the World Health Organization notes, "...are         perhaps some of the more         important global parasitic diseases, with more than 1 million people         affected at any one time,         many showing severe clinical syndromes."
[a]            The key impact of the work is the understanding that the local-scale         spatial arrangement of         landscape around human settlements has a direct effect on the risk of         transmission to         individuals and communities, enabling the development of key public         health messages to         individuals and communities in the endemic areas, that "proximity to           habitat that supports           the intermediate hosts of the parasite, and the accessibility of           free-ranging domestic dogs           to this habitat directly affects the likelihood of infection with the           parasite."
Danson et al have         carried out targeted surveys in numerous remote communities in western         China,         Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as European hotspots in eastern         France, southern         Germany and Switzerland [11], raising awareness of disease         transmission mechanisms,         and prevention, for more than 10,000 people.
The success of this research, and its subsequent impact, is a result         of cross-disciplinary         working, international collaboration, and close involvement in the         fieldwork of medical         teams and government organisations responsible for human health in the         endemic areas.
Impact is demonstrated not only on the health and well-being of         individuals in the endemic         areas, but also through an emerging focus on better understanding the         spatial nature of the         risk factors for human AE, and the design of disease control strategies,         in organisations         responsible for in-country health management.
In the work described the unique and critical contribution of Danson's         work is the explicit         integration of spatial sampling and spatial mapping and modelling         techniques.
In contrast         to earlier epidemiological surveys undertaken in Asia, north America and         Europe, current         survey methods adopted by agencies like the Sichuan Centre for Diseases         Control and         Prevention (China) now include, as a direct result of the work         undertaken by Danson, geo-referenced         data collection in all aspects of their work.
Recording and archiving         spatially         referenced data on dogs, humans and parasite hosts improves the accuracy         and efficiency         with which such agencies collect relevant data to test the effectiveness         of control         strategies.
The range of non-academic agencies influenced by the work may be         evidenced directly by         the list of partners funded directly in the supporting research grants,         which include: Sichuan         Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (China) [d], Ningxia         Medical College (China),         Xinjiang Medical College (China), Kyrgyz Institute of Livestock,         Veterinary Science and         Pastures (Kyrgyzstan) and Ministry of Education and Science         (Kazakhstan).
The broader impact on disease management of Salford's research is seen       most clearly in its       influence on national-scale programmes concerned with the control of       hydatid (of which AE is       one) disease:             2010: Action Plan for Prevention and Control of           Echinococcosis in China (2010-2015).
The           Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
[b]         Danson et al's         collaborative work in China has impacted directly on the development of         an Action Plan to         prevent and control hydatid disease.
The Action Plan has a five year         time frame (2010-2015)         and aims to "...comprehensively promote hydatid disease prevention           and control           work, to further control the prevalence of hydatid disease, protect           people's health, promote           economic development and social harmony and stability....".
Amongst the objectives of the Action Plan are several that were driven         directly by the         Salford research including: "...... (identifying) ownerless dogs         in endemic areas to explore         management... international cooperation and exchanges...and the         introduction of foreign         advanced technology".
The ministries tasked with implementing the Action         Plan include:         Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, the National Development and         Reform         Commission, Science and Technology State Ethnic Affairs Commission,         Ministry of Public         Security, Ministry of Civil Affairs Ministry of Finance, Ministry of         Water Resources, Ministry         of Agriculture, Ministry of Commerce, State Administration of Radio,         State Forestry         Administration, and China Women's Federation.
2011: The World Health Organisation, Collaborating Center           for Prevention and Treatment           of Human Echinococcosis [c] recently provided an overview         of research on disease         distribution and provides clear evidence of the impact of Danson et al's         international         collaborative work in China, and the link to [b]: "This           academic initiative, which now           focuses on more specific research issues, has been followed by a           national program for           surveillance and management of the disease in China (Action Plan,           2010), which involves           14 ministries and is certainly the most ambitious state-funded project           ever implemented to           diagnose and treat AE in the world."
Alveolar Echinococcosis is an important emerging human parasitic         disease that is         estimated to cost 650,000 disability adjusted life years annually.
[a]         Increased awareness         of the extent and impact of the disease, driven in large part by the         work of the Salford         group and its collaborators, is influencing major initiatives to prevent         and control human         infection.
In addition to the China Action Plan 2010 the World Bank has         recently committed         $10 million for the control of hydatid and other diseases in Kyrgyzstan         where recent         research has suggested that changes in land use and animal husbandry,         and the removal         of veterinary services following the collapse of the communism in the         early 1990s, is         leading to an emerging new focus of the disease.
Knowledge of the         spatial characteristics         of disease epidemiology, established by Danson, is critical to the         success of these         initiatives and this knowledge will continue to inform and underpin the         fight against this         incurable human disease for the next decade and beyond.
