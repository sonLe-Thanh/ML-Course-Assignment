     Impact on UK clinical practice and patient care     The BASIL trial led to a number of recommendations, many of which have       been actively embraced       by NICE as part of their recently published (August 2012) Peripheral       Arterial Disease (PAD)       Clinical Guidelines [1].
Professor Bradbury was a member of the       NICE PAD Guidelines       Development Group.
Specifically linked to BASIL findings, the guidelines       emphasise:            Significant health gains for patients with SLI lie in earlier         diagnosis and imaging; the         implementation of evidence-based best medical therapy; appropriate         imaging; and prompt         referral to a specialist vascular service       The best outcomes for SLI are achieved when vascular surgeons and         interventional         radiologists work closely together with other professionals as part of a         multidisciplinary         team in specialist, high-volume centres       The decision whether to perform bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty         first appears to         depend upon co-morbidities (life expectancy); pattern of disease;         availability of a vein as a         bypass conduit; and patient preference          In the context of these guidelines, in terms of clinical practice and       patient care the BASIL findings       translate to the following changes:            SLI patients expected to live less than 2 years should usually be         offered endovascular         intervention first, as it is associated with less morbidity and cost,         and such patients are         unlikely to enjoy the longer-term benefits of surgery       Those patients expected to live beyond 2 years should usually be         offered bypass surgery         first, especially where a vein is available as a conduit       Many patients who could not undergo a vein bypass would probably have         been better         served by a first attempt at balloon angioplasty than prosthetic bypass.
Surgeons should         make every effort to use vein and should view prosthetic material as a         last resort          Impact on international clinical guidelines     The impact of these findings and their clinical uptake is not limited to       the UK.
Following publication       of the trial outcomes Professor Bradbury has been invited to present the       BASIL data in Europe, the       Middle and Far East, North and South America and Australia.
The novel       insights and       recommendations emanating from BASIL were consequently adopted into and       highlighted in a       number of key international guidelines which are now guiding clinical       practice in this area:            The 2011 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on the diagnosis         and treatment of PAD         [2], endorsed by the European Stroke Association, reference         BASIL-1 in their         recommendations for surgical revascularisation in with respect to         revascularisation state:         "When surgery is considered to revascularise infra-iliac lesions,           autologous saphenous vein is           the bypass graft of choice."
The 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart         Association updated         guidelines for `Management of Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease' [3]         discuss the BASIL         trial and how this has led to two new recommendations:                For patients with limb-threatening lower extremity ischemia and             an estimated life             expectancy of 2 years or less or in patients in whom an autogenous             vein conduit is not             available, balloon angioplasty is reasonable to perform when             possible as the initial             procedure to improve distal blood flow.
For patients with limb-threatening ischemia and an estimated life             expectancy of more             than 2 years, bypass surgery, when possible and when an autogenous             vein conduit is             available, is reasonable to perform as the initial treatment to             improve distal blood flow                 As noted above, BASIL-1 has been endorsed by a number of key       organisations; most recently, as       part of the process of applying to the HTA for funds to conduct BASIL-2       (NIHR HTA, &#163;2,004,572,       Chief Investigator, Professor Andrew Bradbury):             Circulation Foundation:"The original BASIL trial has           had profound impact worldwide, indeed I           personally have heard BASIL data referred to and discussed at meetings           on at least 5           continents!
Trials of such importance have a major effect on clinical           practice and patient           care"[4].
European Society of Vascular Surgery: "The BASIL-1           trial has had a profound effect on the           management of lower limb ischaemia at a time when more and more           clinicians had been           moving towards an endovascular first approach" [5]          As a result of this work, the World Federation of Vascular Societies,       (WFVS) Society for Vascular       Surgery (SVS) and European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) have agreed       on the need for       clear standards for peripheral arterial care, and come together to develop       standard guidelines.
Professor Andrew Bradbury was elected as the WFVS Representative to lead       this initiative by an       Executive group at which there were representatives from all the       supporting continental societies:       ESVS; SVS; Australasian Vascular Society; Asian Vascular Society; Southern       African Society;       Indian Vascular Society, Japanese Vascular Society and Society of Vascular       Surgery and       Angiology for Latin America.
These societies represent almost all vascular       surgical societies in the       countries in the world, and Prof Bradbury will now lead the discussions       and collaborations across       not only Europe but also Asia, Australasia and Southern Africa that take       this important area of       patient care forward.
