     Groombridge's research has improved the long-term conservation prospects       for two critically- endangered bird species and one of the world's most       endangered frogs in Mauritius and the Seychelles.
The impact is       particularly significant because island biodiversity forms an important       portion of global evolutionary heritage and these isolated systems also       host some of the world's most endangered species.
Impact on practice (see section 5, points A, B, C, D)       Groombridge's approach has galvanised conservation action for specific       endangered species and their populations in Mauritius and Seychelles.
On Seychelles, Groombridge negotiated with local and regional government       bodies and brokered support for translocation and establishment of a         new population of Seychelles paradise flycatchers, one of the rarest       flycatchers in the world.
This was a major political and logistical       landmark in the conservation management of this species, as lack of       agreement had stalled progress towards translocation since 2001, when the       Species Action Plan advocated reintroduction to Denis Island (detailed in       section 5, point B).
In doing so, Groombridge informed the Government         of Seychelles National Species Action Plan for the flycatcher and       provided a framework for how to successfully carry out reintroductions.
This work by Groombridge also paved the way for population genetic work on       this species and this has helped to define the emerging field of       `reintroduction genetics' with a significant impact on conservation         practice.
Moreover, phylogenetic work by Groombridge (2009-13) has       revealed the Seychelles paradise flycatcher to be one of the most       distinctive Indian Ocean species, which not only justifies the field       conservation and translocation/reintroduction efforts by the Government of       Seychelles, but also highlights a threatened flycatcher population on       Mauritius as sufficiently distinct to warrant conservation (see       letter from Mauritius Wildlife Foundation, section 5, point D).
On Mauritius, conservation efforts for the Mauritius parakeet benefitted       from DNA work undertaken by Groombridge et al (2009-2012) on museum       specimens of other endangered and extinct parrots in the Indian Ocean by       revealing in an evolutionary context the conservation `value' of the       endemic parakeet.
Research using different molecular tools revealed how       the intensive conservation management of the Mauritius parakeets by the       Mauritius Wildlife Foundation has had a beneficial effect on genetic       diversity in this species.
The Executive Director of the Mauritius       Wildlife Foundation states that Groombridge's research has `made a         substantial difference to our outlook' (detailed in section 5, point       D).
This brought long-term benefits by slowing the gradual erosion of         genetic diversity and improving the evolutionary viability of the       species, a benefit acknowledged by the Mauritius conservation NGO.
Groombridge has also tackled problems of infectious disease in this       species.
Genetic work on a high-profile disease outbreak of Psittacine       Beak and Feather disease virus in this species served as a leading         case-study worldwide for other parrot conservation programmes to       follow where endangered populations have become infected with PBFD virus,       for example see Massaro, M., Ortiz-Catedral, L., Julian, L., Galbraith, J.
A., Kurenbach, B., Kearvell, J., &amp; Varsani, A.
(2012).
Molecular       characterisation of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) in New Zealand       and its implications for managing an infectious disease.
Archives of         Virology, 157(9), 1651-1663, Groombridge's work is       referenced in relation to New Zealand, and see section 5, point C.     Groombridge has galvanised amphibian conservation on Seychelles through       field and laboratory- based research on the rare Seychelles sooglossid       frogs, known to be one of the most ancient groups of frogs.
Genetic work       by Groombridge has identified a recently-discovered frog population on         Praslin island as evolutionarily distinct (section 5, point D).
This       clarified the need for surveys on additional Seychelles islands, for       example Dr Frauke Fleischer-Dogley, Chief Executive Office, Seychelles       Island Foundation states `this confirmation has provided much needed         clarity and enabled SIF to orientate its conservation activities to         focus on conserving this population' (see section 5, point E).
The       research also attracted additional conservation funds by local NGOs       (notably the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation and the Seychelles Islands       Foundation) and developed a 3-year PhD project (by Jim Labisko) on the       evolutionary conservation genetics and restoration of sooglossid frogs.
Impact on public awareness and understanding (see section 5, point E)       Groombridge has improved awareness and understanding of his field amongst       the public and the policy community through the showcasing of his projects       as examples of best practice in UK Government documents (DEFRA and       the annual report of the Darwin Initiative, section 5 point E) and in       books targeted at a wide practitioner audience.
A published book on       Reintroduction Biology illustrates the work by Groombridge and defines the       `gold standard' for genetic management of reintroductions for conservation       (700 copies sold, third highest seller for Wiley in this area).
Impact on policy (see section 5, points A, B, D, E)       Groombridge's work has led to increased investment by the UK to         improve training and capacity-building in conservation across the       Indian Ocean.
Darwin Initiative/DEFRA recently provided &#163;256,000 for       2012-2015 to support the work (to train 5 local biologists from       Seychelles, with interisland training involving Mauritius), and this       re-affirms the UK's commitment to conserving island biodiversity (see       section 3, `funding').
This funding will be used to unite local       conservation NGOs with UK-based expertise to develop the skills and       capacity of local biologists.
Groombridge's leadership of this project has       resulted in the additional award of a &#8364;400,000 (&#163;342,500) European Science       Foundation grant to establish a four-year research network (`ParrotNet':       COST Action ES- 1304) to coordinate European and international research       into the environmental, agricultural and societal issues surrounding       invasive parrots.
Therefore an important aspect of the impact of Jim       Groombridge's work is that he has persuaded a range of organisations to       extend and increase funding for conservation work for endangered species       in Seychelles and Mauritius.
