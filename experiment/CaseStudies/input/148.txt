     In the period 2001 to 2009, Chameleon Biosurfaces Ltd. received a       total of &#163;1.48M of venture capital and seedcorn funding from a number of       sources: the ICENI University Seedcorn Fund; Rainbow Venture Capital;       Aitua; London Seed Capital; Great Eastern Investment and Create Ventures.
The activities of Chameleon Biosurfaces Ltd. at UEA were funded by       &#163;1.13M of this venture capital, secured between 2005 - 2009.
Initial work focussed on showing that the electropolymers developed by       Pickett's group were well tolerated in vivo.
Subsequently there       was considerable industrial interest in the development of the       electropolymers as coatings for implantable medical devices &#8212; for which       there is a multi-billion $US global market &#8212; where the aim of the       technology is to address key limitations of current devices such as       foreign body reactions, stability and long-term electrical performance.
In 2009 and 2010, Chameleon Biosurfaces Ltd. completed contracts       with two international medical device companies [text removed for publication]       (2009) and [text removed for publication] (2009 and 2010) to study the       electropolymer coatings on stents and pacemaker implants respectively.
The       latter study resulted in IPR on the coating methodology for use in heart       stimulation applications.
[corroborating source A]     A second patent was filed in 2010 that detailed the preparation and       biophysical characterisation of low thrombogenicity electropolymer       materials that could be used in coronary stent applications.
[corroborating source B]     Following the successful conclusion of these contracts, in 2011 Biotectix         LLC, a leading developer of implantable medical devices based in Ann       Arbor Michigan, acquired all Chameleon Biosurfaces Ltd. issued and       pending US and international patents [corroborating sources A to C]       together with all technical and commercial data on the electropolymers for       an undisclosable sum.
Biotectix LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allied Minds,       is developing a new class of conducting polymer materials and coatings,       for implantable medical devices and sensors.
The goal is to improve the       safety, longevity, reliability, biological integration and function of       implantable biomedical devices for electro-stimulation and sensing       applications.
Following the acquisition, all Chameleon Biosurfaces         Ltd.'s materials technology transferred to Ann Arbor.
Biotectix         LLC continues to maintain the granted IPR and is actively pursuing       applications of the electropolymers in implantable medical devices for       cardiovascular, cochlear and neuro-modulation.
The General Manager at Biotectix LLC, James Arps, stated at the       time that:     "the Chameleon technology is highly complementary to the conductive       thiophene-based polymer materials we are actively commercializing.
Importantly, the acquisition further solidifies our leading IP position in       this field while giving us additional materials options with our       co-development partners in the medical device field."
[corroborating source D]     The continuing importance of this acquisition in increasing the       commercial opportunities available to Biotectix LLC is clear from       the statements by the Director of R&amp;D provided in 2012:     `Implantable medical devices for cardiovascular and neuromodulation       applications, together represent a multi-billion dollar global market.
Hence there is a significant commercial opportunity for value-added       technologies including BT's [Biotectix's] medical coatings that       address the needs for smaller, safer, multifunctional next generation       clinical medical devices.'
`The acquisition of Chameleon Biosurfaces assets further       solidifies BT's leading IP position in this field...'     [corroborating source E]     In 2011, following the acquisition of IPR from Chameleon Biosurfaces         Ltd., Biotectix LLC funded further electropolymer studies at       UEA which have already been of considerable benefit to Biotectix LLC       producing more than 5 new molecular species that continue to be evaluated       for further development by Biotectix LLC.
