     In 2011, Professor Boyle from the University of Glasgow was approached by       the Education and       Universities Manager of the Union of European Football Associations       (UEFA).
UEFA had identified       Boyle through his international sports research profile as a possible       candidate to develop a module       for the first-ever Diploma in Football Management (DFM) programme (to be       delivered March-May       2012).
Boyle was invited to a formal interview in Switzerland, and was       selected to help shape,       create and deliver the content for the Public Relations and Media       Operations module of the DFM       programme.
Building on his previous research, Boyle was asked to address       the gaps in strategic       thinking around public relations and use of social media identified by       UEFA in many of their       member national organisations.
Boyle led the content generation of the       module and worked with       the senior UEFA Media Officer to deliver the content via an online       e-learning programme and       seminars.
Improving access to professional development for organisations of all         sizes     The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), is one of 6       continental confederations of       world football's governing body, F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale de Football       Association.
UEFA       represents the 54 national football associations of Europe and runs       international football       competitions (such as the European Football Championships) and club       competitions (Champions       League and Europa League), and controls the prize money, regulations and       media rights for these       competitions.
The first DFM was launched in 2011-2012 and comprised 36       participants, middle and       senior managers working across 30 national football associations varying       in size from large       (English, German and Spanish leagues) through to medium-sized (Dutch,       Turkish and Ukrainian)       and smaller associations (Welsh, Icelandic and Latvian).
2012 graduates       included; the Head of the       Legal Department at the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU); Events       Manager at the German       Football Association (DFL); Head of Finance at the Football Association of       Wales; Club Licencing       Manager at the Football Association of Norway (NFF); Coordinator of       Strategy, Research and       Education at the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB); Coach Education       Manager at the       Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and four deputy-general secretaries       from the Bulgarian,       Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish football associations.
The National Co-ordinator of Coach Education of the Football Association       of Ireland said:     Having been a student on the UEFA Diploma in Football Management         Course, and         participated in Raymond Boyle's classes, I now have a more thorough,         detailed         understanding and strategic knowledge of PR, media relations and social         media within my         own National Association and beyond...
Furthermore, having experienced         the module, it has         now enabled my staff and I within the Coach Education Dept to become         more proactive         when dealing with the press, rather than having to be reactionary as we         were in the past.
Updating vocational skills and strategic knowledge     The Public Relations and Media Operations module created by Boyle       directly helped shape the       strategic thinking of DFM participants with regards to i) the role and       position of public relations in       their organisation and the need for organisational change to engage more       fully with stakeholders;       ii) the tactical use of social media as part of their communication       strategy and iii) the need to       develop and change their strategic thinking and evaluation of corporate       social responsibility       programmes.
At the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB), for       example, communication       strategies were well-developed, but managed by separate departments with       independent       strategies concerning website management, social media, media relations,       corporate       communication and communication with fans and sponsors.
Boyle's DFM module       highlighted the       need to fully integrate these separate policies and consequently, the       strength of the KNVB's       communication strategy has improved significantly.
The module PR and Media Operations helped the KNVB to strengthen         relationships with         important stakeholders.
Especially in maintaining strong communication         with professional         clubs in The Netherlands, the content of the course helped to take         concrete action on         improving the PR strategy.

Enhancing understanding of public and media relations     Boyle's significant research expertise shapes and informs the original       content he has created for       this core, mandatory Public Relations and Media Operations DFM module.
It       focuses on the key       role that social media is playing in re-shaping football associations'       communication strategies as       well as providing a framework for modernising the communication thinking       within football       associations around the world.
The Special Projects Assistant Manager for       the FA (English       Football Association), said;     This module has highlighted the importance of structures and         methodologies to set out an         organisation's media strategy.
[The] content on social media and         journalism is shaping our         strategic thinking as we embrace new technology as well as recognising         the importance of         `new journalists'...
It has highlighted for us the importance of these         new media formats and         the opportunities that they bring in respect of accessing our         stakeholders and fans and         means that we will better interact with our fans, creating tailored and         exclusive content that         facilitates two-way communication that can strengthen the FA brand.
Developing best practice across the European national football leagues     The DFM is a unique and innovative intervention by an organising sporting       association, seeking to       enhance and develop best practice across its culturally diverse 54 member       nations.
The       programme allows national association staff to continue to develop       professionally and to acquire       academic recognition for their work.
The knowledge developed, the       experience gained and wider       network of contacts acquired via participation in this programme enhances       best practice in public       relations and media operations within the specific national associations       represented.
In 2013, UEFA launched the development of a new programme, the       Certificate in Football       Management, for which Boyle has been invited to contribute a further       Communication, Media and       PR module.
The Certificate in Football Management will be delivered with       National Associations as       part of their national in-house training policy, and the Football       Association of Finland, German       Football Association, Croatian Football Association, the FA (English       Football Association) and the       Georgian Football Federation have all committed to delivering this       programme for up to 25 staff       members in 2014.
