     As a direct result of their research, members of CPC and CRA have engaged       with leading international, national and local policymakers throughout the       impact assessment period, with their research findings influencing policy       debate and informing policy design at all levels.
In summer of 2009, Evandrou and Falkingham's research (ref [3.1],       then available as a working paper) was selected by Elizabeth Sclater, an       advisor to the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission, for submission as       evidence to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against       Women (CEDAW) and "provided valuable reference material" [5.1]       towards the development of the General Recommendation No.
27 on Older       Women [5.2].
This research, showing that the individual's employment history affects       income in later life, and that lower retirement income was linked with       fewer years of employment history, was also cited by the Australian       Government's key research body in the area of family wellbeing, the       Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS), in their 2012 report on `Ageing         parent carers of people with a disability' (5.3), and was used to       argue the need for a carers pension for Australia's 490,000 carers       providing unpaid assistance to others with a severe or profound level of       disability.
In 2009, CPC was a partner in a successful bid to the European Commission       to establish a knowledge exchange platform to promote understanding of       demographic change in Europe [5.4].
Since then, members of CPC       have actively participated in a series of public engagement events       organised by Population Europe (a network of leading European       research centres supported by the European Commission) giving       presentations at meetings between influential decision-makers and eminent       scholars [5.5].
For example, in October 2010 Falkingham gave a       keynote address at a closed meeting for members of the European       Parliament, the Chair of the European Economic and Social Committee and       the Head of Social and Demographic Analysis for the Directorate-General       (DG) for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion.
This led in January       2011 to the `Population &amp; Policy Compact' Europe's Citizens should         have a Choice: Toward a New Policy of Life-Course Flexibility' [5.6]       co-authored by Falkingham and advocating the adoption of policies to       support more flexible work and better work-life balance.
This was       supplemented in September 2011 with the `Demographic Insights' paper Working         Life &amp; Retirement - a short briefing for the media based on an       interview with Jane Falkingham [5.6].
In May 2012, Falkingham gave       the opening address at a Population Europe Conference held at the       Presidential Palace, Warsaw, attended by the President and the Polish       Minister of Social Protection [5.5].
Funding for Population Europe       from the EC has since been renewed, with Jane Falkingham forming part of       the four person bid drafting team (along with French, Dutch and German       colleagues) for both grants.
The weight of the impact of CPC's ongoing research in informing policy       debate at the European level is corroborated by Ettore Marchetti, of the       DG for Employment:     'Jane's team has helped us highlight the importance of adapting social         policy to take account of recent demographic changes, particularly the         changing shape of the life course across cohorts as well as gender         inequalities.
This type of research is important in supporting the         European Commission, the Member States as well as their social partners         meet the challenge of an ageing population and promoting solidarity         between generations.'
[5.7]     In September 2012, Falkingham was invited to give a keynote address at       the Researcher Forum, UN Economic Commission for Europe Conference on       Ageing, Vienna.
A subsequent e-mail from Alexandre Sidorenko, former head       of UN Ageing programme and conference organiser, said:     `... the Centre for Research on Ageing has provided valuable insights         into the changing shape of the life course and the critical role played         by both the family and social policy in ensuring quality of life in old         age.
Prof Falkingham's recent keynote address ... highlighted the         importance of social policy adapting to a changing life course and the         necessity of designing social policy that delivers across the life         course.
Her recommendations were reflected in the subsequent Research         Forum's Statement presented during the Ministerial Conference.'
[5.8]     Since 2009, members of CPC have undertaken a range of public engagement       activities to influence policy thinking nationally.
In November 2012       research on changes in the living arrangements of young men and women,       highlighting the role that social policies play in influencing the ability       of young adults to maintain residential independence [3.4], was       presented to a policy audience of key stakeholders at grassroots, local       and national government levels at the Local Government Association [5.9].
The research was widely reported in the national media and on twitter, as       was the research on mid-life [5.10].
Subsequently Falkingham has       made CPC/CRA research insights on demographic changes accessible to the       public through regular media contributions including 'More or Less'       (broadcast on Radio 4 and the World Service) Radio 4's The World         Tonight and BBC and Channel 4 News.
The research has also       been quoted in The Guardian, The Independent, The         Daily Telegraph and BBC News websites [5.10].
By directly engaging with international, national and local policy       makers, practitioners, members of the UoA have ensured that CPC and CRA       research has achieved significant reach and has informed and shaped policy       discussion and debate at all levels.
