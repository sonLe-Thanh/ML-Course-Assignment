     Technology developed at Swansea University by Clement has yielded several       patents and the first FDA approvals for acne treatment, depilation, and       skin rejuvenation [R5], thus generating many economic benefits.
The       underpinning research has spawned spin-off companies from Swansea       University (Cyden, Chromgenex and Energist) that develop laser and IPL       products to treat acne, aging and sun-damaged skin, hirsutism and wounds.
These three organisations employ approximately 150 people and have       launched more than 20 light therapy products.
Laser treatment has become       essential for plastic surgeons, dermatologists and beauticians across the       globe to treat acne and damaged skin and remove hair.
Clement's role in       facilitating this is well recognised:     "Professor Clement's early pioneering work has had a real and tangible         impact on the development of these treatments and the range of skin         conditions which can now be treated".
Head of the Department of       Dermatology of Molholm Hospital, Denmark [C1]     "Professor Clement's contribution to light-based medicine has         facilitated the development of contemporary technologies and safer and         optimally effective treatments for patients.
As an innovator, he has         been instrumental not only in developing new technologies but also in         offering a scientific basis for optimising existing technologies".
Vice President of the American Board of Laser Surgery [C2]     According to Cyden sales of professional products have reached 1,700 in       over 60 markets worldwide, including the first laser system in the US for       acne therapy (FDA approval K024189 in 2003) and skin rejuvenation (FDA       approval K000811 in 2000).
Cyden and Chromgenex have exploited their       patents to develop commercial partnerships, in particular with Procter       &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) ["Gillette Venus Naked Skin"] and Boots       ("Smoothskin"), to launch hair-removal products for home use.
This shift       from the professional to the consumer market required data on efficacy and       strong safety protocols to ensure effective and safe use by the general       public (FDA approvals K122280 in 2012 &amp; K130315 in 2013).
Sales of       consumer hair removal devices now exceed 125,000 in total across the UK       and Europe.
The contribution of the research at Swansea University to the       growing global market has been acknowledged by the Head of Marketing and       Business Development for Cyden Ltd [C3]:     "According to the Kline Report and data via Mintel, the global market         for light therapy for hair removal, skin rejuvenation, acne, etc will be         worth US$3 billion by 2018.
By developing our home-use devices, which         use the intellectual property from the research at Swansea University,         we aim to win a significant share of this market.
We have achieved this         penetration by establishing partnerships with global brands like         P&amp;G".
In 2011 manufacturing costs in China increased so much that it became       uneconomical to produce there.
This led Cyden to develop a strategy to       repatriate manufacturing of their products from China to the UK.
P&amp;G,       the primary partner and customer, were satisfied following a full options       appraisal that the UK was competitive enough to return manufacturing to       Europe.
P&amp;G's decision took account of the success that Cyden had       achieved with Boots in the UK market, its research collaboration with       Swansea University, and the strength of the underlying intellectual       property (IP).
Representatives from P&amp;G visited Swansea University       frequently and cited the quality of the research as a key differentiator.
Production of the IPL device for P&amp;G under the brand name of Braun (a       wholly owned subsidiary of P&amp;G) began in 2012 at the Sony UK       Technology Centre at Pencoed in South Wales.
While the partnership with       Sony is not a joint venture, it is a critical manufacturing partnership       which uses Sony's manufacturing quality, logistics expertise and supply       chain management.
Indeed, the Sony UK Technology Centre at Pencoed has       used the experience from this partnership to repatriate other       manufacturing contracts from the Far East, thereby protecting current jobs       and creating further employment in South Wales.
The General Manager at       Sony UK Technology Centre [C4] confirmed this by stating:     "This experience with Cyden Ltd and the College of Medicine changed         the way we do business.
This can be traced back to Professor Clement's         landmark paper in the Lancet.
This has influenced Sony Corporate's         thinking globally.
Recently our Chairman, Sir Howard Stringer, said         while visiting Sony Pencoed that this open innovation approach was an         exemplar of global best practice".
As well as the 150 employees at Cyden, Chromogenex and Energyst, the       partnership with Sony has created jobs for web designers, product and       packaging designers, and applied researchers.
Hence the Head of Healthcare       Innovation for the Welsh Government [C5] summarises this as:     "A prototype for future advanced manufacturing opportunities, and an         exemplar for the resurgence of UK specialist manufacturing"     In economic terms, the research by Clement and collaborators has created       more than 1,000 person-years of employment around Swansea, and the city is       now one of four global centres of excellence in light therapy alongside       Boston and San Francisco in the US and Tel Aviv in Israel.
Rigorous       scientific research and evaluation has led to widespread adoption of the       innovation.
Our 1st clinical commentator is confident that Clement's       research has increased "the range of skin conditions which can now be         treated" [C1]; and our 2nd clinical commentator that it has "facilitated         safer and optimally effective treatments for patients" [C2].
Both       are international authorities: Clement's research has yielded long-term       health benefits for thousands of sufferers from distressing skin       conditions.
