     Research at Bristol has contributed to a number of exhibitions, raising       the visibility of British art, drawing attention to its international       contexts, changing perceptions of individual artists, generating footfall       and economic benefit for the host museums and improving understanding of       collections.
The process of curating has expanded the underlying research       and led to further scholarship and exhibitions, building a symbiotic       relationship between university and museum.
The following takes a       selection of these exhibitions as examples of the impact that BARC has       achieved.
Prettejohn's work on Victorian art has been key to the development       of exhibitions such as: The Pre-Raphaelites       (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, 2009); Edward Burne-Jones: The Earthly         Paradise (Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 2009-10); The Pre-Raphaelites         and Italy (Ravenna Museum of Art; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 2010); J.         W. Waterhouse: The Modern Pre-Raphaelite (Groninger Museum; Royal       Academy of Arts, London; Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, 2008-10); The         Cult of Beauty: The Aesthetic Movement 1860-1900 (Victoria and       Albert Museum, London; Mus&#233;e d'Orsay, Paris; Fine Arts Museums of San       Francisco, 2011-12); and Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde       (Tate Britain, London; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Pushkin       Museum, Moscow; the Mori Art Center, Tokyo, 2012-14).
These exhibitions       give evidence of the international growth of interest in Victorian art to       which Prettejohn's work has been central.
They depend heavily on her       scholarship, particularly her publications on the Pre-Raphaelites which       culminated most recently in her edited collection [1].
In several cases,       she contributed essays to the exhibition catalogues [2], extending her       research and disseminating it to a wider public readership.
She was       appointed co-curator of J.W.
Waterhouse, and sat on the advisory       committees for the V&amp;A and Tate exhibitions.
Victorian Avant-Garde       was the second-most popular exhibition ever staged at Tate Britain, with       some 243,000 people attending [b].
Sales of tickets and related       merchandise (e.g.
32,000 catalogues) delivered considerable economic       benefit for the gallery.
The lead curator has highlighted the importance       of Prettejohn's argument that Victorian art should be reassessed in its       international contexts, stating that: `Prettejohn's essay on the       Pre-Raphaelite legacy was praised both in the critical press and on the       Tate blog with visitors praising her ability to communicate complex       academic issues to a broad audience.
The exhibition has been perceived as       marking a paradigm shift in scholarship of nineteenth-century British art,       especially with regard to the international impact of Pre-Raphaelites, the       focus of Prettejohn's essay' [b].
The Telegraph (10 September       2010) singled out Prettejohn's essay as `provocative and surprising',       commenting that the exhibition would `get people thinking'.
Brockington's research on art and pacifism in the First World War       [3], and on the cosmopolitan culture which contributed to the peace       movement [4], was instrumental to the exhibition Beyond Bloomsbury.
As a result of her insights, the Omega's pacifist politics became a major       theme of the exhibition and its education programme.
She advised on the       planning of the exhibition and contributed a catalogue essay on the Omega       Workshops in wartime, which the lead curator described as `a cornerstone       of the exhibition in the way it was presented to the public' [c].
Some       exhibits were included as a direct result of her advice, the curator       stating that their interpretation `was based largely on the research       provided by Dr Brockington' [c].
The teachers' resource pack for schools       highlighted the context of the peace movement and included Brockington's       published work in its sources for further reading [d].
The exhibition as a       whole was well attended (close to 44,000 visitors [c]), pulling its weight       in a record year for the Courtauld Gallery (179,000 visitors across four       exhibitions [e]), and generating income through ticket sales and related       merchandise (profits from the shop totalled &#163;94,660 [c]).
The show was       widely reviewed.
The Burlington Magazine (vol.
151, September 2009,       pp.634-5) stated that `this timely and well-displayed exhibition will go       some way to establishing the Omega's proper place within the wider       international field of experimental early modernist art and design', while       Studio International (22 July 2009) observed that `this is a key       exhibition, a revision that examines an important episode in British art'.
It singled out Brockington's essay for comment, and noted that `the       catalogue is excellent - a major contribution to the scholarship of the       period'.
Rowe's argument that the work of contemporary artists from       marginal groups belongs equally to the mainstream of art-historical       tradition [5] led to a commission to write catalogue essays for the       exhibition Changing Places (2008-9).
The project brought recent       feminist art to new audiences by integrating it with more traditional       collections in popular venues.
As the Lincolnshire Echo (14       February 2008) noted, it `reaches parts other exhibitions don't [...] the       show provides a new take on both the historic and contemporary works'.
The       curators' `Final Activity Report' cites indicators that the exhibitions       attracted new audiences [f].
The project was incorporated into Lesbian Gay       Bisexual Trans (LGBT) History Month in Lincoln (February 2008).
It was the       setting for an LGBT cabaret event hosted by The Collection, at which 42%       of the 180-plus visitors were attending the museum for the first time [g].
The exhibition also had an impact on the presentation of permanent       collections: `re-hanging parts of the collection was sometimes so       successful that the galleries wanted to keep the new changes' [f].
The       collaboration between Rowe, Sayers and Lundgreen was developed further in       the exhibition Myth &amp; History (2009) at The Bristol Gallery,       curated by Rowe and including the artist Lubaina Himid, about whom Rowe       has also written [5].
Research-based postgraduate teaching in British art has led to       several public exhibitions.
For example, String's work on Tudor       portraiture [6] led to collaborative MA projects with NPG, notably the       exhibition Imagined Lives.
Student research, supervised by String       and guided by her published work on the conventions of Tudor portraiture,       led to discoveries that informed the exhibition catalogue and wall texts.
Eight celebrated authors (including John Banville, Tracy Chevalier and       Joanna Trollope) supplied fictional lives to accompany the portraits,       leading the Guardian (17 March 2010) to comment that `new life is       being breathed into [the] collection'.
Their stories have been published       on the NPG website (http://www.npg.org.uk/business/publications/)       and as a book.
The authors have also given talks at the gallery and       online, such as Chevalier speaking about her story on the website Technology,         Entertainment, Design: Ideas Worth Spreading (http://www.ted.com/talks/).
The exhibition proved successful enough to transfer from the National       Trust's Montacute House (2010-11) to the NPG itself (2011-12).
The NPG       press release notes that research undertaken at Bristol `led to a clearer       understanding of the past of these portraits [...] more evidence is now       available about the possible identity of the sitters' [h], while the National         Trust Bulletin welcomed the exhibition as `a chance to undertake       conservation work on these pictures, improving their condition and       appearance after many years in storage' [i].
When the show transferred to       M Shed in Bristol (2012-13), a new layer was added with the introduction       of contemporary photographic portraits of famous Bristolians.
M Shed       contacted the university for further input, and Dr Peter Dent gave a       public gallery lecture (28 November 2012).
Dent was appointed as a       Renaissance specialist following String's departure and is continuing the       teaching collaboration with NPG.
Public feedback on his talk stated, for       example, that `I really felt I understood the art/artists better for       hearing the talk [...] I'll definitely be back to see the exhibition       again' [j].
The exhibition has incorporated extensive opportunities for       visitor interaction.
For example, visitors were invited to respond by       writing their own fictional lives, some of which have appeared on blogs,       such as http://sarah-crawl-space.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/real-and-imagined-lives-at-mshed.html.
One visitor tweeted that `it's a great exhibition and my grandson spent an       hour typing his short story' (https://twitter.com/mshedbristol/status/271927057913626626).
