     Credit is an important, driving mechanism in the economy.
Not giving it       when we should has impact on the individual and impact on wider society.
The advances in the three evaluation areas described in section 2 benefit       consumers and the economy by helping to ensure that consumers are not       denied credit when they do indeed qualify and, conversely, preventing       people from obtaining credit when they shouldn't qualify.
Since the challenges motivating our research in this area arise from the       industry itself, dissemination of our work and results across the industry       is an integral part of our activity.
We achieve this dissemination in a       number of ways, such as formal consultancy projects, industry-funded PhD       studentships (sometimes part time, with company employees), postdocs,       invited presentations to corporations, and through industry conferences       (where we are regularly invited to give keynote presentations).
Examples       of bodies which have funded our work include GMAC, (evaluating       scorecards), HBOS (pattern discovery in retail banking data), British       Credit Trust (developing new scorecards), Fair Isaac (evaluating       scorecards), Capital One (evaluating scorecards), Goldman Sachs (fraud       detection), and many others.
We have worked with most of the major       industry players, and many minor ones.
Turning to each of the three areas of research described in Section 2 we       now describe the impact:     (i) The H-measure: These matters were first presented (by Hand)       to the industry at the Henry Stewart Conference on Predictive         Analytics (an important conference for industry users of marketing       analytics) in December 2008.
Since then Hand has been presented this work       in many commercial and industrial contexts (as well as more academic       meetings), for example, Credit Scoring and Control XI (August       2009, the premier conference on retail finance, with 90% industrial       participants), IMA Conference on Mathematics and its Applications       (March 2011), an invited seminar to Opera Solutions (November       2011, a leading data analytics company), a two-hour keynote presentation       at the Capital One Allstat and Quants conference (October 2013),       and many many others.
The H-measure is being increasingly adopted in the       retail credit industry, as a performance measure which overcomes the       incoherence problem of the current industry standard Gini and KS measures.
The CEO of a leading US credit modelling company, Prescient Models,       writes: "Over the last decade I have found the research papers from the         team at Imperial College to be very valuable.
For the topics of adverse         selection, reject inference, the proper use of statistics like KS and         Gini, and survival models, I have read several excellent papers         that have assisted in my product development and general understanding"       [A].
He also notes that paper [2] "has alerted practitioners to how         they can make more useful models instead of simply chasing improvements         in arbitrary measures" [B].
(ii) A KS comparative test: This new test [4] was first       described, by Hand, to the industry at the Credit Scoring and Control         XII meeting (August, 2011).
Of this work, the Director of the Credit       Risk Analysis Division of a US banking regulator, the US Office of the       Comptroller of Currency, commented in 2012: "The statistical test you         outlined in your paper is exactly what is needed to add statistical         rigor to the decision process.
It is a test we will recommend banks         adopt as part of their model selection and validation process" [C].
In 2013, the CEO of the US credit modelling company, Prescient Models,       noted that the work in [4] provided "further weight and clarity" to       the issue, allowing "models to be judged realistically" [B].
In       praising the robust K S comparative test in [4], he commented that "[s]ubstituting         one model for another in pursuit of spurious accuracy can be a         multi-million dollar waste of money and distraction" [B].
(iii) The illusion of progress: The illusion of progress work is       fundamental, with wide applications, and can be considered a cautionary       tale for the industry, warning it against inflated claims of enhanced       performance for complicated classifiers.
The Director of the Credit Risk       Analysis Division of a US banking regulator, the US Office of the       Comptroller of Currency, wrote about the work described in [5]: "I         would also like to note the contribution your paper [5] has had on our         discussions internally and with modelers at the larger institutions we         supervise ...
Your insight on this issue has helped us solidify our         thoughts on this issue and develop methods of assessing the process         banks use to develop and implement their new models.
We have used your         paper as a "discussion paper" for an internal workshop on modeling         methods after the crash, and as a recommended research paper for         modelers at large and mid-size banks..." [C].
Similarly, "This         article has had a direct impact on the creation of models in retail         lending with some of its terminology quickly becoming part of standard         conversation within the industry.
It has provided the needed support for         analysts to avoid wasting time on spurious improvements, thereby saving         moving and allowing analysts to investigation deeper issues" [B].
Further impact     In addition to the specific impact that has arisen from our research on       the H-measure, KS comparative test and illusion of progress, the more       general impact made by the statistics group is demonstrated by the       following statements from people we have worked with in the financial       industry, and the major industry award citation given below:            One of the leaders of the industry, a former CEO of Experian (Experian         is a FTSE100 company, and a leading international provider of credit         information) writes "You and your team's research has helped           enormously in the development of credit scoring and the credit           industry" [D].
This general point is also made by an employee of one of world's         largest credit scoring organisations, Fair Isaac, who says "it is           more valuable than ever to hear your voice which cuts straight through           to the scientific underpinnings of predictive modelling and           classification, while at the same time being concerned with the           important issues of practicality and usefulness of the resulting           models" and "We continue to look very much forward to your           highly relevant contributions in the field of credit scoring and           statistics" [E].
Finally, in 2012, the Consumer Credit Research Group at Imperial was         awarded the Credit Collections and Risk (CCR) industry award for         Contributions to the Industry.
This is the first time this, or       indeed any of the CCR awards, has been made to an academic unit.
The award       was presented by Gary Brooks, Group Credit Manager at Hitachi Europe, and       the citation read: "... our winners have contributed significantly to         improving decision-making strategies for the retail credit industry.
They have worked with regulators, the banking and finance sectors and         scoring and ratings agencies worldwide in a wide range of areas to         improve scoring" [F].
Prof Hand has also been asked to join the       Editorial Advisory Board of Credit Collections and Risk, the       leading industry magazine in the area.
