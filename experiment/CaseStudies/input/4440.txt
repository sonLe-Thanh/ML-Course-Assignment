     Regional and national policies to promote economic growth make extensive       reference to entrepreneurship and new enterprise growth.
The need to       support innovation and encourage it as a vital source of change and       renewal is being recognised worldwide.
But effective policy must be       founded on strong theoretical and empirical evidence.
Professor Gordon       Murray's research and published work has helped shape innovation and new       enterprise policy in several countries, and through the delivery of this       research in extensive engagement as an expert advisor his research has       assisted in the formation of governmental policy.
In the UK, he was a founding member of the government's Access to Finance       Expert Group, originally formed in 1997.
Since 1995, he has advised the       Small Business Service, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills       (BIS), the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reforms, the       Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills, HM Treasury and HM       Revenue and Customs on issues related to entrepreneurial policy       formulation and assessment.
In 2009 the National Audit Office asked him to       assist on its evaluation of the UK's "hybrid" venture capital programmes       in which he is extensively cited (5).
From 2003, Murray was a member of the European Commission's Enterprise       Policy Group, which was established to discuss, and assist the EC in the       development of, future innovation and enterprise policy proposals.
As the       only academic in the 60-strong group he acted as a link between the EC's       policy processes and contemporary international academic research       findings.
In addition, he has advised and evaluated "seed capital" grant       programmes and helped shape European policy via membership of two Expert       Groups on Venture Capital and High-Growth Young Firms.
As noted by the EC       Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry `His research-based           contributions to the debates have influenced European policies on           small businesses and their financing, and have had a strong influence           on the considerable expansion of venture capital funding in the EU           programmes for 2014-2020.'(1).
In 2008 New Zealand's Ministry of Economics and Development invited       Murray to give a series of policy presentations and lectures on his       entrepreneurial finance research.
This series contributed to a review of       the government's approach to funding hybrid VC programmes.
The following       year, as a result of his research exploring the nature of VC economic       rational, Australia's Commonwealth Government Department of Industry,       Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education invited Murray to       carry out a formal evaluation of its Innovation Investment Fund (IIF),       which Murray had formally proposed some 14 years earlier to the       Commonwealth's R&amp;D Board.
His findings, reported in 2010(6),       encouraged a change in the IIF programme's structure; the development of a       longer term view and a greater focus on attracting professional investors.
The subsequent joint review by the Treasury and Department drew on his       findings and recommended the Australian Government continue to a third       round of venture capital investment(7), `Professor Murray           worked with the Australian Government ....... to review all Australian           venture capital programs, and to identify global best practices and           how these could be integrated into the Australian programs.
The           ultimate outcome of this work was a new and significant financial           commitment from the Government to innovation and venture capital in           Australia' (2).
In 2009 Murray was a member of the Rowlands Committee on Growth Capital       for SMEs, a review commissioned by HM Treasury and BIS, which looked at       small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing in light of the       difficulties experienced in sector.
The resulting Growth Capital Review       Report was influential in encouraging the government's subsequent support       of the market for SME finance (8).
In the same year he also       co-authored the NESTA "Thin Markets Report' (9) which analysed the       impact of UK government-backed VC investment.
The report determined that       despite positive effects, government-backed schemes are restricted by       their structure and size, and called for better infrastructure to support       `more innovative, world-leading, high-growth companies.'
In recognition of       the understanding of constraints identified in Prof Murray's research, he       has participated in the Access to Finance Expert Group, BIS.
The group has       helped inform the discussions and development of the `Enterprise Bank', an       initiative that has been launched recently, under sponsorship of the       Secretary of State, Vince Cable, to provide access to resources for SMEs       in the UK to facilitate the growth.
Prof Murray continues to attend expert       meetings on the development of this initiative with BIS.
Murray was one of six internationally recognised academics asked to lead       the Finnish government's Evaluation of the National Innovation Strategy,       which reported in October 2009 (10).
The largest study in more than       a decade, the review reported directly to the country's Cabinet and       Research and Innovation Council, with Murray's findings presented       personally to the Ministers of Economics and Education.
As noted by the       leading consultant for the Ministry of Employment and the Economy `Growth       Enterprise Review', `Prof. Murray proposed a radical overhaul of           Finland's public apparatus supporting high-potential young companies.
Among his proposals were the creation of a world-class elite           enterprise grouping at Aalto University, the economic encouragement of           foreign entrepreneurs to Finland, and changes to enterprise tax           incentives.
While his suggestions were initially considered too           radical, they have over time been introduced into the Finnish policy           arena.
Aalto University's commitment to science based enterprise and           its very active student and faculty links to other world-class           institutions actively encouraged by government directly illustrate           Prof. Murray's initially contentious proposals......By 2013 Prof.           Murray's lasting legacy in Finland is obvious and several major           institutional changes have taken place along the line he and the           evaluation team at large proposed.'

In 2008 and 2009 Murray was requested to advise the Finnish government on       personal taxation policy's effects on entrepreneurial activity.
His       contributions helped bring about a renewed focus on entrepreneurship as a       key element of Finland's present innovation plan, which was manifested in       a number of ways; firstly, a change in tax policy to give greater rewards       to risk-taking entrepreneurs, as highlighted by the Industry Councillor       for VC in the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry: `[Murray           advised that] the Government should give a strong positive sign to the           market by giving tax incentive for business angels investing in           start-ups.
Last year the government finally made this decision'(4).
The second major recommendation noted that government financial support       should be focussed on a smaller number of initiatives allow for a greater       level of investment; `as a result, the government financing for a           start-up today can go as high as EUR 2 million, half of it in a form           of equity and the other half in a form of grant.
The CEO of the           Finnish firm Supercell, Mr. Paananen, said in an interview [October           2013], after closing an exit of USD 1 billion for his company,           non-existent 2 years ago, that his firm would not probably exist           without the government start-up financing.'

Beyond the policymaking community, Murray has been a regular media       contributor on enterprise issues.
He has been interviewed by Radio 4's       Today Programme, the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, Australia's       Financial Review and Finland's national TV news.
In 2012, as a result of       pioneering international links between academic research, industry and       evidence-based government policy in the related fields of early-stage       enterprise and innovation over a period of over twenty years, Prof. Murray       was awarded an OBE for "services to business" in The Queen's Jubilee year       Birthday Honours list.
