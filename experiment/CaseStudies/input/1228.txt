     The research responds to challenges raised by unprecedented demographic       changes caused by       an ageing population and by longevity.
In collaboration with AgeUK, the       research has led to the       development of knowledge on inclusive design and the marketing of socially       inclusive products and       services for older consumers.
It is predicted that those aged 65 and over       will account for 23 per       cent of the total population by 2035 (ONS1) so it is essential that         the needs of this group (e.g.
mobility, communications, assisted living) are addressed by bespoke         products and services.
Further, this group owns 80% of the UK's wealth and has the highest         disposable income (ONS,         2011).
The benefits of this timely research therefore extend to a large         and growing segment of the         population whose needs have hitherto been neglected, as well as to Age         UK (the largest charity for         older people) and the companies that are key players in servicing this         market.
The research has had significant welfare and commercial       impacts, including benefits relating to       greater social inclusion.
(1) Welfare &amp; inclusion     (i) Welfare: The research has led to health and welfare impact by       improving the lives of ageing         consumers in the UK.
This has been achieved by the development and       commercialisation of       technology products e.g.
assistive living products by Handicare (the       largest provider of stairlifts in       the UK) and British Telecom.
Such products are tailored to meet the needs         and lifestyle of older       people and have been designed with a user-centred approach that       incorporates, through the       segmentation methodology developed by the research, aspirations,       appearance and `fit' with older       people's self-perceptions &#8212; enhancing both effectiveness and appeal.
Benefits include greater       mobility and independent living; assisted communication, improved product       quality and greater       product and service choice that better fits different lifestyles and       needs.
(ii) Inclusion: The research has contributed to the landscape of products       and services that satisfy       the increasingly sophisticated aspirations of older consumers, helping to       challenge the myth that       older consumers are passive and simplistic in their needs.
This has       enhanced cultural       understanding of issues relating to older people, shaping or informing       public attitudes and values.
(2) Commercial Impacts     The insights generated by the research have fed into AGE UK with       the following commercial       impacts:     (i) Age UK's business network, Engage, has seen a 500% increase in       membership from 7       companies in 2010 to approximately 40 in 2012.
The Engage member       companies, interested in the       ageing market or major players in such market, have improved the       application of inclusive design       processes to their product development and marketing processes through the       principles       underpinning the accreditation schemes and the training opportunities       organised by Dr Spinelli and       AGE UK.
This training (e.g.
through seminars; workshops) has created a       knowledge base as       evidenced by the following feedback:     "I now understand that usability testing is essential" (Head of         Marketing, Pearson; member         of Engage)     "(I valued) the whole process [of the seminar]; talking to real users       through to designing       with (ageing consumers) in mind" (Partnership Director, E-ON, member         of Engage)     (ii) The research has created a knowledge base that Age UK has exploited       to underpin and frame       the principles of the AGE UK Products and Service Accreditation schemes       launched in March       2012.
This enhances brand product and service inclusivity as well as       quality and consumer choice.
(iii) Informed by the research, Age UK has established a consultancy       service to companies which       has increased and differentiated its revenue stream.
Consultancy services       in 2010-2012 have       totalled &#163;100,000 compared to nil in previous years.
The research outputs have been disseminated by Age UK in two reports, one       published in       February 2013 and the second in press, and through public seminars and       conferences.
