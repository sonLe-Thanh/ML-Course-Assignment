       Research by Gilchrist (2009) has been used to         identify changeable beliefs within the IPV population.
This led to the         development of a new approach to pre and post-group assessment for the         Caledonian System community programme for IPV (Caledonian System         Manuals, 2010) directly changing social work practice in Scotland.
This         research has also been presented as guidance for the Risk Management         Authority, informing all guidance in IPV assessment in Scotland(January         2011)1      Gilchrist and Dalton's research led to a grant of         &#163;150,000 from the Scottish Government for the team at GCU to implement         and evaluate a randomised control trial of a parenting intervention for         men convicted of IPV related offences (the Alba Project, (2012 -         ongoing) ).
GCU lead the project and have linked Criminal Justice Social         Work, women's advocacy services (ASSIST), Police Scotland and Glasgow         East Women's Aid.
Staff from across professions has been trained in         Triple P, which is currently being delivered by CJSW and ASSIST.
This         GCU research into criminogenic need and interventions for IPV offenders         has directly led to a change in practice in criminal justice across         Strathclyde.
Research by Weldon &amp; Gilchrist (2012) has changed         the response to IPV offenders in Scottish Prisons.
The recent review by         Miller, 2012,2 commissioned         by the SPS Steering group on Domestic Violence focussed on the         prevalence of the implicit theories identified by Gilchrist (2009) and         Weldon &amp; Gilchrist (2012) in this population.
This review has         changed the recording of IPV offences within SPS and is currently         informing planning of intervention and assessment to address IPV           within Scottish prisons.
Based on this theoretical, empirical and practice       knowledge, Professor Gilchrist was invited to New Zealand as a consultant       for Corrections New Zealand to inform: the content of prison programmes       for IPV; how to link services to address IPV across social work,       probation, victim support and advocacy services; and assessment of       offenders and victims in prison and in the community to ensure appropriate       targeting of programmes, and effective management of victim safety.
The       content of prison programmes and the structure of community services are       based on GCU research on implicit thinking and effective interventions for       IPV.
This research has changed IPV practice in New Zealand (letter from       Corrections New Zealand 2013 in support).
The Scottish Judicial Studies committee developed a CPD training DVD of       courtroom scenes involving IPV offenders with input from experts to train       judges in IPV (Jan - May 2011)3.
Professor Gilchrist linked research from GCU which identified thinking       styles and victim experiences associated with IPV offending to key       decision stages in the court process to inform judges.
Additionally       Gilchrist has regularly provided face-to-face input at the linked training       events reinforcing research evidence in relation to risk, and how this       might be translated into legal practice (JSC CPD on domestic abuse; Oct       2011, Nov 2011, Oct 2012, Nov 2012).
This work has shaped judicial       decision making in court, with judges commenting that they now regularly       use special bail conditions to manage risk even in cases where there are       no previous convictions, based on the knowledge they have of risk drawn       from the DVD and specific training.
Research focussed on the role of sexual abuse within IPV offences (Morgan       &amp; Gilchrist, 2010) has led to GCU being commissioned by the Risk       Management Authority to identify a process of risk assessment for the       Police in Scotland for the management of MAPPA1 sexual offenders (Scan for       Risk; May 2012).The GCU team led a seminar for senior public protection       police officers in November 2012, and delivered training on defensible       decision making to senior police officers at Tulliallan Police Training       College in October 2012.The research at GCU has had a direct impact on the       police approach to risk assessment via training of senior staff and has       led to wider practice development changes with roll out of new processes       across a number of areas in the new Police Scotland expected in 2013.
The GCU research into specific factors underpinning IPV (Morgan &amp;       Gilchrist, 2010) was presented at an event at the Scottish Parliament,       which secured the attendance of 8 MSPs, including the Minster for Justice       (The Psychologist, 2012).
GCU is now involved in advising the Division of       Occupational Psychology and the Division of Neuropsychology as to how to       engage with government, having implemented a change in practice in       academic/policy engagement in Scotland.
