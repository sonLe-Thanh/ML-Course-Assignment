     The Ghana trials have substantially influenced global policy on VAS as       well as having a major influence on the development and content of the       national vitamin A programme in Ghana.
In 2011 WHO published four revised VAS guidelines relating to VAS in:       infants and children 6-59 months of age;5.1 infants 1-5 months       of age;5.3 postpartum women;5.5 and pregnant women.5.7       These were based on updated Cochrane reviews5.2, 5.4, 5.6.
5.8       commissioned by WHO and, in some cases, additional analyses carried out by       WHO.
They replaced the previous recommendations published by WHO, UNICEF       and IVACG Task Force in 1997.
Evidence from the trials in Ghana made       substantial contributions to all the new guidelines:            The Ghana VAST trials constituted 28.9% of the total evidence         concerning the impact of VAS on all-cause mortality in children aged         6-59 months and the continued recommendation that this is a key child         survival intervention.5.1, 5.2        The latest Countdown to 2015 (maternal, newborn and child survival)         report5.9 estimated a median coverage of 80% for children         aged 6-59 months receiving VAS in low- and middle-income countries; the         2013 Lancet nutrition review series highlights the importance of         continuing to improve this coverage, estimating that this could prevent         an additional 145,000 deaths each year at a cost of $159 per life saved.
This estimate was derived using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) which models         the number of child deaths that could be saved with different         interventions.
The cause-specific findings from the Ghana VAST trials         make a major contribution to the evidence base on effect sizes for VAS         used in LiST.
The EPI-Plus trial provided 11.3% of the mortality evidence behind the         recommendation not to recommend VAS in infants 1-5 months of age.5.3,           5.4 This is a reversal of the previous policy recommending         supplementation in this age group and which was not evidence based.
Both the EPI-Plus trial and the ObaapaVitA trial contributed evidence         behind the recommendation not to recommend VAS in postpartum women.5.5,           5.6 This is also a reversal of previous policy which recommended         postpartum supplementation.
The ObaapaVitA trial contributed 61.9% of the evidence concerning no         overall impact of VAS to pregnant women on maternal mortality and 61.9%         of the evidence concerning no overall impact on neonatal mortality.5.7,           5.8 Supplementation of pregnant women is not recommended.
The VAS trial findings have also had a major influence within Ghana.
The       establishment of the National Vitamin A Programme was in direct response       to the Ghana VAST trials, and the content of the programme has been       influenced and informed by the subsequent trials in Ghana.
The 2012       Countdown report5.9 gives 93% coverage of two doses per year of       VAS to children aged 6-59 months.
The national vitamin A programme no       longer supports VAS given with vaccines in the first six months of life or       supplementation of postpartum women, saving the programme considerable       money and opportunity costs each year, and, following the ObaapaVitA       trial, VAS for women of reproductive age will not be introduced.
The       definitive no impact findings of the ObaapaVitA trial emphasize that good       research can make important contributions by showing that something       doesn't work; Esi Amoaful, the National Vitamin A Programme Manager, Ghana       Health Service5.10 commented: `Research does not just tell us       what new things to do, it also tells us what not to do.
The remarkable       finding has made the case that had the Ghana Health Sector implemented       this policy all over the country to women without the requisite       information about its benefits, we might have spent millions of dollars       each year to no avail."
Finally, the vitamin A trials in Ghana have made a major contribution to       research capacity, building the initial infrastructures for the Navrongo       and Kintampo Health Research Centres which are making substantial research       contributions to global health.
For example, the Kintampo Health Research       Centre has a widespread malaria programme and was one of the seven African       sites carrying out trials to assess the GlaxoSmithKline RTS,S malaria       vaccine which has just been reported to almost halve the number of malaria       cases in young children.
The vitamin A trials have also trained staff who       have gone on to senior research and policy positions in Ghana including       two current university Vice-chancellors and Directors of two health       research centres.
