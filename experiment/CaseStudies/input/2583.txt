     A key requirement of the Gaelic Language Act is the obligation on public       bodies to produce Gaelic language plans, when requested by B&#242;rd na       G&#224;idhlig.
McLeod's report on these plans for the B&#242;rd, underpinned by       research outputs such as 3.6, has informed the process of plan design and       approval, establishing a framework to help the B&#242;rd analyse the structure       and implementation of other bodies' plans.
The three reports dealing with early years education and childcare,       attainment and choice in primary and secondary education and adult Gaelic       learning opportunities profoundly influenced the formation and       implementation of the National Plans for Gaelic for 2007-12 and 2012-17       (5.4).
Iain Caimbeul, then Deputy Chair of B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig, wrote "to       confirm the importance that B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig places on the educational       research that has recently been completed by yourselves [O'Hanlon, McLeod       and Paterson]" and to "confirm that your educational research outputs have       impacted on policy discussion and development at the B&#242;rd" (5.5).
In the wake of the early years report (http://tinyurl.com/oe48nl6)       initiatives to restructure Gaelic early years provision have been put in       place (5.2).
The B&#242;rd is now implementing a new framework for provision,       with a more direct role for the B&#242;rd itself in place of other agencies,       and it organised three workshops in March 2011 to provide training in line       with the report's recommendations.
The school inspectorate's recent       strategy document on Gaelic education noted the value of the 2010 report       in "map[ping] the way ahead in pre-school provision" (5.8).
In 2010 alone,       the report affected 127 pre-school settings (851 pupils).
To date the       total number of schoolchildren who have benefitted from the       recommendations we made in our report is ca.
1,500.
Following the publication of the adult education report (http://tinyurl.com/oxdjzga)       the B&#242;rd gave a significant injection of funding to the course provider,       Deiseal Ltd., to improve the offer of Gaelic classes to adults across       Scotland.
The B&#242;rd's media release concerning this injection of funding       referred specifically to the recommendations in this report (5.3).
The       findings of the report have directly influenced Glasgow City Council's       Gaelic Language Development strategy for adult learners (5.9).
The report on choice and attainment (http://tinyurl.com/pakma3a)       has had a significant impact on official efforts to promote the uptake of       Gaelic-medium education.
Cabinet Secretary for Education Michael Russell       "hoped [that] the report would encourage more families to opt for Gaelic       education" and that "this report should give parents reassurance that       choosing this path for their children will only benefit their educational       journey" (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11774353).
The importance of the report has been noted in the school inspectorate's       Gaelic strategy document (5.8), in the Scottish Government's Curriculum       for Excellence Gaelic Excellence Group report (2011, 5.6) and in B&#242;rd na       G&#224;idhlig's website and publications, including the National Plan for         Gaelic 2012-2017 (5.4).
In March 2011 O'Hanlon made a presentation       of the research findings to the Highland Council's Gaelic Committee: the       Council has quoted key findings from the report in its recent promotional       leaflet on Gaelic education (5.7), as has Western Isles Council.
Comann       nam P&#224;rant, the organisation representing parents of children in Gaelic       education, has also flagged up the research in its promotional materials (www.parant.org.uk/foghlam).
In 2011 O'Hanlon held eleven seminars in the schools that had taken part       in the research.
The B&#242;rd funded these events as part of its effort to       maximise the impact of the research.
The seminars provided discussion       forums in which people involved in Gaelic education debated how the       research might ratify or change their own understanding, experience or       practice.
Those attending were senior managers of schools with Gaelic       streams, Gaelic advisers to local authorities, teachers in Gaelic- and       English-medium education, local office bearers of Comann nam P&#224;rant and       individual parents.
The importance of our research on attainment and choice was recognised by       its inclusion in the Academy of Social Sciences' Making the Case for         the Social Sciences: Scotland (2012) booklet, where it is noted as a       case study that has contributed "knowledge and evidence to policy,       practice and public life" (5.1).
The report on language models in Gaelic-medium       (http://tinyurl.com/nurg5al) was discussed at meetings of B&#242;rd na       G&#224;idhlig's National Gaelic Education Steering Group and Early Years       Working Group in August 2012.
O'Hanlon's subsequent invitation to lead       workshops in November 2012 in Uist and Stornoway and for new Gaelic       teachers from across Scotland (65 teachers participated) indicates the       impact of these discussions.
The research on public attitudes to Gaelic has been invoked by       Scottish Government ministers, including the First Minister Alex Salmond,       to explain and justify the Government's initiatives to promote Gaelic,       especially in relation to education.
Salmond has said: "We should be       delighted by the indications from public opinion surveys that there is       widespread public support for Gaelic-medium education [...].
That is a       spectacular achievement, which should be celebrated by everyone in the       chamber".
Salmond has also noted the decision (20 February 2013) of the       Minister for Learning, Science and Scotland's Languages, Alasdair Allan,       to grant &#163;90k to fund, alongside other initiatives, further summer schools       in Gaelic communities for trainee teachers (http://tinyurl.com/nsb97tp).
