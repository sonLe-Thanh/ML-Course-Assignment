Informing and influencing policy debate and formation     i) In Kathmandu, in February 2011, an Activist Workshop set up and led by       the research team brought together NGOs, donors, trafficked women and       high-level government representatives (80+).
Preliminary research findings       were used to review NGO programming and led directly to the following       policy debate and political lobbying.
a. Shakti Samuha, one of the first anti-trafficking NGOs to be founded by       post-trafficked women, drafted demands on citizenship rights/livelihoods       which were submitted to political parties and elected government and       Constituent Assembly core committees, including the Fundamental Rights       Committee (FRC).
Six specific recommendations that were raised from the       Activist Workshop are listed in this document regarding citizenship       provision to women and children in general, plus a number pertaining to       trafficked women and children whose mothers were sexually exploited abroad       (IMP1).
b.
This led to the FRC Chair soliciting case studies of post-trafficked       women and their children's exclusion from citizenship from Shakti Samuha.
c. Case studies co-selected by Shakti Samuha and the research team were       then presented by the FRC to the Constituent Assembly (CA) recommending       that `children without having a father's known identity should be         granted rights of citizenship'.
This demand was adopted in March       2012, and is registered by the CA Secretariat to be ratified as part of       the new Constitution when the Secretariat and CA are re-elected (currently       scheduled for November 2013) (IMP2).
ii) As a technical expert to the National Committee in Controlling Human       Trafficking, the research team directly influenced recommendations on       access to housing, healthcare, education and livelihoods for women       post-trafficking, later endorsed by Cabinet in the National Plan of Action       in May 2012 (IMP3).
iii) The American Bar Association used research findings to formulate       policy on witness protection and support services moving to ensure a `more         nuanced and survivor-centric framework for assessing survivors needs and         how justice actors should address those' (IMP4), citing `Post-         Trafficking in Nepal: a project on livelihood strategies for survivors         of human trafficking implemented in cooperation with the IOM and         Newcastle University' as an example of best pratice in `services         provided to trafficking victims by NGOs' (IMP5).
iv) DFID's Asia social development agenda was directly informed by the       research team's input into the development, monitoring and evaluation       (M&amp;E) of DFID's large anti-trafficking regional programme (&#163;9.75m:       2011-18).
DFID's Senior Regional Social Development Advisor for Asia       states `[y]our research helped us understand the complexity of         trafficking and how it works and how it interacts and who to listen to'.
Referring specifically to Laurie's role in the M&amp;E tender selection       process (December 2011-January 2012), she stated `your         expertise...gave professionalism, rigour and expertise to our selection         panel' (IMP6).

Building capacity for self-advocacy amongst women     Local level in Nepal &#8212; drawing on the research team's expertise, a       modular training programme in action-research methodologies was put       together.
This was delivered to the Shakti Samuha leadership, which       consisted of 12 post-trafficked women, between 2010 and 2012.
The       importance of this training was emphasised in their presentation `Trafficking         Survivors to Social Researchers: Reflections on a Journey' to the       `Making Livelihoods: Sexuality, Citizenship and Stigma Conference       (Kathmandu, November 2011; co-hosted by IOM, Newcastle University and       Shakti Samuha; the conference attracted 100+ participants including CA       members and senior policy-makers): `Research conducted by survivors         themselves would be more effective and help to identify the real status         of trafficking survivors, identify their needs and make recommendations         to stakeholders in order to fulfil their actual needs' (IMP7).
As a result of this training and with on-going consultation with the       research team, in 2012-2013 Shakti Samuha designed and implemented an       action-research project to improve trafficked women's access to justice       when taking traffickers to court.
Nationally &#8212; in November 2010, research insights were used to       provide training to AATWIN, Nepal's national anti-trafficking alliance (32       member groups) with a specific focus on anti- trafficking's relationship       with human rights.
As the AATWIN Programme Coordinator stated following       the training, `The project website is being widely used by our member         organisations to gain conceptual understanding on trafficking and         challenges women have been facing post-trafficking' and she noted       how training sessions enabled those campaigning for the fundamental rights       of trafficked women (IMP8).
Internationally &#8212; as part of extending the training       internationally, Poudel (PDR) was seconded to work with IOM Turkmenistan       (December 2011-February 2012) to develop and deliver an anti- trafficking       toolkit for high-level Central Asian policy makers.
This resulted in       post-trafficking being incorporated into the Turkmen government's and       IOM's work in Turkmenistan for the first time, setting the scene to shape       policy agendas by building NGO capacity into the future because as IOM       Programme Coordinator Turkmenistan argued following the training, `Once         the NGOs will be strengthened, then significant positive impacts will         reached' (IMP9).
In 2012, Poudel also worked in partnership       with AATWIN and GAATW (a leading global anti-trafficking network) to       develop and deliver field-based training to 15 women from 5       anti-trafficking NGOs to build capacity in generating baseline data on       livelihood needs for future international lobbying around the UN Optional       Protocol on Trafficking (IMP8).

Raising public awareness and challenging conventional wisdom     The research has made visible the exclusions faced by post-trafficked       women in Nepal.
Achieved through extensive media exposure, this includes       more than 11 TV and 25 radio interviews (some web-streamed       internationally), 8 print media articles (half in the major English daily,       Kathmandu Post), and conceptual input into the anti-trafficking       documentary The Color of Brave (made by Film Himalaya) (IMP10).
Metrics on research project website visits indicate impact on a large       readership (51,932 visitors, January 2010 - October 2013).
Figures for the       last year show 75% new visits, with visitors from 10 countries (Google       Analytics).
