     The impact is economic: enhanced design capabilities based on the       research have resulted in a       superior product and substantial time and cost savings.
The beneficiary is       Rolls-Royce, a world       leader in the design and manufacture of gas turbine engines for aircraft,       ships, power generation       and other applications.
Rolls-Royce has been hailed as a star of the       manufacturing sector by the       UK Government, bucking the trend of many of its peers by achieving a total       revenue of over &#163;12.2       bn and record profits of &#163;1.4 bn in 2012 [A], with 85% of its sales abroad       [B] bringing valuable       income to the country, as well as providing employment for almost 20,000       in the UK alone [C].
From research to impact.
Rolls-Royce uses CFD codes to simulate       the flow of fluids in and       around all products, including the flow of air through all components of       diesel or gas turbine       engines and their installations [D].
In 2004, Rolls-Royce received from       Oxford the first production       version of the HYDRA CFD code for testing.
In 2006 it was established as       the company's       compressor design tool, and by 2009 it had become the design tool for       multiple businesses across       Rolls-Royce &#8212; including gas turbines, air and thermal systems, and power       generation [E].
It is one       of the few codes that the company uses for CFD [D].
The many uses of HYDRA within Rolls Royce are illustrated in this       diagram, taken from [F] and       used with permission.
The ability to simulate the flow of air through the engines is crucial to       Rolls-Royce's design       capability, as engines are now designed almost exclusively through       computer simulation with       experimental testing carried out afterwards to verify the performance of       the final design.
Rolls-Royce uses HYDRA in various ways: to assess the       aerodynamic efficiency of a design; to assess       the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on blades due to the passing of       neighbouring blade rows;       to assess the possibility of self-induced vibrations; and to quantify the       heat transfer from the very       hot gases coming out of the combustor into the high pressure turbine       blades [F].
HYDRA offers Rolls-Royce unprecedented accuracy because of its ability to       deal with shocks, and       the company reports that it is now able to rank designs to better than 1%       efficiency, consistently       more impressive than rival packages such as FLUENT.
As an example, it       reports that calculated       loss coefficients for industrial exhaust systems now differ from measured       values by just 0.02%,       compared to 0.16% when calculated using FLUENT [E].
Nature and extent of the impact.
Of the many impacts of HYDRA to       Rolls-Royce, the greatest       has been on the design of its gas turbine engines for aircraft.
The       `soaring demand for more fuel-efficient engines for planes' [G] helped the       civil aerospace arm of the company deliver a 16%       increase in annual revenue to over &#163;6.4 billion in 2012 [A, G] and with       Trent engines, which are       designed using HYDRA, making up around 75% of all orders [A].
Furthermore,       `Rolls-Royce's       order book rose 4% to &#163;60.1bn thanks to strong demand for its Trent       aircraft engines' [B].
HYDRA has given Rolls-Royce a single tool for aerodynamic, aero-acoustic       and aero-elastic       applications.
Its novel multi-grid solvers allows the company to       efficiently analyse complex engine       shapes which were previously difficult to assess.
Furthermore, the       parallelisation of the software       has cut analysis time, and Rolls-Royce attributes the decrease in design       time for an intermediate       turbine test rig, from [text removed for publication], to the use       of HYDRA's adjoint CFD code [E].
In total, the code has helped save Rolls-Royce at least [text removed         for publication], in test rig       expenses [E].
Rolls-Royce technological development webpage openly credits       HYDRA as one of       the key pieces of technology that make up The Rolls-Royce Engineering       System [D]; for example,       "HYDRA has been used extensively in the design of recent RR products such       as the Trent 1000."
The code was used to design Rolls-Royce's Trent 1000 series of engines,       which power Boeing 787       aeroplanes.
By way of illustration of the benefits of improved accuracy       and design capability,       improvements to the latest iteration of the Trent 1000, unveiled in 2012,       over its predecessors       include: [text removed for publication] more efficient       intermediate pressure compressor; [text         removed for publication] more efficient intermediate pressure       turbine; shortened Boeing flight       testbed schedule thanks to design being ahead of time; and a fan assessed       as having "world class       performance" in a Boeing Audit [E].
The Trent 1000 is also the quietest       mode of powering the 787       &#8212; some 6 dB quieter than its competitors [C].
The newer Trent XWB, announced in 2007 and then first flown in 2012,       powers the new Airbus       A350 XWB and was also designed using HYDRA.
As of May 2012, it was       Rolls-Royce's fastest-selling engine to date, having achieved 1,100 orders       from 34 customers worldwide [C].
Once       again, HYDRA contributed to the improvement of its design, with its high       pressure compressor       seeing an improvement in efficiency of [text removed for publication],       and its intermediate       pressure compressor seeing a [text removed for publication]       improvement, both over the Trent       1000.
All told, the Trent XWB is [text removed for publication]       more efficient than the first       generation Trent engines of 1995, making it the most efficient Trent       engine to date.
