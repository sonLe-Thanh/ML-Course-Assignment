     Cronk has had experience of presenting Voltaire to a broader public: he       wrote and presented three programmes on Voltaire in the Radio 3 series       `The Essay' (November 2010), and more recently spoke about Candide       on Melvyn Bragg's In Our Time (May 2012); in 2013 he did a number       of press, radio and TV interviews about his `discovery' of some Voltaire       manuscripts, and gave a talk about this (`Voltaire's lost letters') at a       recent Oxford alumni reunion, and at another alumni gathering in Paris.
He       has recently written an article on the posthumous image of Voltaire for a       special dossier on Voltaire which appeared in the French weekly Le         Nouvel Observateur in July 2013.
He finds that communicating his       ideas about Voltaire to these different audiences has given him a more       acute awareness of why Voltaire remains such a relevant figure in modern       society.
This case study focuses on two specific areas of impact arising from the       research on OCV: namely the cultural and educative experiences       open to the general public, and particularly to school students,       facilitated by the development of `Candide, l'&#233;dition enrichie'[&#167;5:           A], a free iPad app version of Voltaire's Candide.
The app has been developed as part of a wider commitment by Cronk and the       editors of OCV to rendering the collection available and       accessible to as wide a public audience as possible, for example, the OCV       edition of Questions sur l'Encyclop&#233;die, when complete, will       appear also in the distinguished and best-selling Bouquins collection       published by Robert Laffont.
The Candide app is free to download and is available from the       iTunes app store.
There have been over 7000 downloads since January [A].
A free website was launched in April 2013, and further versions of the app       (for iPhones and Androids notably) are also scheduled for release during       2013.
The early success of the app is attested by its receipt of a Silver       `European Design Award' in 2013 for communication design excellence [B].
The app is divided into three parts:             Le Livre: The French text, with as an optional extra, access to         the main (La Valli&#232;re) manuscript on the left-hand side of the screen.
The reader can read a plain text; or choose the academic annotation of         the Voltaire Foundation edition; or choose a simpler annotation,         specially commissioned, aimed at teenagers in the first instance.
The         reader can also opt to hear the text read by one of France's leading         modern actors and comedians, Denys Podalyd&#232;s; his reading was specially         made for this app.
Le Monde: Readers can access a map of Candide's travels around         the world, and from there access further information about any idea of         interest: there are short essays on themes, iconographical collections,         maps, short videos of talks, etc.
This section will continue to grow.
Le Jardin: The reader is encouraged to dig deeper and so         cultivate Candide's garden.
Each reader can label his/her favourites,         amongs the texts, pictures, recordings, videos, and so constitute a         private anthology of material.
Each such anthology takes the shape of a         tree of learning in the garden.
This section will be a vital learning         tool for schools: teachers will be able to create their own         presentations in the garden and invite their students to contribute to         them, and students will be able to read each other's work.
This section         has been classroom-tested [C], and will be available         to all schools in autumn 2014.
The app, with its dual level of annotations, illustrations, manuscript       images, commentaries, and the Polyad&#232;s recording, offers rewards to a wide       range of readers, and functions in a curatorial capacity to preserve an       important work of French classical literary heritage in a new, sustainable       format.
In particular, the app's encouragement to the reader to engage       with the text offers a unique, interactive experience: 'Ainsi la tr&#232;s       belle initiative d'Orange, de la BNF et la Voltaire Foundation (aucun       diable am&#233;ricain, les chagrins le constateront...) qui vous proposent de       red&#233;couvrir une &#339;uvre majeure de notre patrimoine litt&#233;raire, Candide de       Voltaire.
[...] Si vous avez un ipad, vous pouvez vous rendre ici et       t&#233;l&#233;charger cette application qui vous invite, dans une approche &#224; la fois       ludique et scientifiquement rigoureuse, &#224; d&#233;couvrir ou red&#233;couvrir cette       &#339;uvre de Voltaire, au gr&#233; de vos envies.
Elle offre de nombreux       enrichissements autour du texte ainsi que des &#233;clairages qui contribuent &#224;       la compr&#233;hension de l'&#339;uvre.[...]
Pas mal du tout!'
[D]     Several users have commented on the app's function in establishing an       innovative format for classic literature; for example, the French       publisher `Edilivre' mentions the app in an online article about the books       of the future, `Par ailleurs, m&#234;me les textes anciens peuvent &#234;tre       enrichis.
En d&#233;cembre 2012, la BNF, associ&#233; &#224; Orange et &#224; la Voltaire       Foundation, publia une version num&#233;rique enrichie de Candide.
Une       lecture sonore avec la voix de l'acteur Denis Podalyd&#232;s &#233;tait disponible.
De plus, avec un simple tapotement sur l'&#233;cran l'acc&#232;s &#224; des d&#233;finitions,       des fiches sur des personnages cl&#233;s du r&#233;cit, des lieux, des concepts et       des illustrations du texte ex&#233;cut&#233;s par des graveurs du XVIII&#232;me si&#232;cle       &#233;tait garanti.
Une carte informant sur le voyage de Candide &#233;tait       agr&#233;ment&#233;e d'approfondissements p&#233;dagogiques autour de l'&#339;uvre ainsi que       d'un espace collaboratif.'
[E]Historical writer Anna       Gibson mentions the app on two of her French culture blogs: 'In the best       of all possible worlds, more publishing houses would look to the example       of the [sic] Orange, the Biblioth&#232;que nationale de France and the Voltaire       Foundation with their new, digitally enhanced version of Voltaire's       Candide.
This new digital version may be better named an "experience"       rather than simple digital book.'
[F] Cronk has written       about the app's development , publicly sharing his experience of the       particular challenges involved in preparing a literary classic for       transmission in a digital format, in the journal of the Biblioth&#232;que       nationale de France [G].
`Candide: l'&#233;dition enrichie'       has also been specifically targeted at school students.
French teenagers       studying literature at school now rarely read books from cover to cover:       the syllabus asks them to study extracts from novels, arranged       thematically.
So part of the challenge was to devise an app which would       encourage engagement with a classic, and impel students to then read the       book in its entirety.
The Candide app represents an extremely       useful tool for both independent learning, and also for classroom       teaching, as demonstrated by the enthusiastic response from practitioners       via twitter [H], for example: @francophilia , `French       teachers, gorgeous free ipad app, interactive, participative for Candide.
The future is now!
'; @celine_louis, `j'aurais ador&#233; avoir &#231;a &#224; l'&#233;cole RT       @LaboBnF: Candide, l'&#233;dition enrichie!
'; @FrenchatLeeds, `The Candide app:       the best of all possible apps...'.
G-Souto's, on his digital teaching       blog, writes: 'As a specialist of Humanities &amp; ICT, I'm really happy!
Voltaire's Candide app is marvellous!
This will be an exciting teaching       and learning tool to academics and students.
Classical Literature lessons       will be creative and contagious.'
