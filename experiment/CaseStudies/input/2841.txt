     Overview       Cheshire 3 has had high impact because its development has been guided by       rich 2-way interactions with different networks of potential       beneficiaries.
The beneficiaries include the bodies that provide national       data infrastructures, data users, and equipment vendors.
Our interactions       with them increase the reach and the significance of the impact in 3 ways:            The interactions have ensured that Cheshire 3 is useful.
Its         development has been guided by the needs of potential users.
It supports         the latest policies, methods and practices for the analysis and sharing         of data and its technologies are closely integrated with the latest data         management technologies.
The interactions ensure that public and private bodies that provide         data infrastructures are aware of and understand the advantages of         Cheshire 3.
The interactions ensure that data users know that Cheshire 3 provides         the kinds of enhanced capabilities that they need in order to archive         their data reliably and to extract value from it.
Interactions leading to Impact       Our interactions with providers of national data infrastructure       include long-term collaboration with teams internationally responding to       needs assessment and requirements analysis; integration with other       projects already involved with "big data" management and analytics areas;       and long-term involvement with standards working groups and       implementation of the software at STFC for the Virtual Engineering Centre       at Daresbury.
In 2009 the software was demonstrated to 13 Federal Agencies       as a primary technology, which resulted in the formation of the DataNet       Federation Consortium (DFC).
This demonstration also formed the basis of       the SHAMAN         Integrated Project prototype (2008-2012), which served to integrate       the Cheshire system with the iRODS adaptive middleware, thus supporting       long-term curation and analysis of archived data.
Our interactions with data users include participation in groups       working to develop social consensus for the analysis and sharing of data,       policies, methods, and practice; and the interoperability mechanisms to       support technology integration and data analysis.
This has involved       sustained interaction with emerging networks of expertise across digital       curation projects.
Our interactions with equipment vendors include discussions with       NetApp about the possible adoption of the software for storage devices,       working with corporate developers in London; employment of software       developers across SME (Archive Analytics, SpaceApps) to provide services       and support throughout the EU; use of the software by value added       resellers.
1) Impact on National Data Infrastructures       The software was developed at Liverpool and partly         funded by the NARA US National Archives as a means of supporting       long-term curation and analysis of digital data.
a.
The software has supported services across multiple agencies, in the       US, including NSF, NARA, NASA, NIH, DOD, NHPRC, IMLS, and Europe,       including DOE, JISC, EU, EPSRC.
b.
The software forms a foundational component of the US National Science       Foundation data infrastructure based at DataNet         Federation Consortium, for national (US) e-Science research       applications.
c. The software contributed to all of these services the ability to index       material within a data grid (cloud) and the ability to provide data       analytics workflows across active collections, across all these       organizations.
Cheshire3 has provided this functionality to the DFC and       other NSF research projects that support the national data       cyberinfrastructure for NSF research projects in the United States and       which rely heavily on the extensive set of metadata that allows for the       discovery, analysis, and preservation of studies.
The expanded ability of       these initiatives to federate using iRODS and Cheshire discovery services       means that scientific research datasets can be analysed and managed with       policy based rules that protect the authenticity, privacy, provenance,       context, and integrity of datasets.
d. The software is widely used on a service-oriented basis       internationally, and forms the infrastructure of multiple national digital       library services in the UK, including the         Archives Hub (JISC) (1999-present), and the         Incunabula Short Title Catalogue (British Library) (2005-present).
2) Impact on Data Users     a.
The integrated software forms the basis of commercial prototypes for     AstraZeneca, Drexel, and Virtual Engineering Centre, for managing data     driven collections; and in 2012 the Virtual Engineering Centre commissioned     a prototype for use in the automotive and aerospace sectors at the Science     and Technology Facilities Council.
b.
The integrated system is currently being rolled out for research       organizations, such as Sanger Institute, Science and Technology Facilities       Council (STFC), University of Edinburgh (EPCC), University of Liverpool       (N8 grid).
c. The system has been prototyped for use in managing research data for       the pharmaceutical industry (AstraZeneca) (2008-2010).
d. The research advances in distributed data analytics applied to       petascale (millions of gigabytes) collections have resulted in measurable       impact improving the analysis and management of scientific research data,       including research collaborations across different communities of       practice.
3) Impact on Equipment Developers     a. NetApp, DataDirectNetworks, and Xerox are promoting use of the system and     software for cloud appliance and managing "big data technologies" for     research or predictive use cases.
The Business Development Manager for Cloud     Services at NetApp UK Ltd will confirm that the Cheshire technology     developed by Professor Watry's group will be embedded in upcoming NetApp     enterprise products on a commercial basis from 2014.     b.
The software is driving investment within the SME communities, both in       the US and EU.
The Founder and Senior Science Advisor of Bellerophon       Mobile in the United States, for example, states that "the use of       Cheshire3 workflows to aid discovery of distributed data could contribute       greatly to effectiveness of building mobile knowledge-based systems".
