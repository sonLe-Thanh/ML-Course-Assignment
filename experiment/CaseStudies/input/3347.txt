     UCL research findings on long-range noise propagation have led to       improved understanding and changes in thinking about highway noise       mitigation at ADOT.
The findings have also had an impact on a variety of       other organisations and individuals worldwide, informing their       understanding and stimulating discourse about the assessment of noise       propagation, not only from roads, but also from wind turbines, and       additionally from a gas compressor station and various sources in its       vicinity, including a railway line.
Impact on thinking about traffic noise mitigation at ADOT: The       principal goal of ADOT's ten-year QPPP is to assess the effectiveness of       rubberised asphalt at reducing environmental noise from urban freeways, in       comparison with other noise mitigation strategies, such as noise barriers.
In addition to the public health benefits arising from a reduction of       freeway noise in residential areas, using alternative noise mitigation       strategies may also be cost effective, as the typical concrete noise       barriers used in Arizona are very expensive and cost approximately $1       million per mile to construct.
Since the UCL research was funded by ADOT       as part of the QPPP, major policy changes will not occur until the       project's field trials have been completed in 2015; however, UCL research       findings have already impacted upon thinking about noise mitigation at       ADOT, causing the department to consider more carefully the effectiveness       of costly noise barriers and how they invest in noise mitigation       strategies [A].
ADOT currently makes use of the widely used FHWA Traffic Noise Model       (TNM) v2.5 for assessing the environmental noise impact of new and       existing freeways.
The UCL research findings suggest, however, that the       noise barriers used throughout Arizona and elsewhere may not be as       effective at reducing noise as the FHWA-TNM might indicate; this       difference occurs because TNM does not incorporate local meteorological       effects whereas the model in reference [1] above does.
Indeed, references       [1] and [2] above strongly suggest that typical meteorological conditions       can readily defeat noise barriers that are erected based simply on       blocking the line-of-sight to residential areas of concern.
These research       findings helped convince ADOT that investigation into better noise barrier       technology is required.
In October 2012, this realisation led ADOT to       announce a call for a follow-on three-year project entitled "Materials       Properties and Optimum Geometries for the Design of Noise Walls" [text       removed for publication] [A].
The project entails inviting noise barrier       manufacturers to present novel noise barrier designs to a panel of project       researchers, with selected designs subsequently being tested using the       combined experimental/theoretical approach developed in references [1],       [2] and [3] above, incorporating both measured and simulated       meteorological data.
Raised awareness at the Institute of Acoustics (IoA): In May 2013,     Ovenden was contacted by a community campaigner in the UK who was interested     in the relevance of the findings of reference [1] above to the assessment of     noise propagation from wind turbines.
In particular, the campaigner was     concerned that the "Good Practice Guide for Wind Turbine Noise", being     launched at that time by the IoA at the request of the Department of Energy     and Climate Change, recommended a propagation model (ISO9613-2) that did not     sufficiently include wind shear and therefore did not account for some of     the enhanced effects that had been predicted using the model in [1] above.
This interest stimulated a detailed discussion between Ovenden and the     campaigner about the science and the issues [B], and led to Ovenden writing     to the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser and to the President of the IoA raising     his concerns about the use of ISO9613-2 - a method originally designed for     near-ground noise sources &#8212; in assessing the environmental impact of     high-altitude noise sources such as wind turbine facilities, with the     results of [1] used as evidence of this concern.
The President of the IoA     reported back that Ovenden's "concern in relation to the use of ISO9613-2 as     the method of propagation was discussed at length by the GPG [Good Practice     Guide] working group" [C] at the IoA's council meeting in June, and that,     while changes will not be made at this point, they recognise "that many     arguments are made for a different approach to the assessment of wind farm     noise."
[C]     Improved understanding of sound-related issues in AZ tribal areas:       In October 2010, Ovenden was contacted by a co-founder of a consultancy       firm called EN3 Professionals in Flagstaff AZ, which specialises in       engineering, environmental and energy-related matters, with some questions       about the research findings in reference [1] above in relation to one of       the firm's current projects.
After continued discussion and a meeting in       April 2013, the co-founder invited Ovenden to offer his opinion (based on       his work with ADOT) on an environmental baseline sound level report for a       groundwater remediation project in the vicinity of a gas compressor       station near Topock, AZ.
The project is of interest to local tribes,       including the Hualapai, Cocopah, Fort Mojave, Chemehuevi and Colorado       River Indian tribes, as the area is of great cultural significance to       these communities.
Ovenden's contribution led to improved understanding of       the project's sound-related issues; EN3's co-founder said: "Dr. Ovenden's       review of and comment on the baseline sound studies completed to date at       Topock was vital for identifying how the studies can be improved to better       address tribal issues."
[D]     Raised awareness and understanding at Coconino County authorities:       Also in April 2013, a meeting was held between Ovenden and the Head of       Coconino County's Community Development Department and a colleague to       discuss noise concerns from wind farms.
Their awareness and understanding       of the issues were informed by the findings of reference [1] above, which       were discussed at the meeting, and they expressed much interest in using       such a methodology to see how local meteorology could be taken into       account when assessing the noise impact of the county's current and       proposed wind energy sites.
Greater understanding at the Acoustic Ecology Institute (AEI): The       AEI is a US non-profit organisation that aims to inform public debate       about the environmental impact of noise.
The institute's Executive       Director contacted Ovenden in early 2010 as he was very intrigued by the       fact that the model in reference [1] above predicts in some cases       increasing near-ground sound levels and sound focusing beyond 400-plus       metres from the source.
Subsequent correspondence with Ovenden resulted in       greater understanding within the AEI about such work and how it might be       used to assess the long-range propagation of noise from wind farms.
This       led to reference [1] being highlighted in the organisation's newsletter in       February 2010 [E], where it is noted that Ovenden's model combines field       recordings and new acoustic modelling, and demonstrates significant       differences of 10-20dB in noise levels from those predicted by traditional       sound models at 300 metres and beyond, thereby offering the possibly of       regulatory limits being breached at much greater distances than perhaps       previously considered.
Stimulation of public interest and discourse: The research in       reference [1] above was highlighted by the Acoustical Society of America       (ASA) in April 2011 as being of interest to the general public.
The       society asked Ovenden to prepare a lay language version of the paper to       help disseminate information about acoustics to the general public and       elevate awareness about topics in acoustics to a worldwide audience.
Following this lay language version [F] and an invited talk at the 161st       ASA meeting in May 2011, the research received significant media attention       (including a news story on the NBC News website [G] and an interview on       Deutschlandradio [H], both in May 2011), stimulating public discourse and       interest internationally.
Examples include:            In June 2011, Ovenden was contacted by a community group in Germany         concerned about traffic noise from a neighbouring autobahn, where the         local mountainous topography creates significant highway crosswinds.
The         group requested a copy of reference [1] above, as they believed the         paper's results would be useful in the group's battle with their local         authorities about what measures should be employed to reduce noise.
At the ASA meeting in May 2011, Ovenden was approached by employees         at Washington State Department of Transportation concerning noise         complaints they received from residential areas located a mile or more         from the apparent noise sources of concern (e.g.
construction noise in         particular).
They indicated their strong interest in any further field         tests validating the research findings.
The US Federal Aviation Administration contacted the authors of         reference [1] by email in June 2011 requesting a copy of the paper, as         they also have an interest in using detailed weather information for the         prediction of sound propagation.
In March 2013, a Berlin-based artist requested to know more about the         propagation mechanisms in the research [I].
The artist stated in her         email: "Being myself a sonic artist living and working directly by the         river Spree in Berlin, I recognize similarities in my experiences and         observations with those of your article" [I].
She wishes to compare the         research work with her own observations and ideas in producing sonic         artwork.
