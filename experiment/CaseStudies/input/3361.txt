     The discontinuous carbon fibre preforming process developed through       Warrior and Rudd's body of       underpinning research at UoN has made a significant contribution to the       economic competitiveness       of two of Britain's leading manufacturers of luxury vehicles, Aston Martin       Lagonda and Bentley       Motors, and in the process has showcased British engineering excellence.
Aston Martin employed the technique for the production of the door       opening reinforcement and the       trunk lid surround for its DBS, 12MY Virage, 13MY DB9 and new Vanquish       models [4.1].
For DBS       alone &#8212; since 2008 3,300 cars have been sold in 42 countries at around       &#163;180,000 each, which       equates to sales revenue of &#163;594M.
In 2011 more than 80% of Aston Martin's       sales were to buyers       outside the UK [4.2].
This surpassed Aston Martin CEO Ulrich Bez's aim of       selling a third of the       company's cars in Europe and a third in America.
By comparison, in 2000       the brand's annual sales       were 800 cars, of which 700 were sold in the UK [4.2].
The two carbon fibre parts are manufactured and supplied by Sora       Composites, which is based in       St Meloir, France.
They represent a weight saving of 52% and 44%       respectively compared to the       alternative glass fibre materials.
Over 23 tonnes of discontinuous carbon       fibre composite material       has reached the market through this process on the DBS alone.
The       technology has been a key       enabler for reducing mass and therefore improving both performance and       economy &#8212; making the       car lighter, faster and stronger [4.1].
"The Discontinuous Carbon Fibre Preform (DCFP) work with the University       of Nottingham resulted       in the uptake of chopped carbon fibre composite technology into the Trunk       Lid Surround (TLS) and       Door Opening Reinforcement (DOR) panels of the DBS...
These parts were       originally one of the       main differentiators between the top of the range DBS model and other       models in our range of       supercars...
The technology has been a key enabler for reducing mass and       therefore improving       both performance and economy across our range of vehicles."

A total investment of &#163;800k ([2.7] and       contribution to studentships) was       made by Bentley Motors in developing an enhancement to the DCFP process &#8212;       in collaboration       with Warrior &#8212; that involved using carbon fibre in its least processed       form and spraying it with resin       into a mould, eliminating the need for heating and cooling [4.4].
UoN's work formed the basis of Bentley's RayCell technology, which       Bentley employed, through       investment of a further &#163;500,000 in 2010, for the production of a       demonstration vehicle that       showcases the next generation of cars to be produced by the company [4.4].
The demonstration       vehicle specifically showed that it is possible for the carbon fibre       chassis rails to support the weight       of the vehicle [4.3].
"The Raycell technology developed at the University of Nottingham has       been used to develop the       composite elements for the demonstrator vehicle.
The research has       indicated that it is feasible to       manufacture major structural elements in our next generation of cars using       carbon fibre in this       way."

On presenting the award, the RAE said the       research into carbon fibre       composites had "shown that mass-produced vehicles can be up to 50% lighter       and still maintain       crash-test performance using lightweight carbon fibre composites".
It       added: "High material costs       and labour-intensive manufacturing have restricted composites to motor       sports and supercars until       now... [Warrior] has demonstrated that composites are now a legitimate       material for use in high-       volume production (up to 20,000 vehicles a year)" [4.5].
