     Abdel Haleem's translations have sold more than a quarter of a million       copies internationally and       many pirated versions of the 2010 edition are available for download from       websites in Pakistan and       elsewhere; in February 2013 it was available on the notorious, `Pirate's       Bay' website, now blocked       by leading search engines.
According to OUP and Amazon.co.uk, Abdel       Haleem's translations are       the world's bestselling Qur'an translations.
As of November 2013, the 2010       hardback edition was       ranked 11th and the paperback at 2nd for sales on Amazon.co.uk       in the category "Religion of       Islam," with the Kindle edition at no.
8, and 35th in the       category "religious history of Islam" in the UK       and 6th in the US.
(1, 2 and 3 below)     In keeping with Abdel Haleem's desire to create a widely accessible,       naturalistic English translation       of the Qur'an, many Amazon reviews of the 2010 edition written by readers       themselves Muslims       and non-Muslims highlight ease of reading and improved understanding, both       as a consequence of       the language employed in the translation and of the additional notes and       footnotes and other       explanatory material, examples of which include:            a review of May 2011 --"I have been searching for something like           this for many years and it           seems my prayers have finally been answered.
If you are looking for an           easier to read           translation this Quran really hits the nail on the head.
Not only is           this a translation, the           author has explained the reasons behind the verses, making the quran           more digestable           and also readable.
Excellent version, would recommend to muslims and           non muslims           alike";        a review of July 2011 -- "Abdulhalim did a great job in translating           the Quran, and he           included a very useful explanations that helps any non-Muslim to           follow and understand the           Quran";       a review of February 2012 -- "It was so good to see a learned           translation of the Quran in a           coherent and fluently readable English.
A great work";        a review of January 2013 - "This translation is a great improvement           over earlier translations           for me.
The English is much more understandable but still conveys the           meaning accurately, so           far as I can tell.
The language still retains much of the powerful           delivery one would expect";        a review of July 2013 - "I'm really enjoying to read this           particular translation of the Qur'an,           because of the flowing nature of the English.
It's very enjoyable to           read.....
There is a little           sentence before every chapter to explain where the chapter was           revealed (Makkah or           Madinah) and a short context, which I like ...
In a few instances           where the context needs to           be made a clear a short footnote is included, which again is kept nice           and concise".
(3)          The translation is now available in Kindle and Google ebook editions       available online, and OUP       has commissioned an audio version at the request of readers.
Further impact on a broad readership is corroborated by bulk purchases       made by religious       organisations internationally and through promotion of the translation by       interfaith organisations.
In       2010 the Department of Islamic Affairs in Abu Dhabi bought 15,000 copies       for free distribution in       hotels.
In 2011, Why Islam?, a project based in Southern       California under the Islamic Circle of       North America with branches all over the United States, requested 20,000       copies a year for free       distribution.
The book is widely available in UK mosques; for example,       Palmers Green Mosque       makes bulk orders of the book to sell at a reduced price to its community.
(1) The Building Bridges       Seminars on Muslim-Christian relations, convened by the Archbishop of       Canterbury, use only       Abdel Haleem's translation in its literature and annual omnibus featuring       content of the seminars,       whose multi-faith readership is considerable.
(4)     The translation is widely used in teaching at a number of levels       internationally.
In 2010 Wayne       University in the United States bought 200 copies.
In 2011 a professor at       the University of Qom in       Iran requested copies for his teaching and research activities in two       undergraduate courses writing:       "There are two undergraduate courses of studying Islamic works in         English translation which are         taught in the discipline of English language and literature in Iranian         universities.
As in both courses         it is natural to encounter texts with fragments from the Qur'an, I used         to introduce a number of         English translations, all purchased before yours.
Since your translation         was published, I have been         keen to use [it] for my teaching and research activities."
(4)     It should be noted that Qom is the main centre of Shi'i studies and Abdel       Haleem is a Sunni.
For       this professor in Iran to accept and use a translation by a Sunni scholar       is a telling example of how       widely this translation is accepted.
A professor at the university of Waterloo in Canada has written to Abdel       Haleem:     I would like to express my gratitude for your English translation of         the Quran.
Of all the translations         I have read, I find yours clear, succinct and easy to understand.
I have         used it in my classes and I         always encourage non-Muslims to read the introduction you have provided,         clarifying so many         misconceptions.
I appreciate your description of how Muslims and         non-Muslims alike have taken         Quranic verses out of context, to justify their acts.
(4)     Further impact through dissemination of the translation and its       underpinning research is evident in       Abdel Haleem's participation in a range of literary festivals, public       debates and inter-faith meetings.
He spoke at the Emirates Airline Dubai Literary Festival (March 2011) on       the subject of translating       the Qur'an, and participated in the Times Cheltenham Literary       Festival (October 2010), where the       book stock sold out in the first two hours, to an audience of several       hundred.
He was at the Madrid       inter-faith dialogue conference chaired by HM King Abdallah bin Abdulaziz       al-Saud (July 2008).
