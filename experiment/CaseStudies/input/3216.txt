     Increasing public appreciation of The Book of Common Prayer     Cummings work has enriched the quality of life by increasing appreciation       of The Book of Common         Prayer.
He has turned his academic research on The Book of         Common Prayer into publicly       accessible cultural experiences (an exhibition and popular version of the       book) which, with the aid       of interpretation and appreciation by the media, have enhanced the       cultural life of those who       experienced it.
As a result, Cummings was invited to curate a major exhibition in Lambeth       Palace &#8212; `Lambeth       Palace Royal Devotion: Monarchy and The Book of Common Prayer' &#8212; 1       May-14 July 2012.
This       brought together the 350th birthday of The Book Of Common         Prayer and the Queen's 60th Jubilee.
Cummings' work for the edition led directly to the exhibition, which both       disseminated its research       to a wider audience and made available to the general public a series of       significant books and       objects that charted The Book of Common Prayer's wide cultural       impact and significance for the       monarchy.
The exhibition was launched at the Queen's first public       celebration of the Jubilee at an       inter-faith event at Lambeth Palace, and the exhibition itself was opened       by Prince Charles (see       Section 5, C1 and C2).
Public impact is evidenced by the number of visitors and their reactions       &#8212; 4,456 people visited the       exhibition over its 11-week run.
Approximately 300 people also attended       the four lectures that       accompanied the exhibition (C2).
The Guest Book from the exhibition (R3)       records universally       enthusiastic comments from visitors, many commenting on the quality of the       objects on display,       with a number recognising that they had learned a great deal about the       history of The Book Of         Common Prayer from the exhibition, and others commenting on the       quality of the guidance given.
Visitors came from, among others, the UK, the USA, Australia, France,       Japan, South Africa,       Nigeria, Malawi, the Netherlands and Egypt.
Comments included `Inspiring',       `Fascinating history       lesson', `Will stay in the memory', `Beautiful and edifying presentation'       and `Awe-inspiring' (C2).
There were 46 references to the exhibition in the media &#8212; the most       extensive being in The Times,       The Daily Telegraph and History Today, which argued that       `Anyone interested in English history       should make their way there' &#8212; 37 in on-line publications; and one on BBC       London 94.9fm.
Cumming's edition also generated extensive media attention and press       coverage, which noted the       importance of The Book Of Common Prayer in English history and       tradition, its significance       highlighted by Diamaid McCulloch in the London Review of Books       (C13), as well as reviewers in       The New Statesman, The Atlantic, Anglican Way, The         Churchman, The Heythrop Journal and       Books and Culture: A Christian Review.
Commentators noted that the       book had a vital role in       shaping the nature of English daily life, the forms of worship adopted in       the national church at a       time when church-going was compulsory, the customs and practices of       religion adopted by the       English-speaking world, and the language itself (C3).
The TLS blog       (C7) demonstrates the benefit       of the work for readers beyond the Christian communion, whose interest is       as much cultural and       historical as theological and ecclesiological because `More people heard       Morning .

and Evening       Prayer in weekly services in the words of this book than listened to the       soliloquies of Shakespeare'.
The parallel text of The Book Of Common Prayer's three versions       has sold strongly in the UK, the       US and other countries.
Total sales of the hardback edition are 7,974       copies, 3,960 in the UK and       3,074 in the US (to July 2013).
A paperback edition appeared with the       Worlds' Classics imprint in       July 2013, which sold 1,604 copies in a month (C4).
The Book of Common         Prayer was a runner-up       in The Atlantic books of the year, 2012 (C5).
Impact within the Christian church     A one-day event hosted at the British Academy, `An Uncommon Legacy?
The       350th.
Anniversary of       the 1662 Prayer Book' (28 May 2012), was organised jointly by the Academy       and the Church of       England, the latter recognising the importance of Cummings' work for their       communion (C12).
Individual discussion groups have made use of the edition, notably the       `White Horse Inn' group       (C8) which adopts the edition to inform their study, as well as particular       churches such as St Paul's       Episcopal Church, Bellingham, Washington State, USA (C9), which refers to       the edition to identify       `the basics of our faith clearly and succinctly spelled out for all to see       and understand.
It is our       Catechism; our FAQ'.
There have been references in a number of lectures       delivered throughout       the world, posted on the web (C10).
A blog, `Why Should Presbyterians Read       The Book of         Common Prayer?'
(C6), indicates that the significance of Cummings'       research goes beyond that of       one denomination.
Andrew Hawes (`The future of The Book of Common         Prayer', The Prayer Book         Society Journal, 2012: 7), argues that what is required for a       renewal of faith in the church today is       `something akin to the description Cummings made of the "conscious       cultural retrieval" of the       Prayer book at the Reformation'.
Impact on understanding of development of the English language     Cummings' edition has prompted wide discussion of the impact of The         Book Of Common Prayer       on the English language, notably in The Atlantic, the LRB       (C5 and C13), and James Wood's article       in The New Yorker, where he argues that, without an appreciation       of the words of the liturgy, we       cannot understand the significance of the range and vitality of English,       as The Book Of Common         Prayer's cadences `comfort, disappoint, haunt, irritate, disappear,       linger' (C11).
