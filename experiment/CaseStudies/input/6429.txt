     Principal beneficiaries: Teachers, pupils, awarding bodies,       curriculum designers and policy-makers.
Dates of impact: 2008-13, from the introduction of the 2008 KS3       curriculum to the development of the 2014 National Curriculum.
Reach and significance: Lambert has provided intellectual       leadership in restoring geography's place in the school curriculum,       through the reconceptualisaton of its contents and purposes.
Today,       geography is increasing in popularity again at key stages 4 and 51.
Lambert's work has helped to achieve this, not least by persuading         government (and others) of geography's position in the post-14         curriculum (and what became the English Baccalaureate).
Through the         Action Plan for Geography (APG), his research with Morgan has reached         some two-thirds of secondary schools and hundreds of primaries.
His         position as Chief Executive of the Geography Association (GA) has meant         that his ideas have been heard not only in the highest policy circles of         the UK but around the world.
Despite being a UK-based organisation, the         GA has members in more than 60 countries and has strong links with         geographical organisations in the USA, Australia and Europe.
Instrumental impact2: Lambert has influenced policy-makers         who construct official curricula and qualifications.
2014 curriculum reforms: Lambert played a key role in       shaping the Geography programmes of study.
Tim Oates, chair of the       Government's 2014 National Curriculum review Expert Panel, says that       Lambert's contribution in "theoretical underpinning, empirical evidence,       generation of critical dialogue and formation of professional consensus       has been exemplary: a textbook study of managing the interface between       policy, research, professional bodies and teaching professionals", adding       "his work has had a huge impact" (see impact source S1).
The       influence of Lambert's research on the Coalition Government's curriculum       plans began shortly after the 2010 election.
He had meetings with Schools       Minister Nick Gibb and served on the geography expert panel from 2011-13.
The GA's 2012 consultative national curriculum proposals (S2),       which are largely derived from Lambert's academic output, for example (R2),       have proved influential with DfE officials.
The revised national       curriculum, published in 2013, shows the clear influence of the GA papers,       particularly in the content sequence and the decision to specify specific       regions of the world.
Oates confirms Lambert's influence on complex       judgments such as sequencing.
Primary curriculum: Lambert, as a member of the expert       group of the Rose Review (2009), commissioned by the previous Labour       Government, helped to ensure that its proposals recognised geography (and       history) by name (replacing `Human, social and environmental       understanding' as an area of learning).
The proposals also specified the       subject's `essential knowledge, skills and understanding'.
The final       report therefore bears his thumbprint (e.g.
Rose Review, para.11, S3).
Secondary curriculum reforms: The 2009 GA Manifesto, A         Different View, authored by Lambert and with 44,000 website       downloads by early 2013, influenced both the subject guidance and       government-funded CPD following the revised KS3 curriculum of 2008.
For       example, the GA led the national geography CPD provision, reaching more       than 1,000 secondary schools between 2008 and 2010.
David Gardner, former       geography curriculum adviser at the Qualifications and Curriculum       Authority, confirms Lambert's extensive involvement and "invaluable       contributions, particularly with the drafting of the KS3 programme of       study" (S4).
In 2012, the DfE asked Lambert for "trusted advice" on       GCSE reform.
The following year, new GCSE national criteria were published       which make explicit reference to `thinking like a geographer', a phrase he       coined (S5).
Through his GA position Lambert campaigned at the highest levels to       ensure geography's place in the post-14 curriculum, culminating in the       English Baccalaureate, which was introduced as a performance measure in       2010.
Starting with Lord Adonis, Lambert obtained meetings with every       Schools Minister up to and including Nick Gibb, at which he explored the       idea of a combined geography/history GCSE.
This campaign helped establish       a sense of parity between how geography and history were perceived in the       post-14 curriculum policy arena.
Inspection: Ofsted's definition of geography core knowledge       is derived directly from Lambert's own discussion of extensive, core       geographic `vocabulary' (R2, p. 251).
Ofsted says: "The subject         matter of geography is constantly evolving so core knowledge is         essential if students are to make sense of the world around them and         place their studies in a wider national, international or global         context" (S6, p.4).
Champions and Quality Marks: The &#163;3.8m government-funded       APG (2006-11), which was praised by Ofsted, has raised the profile of       geography in more than two-thirds of English secondary schools and       established a national network of primary-teacher `Geography Champions'.
Negotiated and led by Lambert and Rita Gardner of the Royal Geographical       Society (both co-advisors for geography to Secretary of State Charles       Clarke in 2004, when it was conceived), the APG trained and supported       5,000 teachers between 2006 and 2011 and is estimated to have benefited       2.5m secondary students3.
Through the APG (S7), Lambert and         Morgan's research (e.g.
R4) directly influenced the         establishment of `curriculum making' principles and the accrediting of         good practice through the `Geography Quality Marks' (GQM), now held by         more than 600 schools.
Between its launch in 2006 and July 2013, at         least 370 schools gained the Primary GQM, benefiting some 100,000 5-11         year olds4.
Through the Secondary GQM scheme, 35 schools have           become `Centres of Excellence'.
GQMs have now become the cornerstone           of the GA's expanding commercially-based professional development           activity.
Alan Parkinson, a quality mark assessor, attests that           engaging with the idea of curriculum making has `invariably' led to a           culture change in schools, affecting the quality of students' work and           teacher development (S8).
Ofsted's 2011 report says: "The best           geography seen was usually in schools which were participating in the           professional development programme offered through the Action Plan for           Geography, in specialist humanities schools where geography was one of           the lead subjects or where the school shared good practice with local           partner schools" (S6, p7).
Conceptual impact:     Subject specialists: Lambert's research has helped to guide       geography teachers to a deeper understanding of their subject.
He has       contested the trend for cross-curricular project work, as undermining       subject knowledge and the unique importance of geography to children's       development.
His thinking on `curriculum making' has helped to square the       circle in the debate over which is more important &#8212; curriculum content       (what is learned) or the way it is taught and learned (process).
Lambert's       Learning to Teach Geography (Routledge) is the UK's leading       geography ITE text, having sold 9,413 copies since 2000, including 2,290       abroad ("very strong international sales", according to the publisher,       particularly for a textbook designed for beginning teachers in England.
The impact of a Chinese translation, undertaken by Chongqing University       Press, cannot yet be quantified.
Wider professional engagement: Invitations to address       national education organisations have extended the reach of Lambert's       research beyond subject specialists.
The Prince's Teaching Institute now       includes geography in its summer schools programme following       representation by Lambert in 2008.
He is regularly invited to speak at       these events.
The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust also invited       Lambert to address 1,500 school leaders at its 2010 conference.
Throughout       the REF period Lambert has also led the national debate on geography       through journalism (e.g.S10) and many radio appearances.
Overseas influence: Since 2008 Lambert has been invited to       give keynotes to geography teachers' conferences across the Far East,       including in Singapore, Vietnam, China and Japan, in Australia and for the       Herodot European geography teacher education network.
Lambert's writings       are cited in Australia's National Curriculum documents (e.g.
S9).
