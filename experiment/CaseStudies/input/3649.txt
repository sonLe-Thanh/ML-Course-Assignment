     Following directly from the outputs of the fundamental research programme       above, a generic version of the EP sensor system was showcased at a       `Position Sensitive Detectors in Physics' meeting organised by the       Research Instrumentation Special Interest Group (RSIG), held in London in       May 2010.
The event was intended to facilitate interaction between the       high-energy physics, security and medical sectors.
As a direct result of       this, a dialogue with Plessey Semiconductors began which culminated in an       exclusive manufacturing licence, signed in December 2010.
By September       2011, the first integrated-circuit version of the sensor had been       successfully implemented by Plessey and was ready for designing into       products.
A second sales licence was agreed with Plessey in June 2012.
The       technology is now being marketed as the Electric Potential Integrated       Circuit (EPIC) sensor [see Section 5, C1].
The main impact of this sensor technology to date has been on Plessey       Semiconductors [C1].
Following a restructuring of the company, two new       technologies were acquired from UK universities, with the specific aim of       transforming the company from a foundry manufacturer of semiconductor       components to a product-oriented company focused around two major product       lines.
EP sensor technology from Sussex is one of these two and has had a       significant impact on both the shape and the direction of the company.
Plessey has made a major investment and commitment to EP sensors.
The       current levels of investment within Plessey stand at &#163;x, with x employees       dedicated full-time to the technology, in applications support, sales and       marketing, and development through funded collaborative programmes.
Revenue to the University of Sussex from the licences is a mixture of       licence fees (&#163;x for 11/12), patent costs and royalty payments, which       started in 2013.
Royalties are based on sales of &#163;x for 2012 and projected       sales of &#163;x for 2013 and &#163;x for 2014.
In addition to this overt commercialisation of the technology, work has       been carried out in conjunction with the Research and Enterprise Division       and the Innovation Centre (SInC) at Sussex, with funding from the       Enterprise Panel (University of Sussex) and the South East Health       Technologies Alliance (SEHTA) to develop awareness of the technology in       the wider community.
EP sensors have been judged to be disruptive in a       number of market sectors, by both a multi-national company [C10] and       independent consultants [C11].
There was therefore a perceived need to       engage with and educate the market and potential users about the       capabilities of this new disruptive technology.
Necessarily, due to the       generic nature of the sensors, this involved a diverse range of       institutions and companies across a broad spectrum of market sectors.
The       model used for this engagement process was to issue evaluation licences to       organisations for a 12-month period with a small fee to cover costs and       the requirement of a confidential written report at the termination of the       licence.
The funding enabled a batch of pre-production prototypes to be       manufactured by a local SME (Interface2 Ltd, Newhaven) [C2], for       distribution under these evaluation licences to interested commercial       organisations (from multi-nationals to SMEs, both within the UK and       outside) and to potential partners (including universities, government       laboratories and organisations).
To date the University has placed 20       evaluation licences and has direct involvement with collaborative projects       across all market sectors, including healthcare, sports, security[C4],       safety, aerospace [C3], automotive and geophysics [C6].
In partnership with a number of commercial organisations,       proof-of-concept designs were developed spanning electrophysiological       measurement, with Plessey funding 3 postdoctoral positions at Sussex;       Rescon Ltd, two DARPA contracts &#8212; &#163;150k; a multi-partner EU grant with       Philips Healthcare and Plessey (2012-16, &gt;&#163;20m); surface-charge density       imaging, including forensic fingerprinting, in collaboration with the Home       Office/CAST [C4]; movement sensing, MOD funded, 2009-10, &#163;98k; aerospace       instrumentation, TSB-funded project `Novel Electric Field Sensors for       Advanced Aero-Engine Monitoring' with Meggitt Sensing Systems [C3] and       Plessey Semiconductors [C1], 2012-14, total &#163;1.1m, &#163;524k industry; and       geophysical and structural health monitoring with British Geological       Survey, Keyworth [C5].
The additional impact directly resulting from this engagement activity       is:            Interface2, a local SME, is now the main sub-contractor for a much         larger organisation, Plessey, with responsibility for building the EPIC         chip into a variety of products [C1] for them.
The evaluation licensees are in direct contact with Plessey either as         customers or as potential customers for Plessey products.
Market sectors identified by evaluation licences form the major market         sectors for Plessey (Automotive, Sports, Healthcare).
The pre-production prototype design was adopted directly by Plessey as         their first commercial demonstration unit and manufactured by         Interface2.
One postgraduate student was funded by and seconded to Plessey as a         postdoc.
x Plessey employees work directly on EPIC-related projects and         products.
EP sensor technology has received external recognition for both the research     contribution and the commercialisation activity, including awards at     international trade fairs and product reviews:            EPSRC, Basic Technology Review Panel Report [C6] (2010)       RCUK, `Big Ideas for the Future' [C6] (2011)       IET Innovation Award 2011, `Measurement in Action' [C7]       Gold award at `Best of Sensors Expo 2011' [C8]       EDN `Hot 100 products' list [C9] (2011): `The most innovative and         significant products and technologies as selected by the editors',         250,000 website viewings per month       Finalist for Times Higher Innovation Award 2011       Shortlisted for Army Research Office award 2012       (2008) Nature Research Highlights 454(21): 920 (Impact Factor         36.101, estimated readership of 424,000) doi:10.1038/454920b.

It is clear that this is       an activity with the potential to grow both in magnitude and in the       diversity of its applications.
