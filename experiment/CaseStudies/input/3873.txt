     Impact from 2008 is part of a continuum which commenced at the time of       the publication of TSU       late in 2006.
The means by which the research has been promoted and       contributes to public       understanding of the Union issue from an historical perspective was in       part the result of the       reviews outlined above.
Publication of TSU resulted in a host of       invited public lectures in the UK       as well as overseas between 2006 and 2008 (e.g.
Jill Mackenzie Memorial       Lecture, University of       Guelph, Canada; British Studies Centre, University of Oslo; Haldane       Lecture, University of       Leicester; University of Edinburgh, and at leading cultural institutions       such as the National       Galleries of Scotland and the National Museum of Scotland), there were       numerous media       appearances (e.g.
BBC2 Newsnight), which brought the work to the attention       of the general public.
[See section 5 (3) and 5 (6)]     The paperback or `trade' edition of TSU has continued to sell       since its publication in 2006 (second       edition 2007), mainly in the UK but also Canada and the USA.TSU       sold more copies than any       other book via History Scotland's website between 2006 and 2010.
[See section 5 (4) and (5)] A       new, revised and extended edition, commissioned to contribute to the       current debate on Scotland's       future in the UK, has been prepared for publication (early 2014, as TSU:         Then and Now).
Between       end-September 2007 and April 2013 Patrick gave a series of public talks at       local history societies,       Rotary and Probus clubs (a total of at least 14, to a combined audience of       700) on the Union.
He       communicated with a wider TV audience through his participation in the       BBC's `Scotland's Clans'       series (BBC 2, 2 November 2009; BBC 1, 20 February 2012).
Further evidence       of how the       research has informed and illuminated understanding beyond Dundee is that       the paper `The Issues       Facing Scotland in 1707' (see 3 above), prepared for a symposium on the       Union in May 2007       hosted by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland's leading learned       academy was until early in       2012 the Scottish Historical Review's most downloaded paper from       Edinburgh University Press's       journals website.
Nicoll (Observer, above), commented that he       couldn't imagine `how a historian       could make more impact into a debate of such crucial importance to the       future of Scotland and the       United Kingdom' (5 August 2013).
[See section 5 (2) and (6)]     With the forthcoming referendum, a new round of invitations to       participate in public discussion has       begun, e.g.
`Liberty, Fairness and Ideas of Justice' symposium, the focus       of which was Scotland in       the Union (Scottish Parliament, November 2011).
In January 2012 Whatley       led discussion at a       private meeting of Scottish politicians (from the Scottish, UK and       European Parliaments) on       legitimate approaches to the Union of 1707 in 2014.
That the research has       generated impact       beyond Scotland is indicated by invitations to Whatley to contribute to UK       discussion forums on       Union-related issues (e.g.
mixed audience symposium, `What Good is the       Union', Christ Church,       Oxford, February 2013); recent media appearances include the Jeremy Vine       Show (BBC Radio 2,       25 January 2012), and Michael Goldfarb's BBC Radio 4 programme &#8212; The       F-Word, A History of       Federalism (27 August 2012), where the British union was discussed as a       model for European       relations now and in the future.
The Scotsman (27 November 2012)       published a centre-page article       by Whatley (`Battle for hearts and minds') that argued, on the basis of       historical comparison &#8212; with       1706-7 - that the current pro-Union campaign should create a more positive       case for their position.
Internationally, interest in Scotland's past and future within the UK is       growing.
An in-depth interview       Whatley gave to the Catalan journalist Inigo Gurruchaga for El Correo       was picked up and       published (18 October 2012) in at least three other Spanish news       publications including,       Laverdad.es, Lavozdigital.es and La Rioja.
A       similar interview, explaining the Scottish referendum       in historical context appeared in Greece's best selling Sunday broadsheet       To Vima (22 October).
Whatley chairs the University of Dundee's Five Million Questions project,       established in January       2013, a platform designed to better inform the public (including young       voters) by lectures, debates,       symposia, publications, and blogs about referendum-related issues       (http://www.fivemillionquestions.org),       with several public engagement events stemming from this       (e.g.
Understanding the Independence Referendum, U3A, Perth, 3 June 2013).
A lasting legacy of the research is the extensive database compiled as       part of the project on the       Union, of commissioners (MPs) to the Scottish Parliament 1689-1707,       showing their       constituencies, and voting behaviour on the Union divisions.
This is now       held in perpetuity by the       National Records of Scotland (item reference number GD1/1414/1-2), in       Edinburgh.
Recognising       the significance of the book the NRS Conservation team re-bound and       customised a copy of it, for       long-term preservation.
TSU is now cited as a matter of course by historians of       Scotland/Britain (e.g.
Devine/Wormald,       eds, Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History, 2012), but also       by commentators and scholars       in other disciplines (e.g.
I McLean et al, eds, Scotland's Choices,       EUP, 2013).
TSU is also on       undergraduate reading lists at virtually every university where the Union       of 1707 is taught either as       a topic in its own right or as part of courses that deal with longer       periods in Scottish (and British)       history &#8212; and politics.
Whatley's work is drawn upon and quoted from in       the materials for school       pupils studying for the Scottish Qualifications Authority Higher History       paper (extracts from the       work formed examination questions in 2010, 2011 and 2012).
Source       materials deriving from the       Union project &#8212; secondary and primary &#8212; are available online on the       Education Scotland (ES)       website (for the Treaty of Union, 1689-1740 topic), and for which Patrick       was an academic adviser.
The impact of the research on young people studying history in Scotland by       providing an       academically robust counterpoint to Jacobite-informed readings of Scottish       history is underpinned       by Whatley's contribution in 2007 to the Scottish Association of History       Teachers' History Teaching         Review Yearbook &#8212; a well-used reference tool &#8212; and again in 2012,       when he wrote on the related       subject of the Whigs and their influence in Scotland in the later       seventeenth century and beyond.
