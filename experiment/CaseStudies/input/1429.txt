     The research led by Mascie-Taylor, and the pilot projects assessing the       effectiveness of different interventions (both in the short and long       term), have had direct impact on a number of organisations who support       public health in Bangladesh, including the Government of Bangladesh (GoB),       the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.
The research has       led to the development and implementation of new policy and public         health interventions, and this has in turn improved the health         and well-being of Bangladeshi poor.
The research was disseminated through a one-day conference in 1997       attended by key personnel from the World Bank, WHO, the Ministry of Health       and Family Welfare (GoB) and the Directorate General of Health Services       (GoB) as well as through a detailed report (a).
The report was       submitted to The World Bank/WHO in 1997 and it included recommendations       based on the research findings.
Numerous further research papers jointly       authored with representatives from the WHO and members of the GOB's public       health implementing organisations (such as IPHN/ IEDCR) followed.
Subsequently, most of the recommendations have since been accepted by GoB       as an essential feature of their intestinal parasite control measures.
For example, a recommendation of Mascie-Taylor's 1997 report was to give       a single annual dose of 400 mg of albendazole to all vulnerable children       as well as all school-aged children a) (see p.36: 7.3 `Yearly         single dose mass treatment with albendazole should be given to all         eligible children and all family members during the National         Immunization Day and/o in conjunction with the semi-annual Vitamin A         capsule distribution.
All school children should also be encouraged to         receive albendazole at the same delivery point during National         Immunizsation Days (NIDs) ....' Between 2008 and 2013, a campaign       based on this recommendation led to a WHO and UNICEF supported initiative       `Vitamin A Plus and Deworming Campaign' rolled out to over 100 million       children aged 12-59 months of age.
(b)     A second recommendation from the research following further health       economic analysis (NMT 2003, ref 1 in section 2) was to run an education       campaign promoting simple health messages (including washing hands with       soap after defecation, wearing shoes and nail trimming) at the time of       chemotherapy.
The following statement at the end of this research paper, `As         a result of this research, the Government of Bangladesh has proposed         that simple messages on the importance of hand washing before food         preparation, regular nail trimming and wearing of shoes should be given         at the time of mass chemotherapy as part of its health service delivery         strategy.'
makes it clear that this research has had a direct       influence on the Government of Bangladesh's approach to public health and       indeed, this has resulted in a new public health programme.
This recommendation was initially taken forward by the setting up of a Global         Hand Washing Day initiative which was organised by the Global Public       Private Partnership on Hand Washing in October 2008.
In that year more       than 14.4 million Bangladeshi children from nearly 73,000 schools joined       in this event, pledging to promote hand washing with soap after using the       toilet and before eating.
(c)     This impact has been sustained in subsequent years; each October up to 18       million school children (about 50% of all school aged children in       Bangladesh) participate in an annual event, with discussions and       demonstrations about using soap.
In addition, messages are sent to Imams       of the Islamic Foundation and journalists of the Press Clubs, and (via       SMS) to 10,000 Community Hygiene Promoters through UNICEF.
SMS messages       are also sent to the general public through mobile companies at the       request of Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and       Cooperatives.
A third recommendation of the report was for an annual mass drug       administration (MDA) using two drugs in Filariasis-endemic areas of       Bangladesh using either DEC or ivermectin and albendazole).
(see p.36;         7.4 `Yearly single dose mass treatment with ivermectin and albendazole         should be given to all the population in all filariasis endemic areas         for at least three years ...') (a).
The two-drug       strategy for the control of Filariasis commenced in the northern districts       of Bangladesh in 2008; by 2010, all twelve districts which had a       prevalence of Filariasis above 10% had completed 6 MDAs with a coverage of       between 79%-86% of the total population of the districts (estimated to be       27 million).
Following this, microfilaremia prevalence has fallen from       about 15% to under 1%.
