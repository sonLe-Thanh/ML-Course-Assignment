     Process from research to impact:       The VRShips, VIRTUE and SAFEDOR projects had a combined and general theme       of integrating       advanced information technology into the collaborative design of ships.
The projects were       industrially driven, with responsibility for applying the VIP being held       by eleven associated maritime       consultancies (detailed below).
The VRShips project demonstrated that the       VIP concept was viable       for supporting European shipbuilding by focussing on capturing industrial       requirements and needs,       and prototyping the initial platform.
The focus within VIRTUE and SAFEDOR       was a fundamental       shift in product data management to satisfy the identified industrial       challenges and needs, and       implement the VIP in industry.
This industrially driven implementation       ensured that the partners       had the responsibility to deliver the case study demonstrations; had       first-hand use of the VIP within       their organisations; applied the VIP to their own problems; and were       driven to exploit the       opportunities that the VIP provided within the context of the case studies       and also within further       use within their organisation.
These organisations were, therefore,       adopting the research output       (the VIP), adapting their ways of working by integrating their design and       analysis tools into the VIP,       and subsequently improving the way they operate.
The success of the VIP       development and more       importantly, the industrially-driven implementation is highlighted within       the VIRTUE final project       review relating to the VIP: "The Reviewers are pleased that excellent         progress has been made and         many user requirements set up during the project have been included,         hence demonstrating large         functionality which is indicated through the large number of test cases         which have been provided         and shown by the partners"; Source A.
Types of Impact: The VIP has been applied within the VIRTUE,       SAFEDOR and EuroVIP projects       by world-leading European ship design, engineering and project management       consultancies, that       undertake projects on an international scale including: Arsenal       (Portugal), Atkins (UK), ECN       (France), Friendship Systems (Germany), HSVA (Germany), Insean (Italy),       MARIN (Netherlands),       Principia (France), Sirehna (France), SSPA (Sweden), and ZIB (Germany).
Collaborative       applications have included (and were led by): wave resistance studies       (Scott Gatchell, HSVA),       hydrofoil design and optimisation (Christine de Jou&#235;tte, Principia),       propeller design (Scott Gatchell,       HSVA), sea-keeping (Christine de Jou&#235;tte, Principia), hull/propeller       interaction (Francesco       Salvatore, Insean), and hull shape optimisation (Christophe Malibat,       Atkins).
Through this industrial       implementation of Strathclyde's VIP, the enhancements to engineering       design practice are       exemplified through implementation in HSVA and MARIN.
HSVA is a privately       owned service and       consultancy company with 21 shareholders, 90 employees, based in Hamburg       Germany with       customers worldwide.
HSVA specialises in testing technology, methods,       standardisation and       numerical procedures to solve complex problems, and has a turnover of       &#8364;10-12M, 56% of which is       international.
MARIN is an international leading provider of hydrodynamic       and nautical research       and development, based in Wageningen, The Netherlands, employing 350       people with an annual       turnover of &#8364;42M of which 85% is realised by commercial projects for the       international maritime       industry.
Marin provides innovative design solutions and advanced research       to a wide range of       international customers.
The implementation of the VIP has had the       following beneficial impact:       Improved efficiency: the VIP allows designers greater opportunity       to focus upon design and       analysis activities rather than the management of the process.
Traditional       integration approaches       using technologies such as the Common Object Request Brokerage       Architecture were not end-       user oriented having a steep learning curve, were complex and hard to use       correctly, and resulted       in long development times and high defect rates (Henning, Source G).
The       Strathclyde platform       delivered time savings with the same quality of delivery as other       approaches to meet customer       requirements, as exemplified by the comments from MARIN's R&amp;D Manager:            "It took only three hours for a first-time user to be familiar with           the platform, build up the           process and finish configuration.
Overall, designers in MARIN were           positive about the           applicability of the VIP in the future CFD computations"; Source         B.
"Time efficiency was significant.
Automation of the workflow and           data flow [within the VIP]           resulted in the run time of the process being reduced from six to two           days, which was a 67%           time reduction"; Source B.
Improved productivity: the platform supports both manual and     automated design and analysis     activity to be coordinated in a distributed manner with a view to best     exploit the resources     available.
Productivity improvements are exemplified by comments from HSVA     and MARIN:            "Allowing the process to run autonomously overnight could evaluate           hundreds of design           variations over a multiple parameter search field.
Additionally, less           time was required from the           "expert user", especially for the in-between steps, where little           decision-making was required";         Source C. "This automation resulted with fifteen hours [per day] of           achievement or progress           that would otherwise be wasted if the design was performed manually";         Source C.       "The VIP users found it especially useful to automatically produce           analysis reports following           each analysis.
It saved time for the designers by avoiding composing           such reports, hence           enabling them to focus on more design related tasks"; Source B.
"The           time saved           automatically producing reports was in the region of hours for each           report created"; Source B.         MARIN would typically create over 1000 reports each year resulting in a         minimum annual         saving of 2000 hours effort.
Improved working practice: the platform provided data and process       integration that saved       manual effort and ensured data consistency and integrity as reported by       HSVA and MARIN:            "The VIP facilitated the improvement of legacy tools as a direct           result of integrating the tool           into the platform, which shows that the VIP can also be used for           testing CFD/design tools           being developed.
The tools were expanded to include more           interoperability options for input           and output formats, in some cases for more adherence to a common data           format.
The VIP           provided automation that eliminated the need for the user to manually           input certain values";         Source C.       "The VIP guaranteed data consistency across resistance,           manoeuvring, and sea keeping           calculation of the hull.
Moreover, by storing the correct           configuration of the tools used in this           project in the platform, errors caused by human carelessness were           eliminated"; Source B.
"The likelihood of inconsistent data is very low due to project           management practices, however           the consequence is significant and can cost in the region &#8364;100k,           easily outnumbering the costs           of investing within such a platform"; Source B.
Enhanced knowledge reuse: HSVA has reported that through use of       the VIP valuable specialist       designer time is released to focus on more value-added activities:            "By saving and reusing configuration files, the "know how"           knowledge of expertise was           captured and reused by non-specialist users.
The VIP enabled error           free enactment for non-specialist           users to enact a process that previously could only be done by           specialists"; Source         C.       "The specialist's expertise is only required at the end for a final           evaluation to approve the           outputs, and to provide assistance in resolving unusual results; this           frees up the specialist to           focus on suitable and meaningful work"; Source C.          Wider adoption: The successes and advances that have been achieved       through these projects       led to the creation of the EU FP7 funded EuroVIP project which uses the       VIP to exploit new       developments, by partnering and collaboration throughout the European       maritime sector.
The       focus is to broaden the reach of implementation for the VIP and promote       collaboration which has       now resulted in 64 European wide registered users including seven       associations, the latter       providing a conduit to over 1500 companies across Europe.
The University       of Strathclyde is also       currently in discussion with Astrium Space Transportation (Source D) who       have identified the VIP       as being a promising technology for the Next Generation Launcher,       demonstrating the generic       applicability of the platform.
A preliminary technology plan is being       prepared to allow Astrium to       lobby their partners in the adoption of the VIP, and open up       implementation within an equally       challenging sector.
