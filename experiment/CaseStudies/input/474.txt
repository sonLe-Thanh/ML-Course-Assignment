     The research has extended the understanding of the emerging issues and       helped inform national debate and public discourse.
The research formed       part of the evidence within the cross-party Parliamentary Inquiry into the       current state of online child protection.
Eight key recommendations to       enhance child safety on line were produced as part of this Enquiry       including better support for internet safety education and initiatives.
Following on from this, the Prime Minister appointed Claire Perry MP as       his special advisor on preventing sexualisation and commercialisation of       childhood.
One of the areas will be improving education for parents and       children about safety and technology.
Prof. Phippen has advised Claire       Perry MP on the research findings as part of her role.
All of the research studies have received wide interest from the media       and have impacted upon debate and understanding outside of academia.
Coverage in the UK has been in The Guardian, Daily Telegraph       and Independent while international coverage has also been       extensive.
The research on behalf of BBC Current Affairs resulted in the       documentary "Websex: Where's the Harm", which was broadcast on BBC3 in       January 2012.
The research has impacted on schools, particularly those that have taken       part in the research studies or subsequently contacted Prof. Phippen for       advice and support.
The research has provided a foundation for       practitioners to develop lessons and teaching resources around sexting       that aim to reduce the incidence of risky behaviours.
The research       findings have been used by the Child Online Exploitation Unit to develop a       film called `Exposed' along with teaching resources for use in schools.
These are freely available on their website and are suitable for young       people, schools and parents to use.
Several schools have reviewed their approach to technology and safety,       some have changed their PSHE curriculum while others have introduced new       processes of support including a peer mentoring programme.
As the Head at       Worle Community School, Somerset stated "Our work with Andy last year         allowed us to better understand the issues our pupils face around         sexting and also early exposure to sexualised content.
We are in the         process of developing a peer mentoring programme so that trained older         pupils will be able to support younger pupils."
Following on from       this the Headteacher of Plymouth High School for Girls outlined the main       impact being the development of knowledge and the inclusion of that within       the PSHE curriculum "Working with Andy has helped better understand the         motivations for sexting and also the wider issues around access to         inappropriate content.
By working with a member of staff who delivers         this aspect of our PSHE programme, Andy has provided professional         development for her so that she is better able to address the issues in         school.
As a result of this we are looking at more effectively         integrating these into the PSHE curriculum"     The research has impacted upon national policy via Ofsted Inspector       briefings.
The UK Safer Internet Centre, an organisation co-funded by the       European Commission and bringing together a partnership of three leading       organisations, Childnet International, the South West Grid for Learning       and the Internet Watch Foundation, has used the research in their recent       work with OFSTED namely in the provision of briefings for school       inspectors.
In the briefing for Ofsted Inspectors (Inspecting e-safety       2013), the research from Phippen is referenced and of the five sample       questions for school leadership, three come from Phippen's research.
As stated by the Director of the UK Safer Internet Centre "the         research Professor Phippen does with us provides a strong evidence base         to inform our strategy, policy and practice around online safety         nationally and increasingly internationally.
For example the annual         reports published describing UK and international school online safety         practice discloses staff training is consistently the weakest aspect of         a schools online safety provision directly informed ours (and others)         focus for supporting schools.
Further examples relate to our recent work         with OFSTED - the new evaluation framework specifically refer to online         safety and Andy's research was used to evidence issues in the associated         briefing notes we provide for inspectors."
