     The work by York researchers changed conservation mind-sets,         strategies and practice.
Traditional conservation concentrated on the protection and management of       individual sites,       despite continued degradation taking place elsewhere.
York metapopulation       research showed that       populations generally require networks of habitat patches to persist and       spread, and hence       stimulated a paradigm shift permeating NGOs, governmental agencies and       intergovernmental       bodies, whereby the 20th century `isolated population'       conceptual framework for conservation has       largely been replaced by landscape-scale thinking and policies.
These aim       to maintain and restore       habitat networks and connections to ensure the long-term survival of       species in landscapes where       habitats are fragmented.
Reaching and collaborating with stakeholders.
York researchers       reached a broad audience by       extensive dissemination through the media, individual discussions,       correspondence and       workshops.
Thomas and Hill gave &gt;200 oral presentations and contributed       to &gt;25 meetings with       NGOs, agencies and governmental bodies since 2008.
They pioneered       co-working with       stakeholders, for example developing the UKPopNet programme (2004-2010)       that was co-funded       by English Nature and NERC (Fitter was Director).
Thomas and Hill       co-ordinated a NERC-funded       Knowledge Exchange grant (2010-11) involving Defra, Natural England,       Scottish Natural Heritage,       Countryside Council for Wales (CCW, now Natural Resources Wales, NRW),       Joint Nature       Conservation Committee, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB),       Butterfly Conservation       (BC), Botanical Society for the British Isles, British Trust for       Ornithology, Centre for Ecology &amp;       Hydrology, and Forest Research.
This and other projects resulted in       multiple York-Government-NGO       co-authored articles (e.g.
Thomas et al.
2012) and lectures,       influencing participant       organisations and their membership.
Impacts on NGO policy and practice in the UK.
UK conservation NGOs       have developed       landscape-scale programmes to meet the challenges that the York research       identified, e.g.
:             Butterfly Conservation's Landscape Target Areas (BC 2012) were         directly inspired by         Thomas and Hill's underpinning research: "Prof Thomas' research on           the impact of habitat           fragmentation and the functioning of metapopulations has been a strong           driving force in the           development of Butterfly Conservation's landscape scale approach to           the conservation of           threatened species", according to BC's Chief Executive, Martin         Warren.
BC Target Areas cover         &gt;5 million ha (&gt;20% UK land), including locations identified by         York Zonation analyses.
BC         helps manage ~300,000 ha, where BC staff and "13,000 active           volunteers contributing over           &#163;9.5 million worth of labour during the financial year 2010/11"         work with local communities,         NGOs and government bodies to deliver landscape-scale conservation.
BC's         (2012) report on         the scheme's outstanding success was launched by Biodiversity Minister         Richard Benyon         (House of Commons, 04/12/12; Thomas an invitee).
Metapopulation         principles developed by         York researchers were used to establish new habitats within species'         colonisation distances,         leading to the following increases by threatened species: 55% increase         in area occupied by the         Heath Fritillary in Kent (2008-11), 395% increase in Duke of Burgundy         abundance in a         Yorkshire metapopulation (1999-2011), up to 167% more colonies of four         Lepidoptera in         Warwickshire (2008-11), 1000% increase in Marsh Fritillary in a managed         metapopulation on         Dartmoor (2005-10), and 200% increase in Pearl-bordered Fritillary         population size in the Wyre         Forest (2008-11; BC 2012).
"The success we have recorded with this           approach is undoubtedly           because it is rooted in the sound science produced by Prof Thomas and           his team" according to         Warren, and "Prof Hill's research ... has been equally influential,           helping us understand ... why           some species have been constrained by lack of connected habitats ...           justifying our efforts to           link up habitats in the landscape..."        Invertebrate conservation NGO Buglife developed `B-lines' to         connect landscapes; to create         and restore 150,000 ha of flower-rich habitat across Britain through         community and NGO         activities, with implementation started in Yorkshire and Humber.
The "main           principles and           guidelines of the B-lines approach developed in consultation with           Jenny Hodgson [York PDRA]         and Chris Thomas [of the] University of York" (Evans         2012).
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds invited Thomas to         provide the scientific basis         underpinning its Futurescapes programme at its Westminster         launch (Keynote, 07/06/10).
Futurescapes aims to connect fragmented landscapes and is funded by the         EU-Life Nature         programme to "encourage the development and implementation of           landscape-scale           conservation... in 34 priority areas across the UK [which] cover...           2.18 million ha".
The scientific         rationale influenced a change in NGO practice, whereby ~1,300 RSPB staff         and ~18,000         volunteers work with landowners and other stakeholders to improve         wildlife and societal         appreciation of the countryside in Futurescape projects across 9% of the         UK.
The Wildlife Trusts (47 UK County Wildlife Trusts) have           developed over 100 Living           Landscapes, covering 1.5 million hectares (6% of UK land surface),         explicitly in response to the         problem of habitat isolation in fragmented UK landscapes &#8212; identified         most clearly for UK         landscapes by the York authors; the Scottish Wildlife Trust, for         example, citing Moilanen et al.
(2005) as evidence that "a patchwork of habitats [will] increase           functionality through...           enhancing metapopulations" (Hughes &amp; Brooks 2009).
Policy reviews, government policies and land designation in the UK.
Our underpinning       science has been central to national policy developments:            York research featured prominently in the two major reviews of         conservation and environmental         management in Britain.
Fitter was a co-author and Thomas provided         evidence to Defra's           Lawton Review (Lawton et al.
2010) on the future of         conservation.
According to Sir John         Lawton, the "York research was critical to [my] 2010           government-commissioned review for           Defra... which has more citations to Thomas and Hill than to any other           ecologists upon whose           work we draw".
York work is also quoted extensively in the National           Ecosystem Assessment         (NEA), where Thomas, Hill and Fitter-authored work is cited in 16         separate NEA chapters.
The Lawton and NEA Reviews, and hence York research, provided the         evidence base for the         Natural Environment White Paper (Defra 2011), establishing the         government conservation         strategy.
The Secretary of State's speech to launch the White Paper         repeated the Lawton         conclusion that "we need more, bigger, better, joined up"         conservation; itself a conclusion that         directly stems from our work.
The White Paper initiated Nature Improvement Areas (NIAs) to         deliver landscape-scale         conservation, as suggested by Lawton et al.
(2010), drawing on         York work.
A national NIA         competition took place, involving 76 bidding landscapes.
Thomas has         provided advice to         representatives of four (South Downs, Purbeck, North Devon, Morecambe         Bay) of the 12         successful bids.
According to Lawton, by "a chain of events (original           research with seminal           contributions from York, establishment of scientific consensus, my           government-commissioned           review, government policy development, co-ordination of the Nature           Improvement Area           competition by the government agency Natural England, and awards of           NIA status to a dozen           landscapes), new management strategies for biodiversity have been           achieved over large areas           of some of the most important parts of the English landscape for           biodiversity, and created some           remarkable consortia of people from all walks of life to make it           happen."
The consortium         members include farmers, other land-owners, councils, businesses,         utility companies,         Environment Agency, conservation NGOs, and other citizens.
NIAs generated new conservation strategies for hundreds of           thousands of hectares         (Natural England 2012), leveraged over &#163;40m of additional funds, and         generated over 3000         additional volunteer days in the first 9 months alone, according         to Chris De Grouchy of Defra         (27/3/13).
Conservation management changes are achieved in priority         landscapes by Defra-funded         Higher Level Stewardship (200,000 ha in 2012/13, 400,000 ha in 2013/14),         Landfill Tax         and EU (Life); over &#163;1 billion pa is spent to maintain and         improve rural environments at farm         and landscape scales (Nat Eng ~&#163;650m; Scot Govt ~&#163;500m; Welsh Govt         ~&#163;240m).
Comparable projects are taking place in Wales and Scotland (e.g.
CCW/NRW established the         first designated metapopulation-scale Site of Special Scientific         Interest, in response to our work         on the Marsh Fritillary butterfly in Wales).
Landscape-scale           conservation now covers around           25% of land in Britain, with at least 800 active projects of 10 km2or         larger (Dr N Macgregor,         Nat Eng, 27/03/13).
Impacts on international policies and conservation actions.
International impact has been       achieved by the published scientific literature reaching an international       audience (&gt;5000 citations),       helping to develop a globally-distributed pool of experts who have       influenced NGOs and       governments participating in the development of global biodiversity       strategies and treaties.
The       Pan-European Ecological Network, International Union for the Conservation       of Nature red-listing       criteria, World Wildlife Fund landscape-scale projects in &gt;50       countries, Conservation International       of `biodiversity hotspots', and US-based Nature Conservancy `threatened       areas' all address habitat       fragmentation issues; drawing on York-influenced metapopulation and       spatial ecology as a       component of the scientific justification.
For example:     The Zonation approach, co-developed by Moilanen in Helsinki and       York, has been used to         develop practical conservation applications in at least six countries,       using metapopulation       principles.
Tom Lovejoy, formerly Chief Biodiversity Adviser to the       President of the World Bank and       Senior Adviser to the President of the United Nations Foundation, notes       that the software has been       applied directly to practical conservation: "in Finland (forest         conservation) ... for northern spotted         owls in the USA, in Australia (Victoria State [and] around         Melbourne), [and] in New Zealand (river         conservation priorities ... marine priority areas ...).
Professor Thomas         and colleagues have         produced the most detailed conservation prioritisation analysis for any         tropical biodiversity hotspot         ever-for Madagascar.
Not a textbook example, this has actually been         implemented by extending         the protected area system by over 4 million hectares" (in       conjunction with additional information;       Atlas Team 2009).
These locations will safeguard animal and plant species       in one of most       evolutionarily distinct (~80% endemic) and threatened biodiversity       hotspots on Earth.
