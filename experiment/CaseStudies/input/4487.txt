     Gray's research has been disseminated widely through professional and       public policy outlets as well as conventional academic channels, with a       view to influencing a transatlantic community of defence professionals.
The curricula of staff colleges, military academies, and similar       institutions have been shaped by a major textbook, co-edited by Gray with       John Baylis and James Wirtz, Strategy in the Contemporary World       (2002; updated editions in 2007, 2010, 2013).
Similar influence has been       exerted by a collection co-edited by Gray &#8212; The Practice of Strategy:         From Alexander the Great to the President (2010) &#8212; which was       praised, for example, by Sir Richard Shirreff, the Deputy Supreme Allied       Commander Europe, as `a clear-thinking analysis which is both timely and       relevant and I commend it to decision maker and general reader alike.'
Although the consistent intention has been to serve professional needs by       informing enriching and framing professional debates, Gray's entertaining       and informal style has been accessible to general readers.
Another         Bloody Century: Future Warfare is an important academic statement,       but it was deliberately published through a non-academic publisher to make       its standpoint available to a much wider public.
Similarly, the five       monographs commissioned by the Strategic Studies Institute are available       free of charge in hard copy and online.
Important statements have been       placed in the most widely read of the more specialised security journals:       the RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) Journal, PRISM       (published online by the National Defense University) and Parameters       (published online by the US Army War College).
These statements have also       affected a wider audience.
For example, Gray's critique of COIN       (counterinsurgency) in PRISM sparked a debate in June 2012 on the       influential blogsite of the Pulitzer Prize winner and defence expert       Thomas E. Ricks, The Best Defense, in the course of which Ricks       incidentally noted that 'Gray also made me think I should go back and read       Thucydides again.'
In the course of the 2008-2013 period, this wide dissemination has had       impact in three ways.
First, the research has influenced civilian         policymakers.
In the UK, both the Labour Government and the incoming       Coalition Government appointed Gray to advisory bodies.
To assist the UK's       2010-11 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the government requested       him to participate on the Defence Advisory Forum on the Defence Green       Paper Adaptability and Partnership: Issues for the Strategic Defence         Review (2010).
Moreover, in an important policy speech delivered at       the National Defence University in September 2008, the long-serving US       Secretary of Defence Robert M. Gates invoked the research on the       inadequacies of artificial categories such as 'irregular warfare', and the       need for a holistic strategic vision.
In 2012, Republican presidential       candidate Mitt Romney appointed Gray to his Counter-Proliferation Working       Group.
In a speech on British maritime security in 2012, Minister for the       Armed Forces Sir Nick Harvey cited Gray's arguments about the practical       orientation of strategic theory.
Secondly, the research has informed and structured debates among         military leaders in all three of the UK Armed Services, so much so       that the service chiefs routinely refer to Gray',s thinking.
In his 2011       autobiography, former Chief of the General Staff Sir Richard Dannatt       quoted Gray's Another Bloody Century in making the case for       redesigning British armed forces away from episodic discrete wars and       towards a state of continuous campaign readiness.
The Royal Air Force has       invited Gray to be Director of Air Power Studies, while, the Chief of the       Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, quoted Gray in his Lord       Trenchard Memorial Lecture in 2009 on the role of the RAF as a mobile       force of power projection.
Above all, however, the research is central to       the self-understanding of the Navy: Gray's view of its role and importance       has demonstrably informed the personal attitudes of naval leaders as       evidenced by the way that they articulate its function.
Unusually for a       doctrinal statement, Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP)0-10 British         Maritime Doctrine actually quotes Gray twice.
The epigraph to the       Navy's online `Fact Sheet' is Gray's well-known remark that `the greatest       value of the Navy will be found in events that fail to occur.'
The former       First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, made       use of Gray's words to conclude his Remembrance Day Address of 2011 to the       Henry Jackson Society.
Thirdly, the research has affected the attitudes and practices of an         international community of defence professionals, especially when       adapting to new problems.
The Dean of Academics of the US Army War College       wrote to Gray in 2009 that his monograph Schools for Strategy       'could not have come at a more propitious time', and recommended it to his       staff to inform the 'epistemological debate on how to teach strategy.'
Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper reported that Gray's critique of the       RMA concept influenced him and fellow admirers, who 'would return to       Gray's writings often as they argued against the purported visionaries'       technically focused plans for the future force.'
In 2013, US Strategic       Command requested his advice on the value of Dual Capable aircraft for       NATO.
More recently (August 2013), US Army Special Operations Command       requested advice while noting that `your work has naturally informed our       discussions here' on the subject of a proposed `operational concept for       space.'
Perhaps the most sensitive index of the reach and depth of the       research's service to the international defence community community is its       extensive presence not just on the syllabus of mainstream professional       training, but also on more informal reading lists through which       non-academics have revealed the works they have found practically useful.
Thus UK Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards included The         Strategy Bridge (2010) on his list of recommended books and articles       for officers.
When The Diplomatic Courier, a global       diplomatic-affairs magazine, included The Strategy Bridge on its       2012 reading list, it noted that Gray was `by far the most selected       writer' recommended by its panel of advisers.
As such remarks suggest, Gray's work has characteristics that make it       very attractive to reflective security experts; no academic strategist of       comparably global reputation is found so readily usable by serving       officers.
But in spite of his large following among professionals, Gray's       primary aim is not to offer technical advice, but to locate and frame       debates correctly.
The impact that is claimed for the research is not, for       example, that the US operational concept for space will adopt some       detailed practical recommendations directly traceable to Gray himself, but       that the initial discussions that took place were, as a matter of course,       informed by Airpower for strategic effect (2010) and allied       writings.
As an academic who straddles the worlds of strategic studies and       of military planning, Gray has delimited a field of study, defended its       integrity and coherence, especially in its relation to advanced       professional training, and shaped the self-understanding of its       practitioners.
