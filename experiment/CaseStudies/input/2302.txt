     SASI's research has had significant impacts on: public understanding of       inequality; policy debate and policy making; and secondary school       education.
Enhancing public understanding of inequality     The Chief Executive of the Geographical Association describes Dorling as       "one of the few academic geographers who is both willing and able to         channel the outcomes of his research into the public debate.
Through his         regular appearances in the national media, Danny is seen to advance the         public standing of the subject and share some of the unique insights         which human geography can bring to debates about inequality, welfare and         population change" [S1].
The Worldmapper website presents over 700 engaging cartograms       which visualise a wide range of global inequalities and has become a       powerful platform to stimulate, engage and inform the public.
It has       received international press coverage from TIME magazine, the New York         Times, Washington Post, Rheinische Post and Der Spiegel.
The       website has received &gt;174 million hits since its launch in January 2007       and continues to receive around 2m additional hits per month.
This       engagement is truly international including 75m hits from the USA, 21m       from the UK, 50m from Europe, 11m from Asia, 4m from Australasia and 1.3m       from Africa [S2].
Its ability to challenge conventional thinking and to       help people understand inequality more effectively is confirmed by Anna       Barford's PhD research with teachers in the UK, Kenya and Mexico who       described how Worldmapper visualisations helped their students       understand inequalities.
Dorling is a regular contributor to public debate through frequent       television and radio appearances as well as regular newspaper articles and       public talks.
In 2010 Dorling contributed to the BBC's Maps: Power,         Plunder and Possession television programme discussing cartograms       from the Worldmapper project on topics such as HIV/AIDS and global       income inequality.
The programme received 300,000 live viewings and a       further 72,000 on BBC Player [S3].
In 2011 he featured on Andrew Marr's This         is Britain television programme discussing variations in UK health       and life expectancy.
The programme reached 1.83 million viewers live and a       further 16,000 on iPlayer [S3].
Since 2003 Dorling has written &gt;70 articles in the Guardian,         Observer, Times, Independent and New Statesman and has been       referred to in &gt;300 further newspaper articles[S4].
He is       an associate writer for the New Statesman and the Guardian       newspaper maintains his research profile permanently online.
Dorling's       books are accessible to academic and public audiences alike: his books       with Policy Press alone have sold [text removed for publication] copies       with Injustice selling [text removed for publication] copies [S5].
The Atlas of the Real World won the Geographical Association's 2009       Gold Award for best publication due to its engaging cartograms and       accompanying commentaries depicting different dimensions of modern global       inequality and has been translated into seven languages.
Dorling is also committed to reaching non-academic audiences directly and       since 2003 has given around 500 talks (an average of roughly one per week       for an entire decade) in schools, pubs, cinemas, bookshops, demonstrations       and festivals, at The British Library, Women's Institutes and political       meetings.
Reflecting on Dorling's `Crazy Maps' talk and animated film       presentation at Sheffield's Festival of the Mind, the Chief Executive of       the Geographical Association commented that "once again, [Dorling's]         willingness to adapt research findings for public interest and         consumption was exemplary" [S1].
Engaging the public with his research on inequality in these ways,       Dorling has been described as a "geographer extraordinaire" (Crossbench       Member of the House of Lords), "our leading human geographer" (President       of the RSA) and "geography's Brian Cox" (teachsecondary website).
In April       2010 he was the subject of a Guardian newspaper feature (`In       praise of Danny Dorling') which described him as "that rare university       professor: expert, politically engaged and able to explain simply why his       subject matters".
Influencing local and national policy debate and policy making     At the local policy level, SASI was commissioned by a Sheffield Member of       Parliament to analyse social inequality in Sheffield and to consider       linkages between inequality and wellbeing across the city.
The research       generated a debate in the local media and within Sheffield City Council       that led to tackling inequality becoming a strategic priority for the       council and to the establishment of its Sheffield Fairness Commission to       achieve this aim.
Describing the importance of Dorling's work, a local MP       confirms that the Fairness Commission "arose as a direct result of a         Tale of Two Cities" providing the momentum to galvanise change and,       indeed, the Fairness Commission's 2013 strategy document cites the Tale         of Two Cities report as a key part of its evidence base to tackling       inequality in the city [S6].
Dorling also provided expert oral evidence       around health and wealth inequalities to the Fairness Commission and he       was influential in shaping and guiding its recommendations and the       resulting policy priorities of Sheffield City Council.
The Policy and       Improvement Officer at Sheffield City Council states that as a direct       result of Dorling's evidence and recommendations the council have: (i)       established an explicit commitment to tackling health inequalities in the       city and have established the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy to       achieve this; (ii) have established a commitment to a 20mph speed limit as       the default position for residential areas and have begun rolling this       policy out across the city; (iii) introduced a Living Wage for the staff       it directly employs and with a commitment to extend this to Trusts and       contractors in order to show substantial progress by 2015 [S7].
The Policy       and Improvement Officer of Sheffield City Council concludes that: "There         is a clear impact from this evidence with a direct read across from the         evidence Professor Dorling presented to the Commission on health         inequalities; child road traffic casualties and the living wage through         to the aims and recommendations made by the Commission in its report."
[S7]     At the national level SASI's work has achieved significant impacts on the       development of national policy on child poverty.
A Local Delivery Team       Leader of the Department for Education's Child Poverty Unit confirms that       "Danny's work &#8212; in particular his Injustice book &#8212; helped Child Poverty         Unit officials to frame the child poverty debate in the context of         broader measures and indicators of inequality.
This broad-based approach         to understanding the causes and consequences of child poverty         became central to the Coalition Government's approach to tackling child         poverty" [S8].
Equally influential, in research commissioned by the       BBC (&#163;37k), SASI's analysis of widening geographical inequalities and       segregation across England over the past 40 years was one of only six       citations within the Conservative Party's Big Society, Not Big         Government strategy document (page 3).
In recognition of this work, Dorling won the Royal Geographical Society       (RGS) Back Award in 2009 for his `contributions to public policy'.
Improving teaching and learning in secondary schools     The Geographical Association (GA) describes Worldmapper as a "challenging         and thought provoking resource for teachers and a striking way for         students to take a different view of the world".
One south London       secondary school teacher confirms this view, reporting that Worldmapper       is a "fantastic visual aid...that makes [students] ask questions and be         more critical.
For me this is a vital skill that is not taught enough in         schools currently...When I have used it much discussion is generated         about what the map shows, how it shows it and what the distribution of         the data means to us.
It is a great resource for starting such         discussion and then leading onto more focussed aspects of a topic.
I use         the poverty map a lot with my U6th for their conflicts module and it         really starts to challenge the kids' assumptions" [S9].
Dorling has written about Worldmapper for the GA's Teaching         Geography magazine (read by several thousand secondary school       teachers).
The GA itself regularly uses Worldmapper in its       publications such as the GCSE Toolkit on uneven development as well as in       their student events and teacher workshops.
Indeed, the GA have created       resource packs and lesson plans to support teachers in using Worldmapper       and made these freely available from their website.
Further web links and       teaching resources can also be found on the UK's teachsecondary website       and on the US Library of Congress website.
The impact of these visualisations on teaching and learning led Dorling       to receive the Geographical Association's Excellence in Leading Geography       award in 2007 and 2013 as well as their Gold Award in 2009 for `materials       that make a significant contribution to geographical education and       professional development'.
