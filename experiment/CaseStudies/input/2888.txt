Context       Cervical screening has been based on cytology (`cervical smear') for over       50 years.
Its principal       strength is its specificity in detecting precancerous cells, but its       sensitivity is thought to be in the       range of 50-80%.
Testing for human papillomavirus, the cause of cervical       cancer, is more sensitive       whether in population screening or testing for residual disease following       treatment.
The hypothesis       behind these studies was that HPV negative women are at very low risk,       whereas further       investigation can be concentrated on HPV positive women who are at risk of       developing cervical       neoplasia.
Pathway to Impact       The robustness of the findings of these studies was critical to the       decisions made by the Advisory       Committee for Cervical Screening who make recommendations to Ministers on       changes to the       Cervical Screening Programme.
Reach and Significance of the Impact       The results of these studies have fed directly into NHS policy in the       following ways:            The ARTISTIC Trial directly influenced the decision to establish a         large HPV primary screening         pilot study which began in the second quarter of 2013.
The notes of the         UK National Screening         Committee (UK NSC) meeting held on 25 April 2012 demonstrate that         ARTISTIC informed the         Committee's decision-making: `Members were asked about the         cost-effectiveness of HPV         TaPS [Testing as Primary Screening].
[Committee member] said the         ARTISTIC trial had looked         at both clinical and cost effectiveness but further modelling would be         needed as part of the         feasibility study.
The UK NSC agreed that there is enough evidence to         suggest that HPV TaPS         would be cost and clinically effective.
It was agreed that the UK NSC         should consult on a         recommendation to approve HPV as a primary screen for cervical cancer         and that the         feasibility study should explore implementation issues including length         of time before a re-screen         following a HPV negative result.'
(S1, p. 7)       The MAVARIC Trial directly influenced the decision not to adopt         automated reading of cervical         cytology in England, because it was less sensitive than manual reading         (S2).
The `No further         review' facility of the BD Systems was shown to be reliable and its use         endorsed by the         Advisory Committee for Cervical Screening (S3).
The international reach         of this study is         exemplified by the findings having been accepted by the Health Council         of the Netherlands,         who have rejected automated screening (S4).
The favourable results of the test of cure study (6) directly         influenced the decision to initiate         HPV test of cure as standard in the cervical screening programme in         England.
Kitchener has contributed significantly to the Cervical Screening       Programme in other ways.
He       chairs the Department of Health Advisory Committee for Cervical Screening,       which advises       Government on the direction of the Programme.
He also chaired the Steering       Group of the pilot       studies of HPV triage and test of cure, both of which are being rolled out       nationally in 2011/12.
He       now chairs the Steering Group for the HPV primary screening pilot studies,       which have received       National Screening Committee and Ministerial approval and commenced in the       English Screening       Programme in the second quarter of 2013.
