     Preserving, Conserving, and Presenting Cultural Heritage     The most substantial impact of research by North, Kember,       Hanson, and Plunkett has been to use digital technology to       preserve and disseminate moving-image history to a large virtual,       international audience.
Items digitised through ADAM and CHARTER were       chosen by the above academics; the pioneering e-heritage features       developed in conjunction with Hanson particularly aided       user-accessibility.
The BDM website receives external annual hits of       177,279 (2008), 171,042 (2009), 128,279 (2010), 129,650 (2011), and 98,876       (2012) (5.1).
From Jan-Sep 2013, the EVE catalogue alone received       43,223 page visits, while from 1 April-31 May 2012, the `Young BDM'       section accounted for 18,681 out of 24,577 page requests, evidence of the       museum's digital outreach to a juvenile audience.
The impact of the BDM's       digitisation initiatives is supplemented by North's blog, `Spectacular       Attractions', discussing film technology and history.
Launched on 11 Sep       2008, it received 1,050,000 hits to 31 Aug 2012, with a global       distribution (5.2).
Plunkett and the BDM also collaborated on a       short film produced by the British Film Institute, `Dickens and the Magic       Lantern', which is available on the BFI's website and YouTube (14,229       views) (5.3).
Mack's OUP edition of the original Sweeney Todd story is another       aspect of Exeter's work in preserving and presenting cultural heritage to       encourage public appreciation of the links between Victorian popular       culture and the contemporary film.
Coinciding with the release of Tim       Burton's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007),       the importance of Mack's edition in providing historical context for the       film was proclaimed by the Los Angeles Times, among other media       outlets (5.4).
Mack also made numerous media appearances including       `Newsnight Review' (BBC2; 17/1/2008), `Open Book' (Radio 4; 20/11/2007),       and `The Robert Elms Show' (BBC London; 5/2/2008).
Major coverage included       feature pieces in the Daily Express, The Big Issue, The Big Issue         Scotland, Guardian Review: Arts, and Guardian Unlimited, as       well as week-long `blogger' postings on the OUP website and the website       for Powell's Bookstore, a major American retailer (5.5).
Engaging different publics in literary and cultural heritage     The virtual Impact of the BDM is augmented by its programme of on-site       activities, which facilitates connections between the academy and regional       community, and increases public access to the collection through temporary       exhibitions, organised tours and events such as Family Fun days.
In 2009,       the BDM was given Accreditation status by the Museums, Libraries and       Archives Council as a mark of its `commitment to managing collections       effectively for the enjoyment of our communities'.
The findings of         Plunkett and Kember's AHRC project were subsequently       disseminated through an exhibition that toured public libraries across the       South West of England in 2011.
Consisting of items drawn from the BDM,       exhibitions were hosted by the BDM (Nov 2010-May 2011); City of Bristol       Reference Library (4 Jan-14 Feb); Torquay Library (18-30 July);       Weston-Super-Mare Library (15 Oct-11 Nov); Barnstaple Library (1-30 Oct       2011); Sidmouth Library (8-20 August); Redruth Library (14-25 Nov).
Combined visitor numbers were 31,446 (5.6).
An online exhibition       was presented on the BBC Devon website (5.7).
Findings were also       featured by BBC Radio Devon and Western Morning News.
Qualitative       evidence of the BDM's national importance is supported through citations       from film and museum professionals (5.8).
Hanson, North, Kember, and Plunkett's       research also underpinned the museum's production of a Visitor's Education       pack in 2009 for teachers, demonstrating how museum activities can be used       to teach the national curriculum.
It was distributed to all schools in       Exeter, and is freely available via the BDM website.
Their research also       contributed to updating the physical galleries, encouraging on-site tours,       lectures and workshops, attended by schools and local groups.
These have       included Early Years workshops for a number of local schools as well as       Rotary Club, Age Concern, Movies Memories Group, Tunstall Special Needs       Group, and Devon Youth Service.
Visitor numbers to galleries/outreach       events from Jan 2008-30 March 2013 was 13,082 (5.9).
Contributing to economic prosperity via the creative sector     Exeter's research in Victorian popular culture and the moving-image has       also contributed to prosperity for the creative sector via publishing.
To       September 2012, Mack's edition of Sweeney Todd had sold       88,845 copies.
In 2011, the BDM entered into a partnership with the       publisher, Adam Matthew, to market a digital archive `Moving Pictures,       Optical Entertainments and the Advent of Cinema', consisting of 35,000       images of BDM items.
Plunkett was Academic Editor, responsible for       overseeing image selection.
Published in November 2012, it has created       further international dissemination of the collection.
Publisher's gross       income from this digital package is &#163;368,370 at July 2013 (5.10).
