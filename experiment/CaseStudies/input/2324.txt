     In 2011, The Sunday Times Magazine published an article titled 'I         want to be lighter.
She wants to be darker' (27 November 2011),       thereby reaching a potential readership of over 2.5 million nationally.
The article was also made available online, and remains accessible on the       internet to the present day (http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/Features/article824391.ece).
This article focussed on Dr Dodd's findings, emphasising that whilst young       people are knowledgeable about the risk of tanning and the link between UV       rays and cancer, they still prioritise tanning over any adverse future       appearance or health consequences.
The research findings were then discussed as a current affairs item on       BBC London Radio 94.9 (28 November 2011).
BBC London Radio had listener       figures of 474,000 in late 2011 (http://www.mediauk.com).
Such media coverage at both regional and national levels will have led to       an increase in awareness amongst the general population of the risks of       tanning, with a consequent impact upon attitudes and hopefully tanning       behaviour.
Dr Lorna Dodd has since gone on to develop the first UK based       appearance-based intervention.
In addition, Dr Dodd presented this research as part of a presentation at       Primary Care and Public Health 2013, Birmingham (Dodd, L. &amp; Forshaw,       M.J. "Indoor Tanning and Young Adults &#8212; How to Change Behaviour and       Prevent Skin Cancer").
This is the UK's leading event for GPs,       commissioning groups and all healthcare professionals working in primary       and community care.
130 people registered to attend the presentation given       by Dr Dodd.
As a result, the findings of the research have reached both       the general public and a professional audience of GPs and allied       healthcare professionals.
Findings from this project were also presented at the following       conferences:     Appearance Matters, 5th Conference, July 2012, Bristol (Dodd,       L., Bergin, K., Blackwell Young, J.
&amp; Hogan, K. The impact of an         appearance-based workbook intervention on young adult's indoor tanning         intention).
Division of Health Psychology Conference, 14-16 September 2011,       Southampton University (Dodd, L., Forshaw, M. &amp; Williams, S. Utility         of an extended theory of planned behaviour model for understanding         indoor tanning within UK young adults).
British Psychological Society Annual Conference, 14-16 April 2010,       Stratford-upon-Avon (Dodd, L. &amp; Forshaw, M. Preventing skin         cancer: A systematic review of appearance focused interventions).
