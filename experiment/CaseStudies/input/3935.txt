     The research described above has had immediate impact on the clinical       outcomes of over 420 patients who have undergone DBS in the UCL Functional       Neurosurgery Unit since November 2002.
As a result of the success of the       procedure, the number of referrals is increasing year on year.
During the       period January 2008 to July 2013, 243 new DBS implantation procedures were       performed with a year-on-year increase in number.
(By the end of 2013, 98       new procedures will have been performed compared with 68 in 2012, 46 in       2011 and 43 in 2010) [a].
The benefits for patients of our improved surgical techniques are       considerable.
We have demonstrated that we can improve the underlying       severity of PD using DBS by ~55%, with accompanying improvements in       quality of life (equal to any other series in the world), while the risks       associated with the surgery at our centre are lower than those seen       anywhere worldwide.
Indeed, in our ongoing audit of adverse events, we       have not detected a single symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage in       comparison with symptomatic haemorrhage rates of 2% worldwide [b].
Compared to traditional methods, we have achieved a low rate of adverse       events through the use of an image-guided and image-verified surgical       methodology that provides the ability to accurately and precisely place       electrodes with the use of a single brain penetration.
Reduced haemorrhage       rates translate to reduced patient disability, paralysis or death.
In our       centre, 97% of electrodes are placed with a single brain penetration.
This       approach has the additional advantage that the whole procedure can be       performed under general anaesthesia which is far better tolerated by       patients.
Furthermore, we can now avoid stimulation-induced speech       disturbance through better placing of electrodes.
An independent expert in       the field described our work as "a new benchmark for all centres         involved in PD surgery" [c].
Our excellent safety record with DBS for PD has provided the reassurance       and confidence necessary to embark on pioneering clinical trials using DBS       as an experimental treatment for other disabling conditions, in which the       potential benefits of the surgery are less certain and therefore the known       risks of the operation must be minimised.
Following initial success and       publication of treating five patients [d], we have recruited a       further 10 patients to date, to a double blind crossover trial of DBS for       severe, treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome [e].
We have also       recruited and operated on two patients in an MRC-funded double blind       crossover trial of DBS for severe treatment-refractory Obsessive       Compulsive Disorder and a single patient to a Brain Research Trust-funded       double blind crossover trial of DBS for Parkinson's disease dementia [f],       all of which are led by our team and continue recruitment in our Unit.
Further testimony to the impact that DBS performed in our Unit has on       patients can be seen in a number of media features on our work:            In May 2013, an episode of Keeping Britain Alive: The NHS in a Day         on BBC2 featured two patients undergoing DBS in our hospital [g].
In December 2011, Sky News featured a woman who was treated with DBS         for the symptoms of Tourette syndrome.
The patient stated that "It is           absolutely amazing.
I do not feel I am the same person.
I have had           three years of getting worse.
Now I have got my life back" [h].
The website of the Brain Research Trust features the story of one of         our patients, a 62 year old woman with a genetic form of dystonia         (DYT-1).
She describes the results of the surgery as follows: "the           improvement I feel in my walking is beyond my wildest expectations:           it's actually 95%" [i].
The clinical activity of our Unit and academic output has attracted a       large number of visitors from around the UK and overseas.
The       neurosurgical techniques, patient selection process and post-operative       management pathways developed through our research have been used for the       instruction of over 75 visiting neurosurgeons, neurologists and clinical       trainees over 2009-13.
The research-evidenced standard of care in place at       NHNN has disseminated to multiple other centres throughout the world       including European centres (Groningen and the Karolinska Institute), and       in the United states (Atlanta and UCLA) where the local functional       neurosurgical teams have changed their surgical approach following visits       to, or publications by our Unit [j].
Furthermore, attendance in       our Unit with instruction in patient selection, surgical procedure and DBS       programming techniques have enabled colleagues from Sweden and Portugal to       perform surgery and publish their own results of DBS for patients with       Tourette syndrome [k].
