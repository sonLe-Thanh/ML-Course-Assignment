     Process from research to impact:     After collating an extensive amount of materials documenting the literary       and historical significance       of the 1962 International Writers' Conference, Drs Bell and Bartie had the       idea of marking the 50th       anniversary of the conference in 2012 as a means of revisiting its       cultural, historical and intellectual       significance.
As the 1962 conference was foundational for what we now know       as the Edinburgh       International Book Festival (EIBF), Drs Bell and Bartie contacted the       Director of EIBF in 2010 with       the idea of two 50th anniversary events.
EIBF embraced this idea with       enthusiasm and invited Bell       and Bartie to become academic advisors to the project.
Over a substantial number of meetings with the Director of EIBF, and       various members of his team       during 2010-2012, the initial idea for two commemorative sessions grew       significantly larger.
In July       2011, EIBF made clear to Drs Bell and Bartie, in confidence, their       ambitious plans to conceptually       re-echo the original conference and hold the event over five days, making       it the central strand of       the book festival that year in Edinburgh, and internationally if further       funding followed.
With input       from Bell and Bartie, EIBF then made an application to the Scottish       Government's EXPO fund; this       was successful and the funding was matched by the British Council       (financial details below).
Together, the EIBF and British Council embarked on staging a global       conference, visiting fifteen       countries over a one year period (August 2012-August 2013) with the aim of       creating an historic       picture of the role of literature today.
Generating and Informing a World Writers' Conference: Without the       research of Bell and       Bartie, the Edinburgh World Writers' Conference (EWWC) 2012-2013 would not       have been       conceived.
At the opening address of EWWC 2012-2013 in Edinburgh (August       2012) Director of       EIBF, Nick Barley, acknowledged to the 550 audience members the impact of       the research of Bell       and Bartie, stating that `the British Council and the Book Festival are         indebted to the work of two         academics at Strathclyde University, Angela Bartie and Eleanor Bell, who         have advised us along         the way and who even have gave us the spark of inspiration for         organizing another conference fifty         years after the first.'

In June 2013, Nick Barley wrote to Bell and Bartie stating that `I         have never forgotten the fact that         the original idea arose out of your [Drs Bartie and Bell's] infectious         enthusiasm and your profound         belief in the importance of 1962...
There has been an unceasing buzz         around the conference as it         has toured around the world...
There is a huge mine of ideas and         evidence being gathered, which         will surely offer rich pickings for historians of the future.
The         thoughtfulness and insight of two         academics at the University of Strathclyde have been a key component in         making this possible.'

Bell and Bartie's research continued to inform EWWC 2012-2013       deeply throughout.
Their specially prepared synoptic history of the 1962 conference was       distributed to 50 Edinburgh       participant writers and was also used in Cape Town delegate packs.
This       information was also       printed in the Edinburgh conference brochure, which was circulated to 3000       Edinburgh       International Book Festival audience members [Source 5].
Creative and Political Impacts on Writers and Wider Society: As of       4 July 2013, 262       international writers have participated in 13 editions of the Edinburgh       World Writers' Conference in       the following countries around the world: Scotland, Canada, Germany, South       Africa, Russia, India,       China, Congo, Belgium, France, Portugal, Turkey, Trinidad/Tobago, and       Malaysia.
Commenting on       this, Nick Barley has stated that: `Some of the most memorable moments         so far have been in         Congo-Brazzaville, in Beijing and in St Malo, where authors earnestly         discussed the role of the         novel in 21st-century society through the lens of their own         political and geographical contexts.
Henri         Lopes discussing the need for a `national' literature to help articulate         a post-colonial Congo;         Scottish writer Sophie Cooke having her Beijing event halted by Chinese         authorities when she         mentioned Liu Xiaobo; Bosnian novelist Velibor Colic talking emotionally         in St Malo about his         defection from the Bosnian army in 1992, and the appropriation of         literature by extremist         nationalists in his country... all of these have been key moments in an         extraordinary series of         conversations.'

During the debates on censorship on 21st August 2012 in       Edinburgh, the 50 EWWC writers were       shocked to hear about censorship laws in the education system in Arizona,       USA (House Bill 2281)       &#8212; they then issued a public statement against this bill [Source 7].
Also,       discussion amongst the 50       writers in a closed panel in Edinburgh led to the production of a       collaborative statement on writers'       rights and challenges in relation to copyright and ebook distribution       [Source 8]     Cultural Impacts on Media and Society: In the period 1 July 2012 -       24 June 2013, there had       been 33584 visits to the EWWC website from viewers in 166 different       countries.
The Edinburgh       World Writers' Conference has a current audience of 2123 actively engaged       followers across our       main social media channels.
At its highest points so far, the EWWC Twitter       hashtag       (#worldwritersconf) has had a reach of 439,698 accounts with 886,236       impressions, while the       EWWC Facebook posts regularly reach on average c.8000 accounts [Source 6].
As of the 4th July,       the Edinburgh World Writers' Conference had received 267 media mentions       across print, online,       radio and TV publications around the world [Source 6].
Also, 17 debates (5       from Edinburgh, 2 from       Berlin, 3 from Russia, 2 from Trinidad, 2 from Lisbon and 3 from Kuala       Lumpur) have been live-streamed on the Edinburgh World Writers Conference website.
Although some       countries have yet       to provide data, the following figures further substantiate the project's       reach:            The live-stream of the five Edinburgh sessions was watched from almost         900 unique         internet addresses in 68 countries.
161 viewers watched the live stream from Berlin.
The on-demand films         of the Berlin events         achieved just under 450 views in a month.
The Trinidad live-streams were watched by 159 viewers.

As a result of the conference sessions taking place in 15 countries       around the world, the EIBF       Director remarked that `my impression has been that every single one of         these events has         underlined Scotland's status as a major player in global literary         culture'.

Economic Impact of EWWC 2012-2013:     Drs Bell and Bartie helped input to the EIBF's application to the       Scottish Government Expo Fund in       November 2011, one of four funding bodies that successfully secured       &#163;260,000 for the EIBF.
The       project enabled the development of a major partnership between the EIBF       and the British Council       &#8212; the latter providing &#163;266,000 in match funding and &#163;34,000 of in-kind       support.
[Source 6]     Within EIBF, five jobs have been created as a result of the project: a       20-month freelance contract       for a Writers' Conference Coordinator, a 12-month freelance contract for a       Writers' Conference       Editor, two six-day contracts for Writers' Conference Assistants and a       five-day contract for a Social       Media Consultant.
A commission was also put out for an artist to produce a       piece of work in       response to EWWC 2012-13.
&#163;186,500 has been contributed to the EWWC       project by international       literary partners and long-term service contracts to support the project       (within the UK) include       Glocast, Four Coleman Getty and Tangent.
[Source 6]     Within the British Council, a 9 month contract for a 3 days a week       freelance project manager was       created, and a freelance web manager was contracted for 9 months for 2       days a week.
