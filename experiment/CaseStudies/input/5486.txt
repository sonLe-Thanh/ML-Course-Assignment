     Process from research to impact:       In November 2011, Hope was invited to give a paper at a conference held at       Shakespeare's Globe       Theatre, London, organised by Globe Research.
The presentation used       digital techniques to       explore the language of sensation and taste in Shakespeare's period.
Following it, Hope was       introduced to the producer of the Globe's free schools production of A         Midsummer Night's Dream       which was about to go into rehearsal.
The producer suggested that the       techniques Hope was       developing, and the findings emerging from his work with Witmore, would be       of use to the actors       during the process of rehearsing the play (Source 1).
Funded by the       Theatre, Hope subsequently       visited the Globe in January 2012 to speak to the company about the       language of A Midsummer         Night's Dream.
Hope employed the visualisation tools he and Witmore       had developed, as well as       other software packages, to identify particular features of the play's       language which a human       reading would not be able to spot.
Description of Impact:       The direct impact of Hope's work can be traced in two key ways.
It has       moved outside of academia       to have had an effect on (a) those involved in a production of A         Midsummer Night's Dream at the       Globe Theatre, London; and (b) the Globe Theatre's general practice as a       leading arts educator in       London and overseas.
The work has also had indirect impact on the       audiences of the Globe       Theatre production, which was performed for free to over 14,000 teachers       and students (Sources 4       and 6) from more than 120 schools from across all London boroughs (Source       7) between 27       February and 8 March 2012, with the play part of the National Curriculum       requirement for English       Literature.
Globe Theatre records show that 79% of the students watching       the play had never seen       Shakespeare performed before, that 57% had never previously seen a play at       any theatre, and that       92% said they'd like to see more Shakespeare having seen this production.
92% agreed that, after       seeing the play, they were `better prepared for classroom study' (Source       8).
Impact on the Globe Theatre Production of A Midsummer           Night's Dream:       The company of A Midsummer Night's Dream (11 actors, the director,       and the stage managers)       attended a talk given by Hope in January 2012.
Cast members were       interested in Hope's finding       that A Midsummer Night's Dream is concerned with concrete objects       and their descriptions.
It       prompted a consideration of the role of props in their production.
An       actor from this production       stated that, `although there is no real choice about how many props are         used [in the play], or how         they are used, the power or status afforded to the objects we used was         heightened' after hearing       Hope's talk (Source 2).
Hope's finding that the high frequency of language       associated with location       and the description of space prompted the cast to discuss the characters'       frequent lack of certainty       about their location in the dream-like space of the play.
The same actor       in a recorded interview       notes that `knowing there was an increased dynamism suggested in the         text freed our choices of         movement.
We were perhaps braver and bolder' (Source 5).
Hope's       finding that A Midsummer         Night's Dream showed a general decrease in language associated with       face-to-face interaction       made the actors consider the possibility that relationships in A         Midsummer Night's Dream are not       like those of other comedies (which are characterised by high levels of       verbal interactivity), and to       therefore perform them as `straight' roles.
For the producer of the       production, Hope's ideas formed       part of what he called the `tool-kit' available for all who were involved       in the rehearsals: it `helped         us in how we go about supporting and informing the play and play making'       (Source 5).
It enabled       the actors to feel they were engaged in a very innovative production: with       Hope's ideas, `language         feels more newly minted, more alive in the space' (Source 5).
Impact on the Globe Theatre:       The Globe's international status comes only in part from its world-leading       commercial productions       of plays by Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and new writers.
It is also       one of the most important       providers of arts education in the UK, offering workshops for school and       university students, and       other groups (in 2012 over 100,000 people attended these workshops), as       well as a free annual       schools production (Source 6).
It is thus a means by which many encounter       the theatre for the first       time, and it responds to requirements of the National Curriculum to aid in       and enhance students'       understanding of and pleasure in literary texts.
Success in this aspect of       their work is of undoubted       national cultural value.
It is also of financial value to the theatre as       well: in 2012 core income was       gained from its educational work, and 8% of its income (over &#163;1 million)       came from sources that       include its sponsors (Source 6).
While Hope's work with the company of A         Midsummer Night's         Dream cannot be linked directly to specific income, it is clear that       the reputation of the work done       by Globe Education is vital to The Globe Theatre's continuing success as a       commercial theatre       and in gaining financial support from sponsors.
Hope's on-going relationship with the company of A Midsummer Night's         Dream thus forms part of       the foundation that underpins the work of the organisation more generally.
In January 2013, he       was invited to work with the cast and crew of this year's Deutsche Bank       free schools production,       Romeo and Juliet.
Once again, he used digital tools to explore the       language of the play, and open       up possible rehearsal and performance practices.
In this play, for       example, analysis showed an       increased use of the word `love' &#8212; though in multiple, sometimes       contradictory meanings; an       avoidance of plural pronoun forms (very unusual in a tragedy); an increase       in exclamatory       language, suggesting emotional intensity; and, more than in any other play       by Shakespeare, a       focus on time and its passing, which links to a steady increase in       references to `death', as the play       shifts from comic romance to gathering tragedy.
As the Head of Courses and Research at the Globe Theatre, has written: `Hope's         research ... has         been an extraordinary resource for actors and directors at Shakespeare's         Globe', `There is no         question about the value of Professor Hope's research to actors,         directors and to audiences here         at Shakespeare's Globe' (Source 3).
As this ongoing relationship       develops, actors attest to the       ways they have changed their working practices: `since my first         encounter with Professor Hope's         work my own personal text work has changed to take in more technical         analyses of a play's         language...
Looking at language in As You Like It, for example, I was         drawn to creating a word         cloud (using a simple online tool as a vastly simpler model to Professor         Hope's research)...
This         led me to a new, and welcome, view of the character' (Source 2).
