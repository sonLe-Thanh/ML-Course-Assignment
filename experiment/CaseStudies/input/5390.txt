     deltaDOT Ltd was spun out of Imperial College London via Imperial       Innovations in 2000 and       consists of a team of scientists and engineers dedicated to the       advancement of analytical       techniques using patented methods and instrumentation in High Performance       Capillary       Electrophoresis (HPCE).
deltaDOT designs and produces HPCE instruments       which are marketed       worldwide.
The offices and laboratories are based in the London Bioscience       Innovation Centre       (LBIC) [A].
The average annual turnover of deltaDOT Ltd from 2008-2012 was       &#163;640.2k per annum,       with turnover sales consisting of "sales of instruments and from         service fees, contract research and         analytical work", with much of these sales representing exports [B].
The HPCE analytical instruments are designed, manufactured and marketed       by deltaDOT Ltd.
These instruments use deltaDOT's proprietary imaging and analysis       technology &#8212; LFII.
HPCE and       LFII applied to a Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) analytical system offers       dramatically improved       discovery power in comparison to other conventional CE systems.
HPCE is       applied in Life       Sciences research, drug testing, diagnostics and bio-pharmaceutical       manufacturing.
The       technology is used in detection, separation and analysis of proteins,       nucleic acids, carbohydrates,       viruses and bacteria, chemicals and a wide range of other analytes [A].
In       2012 deltaDOT Ltd       signed an agreement with the major distributor HORIBA UK for sales in the       UK and Eire [L].
HORIBA UK currently offers the HPCE-512 from deltaDOT Ltd [C].
deltaDOT has raised over $12M equity (e.g.
[D]) over the last 15 years.
It has been profitable since       2010, after a Buy-in Management Buy-Out led by Hassard and Nigel Stokes,       an Imperial alumnus.
The latest Annual Accounts submitted to Companies House for the year up to       31/12/2012 reported       'cash at bank' of &#163;257,601, 'net worth' of &#163;569,595 and 'assets' worth       &#163;808,027 [E].
All of the       revenues generated by deltaDOT Ltd are based on Imperial HEP research [B].
In addition to the specific cases outlined below, sales of LFII       instruments by deltaDOT Ltd have       been to various sectors and include (i) five global pharmaceutical       companies, (ii) a global analytical       company, (iii) a US diagnostic company, and (iv) UK and US universities       [B].
2009 saw the formation of the affiliate company, deltaDOT QSTP-LLC,       in Qatar.
The company       was launched as a joint venture between the Qatar Science and Technology       Park (QSTP) and       deltaDOT Ltd [F].
The company developed a 500-square-meter world class       proteomics research       and testing facility in Doha which was the Arab emirate's first such       facility [G].
QSTP invested $15       million in the project.
$5 million of that was an equity investment in       deltaDOT Ltd, which provided       staff, expert support and an exclusive regional licence to its technology.
The remaining $10M set       up the proteomics facility at QSTP [B, C, F].
Discussing the investment,       Dr Eulian Roberts,       Managing Director of QSTP, said: "We hope that this new venture will         result in ground breaking         findings in the field of Proteomics which will then find applications         locally and internationally.
The         establishment of deltaDOT QSTP-LLC also falls in line with the Qatar         National Vision 2030 which         is for Qatar to be an active centre in the fields of scientific research         and intellectual activity" [F].
Since its formation deltaDOT QSTP-LLC has generated revenues of $1.7M,       $3.5M, $3.7M and       $1.8M per annum for the years 2009-2012 respectively.
John Hassard has       been the CEO of       deltaDOT QSTP-LLC during that time.
In July 2012 deltaDOT Ltd sold its 20%       stake in deltaDOT       QSTP-LLC for circa &#163;550,000 [B].
As is the case with deltaDOT Ltd, all the       IP used by deltaDOT       QSTP-LLC is based on the research from the HEP group at Imperial College       [B].
A two-way IP       pipeline agreement exists between deltaDOT Ltd and deltaDOT QSTP-LLC [B].
Since 2008, examples of the use of the LFII system produced by deltaDOT       include:     Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)       deltaDot Ltd's LFII, in the form of the Peregrine HPCE system, was adopted       by the DARPA-funded       Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals (AMP) programme, and by the       Defense Threat       Reduction Agency's rapid vaccine programme [H, I].
The Peregrine was       adopted as a competing       analytical tool for one of the several Rapid Vaccine development       programmes under the aegis of       the AMP programme, working with a consortium which included Dow Chemicals       and Xcellerex.
Only "deltaDOTs analytical technology went through to the next stage"       [J].
The rapid vaccine       programme was established by the US Department of Health and Human       Services (HHS) to       enhance the nation's emergency preparedness against emerging infectious       diseases and       "deltaDOT's technology was adopted as one of the few non-US         contributors to the program" [J].
The LFII approach was praised for its "adaptability across a range of         targets" and for "allowing         rapid analysis of contaminants, protein post-translational         modifications, as well as allowing a highly         quantitate, unbiased, sensitive and reproducible analysis over a broad         dynamic range in both         molecular weight and concentration".
The AMP programme is "required         to generate 50 million         vaccine doses within 120 days of identifying a threat's genome" and       the "Quality Control provided         by the LFII approach is uniquely suited to this demanding task" [J].
In 2010, as part of this programme, "Xcellerex, Inc. and Pfenex Inc.         announced...that the         companies, along with deltaDOT Ltd. and BioPharm Services have         successfully demonstrated the         production of purified swine flu H1 hemagglutinin (California strain) in         42 days starting from the         amino acid sequence of the protein" [I].
During that period the       product quality was "shown to be         fully within the specifications set out by the Defense Threat Reduction         Agency (DTRA) under its         Accelerated Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals contract" with the       results of the programme       providing "valuable tools for biodefense and pandemic response" [I].
As       part of the programme       "analytical capability was supplied by deltaDOT" [I].
Caliber biotherapeutics       Over the past 3 years Caliber Biotherapeutics, a US-based a biotechnology       company with a       mission to develop and commercialize protein-based therapeutics that       improve outcomes for       patients with cancer and other diseases, has been using the deltaDOT Ltd       HPCE instrument       (HPCE-512).
It has been used in (i) reduced and native antibody analysis       as part of their antibody-biobetter       project and to be used in future antibody-conjugate projects, (ii)       Nicotine analysis at       picomolar levels, (iii) analysis of pesticides down to very low levels,       (iv) batch-to-batch analysis of       products, for demonstrate consistency.
As a result Caliber Biotherapeutics       is determined that       deltaDOT's technology is useful for providing "in-process" analytical         information that is useful for         bioprocessing" and as a result will be purchasing further deltaDOT       Ltd instruments for QA/QC use       in its manufacturing processes.
Calilber Biotherapeutics also praised the       reliability of product [K].
Oil &amp; Gas sector       Since 2010 LFII has been used for profiling in the oil and gas sector [J],       namely with Qatar       Petrolium and Total E&amp;P, where a programme to build real-time bespoke       oil-head tools is       underway, funded by Middle East and North Africa (MENA)-based O&amp;G       companies.
