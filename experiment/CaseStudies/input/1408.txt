     Impact 1 &amp; 2     Increased international collaboration between stakeholders and raised         international awareness: The research undertaken through the NDA       grant has raised the international profile of the need to detect and       prevent elder financial abuse by bringing it to the attention of a range       of professionals and organisations such as the Metropolitan Police, Elder       Law Centres, Care Homes and the professional groups involved in the       research.
This social impact has been achieved through 10+ publications,       30+ national and international presentations and events for organisations       such as, the Building Societies Association, the Care Homes Association,       the Social Care sector.
The charity, Action on Elder Abuse, have run a       number of elder financial abuse seminar series with the research team       between 2010 - 2012, to disseminate the findings to members.
Presentations       at conferences in Dublin and London as part of the World Elder Abuse       Awareness Day (June 2011) facilitated networking of academics studying       elder financial abuse.
The presentation in Dublin was webcast, leading to       further networking internationally.
Evidence is demonstrated through the following:            Operation Sterling from the Metropolitan Police approached the team in         2009 requesting to become involved as a partner in the financial elder         abuse project.
Following the completion of the training website they         have requested further research is undertaken to create an equivalent         training tool for the Police training.
Sterling's appreciation of our         work has led to an invitation to consult with the Scottish Business         Crime Centres (Scottish Government) "Protecting Vulnerable Adults from         Financial Harm" work stream group and with the trading standards         representative of the Dementia Friendly financial services sub group of         David Cameron's Dementia Challenge.
The linking of several international research groups and organisations         all of whom visited the team at Brunel University, e.g., the National         Centre for the Protection of Older People, University College Dublin;         the Elder Law Centre, Pennsylvania State University; and the (Canadian)         National Initiative for the Care of the Elderly, Toronto University and         Queensland Police, Australia.
The researchers also convened the first         meeting for the Metropolitan Police and HSBC so strategies could be         planned to prevent scam fraud.
Dr Creedon used the findings in his study commissioned by Wells Fargo         Bank in the US.
Pearson, Director, the Elder Law Centre, Pennsylvania State University         used the findings to inform her legal research on abuse and exploitation         &#8226; Dr Mulroy and Professor O'Neill focused on the research findings in         their BMJ editorial on elder abuse (BMJ 2011: 343: d6027)       Letters of support for a training tool received from stakeholders such         as Age UK, Alzheimer's Society, a GP surgery, Action on Elder Abuse.
Invited appearance on the Jeremy Vine BBC Radio 2 Programme in         December 2009 to share research findings on the `topical issue' of         financial elder abuse.
Impact 3     Enhanced decision making capacity within the health, social care and         finance professions:     The research impacts have also been achieved through the use of the       outputs designed and tested during the ESRC funded follow-on project.
The       resource outputs have been made freely available on-line from August 2012       for health, social care and banking professionals to use (see       www.elderfinancialabuse.co.uk).
The four components of the professional       training tools developed from the project posted on the web include:            Online decision training aids - These were used by 151 novice         professionals as part of a randomised controlled trial of efficacy.
A         positive effect on novices' decision-making capacity was demonstrated.
Podcasts - Enhanced podcasts have been developed which presented a         range of professionals giving their perspectives on elder financial         abuse case scenarios, and domain specific advice on effective cross         sector working.
These have been favourably received in dissemination         workshops.
Case scenarios of actual cases of financial elder abuse for use in         education and training- Developed from Phase I research findings.
These         are based on real case experiences of elder financial abuse encountered         by professionals working in the social care, health and banking sectors.
Seminar instruction packs - Providing professionals with targeted         advice about how to use the case scenarios in small group education and         training exercises.
Evidence is demonstrated through the following:            Twenty-six independent requests for access to the web training site         were made before the website was released including public sector         organisations, finance organisations as well as interested individuals.
The randomised control test that tested the effectiveness of the         decision training tool has shown a positive effect on decision making         capacity.
Training resources produced have been endorsed for member use by Age         UK, professional bodies such as the College of Occupational Therapists,         CIFFAS Fraud detection Agency and Building Society Association.
The number of individual users of the training website, which was made         openly accessible in August 2012, is now 1500+.
The training tools have been used in the health and social care sectors       to operationalise policies regarding practitioner development.
e.g.
Stirling University provided training via the `Professional Practitioner       Initiative' and in the Northeast, the social care sector utilized the       training tools for CPD as well as being used extensively by international       groups e.g.
Age Concern, New Zealand.
