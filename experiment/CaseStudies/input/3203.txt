     About 1,200 people are diagnosed with biliary tract cancer each year in       the UK and 12,000 in the US.
For the majority of patients, it is an       incurable cancer and before 2010 there was no established standard of       care; some patients had best supportive care, others single agent drugs.
Therefore, there was an urgent need to find effective treatments.
Our research showed that the doublet regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin       increases the median survival from 8.2 months (gemcitabine alone) to 11.7       months, i.e.
an extra 3.5 months of life on average.
This is equivalent to       reducing the chance of dying by 36%.
Importantly, the side effects/harm       associated with the doublet therapy were similar to the single agent.
This       improvement in patient outcomes led to revised international guidelines on       treating biliary tract cancer, recommending this doublet therapy as       routine care since 2011:            The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), following the first         presentation of the ABC02 results in 2011, stated that the trial "set a         new standard of care", and assigned it Level II evidence (`Evidence is         obtained from at least one well-designed experimental study') [a].
In 2012, the British Society of Gastroenterology recommended the         doublet therapy for advanced or metastatic unresectable         cholangiocarcinoma (with Grade A evidence) [b].
The United States NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended the         use of gemcitabine/cisplatin and assigned the trial as `Category 1         evidence' ("Based upon high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN         consensus that the intervention is appropriate") [c].
The recommendations have been endorsed by the International Liver Cancer       Association [d].
Subsequent national trials for biliary tract       cancer must now examine new treatments in addition to       gemcitabine/cisplatin [e].
The treatment is recommended on NHS       Choices [f], and by Macmillan [g] as standard chemotherapy       for biliary tract cancer.
In August 2013, we surveyed 43 key centres       treating biliary tract cancer, of whom 12 responded.
All of these had       adopted the new regime as standard of care, reporting improved survival       and a well-tolerated regime.
This amounted to over 230 patients treated [h].
The ABC02 trial data were used to examine cost-effectiveness by an       independent research group [i].
Total Quality Adjusted Life Years       (QALYs) for gemcitabine/cisplatin (0.751) was greater than for gemcitabine       alone (0.561), with total costs of $44,885 and $33,653 respectively.
Gemcitabine/cisplatin had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of       $59,480 per QALY gained, compared to gemcitabine alone.
The authors       concluded that the doublet therapy "is a cost-effective treatment       alternative to gemcitabine monotherapy by currently accepted standards of       willingness to pay".
