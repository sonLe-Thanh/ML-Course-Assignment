     LOCAL/NATIONAL IMPACT     The Shared Education Programme at Queen's encourages collaborative links       between schools so they can run shared classes involving pupils from       schools across the denominational divide, providing pupils with access to       a wider range of curriculum choice, promoting school improvement through       teacher engagement, and providing opportunities for sustained and enduring       contact with associated reconciliation benefits.
Currently in its second       phase, the SEP has facilitated the development of curricular-based         collaborations between 130 Catholic, Protestant and Integrated schools         in NI.
Around 16,000 pupils have participated and around 50 SEP         teachers/principals have undertaken professional development training         offered through the Programme.
(see 5:1 below for details) Most SEP       participants would have previously had limited or no opportunity for       school-based inter-group contact.
The main Protestant Churches in NI have since publically supported shared       education, citing the research and programme evidence from Queen's, and       the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) has encouraged its       schools to promote shared relationships with neighbouring Protestant       schools (see 5:2 below for video evidence of the impact of SEP         partnerships on teachers; pupils and the wider communities).
In 2008, the then Education Minister, initiated a review of the       Department of Education's (DE) Community Relations policy.
Hughes was       appointed to the review group and on the basis of research evidence she       presented on intergroup contact and SEP, a Community Relations policy,       published in 2010, contained a commitment to, `encouraging greater         sharing and collaboration across and between all educational settings on         a cross community basis'.
This policy impacts all children and         young people in Northern Ireland.
A Shared Education Learning Forum (SELF) was established in 2008.
The       forum, which comprises Gallagher, Hughes, other members of the research       team, administrators involved in the delivery of SEP at Queen's and       representatives from 2 other shared education initiatives in NI, plays a       major advocacy role.
The forum organised 2 conferences to disseminate       research and programme activity (see 5:3 below for a conference report) to       policy makers and practitioners.
Both conferences were opened by the       Minister for Education, and the first was attended by members of the       Education Committee.
At the second conference in December 2012, the         Minister in his opening speech pledged his support for shared education.
SELF has also has engaged directly with all the main political parties in       NI to provide information on research findings and programme activity (see       5:4 for details of knowledge transfer seminar held by NI Assembly).
The       research and programme work at Queen's has informed a number of debates in       the NI assembly, and Gallagher was invited to provide evidence on shared       education to the NI Education Committee.
As a consequence of this         engagement, four of the five main parties included a commitment to         support shared education in their manifestos for the 2011 NI Assembly         election.
After the election a commitment that every pupil         should have some experience of shared education by 2015 was included in         the Programme for Government and a Ministerial Advisory Group (MAG) on         Shared Education was established (see 5:5 below for letter to       corroborate the influence of SEP and research on policy developments).
The MAG reported in May 2013, and drawing extensively on the research       evidence (5:6 p. 41-69) and interviews with key stakeholders, many of whom       are participants in Queen's SEP, the report makes 17 recommendations         which support the mainstreaming of shared education in NI to ensure that         it is placed at the `heart of education policy and practice'       (ibid , p.111) through, inter alia,       amendment to the Education Bill to place a statutory duty on the       Department of Education and the new Education and Skills Authority (ESA)       to encourage and facilitate shared education, revision of the common       funding formula to include a `shared education premium'; a change in       legislation to place a statutory duty on schools to comply with Section 75       of the NI Act, and support for teachers in the delivery of shared       education (ibid, p.112-124).
Since 2010, a Public Relations firm has been employed to monitor the       corpus of media stories on shared education; maintain oversight on       questions, debates and discussions on shared education in the NI Assembly,       and in the media; and support an SEP presence at the annual party       political conferences.
There are now numerous local media references         to the shared education programme at Queen's and associated research,         including appearances by Gallagher and Hughes on local TV and radio.
A record of media reports can be accessed via Stratagem (5:7).
The national         and international media have also reported on SEP and research (egs       5:8).
As a consequence of the success of the SEP at Queen's and accumulating       research evidence, the International Fund for Ireland recast a major part       of its philanthropic support towards a wider range of educational       activities, all based on the shared education approach.
In 2010, IFI       allocated &#163;17.5m to a Sharing in Education Programme (SiEP).
To date, around         2000 people have been directly impacted and unquantifiable numbers         indirectly affected.
In May 2013 the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister       (OFMDFM) announced a package of reforms for Northern Ireland.
Relating       specifically to education and reflecting the MAG recommendations, the       package included a commitment to start work within in next 5 years on       building 10 `shared education' campuses in Northern Ireland.
This is         likely to offer the opportunity for the shared education experience to         around 50 schools and 20,000 pupils.
On Oct 23 2013 the Minister of Education made a major statement         welcoming all recommendations of the MAG and outlining a plan for the         operationalisation of them (see 5:9).
The proposed rollout of         shared education will impact all children in Northern Ireland.
INTERNATIONAL IMPACT     In 2009 UNICEF (Macedonia) contacted the researchers to explore the       potential for policy transfer of the shared education concept.
Gallagher,       Hughes and colleagues from Queen's were commissioned to work with NGOs,       senior officials from the Ministry of Education in Macedonia and teachers       from Albanian and Macedonian schools to develop a National Programme of       Intercultural Relations based on the Shared Education model.
This work         is ongoing, and the Programme has already impacted pupils in 6         participant schools in ethnically mixed municipalities.
There are 150         additional schools involved in a preparatory programme.
When completed         the programme has the potential to impact primary and post-primary         pupils in all schools in such municipalities (see 5:10 for letter to       corroborate the influence of the NI shared education programme and       research on the Macedonian initiative).
In 2010, the Tony Blair Faith Foundation contacted the SEP to support its       work with Religious Education teachers in Northern Ireland.
SEP       subsequently helped organise a number of seminars at which RE teachers         from SEP and other schools in NI engage in the international networks of         the Faith Foundation.
Gallagher has been commissioned by the Faith       Foundation as a consultant for ideas on shared education interventions in       Kosovo, and Hughes is a consultant for the Faith Foundation on the       development of evaluative tools.
In 2011, UNESCO published an `Education       for All Global Monitoring Report' that draws on global evidence to       identify aspects of education that may have a positive influence on the       dynamics of conflict or make a contribution to UN peace-building peace         building work.
The research of Gallagher and Hughes is referenced       extensively in the report, which recommends that initiatives aimed at more       inclusive schooling can help mitigate the development of negative       stereotypes between groups in conflict (see 5:11).
In 2012 Gallagher delivered a workshop in Nazareth to explore the       potential for shared education in Israel, and two schools, one Jewish,         one Arab, in Jaffa have now signed up to run a shared education pilot         project.
