Context       Every year 15m people have a stroke worldwide, many of whom survive to       live a long life with significant disability.
The National Audit Office       estimated the wider economic costs of stroke at &#163;8bn pa in England alone       for 2008-2009.
Survivors report high levels of unmet need for support with       long-term cognitive problems after stroke.
Improving cognition was the       number one priority agreed by users and providers to improve life after       stroke (James Lind Alliance, Pollock et al., Lancet Neurology       2012).
Many national clinical guidelines (e.g., Australia, England/Wales,       Scotland) use a hierarchy of grades/levels of evidence to develop       recommendations for clinical practice.
Over the past decade UoM-led       research has provided robust trial and systematic review evidence       (described above) on which guideline writers have based their       recommendations.
Pathways to impact       Targeted dissemination: We specifically targeted journals accessed by NHS       commissioners and policy makers (e.g., Cochrane, BMJ, Health         Technology Assessment).
We sent copies of recent research to the       Chairs of National Clinical Guidelines (e.g., RCP, NICE, Scotland,       Australia) suggesting they use our evidence when updating their       recommendations.
We made research tools/resources and reports freely       accessible online to service providers (e.g., good international uptake       and requests to translate our PROM, the COAST and Carer COAST, into       French, Swedish, Danish, Italian, Portugese, Malay) and clinical       researchers (e.g., ACT NoW is a case study on the NIHR SRN website and its       aphasia-friendly trial recruitment materials are freely available online).
We ensured meaningful dissemination to and with service users, e.g., via       our website, by producing a printed `easy access version' for people with       stroke and, by presentations at events with good user attendance such as       World Stroke Day and UK Stroke Forum.
Impact on national guidelines, clinical practice and patients       The findings from the three systematic reviews (4-6) and the studies from       ACT NoW (1-3) have directly influenced recommendations in the following       guidelines for the rehabilitation of cognition and communication       post-stroke: NICE CG162, Stroke Rehabilitation: Long term         rehabilitation after stroke (2013) (S1); the Intercollegiate Stroke       Working Party (ICSWP) National Clinical Guideline for Stroke, 4th       edition (2012) (S2); the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network       national clinical guideline 118, Management of patients with stroke:         Rehabilitation, prevention and management of complications, and         discharge planning (2010) (S3); the European Stroke Organization Guidelines         for Management of Ischaemic Stroke and Transient Ischaemic Attack       (2008) (S4); and the National Stroke Foundation (Australia) Clinical         Guidelines for Stroke Management (2010) (S5).
For example, ACT NoW is cited in the ICWSP guideline (S2) as a key source       of evidence for the recommendations on the care of people with aphasia.
These recommendations suggest changes to standard practice, both in terms       of ending ineffective interventions and supporting more promising       interventions.
For example: `routine reassessment of the impairment or         diagnosis in the early stages of stroke (immediate and up to 4 months)         should not be performed unless there is a specific purpose, e.g.
to         assess mental capacity.'
(p. 97) Additionally: `In the early         stages of stroke (immediate and up to 4 months) patients identified as         having aphasia as the cause of the impairment should be given the         opportunity to practise their language and communication skills as         tolerated by the patient.'
(p. 98) The Chair of the ICSWP Stroke       Guideline and current National Clinical Director for Stroke for NHS       England has confirmed the key contribution the ACT NoW findings made to       the guideline (S6) and notes that the importance of ACT NoW lies in its       direct implications for speech and language therapy delivery.
The ACT NoW qualitative study and the development of our COAST       patient-reported outcome measure (COAST) also play a central role in the       aphasia recommendations in the 2013 NICE guideline on stroke       rehabilitation (S2).
The Chair of the NICE guideline has corroborated the       significance of the findings for the guideline recommendations (S7).
The COAST, published during the ACT NoW feasibility study in 2008, has       been adopted by clinicians and clinical researchers internationally.
Requests for translation into Swedish, Italian, French, Portuguese, Danish       and Malay have been received (S8).
