     The research by Telle and co-workers at the ALSU on laser       technologies has had substantial impacts on industry.
The table below       summarises the nature, reach and significance of this impact on three       companies.

Based on the research in [R3], a &#163;100k       system [G2, G3] was designed by ALSU to allow uninterrupted       operation of power stations during assaying, thus avoiding the need for a       reactor shutdown for significant periods of time.
This saved &#163;4m per day,       based on the power stations' wattage output and the cost of commercial       electricity in kWhr.
In order to provide LIBS analytic services to the nuclear industry on a       larger scale, a spin-off company, Applied Photonics Ltd, was       established in 1998 by Dr A.I.
Whitehouse, a former PhD student at ALSU.
The company operated in collaboration with Telle and his team and has utilised         the research described in [R2-R6].
Applied Photonics has now       developed into a major provider of LIBS services and manufacturer of LIBS       equipment.
It is based in North Yorkshire and currently employs around 20       staff (in the UK and the USA) &#8212; recently it entered into a strategic       partnership with Energy Research Company (ERCo), Staten Island, NY.
Applied Photonics has an extensive product portfolio ranging from       hand-held devices that allow easy characterisation of samples to bespoke,       submersible LIBS probe systems that perform in situ analysis of       materials within spent-fuel storage ponds for the UK nuclear industry.
The economic impact of this LIBS technology is measured by the       multi-million pound savings enabled by avoiding the shutdown of nuclear       power stations, thanks to the use of Applied Photonics' remote, robotic       assaying devices.
From [C2]:     "...I write to acknowledge the impact that your research has had in         some of the developments in Applied Photonics over the past years.
Your         research work and your collaboration with us in the area of         laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) have been essential to the         development of remote LIBS capabilities in material-assaying."
In 2009, Applied Photonics also delivered a stand-off LIBS system to the       US Army that can determine the chemical composition of samples over       distances in excess of 100 m, by means of a high-power laser and       telescopic spectrometer.
Around two-thirds of Applied Photonics' current       business is now with the US military and nuclear industry, and       while the system developed in 2009 is in the public domain [C2], more       recent advances are subject to confidentiality.
Analysis of nuclear and chemical explosive material for the Atomic         Weapons Establishment     The AWE entered a research collaboration with the ALSU in       1993 to determine the isotopic abundances in uranium samples by performing       RIMS on the final products in the decay chain (lead) [R1].
As a       proof-of-concept, uranium specimens were analysed in-house by ALSU       [C3].
The AWE also enlisted Telle's TDLAS expertise in analysing       the composition of its chemical explosives, which had an unacceptably high       failure rate during the first Gulf War due to their exposure to heat [G4,       C1].
Recognising the efficacy of these techniques, in 2003 AWE       founded a laboratory in its Materials Science Research Division to utilise       this technology &#8212; from [C3]:     "your work in the areas of LIBS and TDLAS has been essential in our         laboratory's expansion"     Since 2007, the AWE has employed a former ALSU PhD student, Dr       B.C.
Griffiths, to lead the laboratory.
This laboratory is currently one       of the main analysis suites used by the AWE to ensure the integrity         and reliability of the UK's nuclear stockpile and chemical explosives.
According to AWE from [C3]:     "This research has made a significant contribution to the development         of a new assaying technique at AWE to enable us to monitor a variety of         species at low concentrations."
Applications of laser induced plasmas by Spectrum Technologies plc     In aerospace systems, due to stringent fire safety requirements,       materials used for insulators on electrical cables cannot be labelled with       standard ink techniques.
A company based in South Wales, Spectrum         Technologies, pioneered the development of laser wire marking for       the airline industry to circumvent this problem.
Building on a       long-standing relationship with Telle and his research in laser-induced       plasmas, Spectrum Technologies has become a world leader in this market.
Spectrum Technologies has 80 UK-based employees and 20 staff based in the       USA, and its annual turnover is over &#163;10m.
From the CEO of Spectrum         Technologies [C4]:     "...
I write to acknowledge the impact that your research has had on         our company over the past 10 plus years.
Your expertise in pulsed solid         state lasers and their applications and your research work in analytical         laser spectroscopy have been of great value to us...
This expertise has         been critical in helping us maintain our world leading position in our         core business."
Spectrum Technologies is expanding its product portfolio by       developing a high-powered laser plasma technique based on infra-red laser       technology to remove enamel insulation from magnetic wires by means of       plasma ablation.
At present, there is no product available to perform this       stripping in situ at difficult-to-access locations typical of       aerospace components.
A grant has been awarded to the ALSU by the ASTUTE       Wales project (under the Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies       component) to conduct research aimed at developing such products [C5].
From [C4]:     "Your research in the area of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy         (LIBS) and laser- induced plasma generation now provides the basis for a         whole new area for Spectrum for the research and development of a range         of novel laser based products aimed at other area of materials         processing and advanced manufacturing."
