     Parliamentary and Policy Impact     Diedrichs' and colleagues' research outlined in Section 2 has       informed and influenced national political and parliamentary debate and       policy in the UK.
Based on the research output, Diedrichs was       invited as the only academic to join the steering group for the UK       Campaign for Body Confidence in 2011.
The Campaign at the time was led by       MP Jo Swinson (now Minister for Women and Equalities), and the steering       group involves politicians, charities, and community organisations who       meet regularly in the British Houses of Parliament.
It aims to promote       positive body image by influencing the advertising, fashion, beauty and       media industries, and the Government.
In her capacity as a steering-group       member, Diedrichs shaped political and public debate by directly       embedding her research into the proceedings of the Campaign.
A specific example of the research's impact on parliamentary debate       occurred in 2011, when the Campaign steering group decided to lobby       Government for the inclusion of body image interventions in school       curricula.
Diedrichs was invited to submit her research examining       school-based interventions to the steering committee.
This ultimately led       to Swinson making a submission in Parliament about the need to teach       evidence-based body image interventions in schools, including cognitive       dissonance approaches that were evaluated in Diedrichs' research       (see Source 1).
In Parliament, Swinson stated: "The University of the West of         England's Centre for Appearance Research will soon publish its         evaluation of different types of body image lessons.
It suggests that         the technique of cognitive dissonance&#8212;putting young people in a position         in which they challenge the stereotypical, ideal body themselves&#8212;is the         most successful in changing attitudes, and can reduce body         dissatisfaction and the likelihood of developing eating disorders...I         hope that the Government will conclude that body image should be taught         in all schools...we need to encourage teachers and schools to use those         resources by sharing best practice.." (see Source 1)     Diedrichs was subsequently invited as the only academic to       co-author the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image's 2012 Reflections         on Body Image Report (Source 2).
This report summarised the results       of a national parliamentary inquiry into the causes and consequences of       body image concerns.
It included policy recommendations for evidence-based       body image interventions to be made mandatory in schools nationally.
Diedrichs'       research directly informed, and was cited as providing the underpinning       evidence for, these policy recommendations.
Industry Impact     Diedrichs' research has influenced industry strategy for       developing and delivering evidence-based body image interventions       globally.
It directly informed and shaped the social mission agenda for       Unilever's leading personal care brand Dove (see Source 3), which delivers       body image educational interventions to girls in over 20 countries.
Between 2008 and 2013, Dove has delivered body image education to 8.7       million girls worldwide.
In June 2012, Diedrichs was invited to advise on the re-launch of       Dove's new psychosocial body image interventions.
In relation to their       educational programs, Dove states that Diedrichs' research has       been "instrumental in formulating our approach, development and design"       (Source 3).
They also say that "Collectively, these pieces of research         have influenced Dove's social mission strategy, bringing clarity to the         evidence base, convincing key business stakeholders of the viability of         evidence-based approaches and contributing to the evidence underpinning         the curriculum themes that guide the Dove Self Esteem Project in         totality..." (Source 3).
More specifically, Diedrichs' research has helped Dove to       identify the most effective school-based programme known to date, which       they are now launching in at least 20 countries.
Highlighting the impact       of Diedrichs' research, Dove has said that "Without this         research, our level of confidence in achieving the tangible impact we         set out to achieve would be significantly lower...Our choice of school         intervention to use as a basis of our re-launched program was reinforced         by the results of a further study of Dr Diedrichs' evaluating a version         of the recommended program in a younger audience, providing new evidence         in an area less well understood to date..." (Source 3).
Additionally, Diedrichs' research has informed the content of a       new Dove education intervention that is delivered in partnership with the       World Association for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.
Dove has said "Dr         Diedrichs' research has been key to the development of this non-formal         intervention program.
Specifically, her paper evaluating the         well-regarded `Body Project' with 12-13 year olds in the UK, has         directly informed the creation of our new youth leader education tools         which will reach over 3.5 million girls in the next 3 years."
