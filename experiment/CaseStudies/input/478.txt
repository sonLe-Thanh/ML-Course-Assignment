     Learning a second language is one of the key ways individuals access       other cultures and improve their chances in the employment market.
Higher       linguistic attainment is in direct relation to more opportunities of       social integration and economic prosperity.
However, many adults have       problems learning grammatical features.
This research focuses on the second language acquisition of tense and       aspect, areas of grammar which practitioners find particularly difficult       to teach and learners find persistently problematic to acquire.
The       findings, which explain where the problems lie and provide solutions to       overcome them, have led the research team to develop and deliver professional         development workshops for language teachers.
The workshops have three impacts for participants:            an enhanced knowledge of the linguistic properties of tense and         aspect;       an understanding of the reasons underlying learners' difficulties;       the consideration of effective pedagogical techniques in grammar         teaching.
The workshops are offered with the aim of equipping teachers with       practical and theoretical knowledge to boost their self-confidence, and       transform tense and aspect instruction into a more meaningful and       rewarding experience.
In turn this motivates and engages language students       to develop their language skills in this area.
The project is currently in the pilot phase: the workshops were first       piloted at the University of Greenwich with in-house language teachers and       their feedback provided the opportunity to improve, eg to make sure that       more everyday language was used for some of the technical vocabulary.
To       date the workshop has been facilitated at two language schools in London       (May and June 2013).
The first workshop was unavoidably delivered on two       dates, with five participants attending the first part and eight attending       the second part.
The second workshop had five participants.
Two types of feedback are gathered.
The first is a questionnaire       completed by participants immediately after the workshop.
The second is       feedback requested from line managers after two weeks.
An example comment       is: "They (the teachers) got a lot out of it in terms of their       professional development as teachers, in deepening their understanding of       L2 acquisition, their individual learners and the concept of fossilised       errors."
The feedback offered the following evidence of the three impacts:             Expanding teacher knowledge of tense and aspect         The first impact of our research has been that teachers have become more         confident and knowledgeable practitioners, by giving them a deeper         understanding of the properties underlying tense and aspect forms.
Of         the thirteen participants, twelve claim to have found it very useful to         have increased their knowledge of the underlying properties of tense and         aspect.
Understanding students' persistent difficulties with tense and           aspect         The second impact has been that twelve out of the thirteen teachers         found it extremely helpful to explore why L2 learners find tense and         aspect so difficult to acquire.
One teacher commented that "teachers         tend to ignore the reasons why students find it so difficult to acquire         tense and aspect due to a lack of insight".
They now understand         that there will be different rates of progress amongst learners from         different L1 backgrounds within a class, as well as different levels of         attainment, and they can act upon this accordingly in the classroom.
Learning effective pedagogy         The third impact has been to enhance participants' understanding of         effective pedagogical techniques in grammar instruction.
Nine out ten         participants found it very useful.
They particularly welcomed the         practical applications and examples, as exemplified by "much to test in         the classroom, with some practical advice on task development".
Participants reported that they had incorporated the newly learnt       knowledge and strategies into their lesson plans and teaching practice,       providing a long-term effect of the impact of the activity.
Finally,       according to the feedback, seventeen out of eighteen participants would       definitely recommend the workshop, with one teacher commenting "It was       extremely useful.
The workshop raised valid points; therefore all teachers       should attend one."
Both Directors of Studies have also asked the team to       facilitate further workshops.
The learning and teaching principles apply to other areas of grammar, eg       gender concord and determiners, so new workshops covering these aspects       are being developed as well as rolling out the tense and aspect workshop.
