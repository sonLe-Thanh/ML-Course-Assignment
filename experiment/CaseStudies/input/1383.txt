     This impact case study demonstrates a pioneering approach to simplifying       the process and thus reducing the cost of bringing new drugs to market.
A       spin-out company, Dynamic         Extractions was established in 2003: its business is split       approximately 50:50 between instrument sales and contract separation work       for industry.
With the instrument sales it is developing a global market       with 30% of sales in Europe, 20% in North America and 50% in the rest of       the world.
The company has been operating profitably for 10 years now with       7 staff and a turnover approaching &#163;1m today.
60% of all sales of the new       technology are directly to industry, of these 83% are semi-preparative and       preparative and being used for preparation of materials for clinical       trials and toxicity studies.
In an unprecedented move by industry, Dow       (USA) recently published a comparison between preparative column       chromatography (HPLC) and HPCCC [P5].
The HPCCC process produced a       two-fold higher throughput and consumed approximately 70% less solvent       than preparative scale RP-HPLC.
They were so pleased with the technology       they returned a number of times for repeat kg scale separations (Dr           David Rooke).
Interest from industry and academia has been marked; Professor           Joachim Kinkel (Source 6), when commenting on Brunel's work,       as chairman of the scientific committee at the Symposium on Preparative       and Industrial Chromatography and Allied Techniques (SPICA) said that       "liquid-liquid chromatography will be the future new technology for the       pharmaceutical industry with its ease of integration in production lines,       ideal clean-up of systems and efficient method development".
Professor           Lijuan Chen of Sichuan University, when commenting on       developments from our early Honokiol work, reported: "In the past two       years, we signed a cooperation agreement to develop one novel drug using       HPCCC combined with HPLC for treating lung cancer with Chengdu Jiye Bio-Tech Co. Ltd. An agreement has recently been made to develop an       anti-cancer drug sharing similar mechanism to taxol in collaboration with       Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group.
Honokiol has now passed the on-site       verification for drug registration and applied to conduct a clinical trial       in China".
"They are producing the bulk of the Honokiol drug using two       MIDI-CCCs &#8212; turning the hope behind our original paper (Chen et al, The       Rapid Purification and Scale-up of Honokiol and Magnolol using HPCCC,       J,Chromatogr.A., 1142 (2007) 115-122) into reality".

From Sutherland's research with GSK there are four new       business case studies currently being developed: pharmaceutical and       clinical development; virgin manufacture of API; toll refining of API from       crystallisation liquors and the use of telescope processing for the       manufacture of early development materials (Dr Keith Freebairn, source 5       and Michael Carroll, source 7).
There is a thriving Chinese industry building the traditional CCC       instruments with long separation times, but six key laboratories in       Chinese Universities are bucking the trend; investing in the new HPCCC       technology (China-25% of DE sales).
High quality publications on the       fractionation of new compounds from ginsenosides are being published by       Tsinghua University, new analogues as new anti-cancer drugs from Honokiol,       new anti-tumour agents from Sichuan University and new compounds as       anti-depressant drugs from Changchun Normal University.
Dissemination - Training workshops on the use of the       technology are being rolled out and an outreach programme placing       instruments for collaborative research in the Universities of Geneva,       Barcelona, Lyon and Rio de Janiero and also Sichuan University in China       where Sutherland has a visiting professorship.
Pivotal to the outreach impact has been establishing a conference series       on counter-current chromatography (CCC).
The 1st International       Conference on Counter-current Chromatography (CCC2000) was launched at       Brunel in 2000 and has been hosted in Beijing, Tokyo, Bethesda (USA), Rio       de Janiero, Lyon and Hangzhou, also in China.
It will return to Brunel in       2014.
The technology has also had an impact on the Symposium for       Preparative Chromatography and Allied Techniques (SPICA) where talks in       2010 resulted in a special liquid-liquid extraction session and workshop       in 2012.
Environmental Benefits - Waste and its disposal continue to       be economically and environmentally challenging issues across the       pharmaceutical industry.
New, greener, business opportunities are arising       from the recovery of product from waste streams (up to 15%) making the       waste stream more economical to dispose of (Keith Freebairn, GSK-see           above)     Awards for the research - highest cited paper in JCA in       2009 ("role of counter-current chromatography in the modernisation of       Chinese herbal medicines" -JCA1216(2009) 740-753) and SPICA2012 prize for       "API recovery from pharmaceutical waste streams" (2012)
