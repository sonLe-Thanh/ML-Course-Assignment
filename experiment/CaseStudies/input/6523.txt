     Old Bailey Online's impact is multifaceted, ranging from extensive public       engagement with the site to media reuse of the trials in fiction,       non-fiction, and `factional' form.
It is used by educationalists and,       importantly, has democratised access to sources of working people's       history.
Reach     Since initially launching in 2003, the site has received over 5 million       visits, 3 million occurring since 2008.
Google Analytics reporting shows       that since October 2010, visitors have come from 213 countries, the top       ten most frequent users being from the UK, US, Australia, Canada, New       Zealand and Germany, Ireland, France, India and Spain.
Visitor numbers to       end July 2013 maintained a steady average of approximately 2,000 daily,       and 32% were returning visitors.
The average visit lasts between 4 and 5       minutes, with the typical user viewing around 7 pages.
A user survey       conducted in 2010 revealed the most common uses of the site as: academic       research (39%), family history (36%), university teaching (28%), and       reading for personal learning/leisure (28%).
Users could tick more than       one box.
[Section 5, Ref.
1]     Site promotion occurred through press releases coordinated with each       launch stage, and public lectures given by Tim Hitchcock and Robert       Shoemaker.
More recently, the researchers' `Crime in the Community' blog       and regular tweets continue publicising the resource, and maintain a       lively online community.
Significance and Secondary Reach     Site Users     In May 2008, the Economist declared Old Bailey Online `a goldmine       for family-tree growers' [Ref.
2], with user comments on the Family Tree       Forum, BBC website, blogs and other online sources suggesting that family       trees are greatly enriched by the discovery of convict ancestors.
Australian Jan Richards' 2009 comment, when the Old Bailey user wiki was       launched, is typical: `How I remember waiting patiently (!)
for them to       reach 1828 so that the records of "my" convict could be loaded.'
She added       that the wiki was `a great way of adding value to this fabulous site and       demonstrating the "sharing" family historians are so renowned for.'
[Ref.
3]     A British lecturer described in 2010 how his undergraduate students used       it `to recreate trials .
.
.
and discuss the themes and issues that relate       to the history of crime'.
He praised the site's flexible search functions       and illustrative results, with `statistical searches [that] can be       displayed as a simple table, or as bar or pie charts'.
His students also       found the site `easy to use, rich in detail and fascinating'.
[Ref.
4] A       public library's blog in April 2013 concurred: `Researchers at Guildhall       Library have reported that they find the indexes and the ability to search       under any keyword to be particularly useful'.
A Canadian researcher simply       said that searching Old Bailey Online `changed my way of thinking about       digital history'.
[Ref.
5]     Contribution to the Creative Economy     In 2012 David Willetts, then minister for Universities and Science, said       the website `provided a valuable resource' to academics and researchers,       and was also `source material for creative industries'.

6] Old       Bailey Online material formed the basis of BBC1's hugely successful Garrow's         Law, which ran for three series between 2009 and 2011, winning the       Royal Television Society Award for best drama.
Series creator Tony       Marchant said in 2009 that his interest arose `after the Old Bailey had       published online transcripts of cases going back 200 years.
These       transcripts were a fantastic oral and written account of the period .
.
.
the words of the accused and the prosecutors gave me an insight into the       history.'
[Ref.
7] Garrow's Law attracted almost 60 million       viewers, and was released on DVD and as an iTunes download.
In March 2013,       the BBC also released Tales from the Old Bailey, a five-part       factual drama series for schools.
Hitchcock and Shoemaker were involved in choosing individual cases,       planning and acting as expert participants in BBC Radio 4's Voices         from the Old Bailey, which ran for two series in 2010 and 2011,       reaching 7 million listeners.
The first series was ranked the fourth most       popular programme on Radio 4, and the second the third most popular series       on the iPlayer.
In August 2011 the New York Times described the       site as offering `a unique window into the criminal justice system and, by       extension, British culture'.
[Ref.
8]     Stimulating Debate     In April 2008 a Guardian leader commented that, `in stark and       paradoxical contrast with the court's contemporary proceedings', the Old       Bailey's eighteenth-century records were `accessible, free and fully       searchable'.
[Ref.
9] The next month, the Economist also noted       `the transcript of a modern Old Bailey trial requires the permission of a       senior judge and then payment to the record-keeping company' [Ref.
2], and       a BBC reporter pondered whether the archive's openness was a welcome       feature for people with criminal forebears.
This inspired a reader in       Kampala to comment: `I curse why we don't have such details .
.
.
we don't       have records and if they exist they are poorly kept', adding that a woman       who had found a murderous ancestor via the website was `lucky to have the       information online'.[Ref.
10] In September 2008 another BBC reporter       speculated on the ipm blog that home secretary Jack Straw's recent       decision to abolish newspaper fees to access court lists might have been       inspired by the Old Bailey Online; [Ref.
11] the fees were indeed removed       later that year.
Entering the Lexicon     John Simpson, outgoing Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary,       reported on Radio 4's Word of Mouth that, when sourcing the       origins of crime-related terminology, `we cite from [Old Bailey Online]       wherever we can.
If we're dealing with a term from the criminal underworld       of London in 1850, we're as likely to have a quotation from that as we are       from one of Dickens' novels.'
[Ref.
12]     Recognition     Hitchcock and Shoemaker were awarded the 2010 Longman-History Today       Trustees Award (given for making `a major contribution to history') for       their `groundbreaking' Old Bailey and London Lives projects and their       `unparalleled impact on the way that history can be researched, taught in       universities and enjoyed by the general public'.
