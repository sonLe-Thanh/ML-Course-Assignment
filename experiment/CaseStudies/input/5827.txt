     The research findings on matters crucial to economic prosperity and       public services influenced public policy, informed legislatures,       professional bodies and regulators, raised stakeholder awareness of public       accounting issues nationally and internationally, and contributed to a       better understanding of these issues among the general public.
Heald's research contributed extensively to public policy in his advisory       roles to government and parliamentary bodies.
Contributions of particular       significance include:            As specialist adviser on public expenditure and government accounting         to the House of Commons Treasury Committee (including 2008-10) and The         Public Accounts Commission (including 2008-09), bringing his research         findings directly to the Treasury's modernisation of public sector         accounting, including (1) potential uses of the UK's WGA, and (2)         arbitraging between different accounting standards and between         accounting standards and national accounts rules especially as these         related to off-balance sheet treatments [5.1]       As member (nominated by the Government's Chief Economic Adviser) of         the Financial Reporting Advisory Board to HM Treasury (FRAB) (including         2008-09), bringing his research findings directly to the development of         PFI accounting policy, particularly the Treasury's acceptance that the         control principle would be used to determine the IFRS treatment of PFI         assets.
FRAB minutes show the sustained contribution of Heald based on         his research findings [5.2].
The research was instrumental in challenging and changing Government       policy and practice by providing an evidence base for holding Government       to account.
Heald also contributed to the cumulative pressure that led to       the Chancellor's Autumn Statement 2012 announcing a new control total for       PFI liabilities in Spending Review 2013.
Heald acted as `critical friend' to the Treasury's WGA process and       sustained the policy community's interest by informing it of research       results on issues and uses, a benefit recognised in October 2012 when he       met an IMF mission as a Treasury external stakeholder [5.3].
The research contributed to the safeguarding and improving of fiscal       governance through the work of the following committees of the House of       Commons that cited the research in their reports:            Treasury Select Committee (2011) on PFI accounting [5.4]       Communities and Local Government Committee (2011) on the abolition of         the Audit Commission [5.5]       Local Audit Bill Committee (2012) on legislative proposals following         the abolition of the Audit Commission [5.6]          and similarly in Committees of the legislatures of Devolved       Administrations [5.7]:            The Scottish Parliament's Finance Committee's self-review of its         budget process (2008)       The Northern Ireland Assembly's Committee for Finance and Personnel         (2010)       The National Assembly for Wales' Public Accounts Committee (2012).
The research was used to respond to UK Government public and private       consultations, including:            Treasury's reviews of FRAB (January 2011) and of Public           Expenditure: Statistical Analyses (March 2012)       Office for Budget Responsibility's review of Fiscal Sustainability         Reporting (May 2011)       Survey of Treasury's External Stakeholders (November 2008) and the         Science and Analysis Review of Treasury by the Government Office for        Scottish Government's methodological review of Government           Expenditure and Revenues in Scotland (March 2008).
Heald also used the research to raise awareness and understanding of       accounting policy issues among professional institutes and accounting       regulators.
He facilitated the Intra-Accountancy Institutes' PFI workshop       (2008); spoke on transparency and public audit at the Governance summit of       the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (2011); and       brought his PFI, WGA and fiscal transparency research to the attention of       the Technical Advisory Group of the Audit Commission, of which he was a       member (including from 2008-2010).
The research also had impacts in international policy and professional       communities:            As a member of the OECD Senior Budget Officials Network on         Public-Private Partnerships, Heald presented a paper in 2011 and acted         as discussant in 2012; he also commented on drafts of the OECD           Principles for Public-Private Partnerships (2011) [5.9] which         acknowledges his contribution       In Heald's responses to international consultations, including the         International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board's consultation on         PPP accounting (August 2008); and the IMF's review of the Code of Good         Practices on Fiscal Transparency (February 2013)       In Heald's role as discussant on the IMF's analysis of successful         episodes of fiscal consolidation (December 2010).
Heald also used the research to make a technically difficult subject more       accessible to the general public: he was a key contributor to BBC Radio       4's File on 4 on the PFI (June 2009) [5.10]; and shared his       insights with, for example, BBC Newsnight Scotland (March 2009), The         Economist (March 2008, March 2010), Financial Times       (February 2009, September 2010, February 2011), Sunday Herald       (April 2010), and Private Eye (November 2009).
