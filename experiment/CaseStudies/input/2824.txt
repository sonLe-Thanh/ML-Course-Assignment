     The PRACtICe study has provided the best evidence to date on prevalence,       nature and causes of       prescribing errors in general practices whilst the PINCER trial has       identified a highly successful       intervention to reduce prescribing errors in primary care.
The main       evidence of impact comes from       media coverage, changes to the RCGP curriculum, production of learning       materials for GPs,       developments to the TPP SystmOne GP computer system, and uptake from a       release of computer       queries used in the PINCER trial.
These have all occurred in 2012-13.
The       main beneficiaries are       patients and members of the public, GPs, pharmacists and the NHS.
Our report on the GMC-funded PRACtICe study was launched at a press       conference at the       Wellcome Trust in May 2012.
The study findings received substantial media       interest [A] including       front-page headlines in The Daily Telegraph and The Daily         Express; articles in all major national       newspapers; Professor Avery being interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today       Programme and BBC         Radio 2 Jeremy Vine show; and coverage on several hundred radio       stations and several hundred       websites.
This raised public awareness and debate around the problems of       prescribing errors in       general practice and interviews undertaken by Professors Avery helped       improve public       understanding of the issue.
In an article for the Daily Mail,       Professor Avery explained how patients       can help reduce their chances of having a prescribing error.
As a result       of this publicity, the BBC1         Inside-Out programme commissioned and produced a documentary on       prescribing errors in       primary care which included Professor Avery explaining the findings from       the PRACtICe study.
This was broadcast in three regions of England in October and November       2012.
As a result of the publication of the PRACtICE study report, Peter Rubin       (President of the GMC)       confirmed that in 2012/13, "We [the GMC] have met with relevant         organisations to ensure that the         findings [of the study] around a greater role for pharmacists in         supporting GPs, the better use of         computer systems and the extra emphasis on prescribing in GP training         are translated into actions         that help protect patients."
[B] Professor Avery has worked closely       with the RCGP since the       publication of the report and presented findings and recommendations at an       RCGP Curriculum       Group meeting in June 2012, and the RCGP National Conference in October       2012.
The following       impacts have resulted from this [C]: 1) Additional learning outcomes on       therapeutics and safe       prescribing skills, written by Professor Avery and ratified by the GMC,       were added to the 2013       RCGP curriculum [D]; 2) Following a meeting between Professor Avery and       RCGP examiners in       April 2013, assessment of therapeutics and safe prescribing has been       strengthened in the MRCGP       examination, e.g.
new consultation skills assessments have been developed.
The PRACtICE study report suggested various ways in which the prescribing       safety features of       general practice computer systems could be improved.
In August 2012, the       GP periodical Pulse       reported that TPP SystmOne, "one of the country's biggest GP software       providers has       implemented a raft of changes to almost 2,000 practice systems in the wake       of a GMC-funded       study which estimated there are errors in 1 in 20 GP prescriptions       nationally" [E].
This has included       computerised alerts aimed at ensuring that patients on high-risk drugs       receive necessary blood-tests.
As a result of the publication of the PINCER trial in The Lancet,       general practice organisations and       NHS leaders (including the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer) have expressed       considerable interest in       rolling out the intervention to general practices in England.
Since 2012,       Professor Avery and       colleagues have worked with a University spin out company (PRIMIS) to       produce e-learning       materials [F] and develop new methods for general practices to download       computer queries used       in the PINCER trial [G] to identify prescribing errors and prevent patient       harm.
By July 2013, over       800 general practices had downloaded these computer queries [H] with       potential benefits to       thousands of patients, and the NHS, from this cost-effective intervention.
Keith Ridge, the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, stated in 2013 that the       PRACtICe Study, "has         brought considerable, and much-needed, recognition of ... the problem of         prescribing errors ... in         general practice" and that he "and other senior Government and         NHS officials and professionals,         routinely use this study as justification for policy development and         initiatives designed to improve         quality and outcome for patients."
[I] He also stated that PINCER is       "an important step towards         improving patient safety and outcomes from medicines prescribing and         use, including the         development of IT to support clinical decisions."
