     By devising and refining the methods and undertaking the empirical       analysis on which formulae are based, York helped to ensure that the       organisations responsible for commissioning services receive a fairer       share of the NHS budget i.e.
in proportion to the relative health care       needs of their constituent populations.
The path-breaking nature of the       work was referred to in a review of Resource Allocation for the Secretary       of State in 2008:"A team from York University were awarded the contract         ... and produced an impressive report based on state-of-the art         techniques to derive estimates from small-area variations in utilization         (Carr-Hill et al, 1994a): this was well described by Ken Judge, in         evidence to the Health Select Committee as being `widely acknowledged to         be the most impressive and sophisticated undertaken so far in this         field' (source 1).
The DoH has been utilising this body of research for the allocation of       resources for almost 20 years and in 2011-2012, weighted capitation       formulae informed recurrent allocations of &#163;85 billion to Primary Care       Trusts and thence via Practice Based Commissioning (PBRA) to General       Practices, directing resources according to relative population needs.
Revising the formulae to take account of unmet need, rather than       just reflecting current utilisation patterns, ensured that particular       groups in the population (e.g., ethnic minorities and the socially       disadvantaged) who were not utilising health care services at the same       level as other groups with similar health characteristics, were not       unfairly treated in terms of the resources allocated for their care.
The       decisive impact of York's research on NHS resource allocation is       corroborated in the official history of resource allocation (source 2).
Research led by, or involving York researchers as co-authors, is       referenced throughout the account of how the formulae have been developed.
The appendix shows that York's research features in 18 of the 27       "external" reports to the Dept of Health, used in the development of the       formulae over several years (source 3).
Through successive re-organisations of the NHS, York research has defined       and under-pinned the development of allocation formulae in order to ensure       that a more equitable distribution of resources is achieved, regardless of       which organisations (District Health Authorities, PCTs, Clinical       Commissioning Groups) have had responsibility for the provision and       purchasing of health care services (source 2).
Without the       research, the financial allocations made to these organisations would have       been made on a cruder basis, ignoring many of the sources of the relative       difference in the healthcare needs of local communities.
The impact of the       formula can be illustrated by comparing the allocations to a hypothetical       benchmark: in 2011/12, adjusting the allocations to reflect population       needs (as in the most recent formula) has the effect of re-distributing       approximately 10% of the total budget of over &#163;100 billion compared with a       benchmark scenario under which each area received a share based purely on       the size of their population.
The use of the formula, compared to this       "equal shares" scenario, would increase health care budgets by up to &#163;571       per head of the population in 56% of PCTs and reduce allocations by up to       &#163;440 in the remaining 44% of PCTs, thus reflecting a re-distribution to       areas most in need.
The research undertaken on general practice General Medical Services       (references 3 and 4) and in particular the element of the research by       Carr-Hill (reference 3) became widely known as the "Carr-Hill formula",       and has underpinned the capitation payments &#8212; the "global sum allocation       formula" &#8212; since 2004.
The BMA said "The new Carr-Hill allocation         formula will provide equity, recognise casemix and practice         circumstances, and ensure money will flow according to patient need"       (source 4).
The lack of adjustment for factors influencing workload       and the cost of providing services were perceived as flaws and the new       contract stated "The introduction of a global sum payment, combined         with new rewards for quality, will address these flaws.
A new GMS         resource allocation formula, developed by Professor Roy Carr-Hill of         York University, will provide the basis for allocating funds for global         sum resources and for quality payments" (source 5).
The       formula and its adjusted versions (reference 5) continues to inform       capitation payments to general practices, involving around &#163;3 billion per       annum (source 5).
In addition to the research impacting on the main allocation formula,       other York research has also had a significant effect on allocations.
Research on the mental health formula led the DoH working group (ACRA) to       recommend to Ministers: "One of two recommendations to have a         significant impact on PCT target allocations is that for mental health.
ACRA recommends a new approach to the mental health component of the         weighted capitation formula.
The approach is a major step forward in how         funding is allocated for mental health services" (source 6)       Hence improving the accuracy with which resources can be allocated to       reflect the relative mental health needs of the population and the costs       to commissioners of delivering those services.
The most recently developed Person Based Resource Allocation (PBRA)       mechanism was the basis of the "toolkit" to enable PCTs to compare actual       expenditure on acute care at practice level with a needs-based standard       allowing for the differences in needs amongst general practices.
This can       promote an even fairer distribution of NHS funds, to the direct benefit of       society.
This research is cited in the Department of Health's Guidance to       PCTs which also cites the role of research on mental health (covered in       reference 6): " The 2011/12 toolkit introduces new methodologies for         the Prescribing and Mental Health parts of the toolkit.
This is based         upon the results of the Resource Allocation for Mental Health and         Prescribing (RAMP) project, which was developed as part of the         methodology for PCT allocations.
In the 2010/2011 toolkit we introduced         a new methodology for the Acute care component.
This was based on         research that the Department of Health commissioned ... to develop an         acute formula based on the prediction of individual patient costs.
We         have retained this methodology for the 2011/12 toolkit and the data         underlying the formula have been updated."
