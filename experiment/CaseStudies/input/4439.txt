     The impact of Bell and Branch's research can be summarised under two       headings: heritage       management and impact on economic growth in commercial archaeology.
(4.1) Heritage management       Prior to c.1990, development pressures in lowland wetlands, especially       coasts and the intertidal       zone, received little archaeological attention by planning authorities,       since these areas were largely       blank with respect to the distribution of known archaeological sites.
Today, informed by       geoarchaeological research to which the University of Reading has made a       major contribution,       planning authorities increasingly require extensive archaeological       intervention in advance of       development (see section 4.2 below).
The research by Bell and Branch on       wetland       geoarchaeology has influenced the official policies and activities of a       range of stakeholders,       especially local planning authorities (e.g.
Somerset County Council) and       heritage agencies.
A       number of specific examples can be highlighted:     Planning and management:            The research impacted on national management strategies for coastal         areas (e.g.
`Mesolithic         Maritime Research Framework' [Bell et al, 2013]).
Testimonial:       "Publication of the survey of the Welsh intertidal zone contributed         directly to the development of a         national programme of coastal surveys" (English Heritage, 12 June 2013).
Specific examples of impact on the planning process include the M4         relief road scheme         (dropped in 2009 partly on archaeological grounds) and the Severn Tidal         Power Scheme     Testimonials:     "Responses to consultations....rely on the excellence of the information       base to which Reading       research has made such a valuable contribution" (English Heritage, 12 June       2013).
The University of Reading's work is seen as "invaluable when forming       evaluation and mitigation       strategies for major coastal infrastructure projects" (Somerset County       Council, May 2013).
The participation of Bell and Branch on advisory panels with a         significant wetland and coastal         archaeological interest has contributed to planning and management         strategies (e.g.
English         Heritage Advisory Committee [Bell to 2010], Trustee and Director of         Wessex Archaeology [Bell         to 2011], Surrey County Council (SCC) Archaeology Strategy Group and SCC         Sub-group for         Environmental Archaeology [Branch to present]).
Raised media attention of wetland archaeology has had a beneficial         effect on national         management strategies.
The research featured nationally and         internationally in the REF period,         in for example Channel 4 programme Time Team (2013), BBC Two's History           of Ancient Britain         (2011) and National Geographic magazine (2012).
In a         testimonial, Cadw refers to the benefits         of raised media attention by Bell "based on 20 years of patient and         pioneering research" (28         March 2013).
Best practice in geoarchaeology            The development of techniques of rapid survey and recording in         intertidal areas has influenced         best practice in geoarchaeology as articulated in Intertidal survey           and excavation (Bell in         Menotti and O'Sullivan, 2012).
Testimonials:     "Nearly everybody embarking on research within tidal estuaries uses the       Severn as a model of how       to carry out integrated and interdisciplinary research that you have       helped to pioneer."
(Cadw, 28 March 2013)     "Your CBA reports now provide a benchmark for our own response to wetland       zone       archaeology....
Your work has raised awareness within the heritage sector       of the significance and       future potential of wetland and intertidal archaeology."
(National Museums of Wales, 4 April 2013) 	            Branch and Bell's research contributed to geoarchaeological aspects of         Regional Research         Frameworks and guidelines, which provide guidance to the public and         private sectors on the         management, protection and research of heritage assets.
In particular,         their work contributed to         The Archaeology of South West England: South West Archaeological           Research Strategy         (2012), and the English Heritage Environmental Archaeology Guide 2nd           edition, case study         (2011).
The impact extends beyond the UK, with agencies in Ireland (e.g.
Irish         Heritage Council and         Archaeological Development Services Ltd.) and France (e.g.
National         Museum of Archaeology,         Paris) implementing approaches developed by Branch (Riddiford et al.
2012) on major national         projects &#8212; e.g the Bord na M&#243;na Peatland Survey (Ireland) and Projet         Briquetage de la Seille         (France).
(4.2) Impact on commerce and economic growth in commercial           archaeology       The research of Bell and Branch is characterised by the development of       new, innovative       approaches to geoarchaeological field and laboratory work within wetland       environments.
The       dissemination of the research to the commercial sector has had an       outstanding impact by       enhancing the capability of commercial bodies to undertake       geoarchaeological investigations       leading to sustained economic growth for these organisations.
Two private-sector areas in particular have benefitted: (a) environmental       consultancies (e.g.
CgMs       Consulting), and (b) archaeological businesses (e.g.
Pre-Construct       Archaeology Ltd).
The       increased input of research-led geoarchaeology has informed commercial       project designs,       fieldwork, post-excavation analyses and publication texts and has enabled       private companies to       "tender for and win projects of greater complexity and size than would       otherwise have been the       case" (Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd testimonial, 26 April 2013).
A number of specific examples of the commercial and economic benefits of       the research can be       highlighted: 	       Commercial archaeology technical reports drawing upon the research       (e.g.
Branch et al.
2012)       include research strategies, approaches to field sampling to provide       multi-proxy records of       environmental change and human activity, and laboratory-based analytical       procedures and       data analysis (including 2D and 3D sedimentary modelling and the       innovative application of a       range of geoarchaeological techniques).
Major development projects in       London, such as the       London Cable Car and the Erith Wind Turbine highlight the research's       outstanding contribution       to the private sector and the rapid transfer of the work through the       direct commercial       engagement of organisations with Quest, as demonstrated by the following       testimonial:       "Quest's refined modelling of the geoarchaeological deposits in London has       enabled...advisors       to tailor archaeological conditions ensuring that mitigation requirements       on development are       both reasonable and proportionate, key requirements of National Planning       Policy" (English       Heritage 12 June 2013).
Enhanced income generation for the environmental consultancies and       archaeological       businesses by the transfer of research-led geoarchaeological knowledge and       expertise has       enabled them to tender for commercial contracts as part of the planning       process, from which       they would otherwise have been excluded.
Examples of additional income for       these businesses       from purely wetland geoarchaeological project work in 2008-2013 are: CgMs       Consulting [UK]       (~&#163;193K), AOC Archaeology [UK] (~&#163;179K), Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd       (~&#163;154K), Amelie       [France] (~&#163;107K), and Archaeological Development Services Ltd [Ireland]       (~&#163;90K).
By providing this research-led enterprise service, Quest has become a       sustainable technical       service facility employing five full-time members of staff and with a       total turnover during the       REF impact period in excess of &#163;1m.
Quest has therefore created and       sustained jobs, and       improved the career development profiles of its staff by actively       involving them in academic       publications (e.g.
Hornchurch Marsh project in the Lower Thames Valley) &#8212;       an impressive       achievement during a time of economic recession.
In conclusion, the research of Bell and Branch, and the strategic       development of Quest, has had       an outstanding impact on research and management strategies for wetlands,       on the planning       process and on methodologies for geoarchaeological research in the UK,       Ireland and France.
It       has also had very considerable commercial implications, both in terms of       individual practitioners       and commercial units.
