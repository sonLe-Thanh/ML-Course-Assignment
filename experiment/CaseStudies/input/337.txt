     Impact on identifying and supporting improvements in collaborative           partnership working.
The Welsh Assembly Joint Inspectorate, having commissioned the       development of the framework into SAIT, formally launched it in May 2009       and since then all Welsh LSCBs have been expected to complete an annual       evaluation using SAIT.
The Joint Inspectorate uses SAIT to assess LSCB       progress against the five components, 21 standards and indicators (S1).
The most recent inspectorate report draws on findings from the individual       inspections to highlight key lessons learned in terms of good practice and       improvement (S1).
A national safeguarding seminar was held on the 3rd June 2013,       funded by the Welsh Local Government Association and Directors for Social       Services Cymru, for 35 senior managers currently sitting on LSCBs.
At this       seminar there was consensus that SAIT has played a crucial part in       enabling the boards to evaluate both their current strengths and areas       that need further development in order to secure safer safeguarding       systems.
They concluded that the annual self-appraisal enables the boards       to identify and work with persistent as well as transitory promoters and       inhibitors to effective practice:     "The Board has used SAIT each year to identify priorities, key issues         and any gaps in order to develop its business plan for the following         year....This has improved multi agency working relationships, increased         understanding of roles and responsibilities across agencies and this has         been translated into improved practice whilst also enabling the Board to         be connected to the daily practice of practitioners" (Welsh LSCB       business manager S2).
Learning about the positive Welsh experiences of SAIT, together with       verbal recommendations by members of LSCBs, a number of LSCBs in England,       including Manchester, Liverpool, Lancashire, Cumbria, Coventry, Bath and       North-East Somerset, Redcar and Cleveland, Wirral, Blackburn with Darwin,       Bristol, Birmingham, Haringey have used SAIT to identify strengths and       areas for development and, in turn, develop strategies for improving       partnership working and multidisciplinary practice:     "Of the assessment tools available, the best, by some margin, is the         Self Assessment and Improvement Tool developed by Jan Horwath and Tony         Morrison...
This view is widely shared by the majority of other board         chairs who I have discussed this with....Overall, the SAIT is the model         of choice for strategic partnerships wishing to set a realistic baseline         of their performance from which they can improve."
(LSCB chair with       experience of chairing three large, metropolitan boards in England S3)     Impact on shaping new strategic partnerships     Policy-makers, such as the Northern Ireland Assembly Select Committee for       Health and Public Safety on Government, hearing about the positive Welsh       and English experiences of SAIT, invited Horwath to describe her work       using SAIT to the Assembly's Heath, Social Services and Public Safety       Committee (S4).
They drew on the conceptual framework to inform the       development of statutory multidisciplinary strategic partnerships to       safeguard children.
For example, in 2012 the Northern Ireland Safeguarding       Children Board commissioned Horwath, who, using SAIT, assisted them in       developing their strategic vision and governance arrangements.
This, in       turn, informed ways in which the members of the board collaborate with       other partnerships ensuring duplication is avoided.
The Framework has been particularly beneficial to policymakers and senior       managers in Cape Province, South Africa and New South Wales, Australia as       it has provided them with the scaffolding to build effective structures       and systems to promote inter-agency practice.
A Chief Executive Officer of       state services in New South Wales described how SAIT informed the major       programme of reform to the state's child protection system:     "assisting with the practicalities of translating the strategic vision         for shared responsibility for child wellbeing into shared goals.... as         well as promoting dialogue about challenges and strategies that would         assist senior managers and the executive to implement cultural change         across the child protection sector".
(S5)     SAIT has also been used with members of the equivalent of local LSCBs in       Portugal as well as policymakers sitting on a national LSCB to identify       ways in which they can use the framework to improve their       multidisciplinary arrangements (S6).
Impact on the development of government guidance     The Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors       of Social Services, with support from the Welsh Assembly, have       commissioned Horwath to work with existing members of LSCBs, using the       conceptual framework and SAIT, to identify the regulations and guidance       required from Government for new, regional safeguarding children boards       (S7).
SAIT informed the content of the chapter on multidisciplinary training       and development in the English Working Together to Safeguard Children:         A guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of         children (HM Government 2006, 2010) (S8).
For example, members of       LSCBs who used SAIT indicated that the collective multidisciplinary       analysis of issues is more likely to lead to both a shared understanding       and group ownership of the solution.
This can be achieved through an       annual LSCB development day, which was specified in the guidance and is       now routinised practice in most boards.
