     The research led to several changes in laws and regulations in the USA       [a,d], New Zealand [b,c],       and in the inter-governmental organisation responsible for advising       nations on the sustainable use       of whale stocks (International Whaling Commission, IWC [e]).
For example,       (i) in 2008, the New       Zealand government established the Doubtful Sound Marine Mammal Code of       Management [b],       including the establishment of our proposed Dolphin Protection Zone [4].
(ii) In 2011, US Federal       regulations were changed to introduce protective regulations for killer       whales in the Northwest       Region under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act       [a].
(iii) In 2011, the       International Union for Conservation for Nature listed the Fiordland       subpopulation of Tursiops         truncatus as critically endangered following our recommendations       [c].
The Internal Whaling Commission shifted the burden of proof in       whalewatching impact assessment       in 2006 [e] and established the Large-scale Whalewatching Experiment       (LaWE) project initiative in       2008 [f] to inform the international management of tourism centred on       interacting with whales and       dolphins.
On the basis of his research Lusseau was elected to chair this       research programme for       the Commission.
This international research initiative provides scientific       information to inform an       adaptive management framework proposed by Lusseau [6].
It focuses on       defining sustainable       levels of tourism whale and dolphin populations can support [b] depending       on their habitat and       their life history characteristics.
As a direct result of Lusseau's findings, the IWC established the       inter-committee Joint Working       Group for Whalewatching in 2011 [f].
This included changes in rules and       procedures of the       International Whaling Commission to develop management procedures for       whalewatching by       allowing direct communication and collaboration between its Scientific and       Conservation       Committees.
Finally, following Lusseau's research [10], the Group is,       since 2012, developing an       adaptive management plan for whalewatching to coordinate the management of       the industry in the       89 member nations [f].
This research also led to a paradigm shift in the way non-lethal impact       on cetaceans is managed in       the UK [g, h].
The management objective for disturbances have been       clarified and aligned to       favourable conservation status.
Adaptive management schemes [6] have       become preferred for       these activities.
A unified scientific foundation for monitoring and       assessing objective compliance       has been adopted in 2012 [5].
A series of management tools has been       developed in direct       response to Lusseau's research.
In July 2013, the Joint Nature       Conservation Committee (JNCC)       established the UK Marine Mammal Renewable Advisory Committee [5].
The       role of this national       committee will be to implement the management scheme we have developed for       the JNCC, NERC       KE and CCW, in relation to the development of marine renewable energy       plants.
From 2012, our       scientific and management advice to the Scottish government and SNH [2]       has been implemented.
Those institutions now use our modelling approach and management framework       to consent and       manage multiple development proposals in the Moray Firth, UK.
Lusseau       advised Scottish       ministers, in August 2013, on the likely effects of the development of       three harbours in the Moray       Firth, to supply windfarm and oil and gas exploitation sites in the North       Sea, on the Moray Firth       Special Area of Conservation using this modelling approach [i].
Finally, this modelling approach is also adopted at the International       Union for the Conservation of       Nature (IUCN) with the creation in 2012 of a modelling working group by       the IUCN SSC/CEESP       Sustainable use and Livelihoods Specialist Group (initiated and now led by       Lusseau) to further       apply this approach to other socioecological systems within the remit of       IUCN [j].
Claimed impact as defined by REF: influenced national and         international environmental policy         decisions and informed national and international planning decisions.
Also led to changes in both         the management of natural resources and the management of an         environmental risk and hazard.
