     This work has had an impact on the following groups:     Tourists and tourist organisations            In collaboration with UNESCO in Florence and the Comune di Firenze, we         have         developed itineraries, grounded in our research, to enable modern         tourists to experience         the religious and intellectual sites key to Dante's Florence.
These         itineraries have been         distributed via the tourist information offices in Florence (as paper         leaflets) from the         tourist season of 2013 and will be available on the UNESCO-Comune di         Firenze flagship         website, www.florenceheritage.it).
The Leeds Centre for Dante Studies is the only research organisation         to have contributed         to UNESCO's work on late medieval Florence.
(Corroboration A)       The historic centre of Florence is a UNESCO World Heritage Site         visited by around ten         million people every year; however, until Leeds research was brought to         tourists, late         medieval Florence had been barely visible in tourist materials.
Our         materials, provided in         both English and Italian, therefore have significant international         reach.
(A).
UNESCO confirms that our research meets an urgent need in updating an         aspect of the         city's heritage industry largely neglected since the 1920s.
In         particular, it sees our work         as valuable in encouraging visitors to return to the city, offering rich         encounters with late         medieval sites, and foresees using our material for several years into         the future.
(A, B))       Leeds research has therefore added a crucial new dimension to         Florence's attractions as         a tourist destination, with considerable reach in terms of potential         visitor numbers, and         significance in terms both of tourists' experience and of economic and         heritage strategy         for UNESCO and the Comune di Firenze.
(A, B)          Faith groups:            Our understanding of Dante's religious context has particular currency         for groups         examining their own spirituality and belief.
Encouraged by the Bishop of         Wakefield, we         have established a thriving partnership with the Diocese.
In particular,         since 2012 we         have worked with the Mirfield Centre, an Anglican education centre for         priests, monks,         religious educators and interested lay people.
The Centre was "attracted by the possibility of a renowned research         team bringing what         was at the heart of their research agenda...into a context where non         specialists might         benefit from and engage with research that happens in the academy, but         intends to         connect with theological thinking, faith and religious experience         today".
(C)       A course, Dante Now, held at the Centre, focussed on how our         research on Dante's         engagement with his religious context could be relevant to contemporary         religious life.
We have also led Christian and Humanist "thinking groups" in the diocese         and elsewhere         in Yorkshire, encouraging further engagement with Dante.
Positive feedback reveals the in-depth significance of this work, both         for ordained         ministers and lay people.
These include: "very helpful for my teaching"         (from a faith group         leader); it has helped me "reflect on the redemptive journey"; "it's         made me think more         about the Christian side of life".
(D)          Public audiences and cultural organisation            We have worked with Opera North (as part of the DARE collaboration         between the         University of Leeds and Opera North), Leeds Cathedral Choir and         University of Leeds         Chamber Choir (involving members of our own student body) to present a         programme of         artistic and cultural events based on religious culture in Dante's         Florence.
Audiences have received a rich, accessible encounter with Dante's         poetry which would         have been impossible without our distinctive combination of research         opening up socially-grounded         understandings of Dante's work and a commitment to public benefit.
Feedback         confirms this: "you struck a lovely balance between the music, the         readings and the         guidance through the text"; "a fantastic event, a feast for the mind and         the senses alike.
The juxtaposition of text, image, and music was incredibly rich".
(E)       At the same time our academic expertise added an extra dimension to         the artistic         excellence of Opera North's programme of events; contacts in Opera North         confirm that         this is precisely the kind of collaboration with the University Opera         North wishes to         develop.
(F)       Public events (including Discovering Dante, a series of public         events - concert, lectures         and exhibition &#8212; on Dante held in the University in 2009; and Three           Evenings in Dante's           Florence) attracted audiences of up to 200 per event.
Online resources have also opened up pathways to our research:         podcasts; online         lectures by Honess and Treherne and visiting speakers; an online         resource, Analysing           Paintings, providing the basic skills to engage with visual         culture in Dante's age; Discover           Dante, a comprehensive introduction to Dante, and to our research         on Dante.
Indicative         metrics show that in 2008-11 there were &gt;79,000 page views and 13,800         unique visitors.
