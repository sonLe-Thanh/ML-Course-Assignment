     Pathways: Building upon the advisory roles described, Metcalfe       secured a number of high level appointments that helped shape his research       on innovation, as well as permitting a propagation of these ideas within       the former Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
These appointments       included chairing a meeting in 1999 of outside experts which reviewed a       DTI report on UK innovation policy, and membership of the panel of       economists chaired by Vicky Pryce (Chief Economic Adviser and Director       General, Economics, DTI) which informed the 2003 DTI Innovation Review       (DTI Economics Paper #7 `Competing in the Global Economy').
The influence       of Metcalfe's work on DTI thinking is summarized by a former DTI Director       of Technology, Economics, Statistics and Evaluation, who notes that:     "Evolutionary economics provides an invaluable and fertile means for         thinking about the nature and process of innovation while the NIS       [National innovation system] has formed the main intellectual         framework for UK technology and innovation policy making since the turn         of the century...Stan Metcalfe has been the leading economist in the         Schumpeterian tradition in the UK for many years and a major interpreter         of the work of Nelson &amp; Winter.
He has been the most important         economic source of these ideas for DTI/BIS economists and other         officials."
[1]     These appointments and the influence of his ideas led to Metcalfe's       membership of a panel of six economists, chaired by Keith Smith, that       produced the economics paper (EP15) that is the basis of the Government's       `Innovation and Research Strategy for Growth' (IRSG), announced on 8th       December 2011 [2].
IRSG: Professor Metcalfe was one of only six academics cited and       thanked by name for their input.
The chair and report co-author (on secondment to BIS) summarises       Metcalfe's contribution to EP15, recognising that "Stan's thinking         played an important role... [with] the over-arching objective of         the Economics paper... to create a coherent framework within which to         formulate innovation policy in order to promote economic growth.
This         framework relied heavily on the concept of `innovation systems', a         concept developed in Stan's seminal application of ideas from         evolutionary economics to the study of innovations [E][F].
Smith       went on to highlight that Metcalfe's work as a whole [see, Section 3]: "played         a very important role in the identification of all four... priorities         for innovation policy as a driver for economic growth" identified by       EP15 [3]: The need to:            Strengthen the sharing and dissemination of knowledge within the         innovation system.
Maintain and develop a full scale knowledge infrastructure.
Incentivise businesses across the economy to undertake the tangible         and intangible investments that drive innovation.
Improve and transform the innovative capacity of the public sector in         order for it to realize its potential as a major driver of innovation.
In sum, EP15 provided key support for IRSG, the objective of which is "supporting         business R&amp;D in areas in which the UK excels, within the context of         developing the wider UK innovation eco-system including universities and         other organisations" (http://bis.gov.uk/innovatingforgrowth).
Moreover, IRSG is built around the key role of government in both       supporting innovation ecologies and the linkages between them:     The Government is improving incentives for companies to innovate         especially SMEs.
In addition to our successful changes to the SME       [small and medium enterprises] R&amp;D Tax Credit we will invest an         additional &#163;75 million to support small business innovation including         additional funding for Smart, grants that support SME research and         development.
We will implement a new innovation voucher programme         enabling small businesses to engage with universities and the wider         knowledge base.
(BIS Website)     The importance of both innovation per se, alongside this specific       strategy to promote innovation, is evidenced by the budgets       involved.
As of 2011, the annual Government budget for science and       research programmes is &#163;4.6 billion, with &#163;150 million each year       supporting university-business interaction.
The impact of IRSG is further       evidenced in the BIS `Annual Innovation Report' (2012) that documents       progress made on a number of fronts in the implementation of IRSG during       2012 [2].
This progress involves the provision of support for innovation       ecologies, and the linkages between them, including additional funding of       &#163;200 million for the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (UKRIF), to       add to &#163;100 million provided in the 2012 Budget to enable universities to       enter long-term strategic research partnerships with the private sector.
Beyond these immediate policy impacts, IRSG, and through it Metcalfe's       work, have played a key role in shaping public debate on economic growth.
As the IRSG chair clarifies, ministers have embraced this topic as they       seek to shape "the ideas into new approaches to technology strategy,         industrial policy and long-term growth... Stan Metcalfe can legitimately         claim to be a central intellectual progenitor of these developments, and         it is therefore fair to say that his impact on contemporary policy         thinking and policy practice has been very substantial indeed" [3].
Overseas Work: Metcalfe's research has had impact in Europe and       Australia.
His ideas were presented in a European context at the 2009       UNESCO forum `Innovation for Development: Converting Knowledge to Value',       and subsequent report [4].
He worked closely with the EU K4G (Knowledge       for Growth) Expert Group that emerged out of the Lisbon Agenda       (2000-2010).
The concluding conference in 2009 `S&amp;T Policy in Times of       Crisis: Prospects for the Knowledge-based Economy', noted that his work       with Professor Paul David on `Universities and R&amp;D organisations in       the ERA' and their contribution to Europe's `innovation performance' was "fundamental         to the discussions at the conference" [5].
This work was       subsequently published in the committee's final report [6].
As the EC       Research &amp; Innovation DG confirm:     Metcalfe's work on innovation systems continues to influence EC         thinking, as the successor of Commissioner Potocnik, M&#225;ire         Geoghegan-Quinn based her approach on his Schumpeterian/ evolutionary         approach... Metcalfe's approach remains at the heart of the Europe 2020         target that proposes three per cent of the EU's GDP (public and private)         should be invested in R&amp;D/innovation, and particularly in the         requirement to `strengthen... every link in the innovation chain, from         'blue sky' research to commercialisation'.
Moreover, his research has         been useful in addressing the EC's medium term goals as his message on         the ecology of innovation was well understood in the EUROPA 2020         document of President Barroso and by Cm.
Geoghegan-Quinn."
[7][8]     Metcalfe's contribution to innovation policy in Australia arose through a       number of engagements.
He became a member of the Creative Industries and       Innovation Centre of Excellence at Queensland University of Technology       upon its creation in 2005, and was a key contributor to series of       `Innovation Fora' in 2006.
These associations, along with his acknowledged       expertise, led to his being one of four international experts consulted as       part of the 2008 `Review of the National Innovation System' set up by Kim       Carr, the Minister for Innovation Industry, Science and Technology.
The       resulting report, `Venturous Australia', set out a national innovation       agenda [9], to which the Government responded in its White Paper (and 10       year innovation plan) "Powering Ideas: An Innovation Agenda for the 21st       Century", and implemented in its 2009 Federal budget.
As confirmed by the       Government's innovation policy branch, Metcalfe's contribution:     "...had a profound impact on the members of the Panel and led to a         better understanding of the role for Government in facilitating         innovation...
In particular, three points made by Stan Metcalfe have         remained central to our innovation policy...
The central importance of         competition policy to keep the system open &#8212; innovation policy as a         complement to competition policy...
There is more to firm performance         than efficiency and effectiveness of products in meeting needs...       [and] the question... `What is the best systemic mix of organisational         forms to promote innovation and the creation of wealth from knowledge?
It is further noted that "the Labor Government has continued to         support innovation and sees it as essential for productivity" [10].
This is clearly evidenced in the `2012 National Research Investment Plan'       which quotes "Powering Ideas..." in its first line, and (tallying with       Metcalfe's K4G work) serves as the basis for the `Excellence in Innovation       for Australia' (EIA) consultation and pilot programme around the impact of       university-based research [9].
