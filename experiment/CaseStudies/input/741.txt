     The findings from Harding's 2001 study resulted in Newcastle City         Council providing more         resources for mediation when a young person is asked to leave the family         home.
A key finding &#8212;       that one service was seeing only 15% of the young people who had been       re-housed &#8212; led to the       workers from this service being relocated into the homelessness section in       order to provide support       at the point where a young person approaches the local authority as       homeless.
Mediation services       and support at the point of the homelessness application continue to be       provided today.
The       continued influence of Harding's initial findings is still apparent in the       manner in which the local       authority and other agencies continue to seek to provide housing support       to young people at the       earliest possible opportunity.
Most recently there has been the       introduction of a new system of       housing assessment for people in the care of the local authority from       October 2012 and the       appointment of two workers to provide intensive support to this group from       April 2013.
The report for the Origins of Poverty project influenced debates         about homelessness within the         Cyrenians (Source 1).
It was used in training with new       members of staff of the Cyrenians and key       issues were discussed at board and senior management meetings.
The most       important finding was       that people who had been in local authority care were substantially       over-represented among the       sample of homeless people, suggesting particular difficulties in the       transition to adulthood for this       group.
The research was also discussed at the Sunderland Homelessness       Strategy event in       December 2011 and the North Tyneside Homelessness Prevention Forum in       January 2012.
The EUROCITIES Peer Review of homelessness services in Newcastle led by       Harding identified         good practice that was used to inform the work of delegates from         Barcelona, Malmo, Munich, Oslo,         Rotterdam, Stockholm and Vienna.
However, it also suggested that       there were weaknesses in       supporting the most difficult and chaotic homeless people, who often come       from a background of       local authority care.
These findings led the local authority to ask a       delegation from Hamburg to       consider this issue as part of a peer review of services for young people       which took place in       February 2012 and was part of the European project, COM.IN (Source 2).
One of the Hamburg delegation's recommendations was to create       `transitions panels' of staff of all       relevant agencies, particularly housing and social services staff, to       support care leavers in the       move to independence.
Harding was the specialist advisor to the Hamburg       delegation's visit and       wrote the 2013 response to the recommendations, in consultation with the       local authority (Source         3).
This response indicated that greater joint planning to meet the       housing needs of care leavers       would be achieved, not by the creation of transitional panels, but by       incorporating a more       substantial housing needs' assessment into the Pathways Plan drawn up by       social workers and       young people around the time of their sixteenth birthday.
This assessment       is in the form of a RAG       (red, amber, green) system which is demonstrated in one of the       corroborating documents and       assesses the likelihood of a successful transition to independent living       and the risk of       homelessness (Source 4).
From October 2012, this RAG assessment has been used as part of the         statutory Pathways         Planning process (Source 5).
According to the Newcastle Children and       Young People's Plan,       there were 509 children in care in Newcastle in November 2010 - all now       receive a RAG       assessment to help formulate their Pathways Plan.
The assessment supports       social workers and       young people as they plan the future move to independent housing; housing       professionals are also       involved in the planning process where their input is judged to be       helpful.
A further response to the findings of the COM.IN project saw Harding       working with Home Housing       Group and Newcastle City Council in 2012 to make a successful bid to         the Northern Rock         Foundation for a project to provide and evaluate new intensive forms       of support for those young       people in care whose RAG assessment is red (Sources 6 and 7).
Two         workers were employed         from April 2013 and are providing support to a small number of the       most chaotic care leavers       (Source 8).
The project will run until August 2014 and the fact       that the evaluation report will be       produced by Harding and Irving has been identified as a key factor in any       application for       continuation funding.
The funding for the project includes money for an       event in the summer of       2014 to disseminate the outcomes of the project to a wider audience.
