     Impact on public policy     The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) provides scientific       advice on drugs policy to the Home Office, and the Home Secretary is       obliged to consult the ACMD before making any changes to drug       classification.
In 2009, the ACMD took the initiative to adopt a       multi-criteria decision-analysis tool for drug-harm decision-making, which       was based on output 4 [a, pg 13], developed by Nutt at the University of       Bristol.
Research informs political inquiry and debate on drug policy     Policy debate has been stimulated and moved forward by a rigorous,       evidence-driven approach to drug classification, based on research carried       out at Bristol [2-5].
The Drug Futures 2025?
Horizon Scan [3]       prompted the government to invite the Academy of Medical Sciences to       consider several difficult and sensitive policy issues, including the       increased sophistication and availability of recreational drugs and the       need to take into account the harms of these drugs in regulatory       approaches, and formulate recommendations for future research and policy       needs.
In their report, published in 2008, the Academy emphasised that new       indices of harm should inform drug classification [b, pg 8].
The drug harms rational scale and underpinning research has been referred       to extensively in political debates, including ones on drug use and       possession [c] and controls on legal highs [d].
In 2009, Nutt's views on       the relative harms of alcohol compared with illegal drugs were quoted       frequently during a debate on the Penalties for Disorderly Behaviour       (Amount of Penalty) Amendment Order 2009 to make the point that government       is "ignoring all the scientific evidence" relevant to drugs and criminal       activity posing danger to individuals [e].
Reviews and recommendations carried out by various bodies [2-3] have       repeatedly stated the need to review the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and       introduce more rigorous and transparent methods of assessing drug harms.
In 2012, Nutt was a witness to the House of Commons Home Affairs       Committee, which released a review that again stated the need for a       "fundamental review of all UK drugs policy" [f].
The drug harms rational       scale has provided a "frame of reference as a society to grapple with       these issues" [g].
Rational scale reaches beyond the UK The Ministry of Health in the       Netherlands commissioned a drug-ranking method based on the rational scale       [h].
The resulting report recommended guidelines for reclassification be       considered in the future, including a ranking approach [h].
The rational       scale was used in New Zealand where it was scrutinised by The Law       Commission as part of their review and recommendations regarding reform of       New Zealand drug classification and control [i].
In stressing the       importance of a full scale review to assess the appropriate drug       classification should a three-tiered system be retained, the Commission       used Nutt's rational scale as an example of how current classification may       not reflect the relative harm of the drugs [i, 6.98].
In May 2011, the       Swedish Supreme Court conducted a trial where the central issue was how       mephedrone was to be assessed with respect to its hazards.
Nutt's research       was brought up by "several participants" as the "only scientific study       assessing the hazards of a number of drugs" [j].
Raising public awareness Public awareness of drug harms has been       increased through numerous public lectures (e.g., at King's College London       and the universities of Leeds, Oxford, Newcastle and Derby) and TV       programmes based on Nutt's research into drug addiction, its underlying       biology and how to treat it (output [1] is one of over 150 papers Nutt has       authored on the subject), as well as his work on drug classification and       relative harms.
TV and radio programmes include:            Horizon Programme (5 February 2008) (Audiences average between 2.5 and         3 million.)
BBC News HARDtalk (May 2009) (HARDtalk is a flagship news programme on         BBC World, BBC News Channel and the BBC World Service.)
BBC Radio 4's Today Programme interview with David Nutt (31 October         2009) (Today has approximately 7 million listeners.)
Radio 4 broadcast, "On the Ropes" (15 March 2011) (Radio 4 had an         average weekly audience of 10.83 million listeners in 2011 when this         episode was aired.)
Channel 4, "The ecstasy trial" (20 November 2012) (This show took an         11.4% audience share when it aired, with nearly 2 million viewers.
It         was the most downloaded C4 programme ever.)
BBC4, "The Brain: A Secret History", three-part series (6, 13 &amp; 20         January 2011) (The series had 983,000 viewers.)
The drug harms scale has generated considerable media attention and the       sacking of Nutt from the ACMD in 2009 escalated media discussion on drug       policy and reform.
Examples include:            Transform Drug Policy Foundation, "Ecstasy reclassification meltdown;         it begins again" (21 May 2008)       Travis, A., "Chief drug adviser David Nutt sacked over cannabis         stance", The Guardian (30 October 2009)       Doward, J., Hinsliff, G. and McKie, R., "Ministers face rebellion over         drug tsar's sacking", The Observer (1 November 2009)       Brown, A.M., "Will the sacking of drugs expert Professor David Nutt         deter other scientists from advising government?
", The Telegraph           Blog (31 October 2009)       Sullum, J., "U.K. `Drugs Tsar' gets sack for telling the truth", Reason         (2 November 2009)       MaryJane, "Which are the most harmful drugs?
", DrugSense (19         December 2010)       12,581 followers on David Nutt's blog "Evidence not Exaggeration"         &lt;http://profdavidnutt.wordpress.com/&gt;       17,293 followers of David Nutt on Twitter (as of June 10, 2013)          There has been increased public interest and discussion on the harms of       alcohol.
For example, in May 2009 The Guardian published an       article comparing alcohol and drugs entitled "Double standards on drink       and drugs".
This generated 156 comments on The Guardian website       and received six Facebook shares [k].
Just one year later, after Nutt's       sacking, The Guardian published a similar article comparing       alcohol and drugs, entitled "Alcohol `more harmful than heroin or       crack'''.
This generated 786 comments, 5,778 shares on Facebook and 698       tweets on Twitter [l].
Data from 2012 also show that there has been an 11%       decrease in the litres of alcohol consumed per head per year since 2008       [m].
Symptomatic of the extent to which the drug harms rational scale is now       embedded in the wider community is the fact that it features in popular       fiction in a novel entitled The Red House by Mark Hadden; .
It may       also be worth mentioning that the term "nutt-sacked" was coined by the       Urban Dictionary to mean getting fired for stating the facts.
In 2013 Nutt was awarded the John Maddox Prize for Standing up for       Science.
Commenting on the award Sir Paul Nurse, President of the Royal       Society: said "The John Maddox Prize recognises the efforts of scientists       to speak out on issues that matter to society, placing evidence into the       limelight and battling to keep it there.
This year's winner is a bold       scientist who will inspire others to keep evidence at the centre of public       and policy debates about science."
