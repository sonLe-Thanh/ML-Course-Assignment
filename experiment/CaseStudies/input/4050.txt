     The findings of interviews and observations conducted during the Dick       Whittington Summer Schools (2005-2007) were used both to refine the team's       questions and approach to identifying the needs of young people, and to       deliver practical interventions leading to improvements in access to         medical education.
In turn, this has contributed to enhanced UK         social mobility.
This was achieved in the first instance by       collating and sharing information from the summer school, including about       how to make medical school interviews more accessible with UCL's medical       school admissions office.
However, the most significant research impacts       arose from the use of the findings outlined above in the research team's       creation in 2008 of Target Medicine (TM) [a], a London-wide       mentoring, outreach, and work placement scheme.
The programme is very       oversubscribed, with five applicants applying for every Summer School       place.
Since 2008, TM has welcomed 260 young people to six Summer Schools       (doubling the number of participants in the earlier Dick Whittington       programmes), mentored a total of 860 students from 171 schools, and       contributed to outreach work at the 50 UCL Outreach target schools.
Between 2005 and 2013 the proportion of UCL medical students from       selective, fee-paying schools (whose students account for just 7% of the       UK's school population) fell from 60% to 34%.
The TM Summer School is a week-long intensive course for 48 Year 11       students from non-selective state schools in N, NW, SW, SE, E, EC, W and       WC postcodes or the boroughs of Brent, Barnet, Enfield or Waltham Forest       who are thinking of studying medicine, have predicted grades of B and       above in Maths, English and Science GCSEs, and whose parents or carers       have not been to university.
The programme, which is run entirely by UCL       staff (headed by Dr Jayne Kavanagh), helps students envisage life as       medical students and doctors, and provides information about and guidance       on the process of applying for a place at medical school.
The week       culminates with participants' preparation of a multimedia clinical case       history for presentation to peers, parents and teachers.
Target Medicine's       most immediately significant outcome is its success in encouraging and       supporting participants' successful applications to universities.
The       value of the scheme to student participants is evident from their feedback       on it; according to a participant in the 2008 programme: "Target         medicine helped me achieve more than I ever thought I could.
I am really         not what you would call a typical medical student.
I was the first         person in my family to ever even consider going to university, let alone         become a doctor."
A 2009 participant, who went on to accept a place       to study Medicine at UCL in 2011, wrote: "I had the impression that         someone with my background would find it difficult to enter such a         competitive profession...the summer school has been immeasurably useful.
It helped me realise why I wanted to become a Doctor and it convinced me         I could."

The reach of the research impacts on local school students' awareness of       &#8212; and interest in pursuing -medical education has been further enhanced by       TM Outreach, which engages with 50 UCL target schools giving a total       potential audience of 10,000 students; 24 of those schools are currently       actively engaged, giving TM Outreach access to 5000 year 9 students each       year.
In 2013 alone, the Outreach team has conducted 29 visits to 28       schools, giving talks and workshops to an average of 60 pupils per visit.
Both school and medical school participants are supported by our development         and provision of appropriate, up-to-date learning resources       including lesson plans, power-point presentations, handouts on interview       techniques, personal statement writing and critical thinking, tips on       admissions tests, quizzes, self-evaluation forms, action plan forms, team       evaluation forms, and structured worksheets to facilitate personal       statement writing [c].
In response to their research findings, the UCL team also incorporated       into TM a comprehensive sixth form mentoring scheme, in which current       medical students &#8212; many of whom are themselves from non-traditional       backgrounds &#8212; are trained to mentor would-be applicants and guide them       through the process of applying to medical school.
Mentoring includes       providing sustained assistance with finding such work experience,       enhancing study skills, writing personal statements, developing interview       techniques, and practicing admissions tests.
Mentors offer further support       through mock interview sessions with UCL Medical School interviewers; mock       BMAT and UKCAT exams; and an early focus on the development of personal       statements.
Since 2008, the scheme has assisted almost 700 pupils, and now       guides ~200 Year 12 and Year 13 pupils from London-based state schools         through the medical school application process each year.
220 pupil       school student participants in the 2010/11 mentoring scheme were surveyed       between December 2012 and February 2013 to assess the impact of that       programme on them.
Teenagers are a notoriously difficult group to       follow-up, but of the 38 respondents, 11 are now studying medicine.
As well as supporting school pupil participants, the mentoring scheme       allows the medical students who act as mentors to develop team-working,       leadership, and teaching skills that enhance the quality of the service       they supply in their future careers as healthcare providers.
A 2011-2012       mentor wrote: "The skills which I have been able to develop over the         past few years have been invaluable in my progression as a medical         student.
As well as taking part in many extra-curricular activities, my         passion for widening participation has been focused in my current role         as the student lead for the UCL-based wing of Target Medicine."
According to another: "The two personally most notable things I gained         on the Summer School are intangible: an increase in confidence; and a         keen sense of equality.
Both have influenced me significantly: in         equipping me with the enthusiasm and skills to mentor and teach on         Target Medicine and at anatomy tutorials in medical school" [b].
These sorts of success, moreover, have a series of broader and longer-term         implications for the standards of UK healthcare provision and,         therefore, for the health, welfare and quality of life of its citizens.
In particular, the programme provides a forum for medical students from WP       backgrounds to contribute to their own communities and helps to broaden       the social diversity of medical student cohorts; as such, it contributes       to the development of a medical profession that better represents the       population it serves.
A crucial new feature of TM, which specifically addresses deficiencies       identified by the research, is the introduction in 2012 of access to high       quality work experience in the NHS.
Within one year, placement capacity       has increased three fold to 128 available sites across North London (1 GP,       70 Whittington Foundation trust and 57 UCL Hospital) and 160 students have       completed work experience.
The range both of the project's impacts and its       beneficiaries has been further expanded by the team's development of       strong and productive working relationships with these local primary and       secondary healthcare services and with leading to enhanced         understanding of WP issues among medical professionals more widely.
Target Medicine's success is such that it features in the Medical Schools       Council (MSC) and British Medical Association (BMA) joint publication A         guide to widening access to medical schools (2010) [d].
Its       inclusion in literature produced by the BMA, a professional association       and trade union for doctors with a membership of 152,000, has       significantly extended the reach of professional engagement with TM itself       and the research underpinning it.
That engagement has been enhanced still       further through discussion of the project among the BMA's online community       and student-facing websites including thestudentroom.co.uk, an online       community with over 1 million members [e].
TM has also featured in BMJ Careers (2010) &#8212; the UK's leading medical       recruitment and careers website &#8212; as a case study exemplifying both       innovative WP practice and the provision of opportunities for medical       professionals to contribute to that practice [f], and the programme's       benefits have extended to these professionals who volunteer to support it.
One doctor who contributed to the 2013 programme reviewed the experience       as follows: "Today [a group of other doctors and I] did something         wonderful...We gave up our evening to talk to 16 year olds from         underprivileged backgrounds...about why we had done medicine, why we did         our speciality area, our most memorable patient or the patients who         changed us or our careers.
It was wonderful to see them so keen and         interested and to be guided through those reflections and remember.
It         made me remember why I am so passionate about my job and how fantastic         it is" [b].
Finally, the research has also promoted and contributed to policy         discussion and debate by highlighting the issue of poor access to       the medical profession by those in lower social classes, through its       influence on several important policy reports.
These include the 2009 BMA       report Equality and Diversity in Medical Schools [g], which in       turn influenced the 2011 GMC The state of medical education and         practice report [h].
The research team has, moreover, provided expert         advice directly to policy-makers: The Cabinet Office produced its       2012 report Fair Access to Professional Careers.
In December 2011       Kavanagh and Culpit shared their experiences of WP for low income and       traditionally excluded communities in a presentation to Cabinet Office       civil servants.
They were invited to make this presentation to support       Alan Milburn, in his role as Independent Reviewer on Social Mobility and       Child Poverty, to improve access to medicine [i].
