     The impact of Statistical Ecology research at Kent has been to improve       substantially the       effectiveness of wildlife conservation policy and practice by providing       better methods of data       collection and analysis.
The beneficiaries of the research are       individuals, charities and       environmental agencies that collect and analyse ecological data and the       organisations that plan       and implement management and conservation strategies that utilise these       data.
A variety of approaches are used to encourage the incorporation of our new       methodologies into       ecological practice.
These include workshops and multidisciplinary       conferences, studentships with       collaborating bodies, joint research with external agencies and provision       of computer software.
Before detailing impact in (a) and (b) below, we expand on the context.
Multidisciplinary conferences: EURING meetings have been held       regularly since 1986 to       promote collaboration between ornithologists, statisticians and population       biologists.
Kent       statisticians have contributed to all of them, editing or co-editing       proceedings of 6 of the 9       meetings.
NCSE initiated the highly successful and influential series of       International Statistical       Ecology Conferences (St         Andrews 2008, Kent 2010, Oslo       2012, Montpellier       2014, British         Columbia       2016).
Both conference series incorporate training workshops and attract       strong participation from       outside of academia; for example, approximately 1/3 of the 146       participants at the 2010 ISEC at       Kent were from outside academia (e.g.
Alaska Dept of Fish &amp; Game;       British Trust for Ornithology;       Microsoft; Proteus Consulting, New         Zealand; Snow Leopard Trust, India;       US Geological Survey;       Wildlife Conservation Society, Malaysia).
Studentships with collaborating bodies, some funded by CASE       awards, have addressed the       spread of an invasive species (CEH), the effect of dredging on benthic       organisms (Cefas) and the       phenology of overwintering wild birds (the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust).
These close       collaborations ensure that research is directly relevant to ecologists.
Two research students have       produced introductory videos, targeted at an ecological audience, to       facilitate uptake of new       methods published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, a journal       of the British Ecological Society       [5.1], and two students won a poster prize at the International         Congress in Conservation Biology,       Auckland, New Zealand,       2011.
Current projects with external agencies/users include developing       models for the spread of ring-       necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) with the British Trust for       Ornithology (BTO); devising new       models and methods for evaluating the effect of global warming on the       phenology, abundance and       distribution of British butterfly species, with Butterfly Conservation;       and investigating the causes of       the decline of sea birds in the North Sea, with CEH.
These close links       promote the wider use of our       methodology within these non-academic institutions.
Estimating the survival of wild animals and integrated population           modelling [3.1-3.4]         Discussion of the sheep model [3.1, 3.2] now appears in several         textbooks on ecological modelling         [5.2].
The estimate of the annual survival of shags developed in         [3.3] was incorporated in the         update of The Birds of the Western Palearctic [5.3].
Our         models demonstrated the probable reason         for the decline of the Northern Lapwing, a species that is now on the UK         red list of globally         threatened species [5.4].
Organisations such as the BTO use         information about population decline         "to inform the public, opinion-formers and decision-makers... and to         make a significant contribution         to environmental policy."
[5.5]        Our methodology for integrated population modelling (IPM) [3.4],         which allows the combined         analysis of data from different sources, is now widely used by         ecologists.
For example, the         methodology has been used extensively by the BTO to "understand the         demographic mechanisms         that drive population changes and hence to better identify the         ecological causes of change and the         management actions needed to alter population trajectories."
[5.5].
This testimonial also highlights         the important contribution of other areas of statistical ecology         research at Kent, including "analyses         of survival involving individual covariates" [3.1, 3.2] and         "occupancy modelling" [3.5] and         concludes that our work "makes a particularly important contribution to         ecological science within         the UK and         to the policy-relevant work that flows from this".
Another testimonial         indicating the         impact of IPM on ecological practice, from the Head of the Ecology         Department at the Swiss         Ornithological Institute [5.6], states that the paper [3.4]         "changed the view of population ecologists         about the quantitative treatment of their data" and leads to "more         efficient conservation actions,         because management decisions can be reached earlier or with more         certainty".
Design and analysis of occupancy studies [3.5-3.6]       In 2009, Guillera-Arroita visited Sumatra and provided training         on occupancy modelling to 30         people from the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry and 8 NGOs [5.7].
A training manual was         developed and translated into Indonesian [5.7].
Many of the         participants were co-authors of a         landmark 42-author article reporting the first island-wide assessment of         tigers in Sumatran         rainforests, based on occupancy surveys conducted in priority tiger         landscapes across Sumatra.
Guillera-Arroita led the analysis, with advice from Morgan         and Ridout.
There is great public         interest in this flagship conservation species and this open-access         article, which is readily         accessible to the public via the Wikipedia page on Sumatran Tiger, plays         an important role in         informing the public, as well as those more actively involved in its         conservation, of the current         status of the species.
From November 2011 to July 2013, this article has         been viewed 3583           times.
The survey informed the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry's National           Tiger Recovery           Programme which is using "science-based adaptive management" by         providing the baseline         against which future progress in conservation will be gauged.
The survey         is highlighted in the         Global Tiger Recovery Program Implementation Report (Box 6, p.18) [5.8].
Priorities identified in         the report (p.19) include development of a $10million Global Environment         Facility grant for         transforming the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation in priority         Sumatran tiger landscapes,         and "the occupancy approach of Guillera-Arroita will be the main         monitoring technique" [5.7].
New methodology for camera trap data [3.6] was also motivated by         Sumatran tiger data, but has         since been applied in many other conservation and wildlife management         projects, including         human-tiger conflict in Nepal;         carnivores in South           Africa and Madagascar;         sympatric cat species in         Thailand; feral cats and dingoes in Australia;         and various cat species in Thailand,         Borneo and         Brazil.
Rapid uptake         of the methodology was facilitated by (i) publication of a follow-up         paper in J.           Zoology, targeted at ecologists, with an accompanying podcast         discussing the work in non-         technical terms and (ii) provision of an R package (overlap) developed         with a scientist at Wildlife         Conservation Society, Malaysia, and available through the Central R         Archive Network (CRAN).
Occupancy surveys are widely used for amphibians and reptiles, for         example by fieldworkers         involved with National Amphibian and Reptile Recording Scheme (http://www.narrs.org.uk/)         and it         is widely recognised that there is scope to improve survey technique.
For example, the government         is required by EU regulations to undertake surveillance to assess the         status of the great crested         newt (Triturus cristatus), and a recent report commissioned by         Natural England         (NECR080, 2011)         noted that "attempts at assessing population status have been hampered         by problems with survey         data".
To address this need, Guillera-Arroita, Morgan, Ridout         and NERC fellow McCrea have         collaborated with scientists from Kent's Durrell           Institute of Conservation Ecology (DICE) to improve         the design and analysis of amphibian and reptile surveys, for example to         detect trends in         occupancy over time.
Morgan was part of a NERC Knowledge         Transfer grant ("Development of         standardised protocols for assessing reptile and amphibian populations")         led by Griffiths (DICE),         aimed at improving current practice.
As a final example of impact, our work on occupancy, and the accompanying       software SODA from       [3.5], has been used by staff of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve       Commission and the Wildlife       Diversity Unit of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation       to design occupancy       surveys to support a state recovery plan and monitoring program for the       Frosted Elfin butterfly       (Callophrys irus), a species that is threatened under New York       conservation law [5.9].
Summary: The beneficiaries of the research are individuals,       charities and environmental agencies       that collect and analyse ecological data and the organisations that plan       and implement       management and conservation strategies that utilise these data.
The cited       examples illustrate how       novel statistical methodology developed at Kent has changed the practice       of wildlife managers and       conservation ecologists in collecting and analysing their data.
As we have       described, considerable       effort is expended to encourage uptake.
The impact has worldwide reach       because the methods       are generic and used by ecologists working on many different species, even       when the initial       methodological development was motivated by a particular application.
Impact is also significant,       because the species involved are often critically endangered and efficient       data collection and       analysis is essential to provide reliable inputs to management and       conservation programmes.
