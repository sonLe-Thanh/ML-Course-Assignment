     The discovery and understanding of the glass cliff by Ryan, Haslam, and       colleagues has led to two distinct types of demonstrable impact:     A. Informing public debate     Since its discovery, the term `glass cliff' has entered public discourse.
The concept now informs and shapes debate and the public understanding of       women's leadership positions.
This impact can be demonstrated in a number       of ways:            The media embraced the notion of the glass cliff, incorporating it         into analyses of women's leadership positions.
A Google news search for         `glass cliff' reveals over 160 news articles that refer to the glass         cliff.
A broader phrase search reveals over 21,000 hits which include blogs         (e.g., the Wall Street Journal blog, July 2012), HR websites (e.g.,         Human Capital Online, Oct 2008), and online resources for female leaders         (e.g., femalebreadwinners.com)       The UK media coverage has included all major British newspapers and         television stations as well as local newspapers.
The research has also         been represented worldwide2,3,4,5, from the Boston Globe to         the Calcutta Times, from CNN to Australian radio.
Importantly, while initial media coverage was restricted to reports         about the research project, in more recent years this has no longer been         the case.
The glass cliff is now frequently discussed without reference         to the research itself; rather the term has achieved the status of a         common phrase used within public discourse to explain women's         leadership.
Indicative of this, in 2011, of the nearly 1,600 web hits         which included mention of the glass cliff, over 500 of them made no         mention of the research or the researchers.
An economic value can be allocated to media activity.
According to HM         Treasury's method of "shadow pricing", which values exposure achieved at         what it would have cost to buy the `column inches', &#163;1.6 million of         media exposure were generated by the glass cliff between 2005 and 2010.
If `glass cliff' were a commercial brand this could be thought of the         value of the `marketing campaign' to establish it.
The New York Times1 named the glass cliff as one of the Top         100 ideas that shaped 2008.
B. Informing HR professionals, Industry, and Policy     Glass cliff researchers at the University of Exeter have actively engaged       in two-way knowledge transfer with both industry and public policy bodies.
Their aim is to address gender discrimination in the workplace by       providing evidence to challenge industry preconceptions and to engage with       businesses and organisations to educate them and help develop more       appropriate HR systems.
First, the researchers engaged with a large number of private and public       sector organisations and professional bodies.
These include the Chartered       Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD, Europe's largest HR and       development professional body with over 135,000 members across 120       countries)7.
Together with the CIPD the researchers produced       two publications.
One was a Change Agenda report, which outlined the       research and the implications for HR Professionals.
This document was       circulated free to all 135,000 members.
The researchers also produced a       more extensive Research into Practice publication, which provides HR       professionals with concrete directions about applying the research in       everyday practice.
This publication is available to buy through the CIPD.
Illustrations from just two of the leading organisations the team worked       with:     IBM reports the following changes in practice since 20109:            Catalysing changes in HR procedures to promote equality, which would         otherwise have been delayed or developed to a lower standard.
Changes         catalysed include:                Formation of a dedicated "Connect Women" group within the company to           engage the management on women's issues;         Extension of flexible time operating to a number of additional roles           within the company to increase the opportunity for female engagement;         Introduction of sabbaticals to support women having children and           continue their careers, addressing the current imbalance at the senior           management level;         Extension of part-time working and job sharing to a larger number of           roles.
In addition, the operator is a recognised global leader in its field.
Thus it was felt that their adoption of this agenda and enabling         policies would likely be copied by other companies within the industry         hoping to achieve best practice.
The Met Office reported the following changes in practice since       20108.
Positive engagement at the management level to support future research         collaborations in the field;       Restructuring of the current self-nomination bonus scheme, as the         current allocation method was felt to under-represent female employees;       Formation of a women's group and recognition of their activity by         senior management to influence HR policy making.
From 2008 onwards researchers have also worked directly with a number of       other large companies and organisations, including the EU       Directorate-General for Internal Policies, PriceWaterhouseCooper, the MoD,       Ford, British Association of Women in Policing10, Microsoft,       the Royal College of Surgeons, UBS, and The Association of Women       Solicitors.
This engagement included delivering seminars and tailored       workshops which function both as awareness raising activities and as       catalysts for real economic change through advising appropriate HR       strategies to address the current gap in female employment.
In addition, the researchers have recently been invited to engage with       government policy bodies, both at the UK level, through the Home Office's       Government Equality Office, and at an EU level.
The researchers were       invited by the European Parliament's Policy Department C: Constitutional       Affairs and Citizens' Rights to produce a briefing paper for EU       Parliament, and they presented the work in Brussels in March 20136.
