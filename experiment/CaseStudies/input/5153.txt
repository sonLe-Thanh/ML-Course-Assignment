     The research described above has influenced both individual countries and       international organisations to modify their influenza preparedness       policies and plans.
The following aspects are key.
Improving national pandemic planning and response capacities     Since 2008, research findings on existing plans for an influenza       pandemic, together with further capacity evaluations, have led some       governments in Europe and Southeast Asia to significantly alter their       influenza pandemic plans.
In the UK, for example, the published results on pandemic planning in       Europe led the government, through the Cabinet Office, to commission Coker       and Mounier-Jack to help develop cross-government strategy on human       pandemic and avian influenza.5.1 In addition, Mounier-Jack       became specialist adviser to the House of Lords inquiry into pandemic       preparedness in the UK in 2008, which stated: `we are enormously grateful       for her assistance'.5.2 During this inquiry she provided       insight and advice to scrutinise whether the response to the 2009 H1N1       pandemic was adequate.5.2 In 2011, she was also appointed       specialist adviser to a House of Commons inquiry reviewing scientific       advice and evidence in emergencies,5.3 and she contributed to       Dame Deirdre Hine's report on the H1N1 pandemic response.5.4       Specific recommendations to which she contributed included clarifying the       function and operation of the national flu line service and the need to       ensure adequate capacity for critical care, which was responded to by the       government.
An evaluation led by collaborators in the AsiaFluCap project revealed a       number of impacts in several Asian countries.5.5 Some of these       impacts occurred even before the outputs detailed in Section 3 had been       published, due to strong and ongoing engagement with policy-makers       throughout the programme of work.
In Taiwan, supplies of the anti-viral       drug, Osetamivir, were redistributed to ensure more equitable coverage       across administrative areas.5.6 Policies in Taiwan were also       revised to improve strategies for risk communication,5.6 after       these were identified as a weakness by AsiaFluCap.
In Indonesia, the       research led to a countrywide `Health Facility Framework Survey'       (`RIFASKES') by the National Institute for Health Research and Development       (NIHRD).
This, modelled on work conducted through AsiaFluCap, was carried       out in 2011 to enumerate and map health care resources across the country       and is informing policy on the allocation of health care resources across       Indonesia.5.7 In Cambodia, policy-makers are drawing upon the       research to support decisions around investments for preparedness.5.8     Based on responses of policy-makers, the AsiaFluCap evaluation also       concluded that the project had `strengthened cooperation and information       exchange between national ministries and government institutions, national       communicable disease control institutions, policy-makers, district health       care administrations and hospital administrations'.5.5 This is       echoed by the former Director of the Taiwan CDC who writes: `I applaud       Professor Coker's coordination skills to bring so many countries with       various cultures together, which in fact has also resulted in an informal       yet useful network to fight future infectious diseases in the region.
'5.6     An innovative software tool for influenza-related resource allocation       developed by Coker and colleagues on the basis of the research was       launched online in 2012 and allows policy-makers and other stakeholders to       estimate and display the availability, needs and gaps of 28 key health       care resources for a selected pandemic scenario in a country or region 	  (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/870).
The tool was considered among project partners, including several       policy-makers, to be very useful for informing policy decisions for       resource allocation, particularly at the national level and for major       hospitals.
Shaping global policy on influenza control     At the invitation of the UN System Coordinator for Influenza, Coker and       his team have contributed time and personnel to feed research findings       into the annual UN/World Bank reports 2006-2010.
The 2010 report       acknowledges the contribution of Coker's research, noting its usefulness       to `address priority setting for strengthening public health systems' and       calling upon the greater use of approaches such as those of his team to       `strengthen allocation of funding ... for countries with scarce       resources.
