     Saul's work on this subject has reached large audiences due to online       circulation of papers R1 and R2 above, and the Gendered Conference       Campaign online at Feminist Philosophers Blog (up to 20,000 hits/day),       which has drawn heavily on Saul's research (see below).
The BPA report       (item R3) has also been widely circulated to departments and related       bodies.
As a result of this, Saul's work has brought about the following       significant changes:     1.
Impact on the policies of departments (a few examples, others are       available):     a.
Many Philosophy Departments have formed Climate, or Equity, or Women       in Philosophy committees as a result of Saul's papers on implicit bias.
At       Sussex, for example, a key causal driver for this impact was the BPA/SWIP       report that Saul co-authored with Helen Beebee, which was endorsed by the       BPA, and presented to a meeting of all UK department heads with a request       to implement its recommendations (S4).
b.
At UCL, a member of the Philosophy Department reports `[Saul's]         paper, which many on the Widening Participation committee have read, was         influential in shaping our ideas about how we should make appointments         to staff posts.
When we advertised some temporary lectureships a year         ago, we trialled a new procedure, whereby we anonymised the applications         before circulating them to the committee.
This was in consequence of a         conviction that gender bias (as well as other biases) were likely         operating, and that a helpful countermeasure would be anonymity.
More         generally, the committee has been monitoring statistics for         undergraduate and graduate applications, success in admission, and         achievement and this too has been influenced by the attention drawn by         your work to unconscious biases.'
c. As a result of the circulation and discussion of Saul's papers on       implicit bias, Rutgers University Philosophy Department has launched a       mentoring scheme; and added online resources about implicit bias and       stereotype threat.
d. Saul's paper on implicit bias and stereotype threat is affecting the       pedagogical training of PhD students teaching philosophy at the University       of California at Berkeley (S2).
e. Research presented at the Implicit Bias       and Philosophy Research Network has led the Philosophy Department at Trent       University in Canada to adopt policies aimed at overcoming implicit bias       and stereotype threat.
2.
Impact on journals: As a result of Saul's work on implicit bias and       philosophy, Analysis has moved to triple-anonymous review (S3) and       The Journal of Philosophy has moved to double-anonymous review.
3.
Impact on conference organising: Saul's research provided the       theoretical underpinning for the Gendered Conference Campaign (http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/),      of which Saul was one of the organisers.
This campaign calls attention to       all-male conferences in philosophy, and argues that philosophers should       try to avoid organising such conferences in order to reduce stereotype       threat and implicit bias.
This campaign has had several impacts:            Impact on organisations such as the British Society for Ethical         Theory, which as a result has instituted a policy of seeking out women         invited speakers and has improved its anonymous review process for         submitted papers.
Impact on individuals: many individual conference organisers have been         in touch to tell Saul that they have changed their conference         organisation practices as a result of the Gendered Conference Campaign.
[text removed for publication]       There are three online petitions against all-male conferences (two         within philosophy and one in the sciences), which have their causal         origin in the Gendered Conference Campaign.
Together, they have more         than 2500 signatures.
4.
Impact on the REF: As a result of Saul's research, a member of the REF       organisation asked her for advice regarding ways for the Philosophy REF       panel to improve their practices with regard to gender equity, and the       panel will be implementing some of the recommendations, including the       raising of awareness about implicit bias, the use of excellent papers by       women in the calibration phase and checking ratings statistics against       gender data for possible evidence of implicit bias.
5.
Impact outside philosophy:     a.
The University of Massachusetts Amherst has now made it possible for       work to be anonymously marked, as a result of Saul's research (S1).
b. Forensic Sciences: as a result of Saul's research on bias, she was       asked to speak at a conference of the Forensic Science Society.
She has       continued consulting with a representative of LGC Forensics, who reports       that Saul's paper has led her to include bias in discussions regarding DNA       interpretation and as a potential factor in cases subject to appeal.
She       has just accepted an invitation to join the Advisory Board of the       Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology at the University of North Texas.
c. A member of the Psychology Department at Hunter College, who works       with universities around the world to improve gender equity, makes use of       the Gendered Conference Campaign and its resources in this work (S5).
d. The Central European University in Bucharest has now adopted a gender       equity policy for conference organisation, linking to the Gendered       Conference Campaign for advice on how to avoid all-male conferences.
e. As a result of a paper Saul gave to launch the Women at the University       of Sheffield network, the decoration of a major hall used for examinations       is being reassessed with particular attention to issues of stereotype       threat.
f. The Gendered Conference Campaign inspired a song, `I Like to See the       Ladies' by the band the 20th Century Monads.
