     The research underpinning the professionalization of coaching informed       the policy development of       the world's two major coaching professional bodies, the International         Coach Federation (ICF) and       the European Mentoring and Coaching Council (EMCC).
The Code of       Conduct (available at       (http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.self-and-co-regulation)       has had impact on Practitioners           and Professional Services by establishing the basis for both       these professional bodies to adopt       formal systems of self-regulation &#8212; recognised by the EU.
In this regard,       Surrey's research into the       professionalization of coaching can be seen to have: `changed         practice' for this group of       professionals, initiating practices shown to be effective by research; `influenced         professional         standards, guidelines and training'; enabled the use of `research         findings by professional bodies to         define best practice'.
Also the adopted recommendations on training       and supervision suggested       by the Surrey professionalization studies contributed to an `influence         on CPD' and `improved         standards in training' within the coaching profession.
It has also       had Economic, Commercial, and           Organizational Impact by helping to make this growing       occupational activity more sustainable by       ensuring standards of accountability and service quality (there are over       25,000 coaches belonging       to the two major professional associations covering over 100 countries;       http://www.coachfederation.org/;       http://www.emccouncil.org/ ) and       thereby reducing the risk of       harm and economic loss.
As a demonstration of the application of professional coaching standards,       the Silver Academy       project in SE England had the following Economic, Commercial,           Organizational Impacts: "at       least 20 new businesses; at least 13 existing businesses have become more       successful; at least       19 delegates achieved other successful outcomes from the programme"       (Reference 5.5 below,       p.9).
It has provided an on-going system of mutual support for       participants via a Silver Academy       Alumni Network, run by the participants themselves, that aims to "Organize       and conduct high       quality business events; Progressively develop the Silver Academy Alumni       network; Liaise with       local businesses and chambers of commerce; Generate sufficient funds to       finance events; Market       the Alumni group" (http://www.silveracademyenterprises.wordpress.com/business-owner-profiles/).
The       group has been posting information and events through this forum       continuously from its       2011 initiation until the present, well beyond the formal period of action       research which terminated       in September 2011, providing evidence of sustained economic and commercial       vitality for the local       economy.
Reach and Significance     Significance.
The Surrey research on the       professionalization of coaching was promoted by 2010-11       President of the ICF and circulated to the executive boards of both the       ICF and the EMCC prior       to their joint strategy meeting in Madrid in 2011 (reference 5.6 below).
By providing rigorous       evidence of the state of coaching relative to other professions, it       offered a robust evidence-base for       policy formation that has now shaped the professional standards of the       world's two most important       coaching bodies &#8212; and their collective membership.
The significance arises       from the centrality that       codes of conduct play in any credible professional body, especially one       with a global membership       of over 25,000.
The Silver Academy project's direct significance can be       evidenced by its success in fostering 20       start-up businesses in the UK and improving business performance for       existing businesses.
This       process of formation was directly associated with the application of       action-research techniques to       the process of coaching within the study group (individual case studies       from participants can be       found in reference 5.5 below; also reference 3.6 above).
However, it also       has indirect significance       in providing a case-study for the benefits of professionalised coaching       applications.
This holds       significance for the profession itself (consolidating its evidence base)       and for universities who       provide considerable volumes of training and CPD for coaches.
The Silver       Academy's Reach is       directly linked to the SE regional economy and to its EU partner in Poland       where 8 businesses       were created.
Indirectly, it has the potential for wider reach through the       dissemination of its       Coaching Toolkit through universities and the professional coaching       associations.
