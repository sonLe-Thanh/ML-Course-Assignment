     The non-academic beneficiaries in terms of positive economic impacts from       the underpinning       research are Nalco &#8212; which has a successful and effective commercial       product line specifically       developed with the problem in mind, and its customers who use this product       (Clean n Cor).
Clean       n Cor helps to decrease integrity risks by mitigating the potential for       under deposit corrosion in       production pipelines which has added benefits for the environment in       reducing the instances of       corrosion failures in high pressure lines and therefore ensuring a safer       working environment for       oilfield personnel.
Since 2008, Nalco has sold in excess of 17,000,000 kg of the product to       over 300 customers       including many of the super-major and major oil companies around the       world.
In the 5 years since       2008, the Clean n Cor technology has been Nalco's fastest growing new       product.
The success of       the original product has prompted several additional derivative products       utilizing the Clean n Cor       technology to address more specific niche applications.
Clean n Cor has been used extensively at over 300 oil production       locations worldwide, to impart       corrosion protection in aging production infrastructure and to maximize       water injectivity, with the       following economic and other benefits:            Clean n Cor is injected into fluids at very low concentrations of the         active materials (40 - 100         ppm) which ensures the application is extremely cost-effective.
From a corrosion control perspective, the technology allows operating         companies to utilize         lower cost steel alloys for the fabrication of injection systems thereby         reducing capital costs         dramatically.
Clean n Cor also protects against corrosion from naturally occurring         microbes in the system,         minimising impact to the environment and protecting personnel in         oilfield operations.
More         specifically Clean n Cor helps to minimize the deposition of solids         build up in the production         infrastructure and provides the protective film that mitigates         corrosion.
Minimizing the effects of         corrosion results in less failures, and ultimately safer working         conditions for employees.
Oil companies often operate in environmentally sensitive areas and the         improvement in         corrosion protection will ensure the potential for pipeline failures and         the resulting exposure of         production fluids into the environment is minimized.
This in turn         assists oil and gas companies         in preserving their licence to operate and protecting their corporate         brand.
Maximizing water injectivity has a dramatic impact on increasing oil         and gas production and this         is critical today as the global demand for oil and gas approaches the         global supply curve.
By         cleaning the hydrocarbon based deposits that build up in injection         systems, the injection         differential pressure into the formation is reduced therefore allowing         more water to be injected to         balance crude oil production and ensure reservoir production pressure is         maximized.
This has         resulted in increases of oil production that ranges between 50 - 100%.
Clean n Cor also minimizes operational costs that otherwise would be         incurred through having         to clean out injection wells as they start to plug up over time.
This is         not only a savings in         operational cost, but also a safety advantage.
The cleaning process         involves the use of heavy         machinery and employees operating on highly pressurized flow lines.
Clean n Cor helps to keep         the pipes clean chemically as opposed to manually.
To date, there are no other competing technologies to Clean n Cor in         the oilfield market place.
Although commercial sensitivity limits the range of specific impact         details that can be given here,         however the significance of this development and the important role         played by Hull researchers         was marked by the presentation by Nalco of a plaque to the Department of         Chemistry, University of         Hull in December 2011.
The award is "for collaboration in the area of         Surfactant Science that led to         the successful development of Clean n Cor".
