     TAMSAT's great impact stems from its skill, the longevity of the dataset       it has produced, the near-real time nature of the data it produces and its       direct links to decision-makers.
Its impact extends beyond rainfall       estimates to include food security; health planning; humanitarian aid; and       in economic planning as well as in capacity building of local       meteorological services and community resilience.
Rainfall estimates, drought and crop failure     The procedures developed have allowed the Unit to issue rainfall       estimates every 10 days and every month, at very high spatial resolution       (4 km nominally but reliable at around 10 km).
These estimates now cover       the whole of Africa and are widely considered to be, on average, as or       more robust, skilful and reliable than from more complex methods.5,6       It is particularly suited to identifying 10-day periods of above- and       below-average rainfall in real time, making it ideal for drought and food       monitoring.
The TARCAT climatology allows events and anomalies to be       defined.
TAMSAT has been shown to provide early warning of crop failures       caused by low precipitation during key stages of the crop growing cycle.
A       quote from the leader of the FOODSEC Action of the EC's Joint Research       Centre (JRC)5 explains the importance and quality of TAMSAT       data and how its wider use came about: "The JRC contracted TAMSAT to         provide improved data of rainfall estimates over Africa.
The TAMSAT         approach was expected to yield more reliable estimates thanks to the         local calibration approach compared to estimates derived from GCMs.
At         the Crop And Rangeland Monitoring workshop (Sept. 2011), it was         demonstrated that TAMSAT data was superior to other sources for         estimating accurately the extent of the drought that hit the Horn of         Africa in 2010-2011.
We started to use effectively the TAMSAT data in         our Crop Monitoring Bulletins (later renamed Food Security Bulletins)7,8       in 2012 because before then data suffered some artefacts in the         calibration process.
The recent release of a 30-year archive opens         possible other uses such as weather index insurance in agriculture.
The         bulletins we publish are mainly used by other European Union services         dealing with food aid, and food security in general.
They are European         Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), DG Development and Cooperation and         EU delegations in countries at risk of food insecurity (circa 15         countries in Sub-Saharan Africa).
The bulletins are also used by UN         agencies (FAO and WFP) ... and by some NGOs."
Planning humanitarian aid     A clear example of the value of TAMSAT research was provided by the       2011/12 Sahel crisis:9 18 million people across nine countries       were subject to drought-driven famine, and more than 1 million children's       lives were at risk.10 Warnings were initially broadcast in 2010       by USAID/FEWS- NET (a Famine Early Warning System)11, based on       the results of general circulation modelling.
As rainfall monitoring       became vital to understand the development of the crisis, TAMSAT was       utilized by agencies such as the UN's FAO6 (via the JRC and the Africa       Real Time Environmental Monitoring Information System), FSNAU (Food       Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit, Somalia) and FSNWG (Food Security       and Nutrition Analysis Working Group) (Nairobi)12.
TAMSAT       complemented independent rainfall monitoring by FEWS-NET and predictions       of large-scale crop yields based on satellite imagery of rainfall, as       pioneered by the Unit using TAMSAT data, became of vital importance.
OXFAM       and Save the Children consider the response was better than for previous       crises (more children received treatment for acute malnutrition in the       region than ever before, and the World Food Programme alone reached 5-6       million people with food aid10).
Shortfalls in the response       were defined to be political and organisational,13 but the       reliability and accuracy of the warnings was considered either "very good"       or "excellent".14 The IMPACT of TAMSAT data and science       continues to grow as governments and aid agencies learn how to make best       use of the warnings and rainfall monitoring.9     Distribution and use of estimates of crop and pasture yields     The Unit won the contract to provide data to the JRC's FOODSEC Action in       2008 because of targeted research (that was later published in Maidment et       al.
2012), demonstrating the value of adding TAMSAT data to re-analysis       data (e.g.
from ECMWF).
Since 2012, JRC and ReliefWeb bulletins7,8       use TAMSAT data to estimate crop and pasture food yields.
More than 40       regional and annual bulletins are published each year providing       qualitative and, where possible, quantitative yield forecasts at least one       month prior to harvest for the whole of Africa.
All the main agencies and       charities involved in African food security and aid (list available from       the Unit) receive TAMSAT data as part of the set compiled by FOODSEC and       used to help them define policy.
The bulletins are also used by UN       agencies to cross-check their own assessments.
As part of the MARSOP       project,3 TAMSAT's operational rainfall estimates support the       activities of the AMESD (African Monitoring of the Environment for       Sustainable Development) thematic groups through their data broadcasting       service, e-Station.
Additionally, the TARCAT dataset is instrumental in       the derivation of the Global Water Satisfaction Index (GWSI) for crop       productivity analysis within the FOODSEC Action.
TAMSAT data are now also       used by members of AfClix (the Africa Climate Exchange) set up by R.       Cornforth, a NERC KE Fellow in the Unit since 2011, representing a diverse       set of users across disciplines and sectors worldwide (for example,       recently supporting a flash flood early warning system in Sudan piloted in       the 2013 rainy season).
Capacity building and community resilience     In addition to providing data, an important aspect of TAMSAT is capacity       building of African national meteorological agencies.
In this, the       relative simplicity of the TAMSAT method is a major asset.
The Unit's team       now collaborates with 21 partner organisations, 10 of which are in Africa.
TAMSAT is also used by AGHRYMET15 to provide key and timely       information on the rainy season.
As, for example, noted by the Ethiopia       national meteorological agency "TAMSAT played an important role in         building capacity to generate quality rainfall products for both         real-time and historical data use in Ethiopia.
"16 The       Unit has run workshops in Africa, attended by 7 African nations, installed       custom-made training software and websites and taught MSc and PhD       students.
TAMSAT also has had a key role in building community-centred resilience,       as noted in a recent review9.
Specifically, TAMSAT allows       African meteorologists to monitor the progress of rainy seasons and to       give early warning of floods and droughts.
When allied to the 30-year       TARCAT dataset, TAMSAT data are already having applications: supporting       government and commercial insurance schemes for small farmers (for       example, index-based insurance contracts based purely on TAMSAT data are       now providing insurance cover for 8500 farmers in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia17);       limiting insect and fungal infestations; healthcare (there are very       promising programmes to exploit TAMSAT in predicting malaria outbreaks18,       the efficacy of which are now being tested), managing soil erosion,       planning drought and flood resilience programmes, crop diversification and       appropriate crop selection, planning strategic animal fodder reserves and       agricultural infrastructure, informing human and livestock vaccination       programmes.
The reach and the significance of TAMSAT's impact are huge.
The number of       under-nourished people in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be 234       million.
Through its role in increasing the resilience of African       populations to weather and climate shocks, TAMSAT has had major impact.
In       2010, TAMSAT received the IBM award for Meteorological Innovation That         Matters from the Royal Met.

The citation states: "TAMSAT         continues to deliver massive benefits to Africa in terms of essential         rainfall predictions ...[it] ... is used extensively by African weather         services, providing a unique and essential source of data.
This         technology providing precipitation information is of such importance in         developing regions, that it merits this recognition.
From its inception,         TAMSAT have shown how even the early generations of satellite technology         can be harnessed quantitatively to provide vital rainfall information         over a wide region."
