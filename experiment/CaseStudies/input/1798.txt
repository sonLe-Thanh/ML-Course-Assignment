     4a: Change in policy / guidelines     The results of the DCIS trial have had a direct and major impact on       health policy and guidelines around the world.
Examples include:             UK: The current UK National Institute for Health and Clinical         Excellence Clinical Guideline on treatment for early and locally         advanced breast cancer recommends: "Offer adjuvant radiotherapy to           patients with DCIS following adequate breast conserving surgery"         (paragraph 1.11.2) [5].
USA: Following the publication of long-term follow-up findings         from the UK/ANZ trial, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality         Appropriateness Criteria were amended to include the following         recommendation: "Breast conservation therapy (consists of           breast-conserving surgery to achieve negative margins followed by           adjuvant radiation therapy to the whole breast) is an acceptable           treatment alternative to mastectomy for women with localized DCIS           wishing to conserve their breast."
[6]        USA: A review by US authors in the International Journal of         Surgical Oncology in late 2012 stated that for DCIS, "Postoperative           radiation therapy in combination with breast-conserving surgery is           considered the standard of care, with demonstrated decrease in local           recurrence with the addition of radiation therapy."
[7]        CANADA: According to the Canadian Cancer Society, "External           beam radiation therapy is given after breast conserving surgery,           unless there is a medical condition that prevents a woman from           receiving radiation" [8].
Using data from our trial, Canadian         clinical practice guidelines developed in 2008 and revised in 2012 state         that for patients with DCIS, following breast conserving surgery,         adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy is recommended [9].
2028          4b: Change in clinical practice     Changes in policy and guidelines have been followed by changes in       practice.
For example:             UK: British Association of Surgical Oncology audit figures show         that in 2001-02 only 46% of UK patients with non-invasive breast cancer         who had undergone breast-conserving surgery received radiotherapy, but         by 2010-11 this had increased to 60% and the trend was rising (see         Figure 1 overleaf) [10,11].
USA: An audit of a large US Health Maintenance Organization,         Kaiser Permanente, in 2010 showed that 57% of 3,000 women treated for         DCIS in this organisation in the previous 10 years were given adjuvant         radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, and that the odds of a         woman receiving radiotherapy rose significantly over the time period of         the study [12].
Figure 1: Percentage of non-invasive breast cancers in the NHS       Breast Screening Programme treated by breast conserving surgery receiving       radiotherapy           4c: Change in morbidity     The greatest impact of adjuvant radiotherapy treatment for the affected       women is decreased morbidity resulting from reduced recurrence rates.
In       the UK each year, around 3,115 of the 4,650 women diagnosed with DCIS opt       for breast conserving surgery [13].
Without adjuvant radiotherapy 623 of       these women would face recurrence within ten years, but with adjuvant       radiotherapy, recurrence risk is reduced by almost 70%.
Based on current       figures, 60% of women who undergo breast-conserving surgery now receive       adjuvant radiotherapy (1869 women) each year, among whom 261 recurrences       are prevented.
