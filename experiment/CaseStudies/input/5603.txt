     The research outlined above has contributed to international practices of       conflict prevention       through applied performance practice-as-research, and delivered cultural       and artistic benefits       through its creation, inspiration and support for these new forms of       artistic and social expression       [a].
It has also enhanced and improved public awareness and       understanding of conflict issues and       contributed to widening public access to and participation in political       processes, especially in       Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
Cultural, artistic and social benefits in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan:       Through her integration of       local Kyrgyz cultural forms into applied performance practice-as-research       and her training of       Kyrgyz theatre artists, Breed has introduced applied performance as a new       form of artistic       expression in Kyrgyzstan.
This has allowed local communities to connect       with their cultural and       artistic heritage through participatory practices that also negotiate       contemporary conflict issues.
As part of projects described above, Breed directly trained some 144       youth and adults; many       more were trained by consultants using Breed's curricula.
Participants       went on to form 27       drama clubs in Kyrgyzstan, which have since engaged thousands of       additional beneficiaries       through public performances and training.
As a result, Youth Theatre         for Peace (YTP)       beneficiaries in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan total more than 47,000 people,       who have engaged       directly or indirectly with Breed's work through drama clubs and public       performances [b].
Following her training of trainers and subsequent youth workshops for YTP       in 2009, Breed       facilitated a sustainability workshop in 2010 and 2012 for adult trainers       and young people who       had been promoted to the role of youth facilitators.
As a direct result of       this training and of the       YTP programme more broadly, school drama clubs were established in       Kyrgyzstan and two       adult trainers were elected to paid positions with their village councils.
In those roles, `they       became prominent figures in their communities, raised issues and       challenges that they had in       their communities, and people voted for them because they could see that       they were actively       trying to solve these issues' [c].
Funding obtained in 2012 through USAID Kyrgyzstan was used in 2012-2013       to extend the YTP       project from the Chui and Batken oblasts to the Northern mountain oblasts       of Naryn and Talas,       where a further 60 trainers were instructed by Breed in participatory       practices and workshop       design.
Her training of 10 former trainers as `master' trainers for new       participants has extended       the reach of Breed's distinctive methodology &#8212; and of the cultural and       artistic benefits arising       from it &#8212; throughout the country.
The provision by the Kyrgyz Ministry of       Education of salaried       posts for teachers to continue theatre outreach work begun as part of YTP       has not only ensured       the sustainability of the benefits to programme participants in       Kyrgyzstan, but also delivered a       small but significant economic benefit via the creation of these new jobs.
A number of trainers and educators have initiated community projects       integrating Breed's       participatory performance methodology.Thus teachers trained by Breed have       used her       methodology to create sustainable networks and partnerships allowing       government and       community dialogue about, and responses to, conflict issues.
One has       developed ongoing       participatory theatre performances in collaboration with the prosecutor's       office to address justice       issues, stage scenarios related to new laws, and address issues related to       building tolerance in       Tokmak [d].
Another has worked with the Kyzkol Village Council to       address issues related to       the social inclusion of orphans through theatre practices and has       successfully launched       campaigns through a conference of 250 social pedagogues (March 2013),       leading to financial       support for orphans and acknowledgement of legal agreements from local       authorities [d].The       methodology has also directly influenced Foundation Tolerance       International's (FTI) institutional       practices, informing the integration of participatory approaches into FTI       conflict analysis and       prevention projects covering six oblasts and all four FTI offices [c].
In addition to training described above as part of the IREX YTP project,       Breed trained an       additional 30 adult trainers and 30 youth trainers for the UNICEF       Interaction of Young People       (IYP) project, which involved 15 schools in the Osh and Jalalabad regions       of Kyrgyzstan.
Drama       clubs subsequently developed from the initial training expanded to include       251 youth members,       and performances developed from theatre tours related to local conflict       issues have benefitted       an estimated 6,000 community members [e].
Raising public awareness of and changing attitudes to conflict:       The YTP project has had       demonstrable impacts on the adults and youths involved directly in it in       both Kyrgyzstan and       Tajikistan.
An independent 2011 evaluation analysis of the YTP programme       in Kyrgyzstan       involved an overall sampling frame of 144 project participants and, more       widely, of 15,000       people in 93 communities.
The evaluation showed marked and positive       attitudinal and       behavioural changes among both youth and adult program participants       towards people of other       ethnicities, religions and nationalities compared to a matched control       group.
12 focus group       discussions were conducted to assess the programme's effects on community       members (the       `audience' of the performances organised by participants), who weren't       involved directly in the       programme training events.
The evaluation found that in Kyrgyzstan:            Nearly 98% of program participants reported confidence in their         ability to positively         influence conflict situations in their community, compared with 31% of         the control.
Respondents in every focus group expressed their belief that the         programme methodology         could positively affect community cohesion in relation to conflict.
94% of youth participants reported a perceived increase in personal         agency in conflict         situations.
90% of youth participants reported a perception that they could speak         more openly and         in a more balanced way about conflict issues; 91% of those were assessed         by their local         adult mentors as being actually able to do so.
85% of youth participants reported increased empathy for `other'         groups (`empathy'         conceptualised as understanding the situation, feelings, motives, and         ideas of people of         other ethnicities, religions, or national origin.)
88% of youth participants reported more positive interactions with         those from other         ethnic or religious backgrounds [f].
The benefits to programme participants of this enhanced awareness and       understanding of       conflict issues &#8212; and of the ensuing changes in attitude &#8212; are further       evidenced by some of the       successes they have enjoyed since the programme.
Young participants have       become leaders       among their peers and in their schools, and to hold positions of       responsibility among, and       garner the respect of, adult community members.
For example, in 2011 one       youth participant       became the first female in her school's history to hold the title of       school President [g].
Improving understanding of and increasing participation in political         processes: Breed's       work has contributed to widening public access to and participation in       political processes in both       Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, where the new drama clubs and theatre tours       have engaged (in total)       more than 53,000 community members between 2010 and 2013 through the       staging of conflict       issues in partnership with local government officials [b, e].
Several of the performances were       devised during youth workshops facilitated by Breed in collaboration with       local artists and       partner organisations.
Applied performance is new to this region, and       individuals claimed that its       techniques provided the additional benefit of extending the ethos and       practice of participatory       approaches to the classroom environment.
Performance topics included human       rights issues       concerning domestic violence, bride kidnapping, water and land disputes,       and girls' education.
The participatory techniques allowed audiences to actively engage with the       dialogic       performances and to express their thoughts and feelings on conflict and       suggest potential       solutions to the staged conflict scenarios.
Those myriad proposed       solutions did, in fact, inform       policy-makers' discussion and debate both informally, through the theatre       performances       themselves, and formally, through meetings conducted with government       officials before and       after performances [b].
Impacts on education and training: Breed's participatory       performance workshops have       appeared in course syllabi for theatre and performance studies programmes       at the School of       Theatre and Dance UC Santa Barbara (USA) and Dartmouth College of Arts       (UK).
Since 2010,       Breed has also provided consultancy to the British Museum (BM) to       facilitate its The Tree of Life         Talking Objects project (March-April 2009) and to train staff,       partners and museum personnel in       the use of participatory techniques to enrich user-based approaches to       objects (June 2011).
The       Museum's dissemination of participatory approaches via its Talking         Objects project and peripheral       public engagement activities has enhanced public awareness of the utility       of such approaches.
These activities included the Museums and Participation: Unlocking the         Potential of Things       conference (20 March 2012), at which Breed facilitated an experiential       workshop with BM youth       panel members, demonstrating the Talking Objects methodology to       over 300 participants [h].
