     Our research, as cited in s2 and 3, led to the delivery, by Lotus       Engineering, of a major engine family project for a South East Asia       manufacturer [5.1].
Unfortunately, client details cannot be       included here due to extremely strict Lotus client confidentiality and the       scale of the investment.
Nevertheless, the research's impact is described       by Lotus as: "The valuable new knowledge, understanding and techniques         gained from Lotus's collaboration in the HOTFIRE project has directly         contributed to the successful delivery of a major engine family project         for an ASEAN region OEM client of Lotus Engineering.
Lotus has also been         able to bid for major work in China, both with established OEMs and         start ups.
This would not otherwise have been possible.
In addition to         the direct commercial value, a considerable amount of exposure has been         achieved in international learned symposia and in technical journals for         Lotus and its collaborative partners both from industry and academia."

Meanwhile, Continental Automotive France SAS, a major fuel injection       system and Tier 1 supplier to the automotive industry, has said "Especially         important was the understanding of the influence of non-symmetric valve         actuation on the fuel spray development and mixture process leading to         the design definition in the 3 cylinder demonstrator engine."
[5.2].
Since the pioneering HOTFIRE project, many major automotive OEMs (e.g.
BMW, Ford, PSA, Audi etc.)
are now developing and producing down-sized       three cylinder petrol engines to meet their aggressive fuel economy and CO2       emission targets [ref 3.2]; these investments represent $100Ms.
[5.3-6]     The economic and societal impact of these high specific power, low fuel       consumption and low emission engines is substantial: they provide       significantly lower operating costs and reduce impact on the environment       [see 3.2].
The Loughborough researcher Dr P Stansfield now works at MAHLE Powertrain       (the high performance engine design and component company), being active       in advanced engine powertrain system development working for a wide-range       of international clients.
Both MAHLE and Lotus are directly exploiting the       expertise gained by the Loughborough team's researchers in their latest       down-sizing engine programmes.
The HOTFIRE project won the automotive category at The Engineer       Technology and Innovation Awards (2008) [5.7].
The HOTFIRE project       was also chosen by the EPSRC for the transport category in their brochure       "10 WAYS WE HAVE MADE AN IMPACT" (EPSRC 2009) and was heralded as       an outstanding collaborative project between universities and industry [5.8,         5.9].
