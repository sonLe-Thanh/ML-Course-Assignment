     Process from research to impact: The Strathclyde team maximised       the economic impact resulting from its research through a series of       coordinated steps:            Instigating and then collaborating on the development and           commercialisation of new diamond product lines, by iterative           diagnostic assessment and proving the material in key applications.
Pioneering a diamond-enabled laser technology that was subsequently           commercialised.
Developing a diamond etch process [text removed for publication].
Identifying and developing the novel laser architectures needed to           enable new markets for diamond in photonics, for example as           heatspreaders in semiconductor disk lasers.
This impact was developed in partnership with Element Six Ltd,       drawing on their world-leading diamond growth capability.
The Strathclyde       team stimulated interest in, and then contributed to the development of       new diamond product lines by proactively taking to Element Six the       requirement for lower birefringence and absorption along with an       appreciation of the markets such material would address.
Strathclyde and       Element Six then worked together on an iterative process of diagnostic       assessment and growth development.
The Strathclyde team proved the       efficacy of the resulting new material in disk (2008) and Raman lasers       (2011), effectively completing a major design cycle and directly enabling       new product lines for the company.
(Sources A2 and D1)       The team was instrumental in building four substantial academic/industrial       collaborative projects: `NATAL' and `VERTIGO' (EU-funded); `ALFONSO' and       `MIDDI' (DTI-funded).
These involved working with companies such as Osram,       Toptica, LISA-LASER, Cablefree,       and Element Six to transfer to industry the technology       that was subsequently commercialised.
In parallel, the Strathclyde team identified the barriers to the       commercial uptake of diamond in photonics and the need for laser designs       that fully exploited the exceptional properties of diamond, putting in       place research programmes to overcome these hurdles.
The Strathclyde team       postulated and then proved the efficacy of high optical quality diamond in       advanced laser applications, and scoped the markets for diamond-enabled       laser technologies.
This included consultancy to scope the technological       challenges and market potential for diamond Raman lasers, influencing       Element Six's investment in this area.
The Strathclyde team was also the       academic partner on the DTI-funded `MIDDI' project (with Element Six)       that developed a precise etching technique [Reference 3].
[text removed       for publication]     Reach and Significance of the Impact:       a Sales Growth: [text removed for publication] head of the optical       business unit at Element Six, notes that "we have had a number of         experiences in recent years of existing and potential new customers         approaching us quoting results from Strathclyde".
This growth is       driven by the world leading optical quality of Element Six's single       crystal material, where the material and markets (for example       semiconductor disk lasers) were developed with support from the       Strathclyde team (Source D1).
b Improved Products &#8212; Diamond: Collaborative research with       Strathclyde has enabled Element Six to introduce new CVD       diamond product lines (2010-2012) to address markets in 1) Raman crystals       for frequency shifting of established laser systems, 2) intracavity       cooling elements for solid state disk lasers to enable higher power       systems, and 3) intracavity coolers for semiconductor disk lasers,       improving longevity and efficiency.
[text removed for publication]       Element Six's website notes the importance to these markets of reductions       in loss and birefringence (areas worked on with Strathclyde &#8212; References       5, 6), since this material is "particularly suited for the most         demanding optical applications", and that key markets include areas       pioneered by Strathclyde: "novel laser technologies, including         semiconductor and doped dielectric disk lasers" [References 1,2,4,6]       and "Raman laser applications" [Ref 6].
Photonics is the fastest       growing sector of the CVD diamond business according to Adrian Wilson,       Head of Technologies at Element Six (quoted in Electro-optics magazine,       July 2012).

c Improved Products - Lasers: M Squared Lasers Ltd entered       the marketplace for diamond- enabled lasers in 2012 with the purchase of Solus           Technologies Ltd.
These lasers utilise the intracavity diamond       heat spreader technology pioneered at Strathclyde [References 1,2,4,5] for       markets including high volume printing, semiconductor metrology and       scientific instrumentation.
[text removed for publication] Business       Development Manager at M Squared Lasers Ltd, notes that "the         pioneering research at Strathclyde on diamond-enabled lasers has been         influential in opening up a valuable new market for M Squared Lasers         Ltd" (Source D2).
