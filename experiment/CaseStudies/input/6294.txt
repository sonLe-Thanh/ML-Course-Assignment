     Highland Council policy     Our research is embedded in Highland Council's CPD Strategy for teachers.
The Director of       Schools described the research as having a `significant impact'.
The model       of curriculum       engagement developed in the research (sense-making opportunities; fitness       for purpose;       identification of barriers/drivers; cycles of curriculum development) is       significant in that it is now a       priority for Highland, reflected in council policy documentation.
Policy       and practice have been       directly influenced by two working papers and a research report.
The       research informed the 2012-13       CfE Strategic Plan, and the guidance for primary and secondary schools on       curriculum       implementation.
In 2012, Calum MacSween, the Council's Director of Schools, stated that:     The strength of the University of Stirling research is that it bridges         theory and practice.
For         example, in addition to the papers written for &#8212; and about &#8212;         developments in Highland, recent work         on Teacher Agency has been discussed by a sub-group of our CfE Strategic         Group and will be         discussed further in 2013 as we absorb the implications of the research.
[...] We plan to embed the         University of Stirling approach to Professional Enquiry Skills in a         developing CPD Strategy.
Highland Council schools     The research has particularly influenced the Council's professional       development programme.
In       December 2012, the 110 participants were awarded Professional Recognition       Certificates by the       General Teaching Council for Scotland.
In December 2012, Mr MacSween wrote that: Priestley and his team have         provided significant         levels of CPD which have invariably been praised as `making sense' by         practitioners...The         commitment to smaller scale events and encouraging class / school based         research have provided         us with a legacy of a small but committed group of staff committed to         professional research and         reflection and who will be agents of change when we get through this         `busy phase' of CfE         implementation.
The team's willingness to work at micro level &#8212; in         schools, in ASGs, with small         groups of subject or primary specialists &#8212; has left us with the seed         corn for future expansion into         school based curriculum research which will go deeper than the popular         TLCs.
East Lothian Council     Since 2012, the curriculum development model has been adopted by East       Lothian Council.
The       Council's Quality Improvement Officer wrote that it has enabled teachers `to         question [their]         approach to teaching and learning, [...] promoted professional         discussion about [their] different         approaches', and `made teachers more aware of the original         purpose of CfE'.
Darrin Nightingale,       Head of Education at East Lothian Council, has said that Several         papers by Professor Priestley         have been important in influencing key strategic decisions for the         education service in East         Lothian.
In particular, he described them as pivotal in our         decision to invest in a partnership with         Stirling University to support the authority's approach to curriculum         development and enhancing         teachers' professionalism.
This marked a change in the way we as an         education service were         prioritising staff development opportunities so as to offer more         collaborative, sustainable models       (October 2013).
More recently, Perth and Kinross Council decided to use       the research to inform       teacher development.
National policy     The research has influenced national policy, mainly through Education       Scotland.
Graham Norris,       Assistant Director for School Years at Education Scotland, said in October       2013 that the research       helped to inform actions now being taken at a national level by         Education Scotland.
A new team of         Senior Education Officers is using collaborative enquiry to promote         improvements in the         classroom, working with groups of practitioners in schools.
Education         Scotland is also in the         process of establishing a new national process of curriculum review         which will be on-going and will         involve all of those who have a stake in the curriculum.
The context and         planning for both of these         important work streams was informed by research carried out by Stirling         University, notably in         Highlands and in East Lothian education authorities.
In addition       SQA, as well as two councils, were       partners in our ESRC seminar series.
The research has been showcased in       seminars delivered to       the Scottish Government (June 2012; February 2013) and Education Scotland       (December 2012).
Finally, a 2011 paper by Priestley based on the research is reproduced in       an Open University text       for undergraduate and masters' students (C. Wise, P. Bradshaw &amp; M.       Cartwright (Eds.)
(2013)       Leading professional practice in education, Sage), with impact on       initial teacher education and       continuing professional development in the UK and beyond.
Public engagement and debate     Priestley has developed a role as a public scholar, with the aim of       improving public understanding       of the complexities involved in curriculum change.
Particularly since the       publication of Developing         Curriculum for Excellence: Summary of findings from research undertaken         in a Scottish local         authority in 2012, he has been in wide demand as a speaker and       commentator.
Details of the       research were widely published (including Times, Daily Mail,         Daily Telegraph, Scotsman, Herald),       on radio (Radio Scotland, 11/04/12) and TV (BBC Newsnight, 12/04/12).
References continue to       appear (e.g.
Times, 17/09/12 and an interview with Priestley in       the online US news site, Education         Week, 24/4/12).
This wider public engagement has helped improve the       quality of public scrutiny       and debate and contributed to improving public understanding of       educational research.
