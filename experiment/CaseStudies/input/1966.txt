     The research has had an impact on production of brassicas by enabling       growers to make better informed decisions about when to utilise fungicides       as part of their disease control management, which has had associated       economic benefits for growers.
It has also had environmental impacts       through a reduction in the use of fungicides.
The Agriculture and       Horticulture Development Board state that: `This research [is] highly         important to Horticulture UK PLC...the daily availability of accurate         predictions relating to the occurrence of crop pathogens and their         control allows UK businesses and producers to better plan their         production schedules and reduce damaging impacts of diseases...In         addition to impacting on commerce and saving money, correct         identification of disease can prevent the unnecessary application of         fungicides which will have positive impacts on the environment'.
(Source         A).
The outcome of the research fundamental to these impacts is the       development of the in-field rapid detection devices which allow the user       to determine whether a specific pathogen is present.
The device can be       used on its own by growers or in tandem with mathematical models that       predict when infection of crops from fungal pathogens is likely to occur.
NPARU itself provides such a model for brassica growers (Source B).
The model establishes whether a crop is theoretically at risk of       infection; then, where a risk is apparent, the grower (or alternatively a       consultant providing information to an agricultural network) can go into       the field and use the device to identify the specific pathogen in the air       and spray crops accordingly.
The primary impact of the research is thus on crop protection.
The vital       importance of diagnostics in crop protection is emphasised by       recommendations arising from a 2013 Food Research Partnership Stakeholder       Workshop (Source C).
Specifically the impact is on brassica crops.
A 2010 report produced for DEFRA predicts a &#163;43.1m potential increase in       value to the brassica industry if 100% control of fungal pathogens could       be achieved.ii Brassica producers, through use of this diagnostic         system, are now in a better position to limit significantly the impact         of fungal pathogens on their crops.
The extent to which this diagnostic system is used in the UK is evidenced       in a number of ways:            In 2012-13 approximately 1500 test kits were sold for the fungal         pathogen Mycosphaerella brassicicola which causes ringspot, a         major leaf disease in vegetable brassicas.
The 2013 Red Tractor Crop-Specific Protocols for Broccoli, Brussels         Sprouts, Cabbage and Cauliflower each explicitly require its growers to         use this system (Source D).
Red Tractor provides a Farm Assurance         Fresh Produce Scheme that allows retailers and consumers to have         confidence in the quality of the produce.
Many major retailers expect         growers to have this assurance; crop protocols act as a template for         good practice that growers must follow to gain this assurance and the         wider market access that comes with it.
78,000 farm enterprises are         signed up to the overall scheme.
A number of networks provide information to growers on a regional         basis using this system.
To give two examples:                the `Brassica Alert' operated by the Allium and Brassica Centre and           sponsored by Syngenta Ltd. (see http://www.syngenta-crop.co.uk/brassica-alert/)           disseminates information on the three major fungal pathogens (Alternaria             brassicae, Mycosphaerella brassicicola, Albugo             candida) to over 70 producers and growers in the Lincolnshire           region on a weekly basis (Source E).
Kettle Produce Ltd, a major producer of horticultural brassica crops           in Scotland, provides an information network for its 50 growers,           representing approximately 2,500 hectares.
In this case, information           relates to the light leaf spot pathogen caused by Pyrenopeziza             brassicae.
Kettle Produce Ltd have stated that `combining             this information with the appropriate fungicide spray regime and             variety has improved control of this disease in our production             system...The continual improvements you have provided...have given             us an invaluable tool in our battle against light leaf spot and have             radically improved our control of this disease helping us to             increase yields and secure the economic sustainability of Brussels             sprouts' (Source F).
The benefits of the diagnostic system have been disseminated to         vegetable growers through trade magazines such as The Vegetable           Farmer which has approximately 6,000 readers per month (Source           G).
The associated economic benefits for brassica growers are clear through       the increased yield arising from more effective protection of crops and       the decrease in costs through the reduction in fungicide use that goes       hand in hand with this approach (Source H).
An evaluation study of       the use of integrated pest management techniques in an Australian context       predicted that the use of such a diagnostic system increased farm profit       by 15% per hectare (Source I).
The environmental benefits of this diagnostic system are also apparent.
Evidence has shown that use of such a system leads to a significant       decrease in the number of fungicide sprays required: fourteen to just two       in this example (Source I).
This is in line with UK Government and       European Union policy on the rationalisation of fungicide use.
