            Impact on user involvement          The early research helped secure government funding in the late 1990s for       two voluntary sector       organisations promoting the needs of care-experienced young people: Voice       of Young People in       Care (VOYPIC) and First Key (NI).
First Key NI was later consolidated       within VOYPIC.
`Research at Queen's was important to making the argument for setting up       VOYPIC and has       continued to help shape our agenda.'

Queen's research features on VOYPIC's own research resource &#8212; their       `Library in the Sky'.
Changing the way policy makers and practitioners think          One early impact of the studies conducted at Queen's was to change the       way that policy makers       and practitioners thought about the care system (Reference 1).
This was       not just an `academic'       change, but one with implications for service development.
For example,       Pinkerton's pioneering       1996 study documented the poor outcomes of care leavers in NI, including       their low rates of       educational achievement, housing insecurity, unemployment and early       parenthood.
The study       introduced concepts such as `care career' and `outcomes', encouraging       policy makers and service       makers to think about the `whole system' and the impact of service       provision across the child's       lifetime in care, and beyond.
Together with later research on the needs, care experiences and outcomes       of looked after children       (Reference 6) research at Queen's reinforced for policy makers the       importance of understanding       the individual needs of children in care within the complex social and       emotional worlds of their       placements.
`The care population and the population of children on the edge of care       is not a       homogeneous group but in fact consists of different smaller groups with       differing needs for       whom a variety of services need to be available.'
DHSSPS (2007) Care         Matters in Northern         Ireland p.18.
http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/care-matters-ni-3.pdf     Importantly, these studies also established connections between the       situation in NI and       INTRAC &#8212; a global network of researchers concerned with care leavers &#8212; established 	  following a       seminar at Queen's in 2003 (Reference 9).
Impact on the research infrastructure in Northern Ireland          A very significant impact of the early research conducted by Pinkerton,       Iwaniec and Kelly was the       establishment of a research centre at Queen's.
This was the decision of       the then Department of       Health and Social Services, in partnership with the Health and Social       Services Boards (responsible       for commissioning services) and Queen's.
It was to be a University-based       research centre       connecting with similar centres across the UK, Ireland and       internationally, but focusing on high       quality research to inform the policy making process around child welfare       in Northern Ireland (see       Reference 1, Chapter 13).
This centre is now the Institute of Child Care       Research.
Impact on service development          Queen's researchers strive both to develop and use a strong legislative       and policy mandate.
This       ensures that practitioners and service designers better understand, and       more effectively manage,       children and young people's pathways through care in ways that provide       stability and boosts their       capacity to cope.
Queen's research on children in care therefore makes its       impact as part of a       regional child welfare system into which it is well embedded, as the       following quotes illustrate:     `The Queen's work on adoption provided the regional underpinning to the       policy direction       agreed for adoption (Adopting the Future) which we hope will legislated       for next year'       DHSSPS (Adoption Lead)     The international engagement with other policy centres led to Northern       Ireland policy makers being       introduced to research by Chapin Hall (University of Chicago),       demonstrating the benefits of       extending support to care leavers beyond the age of 18.
This, combined       with Pinkerton's work on       care leavers in NI, resulted in the Northern Ireland government committing       to funding the GEM       (Going the Extra Mile) Scheme (piloted 2006, formally launched 2010).
`The work at Queen's has been a crucial part of developing the evidence       informed leaving       care policy and practice we are striving for.
It has helped provide the       local and international       evidence for initiatives such as the GEM Scheme promoting post care       continuity and stability       by enabling young people to remain with foster carers.'
NI Health         &amp; Social Care Board         (Leaving &amp; Aftercare Lead)     NI was the first of the four UK jurisdictions to introduce such support.
The progress that has       been made regionally was recognised by the 2010 Demos Report on Children       in State Care in       the UK which used Northern Ireland as an illustration of best practice (http://www.demos.co.uk)            Impact of the Care Pathways and Outcomes Study          McSherry's team have carefully tailored reports of this ten year       longitudinal study to different       audiences in an endeavour to disseminate the findings widely and in ways       that maximise impact.
Audiences include politicians, policy makers, service providers, social       workers, carers, and children       looked after (see http://tinyurl.com/pzswy35 for a cartoon based account of this complex study).
The specific impact of the Care Pathways and Outcome Study was apparent       in the response to the       publication of the findings from its most recent phase (Reference 8) which       was launched by the       Northern Ireland Minister for Health and Social Services at a British       Association for Adoption and       Fostering/ICCR partnership event:     `I want to congratulate the research team at Queen's University for       undertaking this important       study.
It is vital that we carefully consider the key messages emanating       from such research       to inform future policy and determine best practice on how to meet the       long term needs of       children in care.'
Health and Social Services Minister     The current Research Director of the Department that funded this       study, and other key       stakeholders, also provide evidence of the impact of this study in NI:     `While this study provides a positive contribution to the experiences and       outcomes of looked-after       children, it also focuses on those areas which require significant       attention from policy       makers; service managers and practitioners.
It provides an evidence base       for decision       making in relation to the health and wellbeing of young children being       looked after.'
Director         of Health and Social Care Research and Development.
`We are delighted to hear about the particular progress in the numbers of       children being       adopted in the Northern and Southern Health and Social Care Trust areas.
Their use of       specific organisational structures and specialist staff to help with       adoption is welcomed by       BAAF.'

`This report must be considered highly important for policy and practice       in Northern Ireland       given its breadth, the similarity of the groups and the variations in       decision making.'

`This booklet is extremely relevant to social work practitioners,       solicitors and the courts and       an essential addition when considering the children of today.'
Assistant         Director of the         Northern Ireland Guardian Ad Litem Agency.
`This is a timely and important report for both policy makers and       practitioners ... To promote       the outcomes that we desire for our Looked After Children and Young       People, it is important       that we take on board the key messages emanating from this report.'

`These findings have influenced our policy in terms of ensuring that       birth parents are       supported when children return home from care.'

Wider impact          At the same time, the `whole child/whole system' perspective was being       further developed at       Queen's.
An article by Pinkerton, explaining this perspective on leaving       care, was included in an       issue of Development and Transition, a journal published by the       United Nations Development       Programme/London School of Economics and Political Science.
This was then       circulated world-wide       through the Better Care Network, UNICEF &#8212; Child Protection Section.
Keynote presentations have been made to policy makers and practitioners       at conferences and       seminars in Australia (Melbourne), Taiwan (Taipei), US (Chicago) and South       Africa (Cape Town).
The work also attracted Doctoral students from Romania, Ukraine, Ghana and       China.
The first of       these now chairs a project in Brasov which uses the concept of the `care       career' and conceptual       tools developed by Pinkerton to inform its work.
The tools include the       `leaving care coping wheel':       this provides practitioners and service designers with a useful, visual,       representation of everything       that needs to be in place to address the needs of care leavers (e.g.
guidance and support, practical       and social skills), and the importance of linked support from a number of       agencies.
Another project       in Cape Town, initially aiming to provide a residential aftercare service       chose instead to develop a       mentoring project on Pinkerton's advice.
The work of the Ghanaian PhD       graduate (Frimpong       Manso) has been used to demonstrate `promising practice' for promoting the       2009 UN Guidelines       on Out of Home Care.
