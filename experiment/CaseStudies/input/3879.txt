     The impact of this methodological programme of research has extended well       beyond academia, impacting on the health and welfare of patients, service       redesign and the well-being and research capability of practitioners.
A       further area of impact, simultaneously exploring staff experience and       quality of patient care, is emerging (e.g.
the ongoing Improving Patient       Experience of Care study).
Rehabilitation post Intensive Care:            The PRaCTICaL [1,iii] study influenced the redesign of         co-ordinated care after ICU discharge with the implementation of a         modified model of the nurse-led clinic.
One Scottish NHS Board has         offered this service to all survivors since 2008 (approximately 250         patients per year), leading to the establishment of the first         patient-led support group (locally) and a developing web-based resource         for all patients in Scotland.
NICE guideline CG83 (Critical Illness Rehabilitation) cites the         PRaCTICaL study [2,iii] as a key contributor to the evidence         base to inform development in ICU service delivery.
Evidence [1,i,ii] informed the local implementation of an intensive         care liaison service and a nurse-led intensive care follow-up service.
These posts support patient recovery post-ICU through hospital visits         and invitations to return to follow-up clinic, meeting the unmet needs         of ICU patients and relatives before and after hospital discharge.
Further innovative research is currently evaluating the role of a         generic health care assistant in supporting patients from ICU to         hospital discharge [1,3].
This research, [ii] has been cited in two         influential systematic reviews (e.g.
[4]), informing the evidence base         routinely used in clinical practice and delivery of critical care         services.
This research has been adopted in the work of the Scottish         Critical Care Research Liaison group, which has emerged over the last         2-3 years.
The group is a subgroup of the Critical Care Specialty Group         with strong links with the Scottish Critical Care Trials Group and the         Edinburgh Critical Care Research Group.
The ICEQ and subsequent recovery research has considerable         international reach.
The ICEQ has been translated into Swedish         (Masters dissertation) and Turkish.
In 2010, in collaboration with         established critical care researchers from Griffith University,         Australia, the Scottish Critical Care Interdisciplinary Research and         Liaison group hosted an Economic and Social Research Council-funded         international summer school for early career researchers.
A second event         was held in the Gold Coast in 2011, with a third in Finland in 2013.
A         corroborative statement confirms the reach and significance of this         research [5].
Psychosocial risk in healthcare staff:             Jones &amp; Johnston (1999) [iv] has influenced educational and         pedagogical practice in the University of Nevada.
The SNSI has         international impact, being used to evaluate the effects of clinical         placement innovation on distress and academic performance of student         nurses in Nevada [6].
The SNSI has been administered in a web-based form         to evaluate student nurse well-being and to evaluate the effect of         Faculty support to improve well-being and performance in foreign born         Baccalaureate Nursing students in Texas Women's University [7].
Jones &amp; Johnston (1999) [iv] has guided the         redesign of Nursing and Midwifery educational programmes to reduce         sickness absence and attrition which are costly, affect student         progression, establish patterns of behaviour that endure into practice         and affect patient care delivery [6, 7].
Jones &amp; Johnston (2000) [v] is cited in 2010 NICE Public         Health Guidance 22: Promoting Mental Wellbeing at Work (2009) and in a         NICE economic analysis publication reaching over three million staff         employed in the NHS and local government (at 2010 levels of staffing)        [8,9].
Jones &amp; Johnston (2000) [v] subsequently         influenced the design and assessment strategy of a study exploring         psychosocial risk and physical activity in healthcare students in Wales.
A real-time diary-based approach to the assessment of psychosocial         risk [vi] has been used to evaluate the effect of health policy on the         work performance of senior charge nurses in Tayside.
This         NHS-commissioned research evaluates the implementation of Leading Better         Care (Scottish Government 2008) and is referred to in the NHS Tayside         Nursing and Midwifery Governance Framework (2009) [10].
The SNSI, ICEQ and related methodological papers are influencing         professional knowledge, understanding and practice in developing         questionnaires for clinical use.
These methods have been used to develop         the Valuing Patients as Individuals Scale to evaluate patient experience         in Acute Medicine in NHS Tayside (see corroborative statement from NHS         Tayside [10]).
