     This research has impacted three beneficiaries:             Television &#8212; broadcasters and production companies have         employed our technologies and expertise to produce features for existing         TV shows and to innovative new TV formats.
Advertising &#8212; agencies and their clients have engaged us to         help deliver unusual marketing campaigns for visitor attractions,         amusement rides, horror films and even cars.
The Public &#8212; a series of live exhibitions of biosensing         controlled rides at Science centres and festivals have directly engaged         thousands of people with our research, while the above-mentioned         television broadcasts have reached many millions more worldwide.
1.
Television     Our research into broadcasting riders' physiological responses to       spectators reported in [1], along with our proposals for documenting       rider's experiences reported in [2] and [3], have led television companies       to experiment with incorporating biodata into TV programs.
Their       motivations have been to provide close-up and unusual views of intense       experiences such as riding rollercoasters, but also to help support a       common narrative of the `scientific' investigation of such experiences.
Each of the TV features, in the edited selection below, applied the       techniques for broadcasting close up views of riders' experiences reported       in [1,2,3,5,6] to professional television production:            An extended feature in the Discovery Networks         International-commissioned programme Engineering Thrills produced by         Waddell Media and first broadcast worldwide in October 2008 [http://youtu.be/6LOQtclGnYY].
An article that ran across two episodes of the BBC 1 Blue Peter         flagship children's show in March 2009 in which presenters tested a         rollercoaster by riding it while wearing biosensors so that their         physiological responses could be shown and discussed back in the studio         [http://youtu.be/FM8GET0f6rU].
An article on The One Show in which presenter Christopher Biggins         experienced a vertical drop rollercoaster that aired in October 2009 [http://youtu.be/fx6y4DMo8No].
A feature article on the Discovery Canada popular science magazine         show Daily Planet, that aired in November 2011 [http://youtu.be/RBZmFH0roF4]       A feature article on the BBC popular science programme Bang Goes The         Theory that aired in August 2009 [http://youtu.be/IpBlm4pOT0Q].
A June 2011 article on ITV Daybreak that shows a Thrill Laboratory         experiment on breakfast TV presenter (broadcast and online) [http://aerial.fm/docs/update.php?id=157:33:0:1]       The lead article on the BBC's Blue Peter in May 2013 in which the         show's two presenters compared their reactions to Alton Towers' new         ride, `Smiler' [http://youtu.be/hwESXZSlJ94].
Not only did these various productions build on our published research,       but also they employed our researchers as creative, technology and data       analysis consultants and directly used the technologies that we have       developed to capture, analyse and visualise biodata.
These productions led to further impact through an extended collaboration       with the TV production company RDF [A] to explore the wider potential of       biosening to underpin entire new television formats.
RDF commissioned us       to work on pilots for two new shows: `Honey I'm Hot Again', a not-for-air       makeover pilot for Discovery Channel in 2010; and `Fright Club', a       not-for-air game show pilot for E4 in 2012.
These led to the award of a       TSB IC-Tomorrow `Digital Innovation in TV Award' in February 2013 that       included an opportunity to pitch new format ideas to Channel 4, Maverick       TV, Zodiak TV, BBC News and MTV Networks.
Feedback from the TSB stated       that all industry members wish to talk further about incorporating our       research into industry projects [B].
2.
Advertising     The same research has also been exploited by marketing companies to       create innovative campaigns for thrilling products.
Drawing on the       approach reported in [1,2,5,6], Merlin Entertainments Group [C], the       world's second largest provider of visitor attractions, used our       technology and know-how to market two new attractions, a `horror maze'       themed around the film Saw VII at Thorpe Park, and a new interactive ride       at The London Dungeon.
Summit Entertainment (part of the global film       production and distribution company Lionsgate) engaged us to help produce       a promotional trailer for their horror movie Sinister in which audience       members' `fear factors' were measured as they watched a pre-screening of       the film.
These led us to being engaged as consultants by the global       advertising agency TBWA to support their "Built to Thrill" brand       activation campaign for the NISSAN Juke car which involved us conducting a       series of thrill experiments to measure peoples' physiological responses       to various driving-related thrilling experiences.
The results were       incorporated into four short films [http://youtu.be/MS3qIvA_vNQ]       that appeared on the campaign website that reached 164,000 consumers [D].

The Public     Working with rides and other thrill experiences has also captured the       public's imagination and proved attractive to science communicators.
Our       research has therefore also delivered significant impact through public       impact, engaging millions of people with the potential use emerging       biosensing technologies to help us understand the physiological and       emotional aspects of thrill.
Festivals     Building on the approach described in [1,5,6] and the specific       breath-sensing technologies reported in [4] we have been commissioned by       science communicators to engage thousands of people with a hands-on       experience of our research at festivals and exhibitions, including EPSRC's       Pioneers exhibition in 2008 [http://youtu.be/Iz7ZM7EnGVQ]       where we exhibited the bucking bronco ride from [4], The 2011 Cheltenham       Science Festival for which we created PerPing, a breath-controlled       `tennis' game [http://www.thrilllaboratory.com/experience/PerPing.html];       and the Mayhem Horror Film Festival in 2009, 2010 and 2011, where we       conducted `fear experiments' on audience members who watched classic       horror films [http://aerial.fm/docs/projects.php?id=136:0:0:0].
The Pioneers exhibit was subsequently nominated for the International       Digital Arts award at Future Everything, the UK's leading annual festival       of digital arts.
Television     The television features described above have many millions of viewers.
For example, BBC's One Show typically attracts over 5 million viewers and       Bang Goes the Theory over 3 million viewers.
Waddell media, producers of       the early Discovery Channel programme on roller coasters, estimate that it       will have received over 5 billion views as a result of regular repeated       broadcasts across multiple international regions [E].
Radio coverage has       included BBC World Service [http://bbc.in/NfMMbe]       and You and Yours.
Press     The various activities described above have generated extensive press       coverage, impacting on further millions.
This includes coverage in the New       York Times (February 2008), Daily Mirror (October 2008) [http://mirr.im/18PFaKj],       Observer Magazine (May 2009), the BBC's Focus science magazine (August       2009) [http://sciencefocus.com/feature/thrill-engineers],       Guardian Science Weekly (November 2010), the Independent (August 2011),       New Scientist (May 2011) [http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/05/amusement-park-rides-that-know.html], and       the London Evening Standard (June 2012).
Our research featured as the       cover article of The Times' Eureka science supplement in January 2010 [http://www.aerial.fm/docs/content/Eureka.pdf]       and as the cover article of the September 2013 edition of Communications       of the ACM [6], which reaches 100,000 computing industry professionals       worldwide.
