     The USB2000 has had widespread international reach and is now considered       "the new de facto standard in measuring volcanic gas emission rates",       according to the former Director of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory       [S1].
The unit has been deployed to almost every degassing volcano on the       planet, in over twenty five countries and on every continent, for       operation by volcano observatories, the governmental agencies responsible       for volcano monitoring and eruption prediction.
Since 2008, well over       10,000 survey days of service have been achieved, in countries such as:       Costa Rica, Nicaragua, New Zealand, M&#233;xico, Colombia, Ecuador, El       Salvador, France (R&#233;union), Vanuatu, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the       USA, Italy, Russia, Japan, Indonesia and Chile.
This technology has       particularly expanded access to valuable volcanic gas data across the       developing world.
For instance, a volcanologist working within the Centre       for Volcanology and Geological Hazards Mitigation in Indonesia states that       the "USB2000 is far smaller, lighter and cheaper than the Correlation         Spectrometer previously used in this context and as such is far more         suitable for field operation... For this reason these units have been         used extensively now across South East Asia and Oceania, significantly         increasing the volume of data we now have on volcanic degassing in the         region" [S2].
The techniques devised by McGonigle have led to considerably more       accurate and higher time resolution volcanic gas observations than       available previously.
The significance of this is confirmed by a scientist       within the United States Geological Survey (USGS) who states that: "volcanologists         are now able to study far faster and subtler processes than possible         previously" and that "This means we can monitor volcanoes in far         more detail than in the past, with impact upon our capacity to forecast         eruptions...These instruments have been used by USGS and extensively         across the globe in monitoring operations and are a valued part of the         surveillance we perform on the United States volcanoes in order to         determine hazard levels in our efforts to ensure appropriate civil         protection for US citizens" [S3].
The former Director of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory further       outlines the significance of this enhanced monitoring capability for civil       protection measures: "Hence we now have a far more robust means of         constraining activity and the transitions from passive to eruptive         behaviour with significant implications for our capacity in forecasting         and in civil protection" [S1].
In addition, a volcanologist within       the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia indicates that       the operation of these units on the Italian volcanoes has led to "completely         new insights into how these systems work" and hence a "far more         accurate means of monitoring activity and forecasting eruptions"       [S4].
The USB2000 and UV camera approaches have therefore provided       considerably improved models and data to inform monitoring and predictive       efforts worldwide.
The international reach of these new methods has been expedited by       McGonigle's authoring of a series of freely downloadable computer programs       (VolcanoSO2.exe, Vulcamera and UVolc).
The programs facilitate the use of       the USB2000 (and the recent USB2000+ upgrade) and the UV cameras by       volcanologists, the majority of whom are non-expert in the underlying       science of spectroscopy and would not be able to benefit from this       technology without such codes.
A member of the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption       Response Team in Russia comments that: "we have been using the UVolc         software for controlling miniature USB2000+ spectrometers to measure the         volcanic gas releases during a number of eruptions", and that the       code is "easy to use by non-experts" and "leads to far more accurate         results than available previously.
This approach to developing no cost         software for wide circulation across the volcano community is a great         help in ensuring the wide reach of these very helpful new technologies"       [S5].
Since 2008, these programs have been downloaded around 100 times       (this corresponds to over 80% of the global user community, which numbers       approximately 120), and McGonigle has personally trained volcanologists       from Italy, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, the USA and the UK in his       novel hardware and software protocols for measuring volcanic gases.
This impact was recognised in McGonigle's Rolex Award for Enterprise and       has led to extensive media coverage through outlets such as the National         Geographic and Discovery channels, the BBC homepage (18       November 2008), and over 1,000 articles in 27 countries in print outlets       such as: The Telegraph, The Observer, El Pais, Le         Monde, International Herald Tribune, Wired, Esquire       and La Repubblica.
McGonigle's research has also been profiled in       Geographical magazine (February 2009) and Italian Vogue       where he is cited as "one of the world's foremost volcanologists" and as       having caused "a minor revolution in the field".
