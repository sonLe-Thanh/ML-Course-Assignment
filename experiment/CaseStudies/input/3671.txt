     TT Electronics plc.
is a global electronics company supplying the world's       leading manufacturers in the automotive, defence, aerospace,       telecommunications, computing and industrial electronics markets.
They       have average annual sales of over &#163;500 million and employ over 6,000       people worldwide at manufacturing, engineering and sales support       facilities in North America, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Barbados, Malaysia,       Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, India and China, with sales to major OEMs       including BMW, MAN Trucks, Daimler, BAE Systems, Selex, Smiths detection,       Thales, Boeing, Airbus, Schneider, Hager, Philips Medical and GE Medical.
The outcome of the Unit's research is the novel CuAlMo alloy film       material.
This has had the following economic and commercial impacts for       TT Electronics plc.
:            Launched a full scale production in January 2010 (4.8 million units         per year) and satisfied market needs for the precision low current         measurement in power management applications with a large number of         clients across the globe.
Invested &#163;750,000 in a new production line in 2007 to manufacture 4.8         million resistors per year, which in turn generated new production jobs.
Created new full time jobs for the new production facility, in         September 2009, thus increasing the number of employees by 2% at Welwyn         Components Ltd. (TT Electronics plc.
plant in Bedlington, UK).
Increased the competitiveness in a new electronic component market         (since 2010 till present) and won additional contracts with 12 new         clients in the power management market sector, estimated to be worth &#163;2         million over the next four years.
Incorporated the newly developed material into the manufacturing of         existing resistor products (24 million units per year) in March 2010,         which reduced the production costs by 10%; through savings in resources         such as equipment, power and material consumption and labour.
The         additional income generated as a result of using the new material for         the production of existing resistors is currently at &#163;120,000 per annum       Reduced the number of vacuum deposition machines from five to two in         November 2010, which led to a significant reduction in corresponding         overhead costs related to the electricity and gas consumption and the         maintenance by 60%.
Since the developed thin film is also thinner, it is         therefore easier to cut through at the subsequent laser trimming stages,         which in turn has reduced the time from production to the market          This impact is corroborated in the following statement from the Global       Product Line Director at TT Electronics plc.
:     "The development of this new low resistivity thin film resistor         material has been of significant benefit to TT electronics.
The research         collaboration between Northumbria University and TT electronics focussed         on the development of a new precision resistor material which is used to         satisfy a gap in the global market for precision current measurement in         power management applications.
The end result of the research was in the form of a material         composition of CuAlMo which not only satisfied this requirement but also         allowed a wider range of resistor values to be manufactured at lower         costs, providing savings in material, labour and overheads.
This work         has also been instrumental in the setting up of a new &#163;750K surface         mount thin film chip resistor production line at TT Electronics plc.
This line now produces around 5 million resistors per annum and has         created new jobs for full time production operators.
In summary the research work of a group of academics at Northumbria         University on the development of a new precision current sense resistor         material has been vitally beneficial for TT Electronics commercial         activities in targeting a new growing market and generating new business         and also in reducing cost of production of existing products."
