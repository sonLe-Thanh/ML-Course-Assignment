     1) Diagnostic genetic testing is now available for all patients         diagnosed with neonatal diabetes.
Multiple laboratories in Europe       and the USA have set up testing for neonatal diabetes.
However, for those       patients in countries without genetic testing laboratories or for whom the       cost of testing is prohibitive, the Exeter laboratory provides rapid       testing at no cost to the patient or their parents (funded by the Wellcome       Trust).
Patients continue to be referred for testing from across the world       and, to October 2013, 1169 referrals had been received from 77 countries       across 5 continents.
The number of patients diagnosed with a KATP       channel mutation causing neonatal diabetes had increased from 10 reported       in the first publication (2004) to 454 in October 2013.
2) Public awareness of neonatal diabetes and the need for genetic         testing has been raised.
In July 2009, the Royal Society hosted the       first Neonatal Diabetes Open Day for families whose lives have been       changed by this research.
45 families came from across the world to       celebrate the life-changing transformations they have experienced.
Colleagues in Chicago (USA) were inspired to create a US registry and held       their first Neonatal Diabetes Family Meeting in June 2010.
Facebook groups       have been created by parents and parent-led meetings have followed.
3) Most patients found to have a KATP channel         mutation can stop insulin treatment and achieve better glucose control         with sulphonylurea tablets.
For most patients their glucose control       on insulin was outside treatment targets but on sulphonylureas glucose       levels are maintained within treatment targets and often close to the       levels in people without diabetes.
More than 500 patients worldwide have       now had their diabetes therapy changed and many more newly diagnosed       individuals who would otherwise have been prescribed insulin therapy, are       being treated with tablets.
4) Changing from insulin injections to sulphonylurea tablets improves         quality of life by stopping pain at injection sites and removing the       many restrictions on life that are imposed by multi-injection or insulin       pump therapy.
The regulation of insulin secretion in response to ingestion       of food means that the patients' diet is no longer tightly restricted.
They also experience fewer hypoglycaemic episodes.
5) The better glycaemic control achieved with sulphonylureas will         reduce the future risk of diabetic complications including heart       attack, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and neuropathy.
6) Many of the 20% of patients with neurological impairment have seen         an improvement in their motor skills, cognitive function, speech,         concentration, sleep and behaviour.
Reports from parents have been       substantiated by teachers and healthcare professionals.
The early       diagnosis made possible by clinical diagnostic genetic testing means that       the maximum number of patients can benefit from improved neurological       outcome as well as better diabetes control and lifestyle gains.
7) Reduced healthcare costs due to the cheaper treatment       (sulphonylurea tablets vs insulin), reduction in blood glucose monitoring       and reduced risk of diabetic complications later in life.
For example,       colleagues in the USA (g; below) estimate that genetic testing followed by       transfer to sulphonylureas and consequent improved glycaemic control saves       $12,528 per patient at 10 years and $30,437 at 30 years.
8) This work has informed public debate on genomic medicine.
