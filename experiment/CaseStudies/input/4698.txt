     The CSPSJ's work and research has had a major international impact.
In       2006-07, UNICEF successfully used it to lobby the UN General Assembly to       adopt a new, international definition of child poverty which reflects the       needs and rights of children.
It noted: "According to this new         definition, measuring child poverty can no longer be lumped together         with general poverty assessments which often focus solely on income         levels, but must take into consideration access to basic social         services, especially nutrition, water, sanitation, shelter, education         and information" [a].
UNICEF made the Bristol Approach a core part       of its Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparities, conducted in       54 countries [b] since 2008.
Team members advised over 40 individual       UNICEF country and five regional offices, ran training workshops, and       guided NGOs and national governments (e.g., Mexico, South Africa)       interested in developing and applying the Bristol Approach.
The Global         Study has improved national, regional and global awareness of how       appropriate social and economic policies can eradicate child poverty.
UNICEF stated in 2009 that "...the research...transformed the way         UNICEF and many of its partners both understood and measured the poverty         suffered by children.... [it] has exposed policy-makers all over the         world to a new understanding of child poverty and inequalities.
As a         consequence, children are more visible in poverty reduction policies and         debates" [c].
The Global Study's 54 countries (listed at the end of this       section) represent over 1.5 billion children &#8212; approximately 60% of the       children in the developing world.
Specific examples of the direct regional       and national impact include:     China: UNICEF and the Chinese Government's Leading Group Office of       Poverty Alleviation and Development agreed to consider child poverty as       distinct from adult poverty, conduct research to understand the child       poverty situation in China, and design and pilot schemes that identify the       dynamics of child-poverty alleviation at the local level.
As a result,       child poverty is now incorporated in the ten-year National Rural Poverty       Reduction Strategy 2011-2020 [d], which will benefit China's 322,000,000       children;     Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Region: In 2010, the Economic       Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) applied the Bristol       Approach to produce the first-ever regional study of child poverty for the       Americas [e].
In 2012 UNICEF's Senior Regional Adviser on Social and       Economic Policy stated: "...the study developed by the University of         Bristol is quoted in the region, when child poverty is discussed...it is         used to teach or improve interventions...it is in the core of policy         discussions in the region" [i].
CSPSJ research has influenced the       design and content of a free, online, multilingual, multimedia training       guide for estimating child poverty in the LAC region, to protect and       promote child and adolescent rights [f].
This resource is available to the       general public, and has been used by advocates for children's rights,       journalists, NGOs and policy makers in the region;     East Asia and the Pacific Region: In 2011, the CSPSJ provided data       for the first ever UNICEF Regional Report on Child Poverty in East Asia       and the Pacific [g].
The report demonstrated high levels of deprivation of       basic needs among children and provided governments in the region with       policy-relevant data previously lacking;     South Asia Region: In November 2009 at a conference in Dhaka,       Bangladesh (Achieving Child Wellbeing and Equality: Towards a new         understanding of child poverty and deprivations) Prof. Gordon made       presentations to a ministerial-level audience of policymakers from India,       Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Bangladesh;     Mozambique: In 2008, the Government responded to Bristol/UNICEF's       work on child poverty by approving the Children's Act, and translating the       UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into national child-rights       legislation.
It has since invested strongly in education and health,       resulting in significant reductions in the proportion of children       experiencing deprivation, and in 2010 introduced the Basic Social       Protection Strategy, which includes child grants to alleviate child       poverty.
In 2013 UNICEF's Senior Social Policy Specialist reported that       Bristol's research has helped the Government understand what exactly is       needed to address the problem of child poverty, for example increasing the       budget for programmes designed to deal with child poverty;     Ukraine: Advocacy around the Global Study resulted in the       inclusion in 2009 of the child poverty rate as a national Millennium       Development Goals (MDG) indicator and therefore part of the MDG       achievement agenda.
It also resulted in the Annual State Report on       Children in 2009 focusing on child poverty;     Haiti: Research by CSPSJ provided the first ever estimates of       child poverty in Haiti.
The data were reflected in the 2008 Haitian       National Poverty Reduction Strategy and UNICEF's 2009-2011 Country       Programme Documents.
Following the devastating earthquake of January 2010,       our work was also used by UNICEF in its Humanitarian Action Report         2010 Partnering for Children in Emergencies.
In summary, these examples demonstrate the significant, international,       social and policy-related impact of the Bristol Approach.
Governments, UN       organizations and NGOs around the world have adopted, adapted and applied       it to child and youth poverty measurement.
UNICEF has also used CSPSJ's work in its Socio-Economic Policies for         Child Rights with Equity training programme, which aims "to         enhance the theoretical understanding of all professional level UNICEF         staff on public policy and development issues, strengthen their ability         to apply this knowledge in the design and implementation of policies and         programmes and help build effective partnerships to promote children's         rights and wellbeing" [h].
In 2013, UNICEF's Innocenti Research       Centre developed an online tool for conducting Multiple Overlapping       Deprivation Analysis (MODA) in respect of children.
This freely available,       interactive tool acknowledges and builds directly on the work of the       CSPSJ, and is used by researchers, students, NGOs and international       organisations.
