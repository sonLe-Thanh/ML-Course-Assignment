     Leeder has played a crucial role encouraging and advising poets,       translators, artists and cultural organisations to advance the performance       and presentation of modern German poetry in the UK and beyond.
Leeder's       research insights and prize-winning translation expertise have contributed       greatly to increasing the accessibility and coverage of modern German       poetry in the UK, attracting new audiences, and enabling more culturally       and historically revealing performances and presentations of existing and       new work.
Advising creative and cultural institutions     Leeder has regularly advised cultural organisations concerned with       promoting international cultural cooperation and mediating public       awareness of contemporary European literature, such as the Goethe-Institut,         The Austrian Cultural Forum and the South Bank Centre[1],       on how to make European literature (especially German poetry) more visible       through translation and transmission via various media.
Her guidance has       enabled these institutions to expand their coverage of modern German       poetry and to deliver new interpretations, bringing it to new audiences.
She advised the Senior Commissioning Editor of Oxford University Press's Oxford         World's Classics book series on translations of Rilke; she regularly       advises BBC Radio 3 and 4 on German poetry programming, and       advised the premier New Zealand trade poetry magazine SPORT about       its special German issue for the Leipzig Book fair (2012).
Leeder's research was cited[2] as influential in the       preparation for the BBC Symphony Orchestra's UK premiere       performance of Detlev Glanert's `Musik f&#252;r Violine und Orchester, Op 33'       inspired by Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus (Barbican, 11/02/2011).
Engaging public audiences through radio     Leeder has regularly used the discussion of her research on BBC Radio         3 and 4[i] culture and arts programmes       such as The Verb, Word of Mouth,         and Night Waves as a way of reaching a large public       audience and broadening their understanding and appreciation of modern       German poetry.
Her appearance with Dennis Marks, on `Fin de Si&#232;cle       Vienna', at the Proms Literary Festival, 05/08/09 (broadcast on       Radio 3), was described as "warmly authoritative, informal and informing"       in BBC feedback.
The producer of the Radio 4 programme `The Women of       Rainer Maria Rilke' (16/05/09) said of Leeder's contribution: "Your       knowledge and expertise are utterly invaluable to us and your tone,       enthusiasm and appraisal of the texts were absolutely perfect for our       audience".
She also participated alongside Martyn Crucefix, Don         Paterson, Philip Pullman and Rowan Williams in `Among the Ranks of       the Angels - Rainer Maria Rilke' (Radio 3, 27/03/11 and 05/08/11),       unpacking Rilke's Elegies for a general audience.
The confidence and interest in Leeder's work has led to repeat requests       for advice and participation.
Leeder was commissioned to write and present       a Radio 4 programme on Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus (Dancing the Orange,       21 and 27/07/13, Radio Choice in The Times,       20/07/13).
The producer said: "A number of people who heard the programme       told me that they were impressed by Karen's depth of knowledge, her       ability to communicate complexity engagingly and her own engagement with       the subject.
My editor and the commissioning editor were pleased and have       encouraged me to submit more proposals for programmes presented by Karen.
"[3]     Reaching out through cultural events     Leeder has participated in, chaired and curated public events, as a       vehicle for raising cultural awareness and public appreciation of modern       German poetry.
Her research on the reception of Brecht's poetry led to an       invitation to chair a public event with poets Bernard O'Donoghue       and Jamie McKendrick (03/03/13), as part of the `The Rest Is         Noise' festival[ii].
The session combined readings       and poems sung with piano accompaniment and discussion to engage the 400-       strong audience with Brecht's poems.
The Festival Programme Manager[1]       said: `Karen's academic expertise was to the fore in advising on the shape       and material used in our Brecht poetry event [...] the event [...] was       very well judged, allowing space for new research and insights about       Brecht to come to the fore.'
She advised on and chaired a post-performance discussion with       distinguished photographers Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin       and conductor Paul Kildea at the film and opera event based on their       artists' book War Primer 2[iii] (a       contemporary recasting of Brecht's Kriegsfibel) at the London         Photographers' Gallery (25/04/2013).
Chanarin emailed afterwards:       `Thank you for a wonderfully informative introduction last night.
I think       you managed to set just the right tone, and create an atmosphere in which       the audience felt able to participate' (26/04/13).
The Academy of Arts         in Berlin has requested a repeat of the event next year.
Developing professional practices for translators and other         professional groups     Leeder's research and prize-winning translations have helped to change       how German poetry is translated into English, and how artists respond to       it in their own work.
She has served in a consultative capacity on various       non-academic bodies including the English PEN, the Translator's         Association of the Society of Authors, the British Centre for         Literary Translation, and New Books in German (a trade       magazine).
She was a member of the editorial board and then a trustee of Modern         Poetry in Translation and a Judge of the Schlegel-Tieck Prize       for German translation, the Times / Stephen Spender Poetry Competition       and the Poetry Society Corneliu M. Popescu Prize 2013[iv].
This has further enhanced the visibility of German poetry in the UK and       within the poetry and translation communities.
She has influenced translation practices through working directly with       translators such as Martyn Crucefix[4] and also through       knowledge-sharing via events and the media.
Thus she chaired a round table       on `The Art of Translation', with Jenny Erpenbeck, Michael Hulse, and       Marco Szondi, for an audience of 250 at the Writers and Readers         Festival in Wellington, New Zealand (04/13).
In 2008 she held a       round table with industry specialists (publishers, theatre workers,       translators, etc.)
at Tate Liverpool[v] intended       to overcome the practical and cultural challenges of presenting       German-language culture to a British audience.
One translator at the event       commented: `Leeder has been a substantial influence on my career as a       translator [...].
I have also been inspired by her approach to the       practice of translation - hearing her talk about translating poetry has       helped me to think through the process, and to develop my own creativity       in translating literature.'
Stimulating and shaping creative practice     Leeder's research on Rilke and Brecht has led to work with major UK       poets.
She has advised Jamie McKendrick, Robin Robertson, and Martyn         Crucefix[4] on their Rilke translations and poems       `after', Rilke, including Crucefix's version of the Sonnets to Orpheus       (2012) and the Duino Elegies (2006) which has been toured by Aya         Theatre in London (2012 and 2013).
She worked with Andy Croft       on his poems `after Brecht'; his poem `In the Brecht Museum' (in Sticky,       Flambard Press, 2009) is dedicated to her and responds directly to her       research on Brecht [&#167;3.3].
Leeder's research on emerging German poets and her translations of their       work has helped them to establish their presence and careers.
Her research       on the Austrian poet Evelyn Schlag[5] led to       commissions which have been instrumental in increasing Schlag's profile in       the UK and beyond: e.g.
Schlag's poem `Honeymoon Years' (tr.
Leeder) was       selected for World Poetry Day by the European Commission and the       European Parliament, November 2008.
Schlag was selected as Austria's       representative in the 2012 London Olympics' Poetry Parnassus           [vi] where she read a poem translated by Leeder.
Schlag said of Leeder: `Not only have her articles given me a profile,       collaborating on the translations with a sensitive translator such as       Karen Leeder has also had an influence on my own writing.'
