     Globally, HEIs have become increasingly concerned with the prevalence of       plagiarism in       academic writing, and in particular in assessments.
Plagiarism was       perceived to be more       common among international students.
One seemingly simple solution to the       problem was to       check all assessments electronically, using PDS.
It was assumed that these       systems would       subject all students to the same rigorous process of checking, i.e.
that       they would be fair.
The       research demonstrated that this was not the case.
It revealed that,       because of the assumptions       embedded in the algorithms, these systems discriminate against certain       students.
These       systems should therefore be used with caution and only as part of a       comprehensive framework       to deal with plagiarism.
A THE article suggested, based on the       research, that, `In fact, the         reason such students are branded as cheats is that universities have         flawed ideas about         plagiarism.
Plagiarism is not a simple phenomenon.
It is not a         straightforward choice between       cheating and not cheating.
A number of complex conditions shape the         writing practices of         students.'
These insights were disseminated through 20 workshops and       presentations at HEIs       and at HE policy forums in the UK, Europe, China and the USA.
Local impact:       Sessions, incorporating the research, have been held for several years,       training academic staff       at Lancaster University on the Associate Teacher Programme (ATP) and       Certificate of       Academic Practice (CAP), courses accredited by the Higher Education       Academy.
Also, student       academic writing practices have been influenced through workshops and       working closely with       faculty student learning advisors, based on the recommendations from this       research.
Impact on policy:       The work has been influential in shaping policy at various national and       international HEIs such       as Nottingham         Trent University, University         of Northumbria, University         of Sydney and Simon       Fraser         University.
Southern Illinois University, for example, actively drew       upon it to formulate       their institutional         policy for dealing with plagiarism.
They encourage staff to       appreciate `that         students from non-Western cultures may have different concepts of         authorship and little or no         training in how to use sources and therefore may need extra help in         avoiding plagiarism' and       that they should `expect some `patchwriting' (developmental         plagiarism) that is unintended, and         allow time for revision of patchwritten texts'.
These are       recommendations that come directly       from the Lancaster research.
At the London School of Economics the       research was described       by members of a working group on the use of Turnitin for PhD theses as       being `very helpful in         forming a sensible policy for LSE in this area.'
Impact on training for staff and support for students:       The research has been adopted by various international HEIs to train their       staff to be sensitive       to the complex, culturally specific practices that are implicated when       students write for       academic purposes.
At the University of Sunderland, for example, it was       used to develop       workshops for staff to show them the limits of PDS and how knowledge of       these systems can       be used support strategies for developing `deep' learning approaches.
The       work has been       used nationally in university staff training workshops at The LSE, York, Leeds, 	   Wolverhampton,       Kingston       and Bradford and also internationally at Penn         State University, University         of San Diego,       Wisconsin,       Syracuse,       Sydney,       Guelph       and Simon Fraser University.
An external       advisor to the Plagiarism Advice Service, at the time of the project,       stated that `The work by         Hayes and Introna has changed how I think about student plagiarism ...
The SDAW outcomes,         used generically, have made a difference to how I designed and delivered         workshops and         presentations on teaching international students since 2008 (amounting         to c. 50 events in c. 10         countries to c. 2000 people.'
This advisor suggested that the       findings could have ongoing       impact in the form of a handbook for practitioner use.
This is now under       development.
The research has enabled student unions to provide more effective support       for students who       were accused of plagiarism.
The students union of Concordia University, in       Montreal, used the       research as part of their `Academic         Fairness Campaign' (in 2010/11) for a more nuanced way       of dealing with students identified as plagiarists by detecting systems.
Drawing on its findings,       they suggested that universities `should endeavour to: Create         teachable moments out of         seemingly bad situations.
If an international student, especially a new         student, is suspected of         plagiarism, do not automatically assume intent to be dishonest...
Adopting an educative         approach to plagiarism is preferable to one based solely on punishment.'
This campaign is just       one example of how this work has helped students to get fair treatment.
An Executive Member of the UK Council for Graduate Education and member       of the project       steering group, based at Royal Holloway, University of London, confirms       that there was little       research at the time that, `explored either how difficult it may be         for students from overseas         (China, India, Greece) to make sense of doing a UK Masters programme ...         nor had previous         work integrated academic writing, student educational biographies and         use of Turnitin'.
She       invited the research team to speak at Bristol University (her former       institution) and Royal       Holloway, to share the project findings.
A member of the National Advisory       Board of the       Academic Integrity Standards Project funded by the Australian Office for       Learning and       Teaching since 2010 corroborates the impact of Introna and Hayes' research       and that it,       `contributes to ongoing dialogues among university lecturers,         program/course coordinators and         university executives about how to better understand and use pedagogic         means to address the         underlying issues that contribute to instances of plagiarism.
I and         others in this field in Australia         contribute regularly to national dialogues on these issues...
In         addition, I contribute to university         dialogues with colleagues and faculty management, presenting seminars         and workshops that         draw on the work of Introna and Hayes to advise on pedagogic approaches         ... for supporting         international students to develop competence in academic writing.'
Overall the work at LUMS has been instrumental in shifting the debate on       plagiarism from one       of `detecting and punishing' to a more nuanced understanding of the       complex cultural and       technological conditions that shape writing practices.
The research has       been disseminated and       debated worldwide by institutions, students and interested parties via       social media and has       underpinned further academic research in the field.
In sum: the project       has, through its       innovative research and dissemination strategies, transformed writing       support and teaching       practices in at least 32 HEIs, nationally and internationally.
The actual       impact is most certainly       significantly more since this impact case only focused on impact that was       formally recorded.
