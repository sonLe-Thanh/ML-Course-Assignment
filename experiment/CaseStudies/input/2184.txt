     The impact deriving from this research derives from the widespread public       use of the data collected, collated and contextualised by the researcher.
The research informs the data selected, and the public use impact deriving       from this is only available as a consequence of the research that       underpins it.
This represents a significant extension of the evidence       available regarding the lives of the London poor in the early modern era.
A major ESRC-funded project London Lives, managed by researchers       at Sheffield and Hertfordshire Universities, has benefited from the       datasets produced via the underpinning research, namely the `Settlement       Examinations' and `Workhouse Admissions Register' which encompass over       100,000 records.
London Lives is a "not-for-profit project whose sole         objective is to make the documents and data it contains available for         private use to all internet users free of charge", which it does       through providing the data in a fully digitised and searchable form.
As a       result of the London Lives project utilising these research datasets, both       are now available on the project's public website, http://www.londonlives.org,       which was launched in June 2010 (IMP1, IMP2).
Any user of the London Lives site therefore will get results that       might include records produced by the underpinning research.
The site has       been described as being "a significant addition to research capacity         for scholars researching the social history of eighteenth-century London",       whilst also being of practical value to many individuals outside academia       tracing their family history or otherwise researching their own projects.
As of 2011, the London Lives site had received around 450,000 visits from       118 countries (of which it is estimated that approx.
90% are from       non-academics), viewing around 4.5 million pages (IMP3).
A good       proportion of searches result in hits on the St Martin's data.
Users who       register with the site also have access to additional resources and       functions.
As of July 2011, out of 3883 registered users, 313       self-identified as being affiliated to universities.
Academic users       originate from 54 HE institutions in the UK and 59 in the US, as well as       from 14 other countries worldwide, such as Australia, Canada, China, New       Zealand and Sweden.
In addition, 181 users self-report being affiliated to       an organisation, such as family or history societies, public bodies (e.g.
British Library, English Heritage), the media (e.g.
the BBC, CNN, the       Guardian), and government (e.g.
Ministry of Justice, Arizona Supreme       Court) (IMP3).
More recent statistics indicate that over 200,000 people visited the       London Lives website between 1 July 2011 and 31 July 2013.
In the same       period, unique page views of St Martin's data were 12,378 (St Martin's       settlement examinations) and 20,709 (St Martin's workhouse registers),       with over 5,000 unique page views restricted solely to the St Martin's       datasets (IMP4).
Registered users are able to create Wikis [a web       application developed collaboratively by a community of users, which       allows any of them to add, modify or delete content] for their personal       research purposes on the site using the datasets deposited, or,       alternatively, they can integrate such data into their own private       research (IMP5).
Up to the end of July 2013, 80 users in total had       created their own Wikis using St Martin's material, evidence of active use       of the research data.
The research also achieves considerable impact via its own project       website, Pauper Lives in Georgian London and Manchester, http://research.ncl.ac.uk/pauperlives/.
Website traffic analysis has revealed that between 1 January 2011 and 31       July 2013 the Pauper Lives website received 2,953 visits consisting in a       total of 8,402 page views, and with a new visits rating of 65%.
Though       most visitors are from the UK (77%), the reach of the impact is evident       via visits from 43 other countries, including Australia, United States,       Canada, New Zealand, France, Germany, Brazil, China and Denmark (IMP6).
Impact on the public understanding has been extended by allowing free       access to multiple research team seminar and conference presentations via       the research website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/pauperlives/esrcpresentations.htm).
The project website and resources are cited on genealogical or family       history websites as a useful resource.
For example, in a 2011 newsletter       to members, the Founder of Lost Cousins, a genealogical site with       over 90,000 registered members stated: "I often make unexpected         discoveries when I'm researching articles for this newsletter.
Another         of these was Pauper Lives in Georgian London, a research project at         Newcastle University, which includes some fascinating PowerPoint         presentations and working papers.
You'll also find potted biographies of         two paupers, based primarily on workhouse register entries which record         their numerous admissions and discharges &#8212; all in all it's a wonderful         site" (IMP7).
The newsletter also noted how the project       website "brilliantly supplemented" another popular website, Peter       Higginbotham's Workhouses.
This site also provides a link to the       research project website on its page on St-Martin-in-the-Fields (http://www.workhouses.org.uk/StMartins/).
Boulton is in regular communication with many of those who utilise the       research to pursue their own genealogical enquiries.
To take just one       example, Madi Maclean (Australia) wrote: "I was trying to find out what         had happened to a direct line ancestor of mine whose son and second wife         were sentenced to transportation at the Old Bailey in 1789.
Through your         project's work on records in St Martins in the Field, I found a record         of the father (Stephen Tucker) being examined as a pauper a year later.
This confirmed his wife and two children had died by then (I think in         Newgate Gaol).
I also found the wife getting poor relief before she         married...the information from your projects...really fleshes out how         people got by" (IMP8).
The research was also the subject of a Museum of London (http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/)       exhibition held in c. 2010.
This exhibition incorporated pauper lives       reconstructed through the research as part of `Life Chances,' an       interactive virtual display of early-modern London street life.
As the       museum director confirmed, the research has "greatly enhanced the         public understanding of the 18th century metropolis, especially the         lives of the poor.
The exhibit has been highly praised both for its         design and interesting content.
Since 2010, over 1,300,000 people have         visited the Museum's Galleries of Modern London," and a great many       of these visitors "have interacted with or observed the `Life Chances'         exhibit."
(IMP9).
The research informed the popular publication, `Yet Another Inquiry into       the Trustworthiness of Eighteenth-Century-London's Bills of Mortality', (4)       which appeared in Local Population Studies, a genealogical       publication.
The Local Population Studies Society (LPSS) which publishes       the journal "is the United Kingdom's only charity solely devoted to the         promotion of all aspects of historical demography in a local context"       and one of its explicit aims is to "promote education in local         historical demography and associated topics in universities, colleges of         further education, other educational establishments and among the         general public" (IMP10).
