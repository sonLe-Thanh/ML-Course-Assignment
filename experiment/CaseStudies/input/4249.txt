     In application materials submitted to the AHRC in 2005, AS       outlined both its determination to       pursue an innovative research agenda and a commitment to putting broad       public engagement at       the heart of its work, emphasizing its dissatisfaction over the gulf         between advances in new         scholarly research on emancipation and the persistence of an older,         largely discredited         rendering of the past in secondary-level education and in public       discourse.
Its work in the period       since has been directed at contributing in a meaningful way to closing       that gap, and to that end AS       has been engaged over the long term with a broad constituency of US-based       high school       educators and curriculum experts, labour, community and cultural       organizations, heritage workers       and US National Park Service personnel, and commemorative projects.
Strategically         its focus         has been on changing the way secondary school teachers think about this         period.
The project's impact strategy rested on three essential elements:       the launch of an aesthetically       appealing, intellectually credible website intended for classroom and       popular use; the organization       of a series of high-profile (US) conferences and workshops that would       promote enduring       collaborations between leading research historians and the diverse       constituencies mentioned       above; and an ambitious campaign to engage high school educators across       the Carolinas in       designing a new curriculum and producing high-quality online teaching       resources on slave       emancipation for classroom use.
The project's educational website (www.afterslavery.com) has served as         its public face       since early 2008, and in August 2009 added a tablet-friendly "Online       Classroom' with ten learning       units&#8212;each comprised of annotated documents with "questions to consider"       and suggested       readings.
In the first six months of the launch the site received over       7000 individual `hits'.
Its page       rank has risen from 4/10 at launch to 6/10 at present (by comparison, the       much better-resourced       REF2014 home page is rated just marginally higher at 7/10).
The site has       been peer-reviewed,       with the preeminent online reviewer in the US (MERLOT) rating the       pre-tablet site at 4+/5 stars and       describing it as "a model of the scholarship of teaching that can benefit       faculty teaching and       student learning around the world."
The project's web presence created substantial opportunities for engaging       key non-HE       constituencies&#8212;in particular for building durable relationships with         secondary-level educators         in the US.
In September 2010 AS formalised a partnership       with the Lowcountry Digital Library at       the College of Charleston&#8212;now the permanent home for the site, with plans       to use it as the       "cornerstone of an elaborate and interactive online classroom" to "foster       research on the Carolinas       from primary school projects to advanced scholarship."
In the spring of       2013 AS conducted a       series of seminars and designed a unit on Reconstruction for America         in Class, the online learning       interface managed by the (US) National Humanities Center, with an audience       of hundreds of       secondary-level educators.
Over the course of the project AS has       built a strong relationship with       National History Day, the leading organisation for primary and       secondary-school educators in the       US.
In 2010 NHD conducted a survey on the AS website involving 76       national award-winning       school teachers in the US, with extremely positive results: 92% responded       that the site was       "extremely useful" for adding to their knowledge of the period; 89% agreed       there was an urgent       need for the web material to be "infused into the American classroom" and       76% responded that it       was "extremely likely" they would use the AS website in their teaching.
Teachers commented       favourably on the quality of the writing and the range of source       materials: typical comments       included remarks that the site was "informative to a teacher...who doesn't       have time to do personal       research," that the site "makes a huge difference in student       understanding" and that "my teaching       improved because of this overview."
Over a period of three years After Slavery organized five         major gatherings prioritising         engagement between research historians and non-HE constituencies.
A       2010 Charleston       conference&#8212;with 240 registrants from 23 states the largest ever conference       on Reconstruction&#8212;       brought together teachers and curriculum experts, National Park Service       site interpreters, veterans       of the local labour and civil rights movements, and prize-winning       journalists, and included a dozen       panels on public history, commemoration, and popular memory, along with       two well-attended       (travel-subsidized) teachers' workshops.
The keynote by Pulitzer       Prize-winning historian Steven       Hahn&#8212;hosted by the President of the South Carolina (SC) AFL-CIO       (equivalent of the British TUC)       and held in the Longshoremen's Union Hall&#8212;served as the launch of an AS-curated       exhibit on       slave emancipation in Charleston.
Co-sponsors included a long list of       cultural and public policy       organizations, including the state's African American Historical Alliance       and the SC Department of       Education.
Since then AS has organised four highly successful teachers'         workshops in the Carolinas,       including two regional workshops with 40 teachers registered for each.
The       second of these&#8212;on       "Teaching the New History of Emancipation"&#8212;was held in early February 2013       and featured a       keynote by 2012 Pulitzer, Bancroft and Lincoln Prize-winning historian       Eric Foner, but also       involved panelists from the National Park Service, US National History       Day, the Palmetto History       Program (secondary-level teachers), the Slave Dwelling Project, plantation       site interpreters, digital       learning experts, archivists and public historians.
Its success led to two       workshops in March 2013       aimed at involving teachers in producing a package of new online teaching       resources for the       beginning of the 2013-14 school year.
The website now includes a full set       of high-quality teaching       aids suitable for high school use, and will be rolled out in a pilot         exercise involving 75 public         school teachers in August 2013.
Beyond its engagement with non-HE educators, AS has positioned       itself at the very centre of a       series of initiatives aimed at marking the sesquicentennial of the Civil       War in the US.
Kelly has       been appointed to the Steering Committee of the Jubilee Project,       an ambitious Carolina-based       public history project commemorating the 150thanniversary of       the Emancipation Proclamation, and       has been closely involved in designing a full program of events         reaching across diverse         non-HE constituencies in South Carolina over the current year.
In       that role he has presented       related lectures at more than a dozen academic and non-academic venues in       the US since autumn 2012.
