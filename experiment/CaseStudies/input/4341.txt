     Raising international awareness and changing international guidelines.
On the strength of this and other work, University of Birmingham was       confirmed as a WHO       Collaborating Centre for Child Care and Protection in 2006-2010, as part       of which the group were       invited to develop policy briefings and fact sheets to disseminate the       research findings to       governments, NGOs and other relevant policy-makers.
The University of       Birmingham work was       widely cited at a conference for European Ministers Responsible for Family       Affairs (May 2006) as a       "major contribution" to the issue of children in institutions and this       prominent endorsement has fed       into the impact that has occurred since (corroborative reference 8, pps,       9-10).
In 2007-8 the principal outcomes of the research and the manual for       deinstitutionalising young       children into family-based care to reduce harm was disseminated in 20       European and CEECIS       countries by the research team.
A monograph prepared by the research team       summarising their       own and other relevant research was presented by UNICEF as part of the       case put to the UN       General assembly leading to the Guidelines for Alternative Care published       in 2009 (corroborative       reference 1).
Among other outcomes of the group's research, the conclusion       that children younger       than 3 should not be in institutional care has been the basis for numerous       subsequent campaigns       and recommendations for best practice, including: the report from a       high-level conference on       Children without Adequate Parental Care in 2009 (corroborative references       2 &amp; 3), with       participants including Save the Children, UNICEF, Better Care Network); a       worldwide campaign by       Save the Children, UNICEF and Everychild and other non-governmental       organisations to end the       institutional care of children less than 3 years, outlined in a working       paper (corroborative reference       4 cites research references 5&amp;6); the `At home or in a home' report,       2010 (corroborative reference       5, background reading); and `The rights of vulnerable children under the       age of three' by United       Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (corroborative       reference 6: footnote 1 on       page 5 refers to research references 2 &amp; 6).
It has also motivated       further investigation, including: a       survey by Eurochild (in 2009, updated in 2010) in 30 countries, that       resulted in calls for legislation       across Europe banning children under 3 in institutions; a 2012 UNICEF       report that called for these       concepts to be applied to Eastern Europe and Central Asia (CEECIS).
This       has drawn widely on       the University of Birmingham findings (e.g., corroborative reference 7: 21       citations of research refs.
2,5 &amp;6, e.g., pp.
116-117).
Changes to care systems and government policies in multiple countries.
In 2009, the UN General Assembly Report of the Human Rights Council in its       11th Session       produced `Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children' for 193 Member       States.
The Guidelines       use a number of concepts put forward by the group's research, particularly       the cut off of 3 years.
In       turn, this has led to changes in many countries across those member       states, including:            Lithuania: Undertook their own national review of institutionalisation         and ways to end it as a         direct result of work of the Birmingham group (corroborative reference         9, pp.7-8), and have         subsequently changed national policy and practice.
Bulgaria: Developed a National Strategy for the Child (2008-2018) and         associated Action Plan         for Deinstitutionalisation, which determined that 105 institutions         should be reformed and         restructured, further stating that by 2014, no child under three should         be in institutional care         (corroborating reference 7).
In Romania and Serbia, legislation has been passed making it illegal         for infants to be in         institutional care (under 2 years in Romania [Law No.272/2004; Romanian         Social Welfare Law         2011], under 3 years in Serbia [Serbian Social Welfare Law 2011).
The         Romanian National         Strategy for Protection and Promotion of Children's Rights 2008-2012         aims to prevent the         separation of children from their parents.
In Serbia, between 2005 and         2011, the proportion of         under 3 year olds in institutional care had decreased by 81%         (corroborating reference 7, e.g.,         pps.
91.
140,).
Czech Republic: In 2009 the government implemented the National Action         Plan to Transform         and Unify the System of Care for Vulnerable Children from 2009-2011,         including a clear         preference for child care in a family rather than an institutional         environment and reference to         UN guidelines).
Hungary: Increased demand for foster care resulting from the decreased         number of children's         homes (especially infant homes) in turn led to an amendment to the Child         Protection Act         regarding fostering, 1 January 2011.
Improved outcomes for children and decreased costs of care.
The long-time reduction in cost for Governments shown by the UoB         research (based on data         provided by 33 governments) has been outlined by UNICEF (corroborating         reference 7, p.118,         citing research references 4 &amp; 6).
The research found that         Governments' reported spending         showed institutional care is three times more expensive than foster care         for children without         disabilities and twice as expensive for those with disabilities.
As well as financial gains, longitudinal research on Romanian orphans         has clearly shown the         improved social, cognitive and emotional outcomes for children moved         into family based care         and the need for this to occur at an early age (research reference 5).
For example, research         has shown those children moved before the age of six months are able to         catch up on all areas         of development.
Children who are moved at a later stage (e.g., four         years) are able to get close         to or within the normal range on many aspects of development, but         continue to show difficulties         with interpersonal, social and peer relationships even aged 16 years.
Most children moved at a         later state are generally unable to catch up on their development.
Thus,         early movement of         children from such environments is crucial.
This is a long-term impact         of the research, the         significance of which increases over time, and as the recommendations         are followed in ever         more countries.
On-going impact: Disseminating the ideas to Central and Eastern Europe         and Central Asia         (CEECIS).
UNICEF has used the outputs from the University of       Birmingham research and       commissioned a monograph by a member of the research team outlining the       research knowledge base       (based on the University of Birmingham research; corroborating reference       10) and argued that these       methods and concepts need to be applied to CEECIS.
They note that       currently more than 15,000       babies and young children per year are being taken into care; that is       "every hour, approximately two       young children, mainly babies, are separated from their parents and sent       into institutional care in       Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia" (corroborating reference 7,       p.5).
2013: UNICEF has begun to move the work into South American and other       countries, with the work       from this research contributing to their approach.
