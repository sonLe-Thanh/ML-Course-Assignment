     Banatvala's research outputs have been manifested in a number of novel       works, which have received international acclaim.
To develop, produce and       present these works, Banatvala together with the partners set up a special       purpose production and marketing vehicle, The Works Partnership, in 2007.
Since 2008, the Works Partnership together with Moving Theatre Ltd have       received over &#163;252,000 in development grants, including over &#163;100k from       the EU Culture Programme, &#163;11k from the European Cultural Foundation and       &#163;95k from the Arts Council to:            Develop the successor project to The Works: The Mechanics,         a partnership between Moving Theatre, Radio Romania International,         Theatre Ephemeride (France), Association Greenwave (Georgia), and         Tbilisi State Music and Drama Theatre (Georgia), to produce five         different interpretations of the story of Carmen from an         original adaptation commissioned by the partnership.
The partnership         produced a choreo-drama, a bilingual stage play, a radio installation,         and an interactive audio-drama.
Develop and co-produce a bilingual adaptation of Troilus and         Cressida in Georgian and Russian with interleaved monologues         written from original interviews with survivors on both sides of the         South Ossetian war (2008).
Produced in Kutaisi and Tbilisi (see below).
Up until 2011, The Works Partnership was the only UK arts company to: (i)       be the lead partner on two EU Culture Fund projects; (ii) lead a project       in the 2011 EU Culture Fund Third Country Stream; and (iii) have led a       radio-based collaboration project.
Access to Banatvala's research has       enabled Moving Theatre to move from producing works for UK national       touring to being a leading international research and development company       in the field of audio-drama.
Banatvala's research has made an impact in three important areas:     1.
The practice and reach of bilingual radio drama:     Prior to Banatvala's research, bilingual radio drama was primarily drama       written in two languages but not integrated into a single drama (e.g.
Beckett's work).
Following Banatvala's research there has been a tangible       uplift in bilingual radio drama, evidenced by, for example:            BBC Radio has collaborated with Radio France to produce D&#233;j&#224; Vu,         a play in French and English, on Radio 4 and Radio France in 2009 [www.arteradio.com/son/334014/].
Among the radio projects which received funding in 2010 from Ireland's         Cogar Sound &amp; Vision, three were bilingual Irish/English [www.cogar.ie/default.aspx?treeid=346&amp;ItemID=76].
In 2013, the international arm of the French National Radio Station         (Radio France International) began broadcasting a bilingual radio drama         series in French and Hausa to African listeners [http://allafrica.com/stories/201310120194.html].
This is believed to be the first of its kind.
In addition, the bilingual plays emanating from his research have reached       audiences beyond their partner countries, for example:            Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National acquiring Bucharest         Underground in 2010 for Airplay, its primary radio drama         programme, attracting an average audience of 40000 [www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/airplay/bucharest-underground/3029062].
Following the award of the Prix Marulic 2009, Hannu Karisto from YLE         Radio Finland is in negotiations to broadcast A La Villa Bab Azzoun.
Radio Romania specifically broadcast Bucharest Underground         through its international arm, Radio Romania International.
2.
The practice of live recording of serious drama:     A further manifestation of Banatvala's research has been the       establishment of the radio play as an act of live theatre and as an       important theatrical experience in its own right, through the recording of       serious drama as a live performance in front of a theatre audience (e.g.
A         La Villa Bab Azoun and The Way of All Women recorded live in       London, 2009).
Prior to this, live radio had been confined to comedy and       panel games in the UK and some community radio.
For example, the Romanian       Cultural Centre presented a live performance of Bucharest Underground       as a cultural event in 2009.
In the UK, since 2010, The Wireless Radio       Company has established a reputation as a producer of live performances       for radio drama recordings, playing to sell out audiences.
Other companies       too have subsequently developed a profile for radio plays for live       performance: the Fitzrovia radio plays have toured to popular and critical       acclaim in each year since 2009, for instance, and a version of The         Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for radio will tour theatres in       late 2013 performing to live audiences.
3.
Partnership working across cultural and linguistic borders:     The impact of Banatvala's research in this area is reflected in the       Moving Theatre company's involvement in a partnership programme (set up       2010) with Theatre Ephemeride (France), Radio Romania International,       Association Greenwave (Georgia) and Tbilisi State Music and Drama Theatre       (Georgia) which received EU Cultural funding and support from Arts Council       England for The Mechanics &#8212; a programme to reinterpret the story       of Carmen using a range of languages and performing arts forms.
At       the heart of The Mechanics was the creation of a full-length       bilingual stage play reinterpreting the Carmen story for an       English and French audience.
Other elements of the programme included:            a radio installation led by Association Greenwave in which selected         participants worked with an artist on themes inspired by the Carmen         story;       an original `interactive radio drama' (with Wireless Theatre Company),         extending the radio drama as an art form for the digital age.
Individual         online users create their own drama from a selection of scenes, sound         effects and music and then re-post their creation for others to hear.
All the scenes are professionally performed but the individual listener         is invited to create his/her own relationship with the piece by choosing         which to include and deciding where to take the storyline.
Across the programme, figures reported to the Arts Council for The         Mechanics included 48 artists involved; 1,000 participants; 4,000       members of live audiences; and 150,000 viewing the production via       broadcast, online or written versions; 6 commissions; artist employment of       1,200 days; and 40 education, training or participation events across the       partner countries during 2011-12.
A partnership between Moving Theatre and Lado Meshkishvili State Theatre       (Georgia), delivered a ground-breaking bilingual production of Troillus       and Cressida in Georgian and Russian with interpolated verbatim       monologues (2011).
The monologues were drawn from interviews from       participants in the Georgian/Ossetian war.
The production involved 24       actors, two translators, a set and costume designer for eight weeks.
The research has also contributed to the UK listener's appetite for       internationally-produced radio drama and a willingness to engage with       unfamiliar formats, languages and themes.
One indicator of this has been a       clear interest in the UK in establishing an International Radio Drama       festival in Britain.
Drama producers from ABC Australia, Radio Romania,       Radio Croatia, Deutchelandfunk and the BBC have all supported this       proposal.
A survey of thirty representatives at the 2013 Prix Marulic       received unanimous support for such a festival.
The project has similarly       been met with approval from Arts Council England, Canterbury Festival       2010, East Sussex County Council (RUGEF programme) and the Interreg Manche       European funding programme.
