     Below we provide evidence of three distinct, though interlinked, impacts       driven by our research:     1) Advancing policy and public understandings of bisexuality     The Open University and BiUK published The Bisexuality Report,       which summarises key national       and international research and advances recommendations for policy and       practice.
The report has       led to the following policy impact:            The Government Equalities Office has met regularly with the authors to         discuss implementation         of the report's recommendations.
On the strength of the report Barker has been invited to be a member         of the government-funded         Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender (LGB&amp;T) Partnership and the         LGB&amp;T Chief Executives         Network.
A summary of the report findings on health has already been included         in the Public Health         Toolkit Document for Local Authorities launched in Parliament in April         2013.
This toolkit will         have a significant impact on the delivery of public health on a national         scale.
The report has informed public debate and the understanding of         bisexuality.
It has been         endorsed by national LGBT organisations including Stonewall and Pink         Therapy.
The           Bisexuality Report has been downloaded over 50,000 times since         publication in February 2012         and been discussed in the national and international press.
2) Impact on policy and public understanding of relationships     The project team of Enduring Love?
has impacted on both policy       and public understanding of       couple relations:            The Enduring Love?
project has helped shape the Department for         Education (DfE) agenda,         mainstreaming `public service' relationship education and couple         support.
Invited presentations         of findings have been completed at the DfE (February 2013), Relate         (Annual Conference 2012         and 2013), One Plus One (October 2013), and Tavistock Institute.
The research team has impacted on the democratic debate on couple         relationships.
They have         been invited to participate in all-party parliamentary briefings,         receptions and consultation         events, including House of Commons (July 2013 and April 2012), Houses of         Parliament         (February 2013) and Windsor Castle (March 2012).
The project is contributing to public interest in what makes couples         stay together.
A series of         iTunes audios and videos have been produced (Gabb and Fink) that speak         to a general         audience and received over 24,000 hits on their launch.
Findings and         reports of the research         have also been disseminated to wider publics via involvement in radio         programmes (including         BBC's Woman's Hour) and a number of large circulation print         publications, such as The Metro         (14 February 2013) and The Sun (16 January 2011).
In a related project, Barker has contributed to public debate and         understanding of relationships         by authoring a book for a general audience on relationships and         maintaining an associated         blog, Rewriting the Rules.
Both received considerable media         coverage (e.g.
the Guardian, the         Independent, DIVA and Elle magazines, BBC radio         and television).
Fink's research has impacted on Milton Keynes residents' understanding         of the dynamics of         poverty and place in children's lives and family relationships.
She         organised and participated in         a number of successful knowledge exchange activities with Milton Keynes'         residents including         children's workshop participation and attendance by local residents and         councillors at the         Second International Visual Methods Conference (2011).
Fink also contributed to local understanding of changes in adoption         policies.
Fink's Knowledge         Transfer Partnership with St Francis Children's Society (SFCS), Milton         Keynes, resulted in a         (confidential) report for SFCS and publication (2011) has disseminated         findings about shifts in         adoption policy and practice to both practitioner and academic         audiences.
3) Impact on professional practice     Barker, Vossler and Langdridge are psychotherapists and trainers in the       areas of sexual and/or       relationship therapy who exercise wider impact through their established       links with key professional       bodies in the field.
Impact of 2012 British Psychological Society's guidelines on           working           psychotherapeutically with sexual and gender minorities.
Barker         and Langdridge's work         underpins the 2012 British Psychological Society's guidelines on working         psychotherapeutically         with sexual and gender minorities, where they have been key members of         the working party.
These are the first UK guidelines on these matters for UK psychologists         and will have a         significant impact on practice.
Training of professionals.
Vossler, Langdridge and Barker have         all undertaken numerous         workshops for professionals including: workshops for Relate (Vossler,         Barker) and continuing         professional development days for COSRT (Barker) and Pink Therapy         (Langdridge, Barker).
Impact on the future of psychosexual and relationship therapy in           the UK.
Barker has been         responsible for producing the public-facing material on the COSRT         website and organising their         conferences, which shape the future of psychosexual and relationship         therapy in the UK.
Contributing to the improvement of Milton Keynes Council's services           for Black and           Minority Ethnic (BME) families and children, as well as enhancing           cooperation with           voluntary sector organisations.
At the level of local professional         practice, Erel is the         Independent Chair of the Commission on Ethnic Diversity in Milton Keynes         that has been         tasked with improving these services and co-operations.
