     Here we detail three key areas of impact by IGRU on policy, society and       production:     1.
Impacts on public policy and services IGRU's work has been       used to determine policy in many countries including Norway, Finland,       Israel, and Australia.
Here we detail impact within Norway and the UK on       the effects of slot gambling machines on public health.
Reach 1: Griffiths' work on the structural characteristics of slot       machines (References 4 and 5) underpinned his oral and written evidence to       the Supreme Court in Oslo as the Norwegian Government's expert witness.
[Evidence 1a, 1b]     Effect 1: As a consequence of Griffiths' testimony, Norway banned       slot machines in 2008 until less harmful and more socially responsible       machines were designed (June 2010).
"[Dr. Griffiths] was the Norwegian         government's expert witness...in the court case that led to the         temporary prohibition of slot machines in Norway...His testimony to the         Supreme Court [was] key in the decision made to ban `old' slot machines         in Norway" (Deputy Director General, Royal Norwegian Ministry of       Culture [Evidence 1a] and confirmed by the then CEO of Norsk Tipping       [Evidence 1b]).
Reach 2: Griffiths' work was central to the parliamentary Culture,       Media and Sport Committee debate on slot machines and their psychosocial       impact on the population.
Effect 2: Contribution to the policy debate &#8212; to quote from that       committee's report:     "In 2008, Dr. Griffiths [was] commissioned by the Department for         Culture, Media and Sport to write me a report of the impact of high         stakes gambling machines on problem gambling which [was] used to inform         UK government policy" (UK Minister for Sport 2007-2009) [Evidence       1c].
As is confirmed in parliamentary report "The Gambling Act 2005: A bet       worth taking?"
[Evidence 3c].
"Dr. Griffiths was co-author of the last two British Gambling         Prevalence Surveys (published in 2007 and 2011).
These national         studies...form the basis on which much of British gambling policy is         based.
They are arguably the most important gambling research studies         that have been undertaken in Great Britain" (Secretary of State for       Culture, Media and Sport, 2001-2007).
[Evidence 1d].
2.
Impact on product development: Griffiths, with Parke and Wood,       developed a tool to help game developers design more responsible       lower-risk games for vulnerable and susceptible individuals (Funder Camelot         Plc &#163;40,000).
This led to the commercial development of GAM-GaRD       (Gambling Assessment Measure: Guidance about Responsible Design).
In 2010, Griffiths and Wood developed the Nova Scotia Responsible         Gambling Impact Index (NS-RG-II) (commissioned by Nova Scotia         Gaming Corporation CAD$250,000) concentrating on the       situational characteristics of gambling.
The NS-RG-II has now been       incorporated into the previous tool and is sold and licensed as GAM-GaRD         2.0.
Reach: The tool is now a commercially available product used by       numerous gaming companies around the world.
In 2010, the World Lottery         Association recommended that all its companies use this tool as part       of their social responsibility accreditation procedures and in many       countries (e.g.
Norway, where it is not possible to attain       gambling-licences without GAM-GaRD accreditation).
"Dr. Mark         Griffiths and I co-developed the gambling social responsibility tool         GAM-GaRD based on our research into the structural characteristics of         gambling.
GAM-GaRD is a risk assessment tool [and] has been used by 30         gaming companies and gaming regulators worldwide" (CEO, GamRes         Ltd, licenses GAM-GaRD).
[Evidence 1e]     Effect: The use of this tool pinpoints ten known potentially       addictive characteristics of games and offers companies practical ways to       reduce the risk of players developing gambling problems by altering the       games' structural characteristics.
This has been "of great use in         helping protect gamblers from developing problems" [Evidence 1a]     3.
Impacts on health and welfare: IGRU with TACADE were       commissioned by the Responsibility in Gambling Trust (RiGT       grant: &#163;240,000) to develop educational materials on young people and       gambling based on Griffiths' research [Evidence 3a, 3b].
Two major       resource packs were developed: (i) You Bet!
Gambling Educational         Materials For Young People Aged 11-16 Years, and (ii) Just         Another Game?
Gambling Educational Materials For Young People Aged 13-19         Years).
The resources were formally launched by Griffiths and TACADE       at the House of Lords (March 2008), and continue to have impact in the       current REF assessment period.
Reach: You Bet!
Gambling Educational Materials For Young         People Aged 11-16 Years, and Just Another Game?
Gambling         Educational Materials For Young People Aged 13-19 Years) have been       distributed across the secondary school secondary in England and Wales       [Evidence 2a, 2b].
Griffiths spoke at ten regional training workshops for       key stakeholders (schools, counselling services).
Effect: You Bet!
resources were accredited for use within       the National Curriculum in 2009 for use in Personal and Social Health       Education classes.
In many 2011 national media reports, GamCare       (the national gambling charity that runs the National Gambling Helpline)       recommended all schools should use these resources.
