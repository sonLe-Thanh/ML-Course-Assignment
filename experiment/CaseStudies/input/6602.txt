     HAI research at GCU has impacted on health and welfare, and public policy       and services.
It has reduced avoidable infections in healthcare in the UK       and Europe by stimulating policy debate on HAI4-6, investment       in MRSA screening and approaches to validation of prevalence surveys.
This       has resulted in changes to: policy decisions, investment in new healthcare       practice, evidence guidelines, and educational practices impacting on       patients, clinicians and policy makers [S1-10].
The large scale PPSs led by Reilly et al in Scotland in 2006 and       20111,2 determined HAI priorities and was a key driver in the       decision to invest funds in NHS Scotland to prevent and control infection       [S1-2].
Funding of &#163;56million was invested in a number of areas in order       to reduce HAI from 2008-11; with &#163;7million of this focussed on MRSA, in       recognition of the public health importance of the organism identified in       our research [S3].
Our research on MRSA screening4-6 has stimulated debate on the       national policy for screening, which resulted in the introduction of a       national strategy for MRSA screening in NHS Scotland [S3].
In addition, it       demonstrated that nasal passages and perineum were the most appropriate       sites to screen4.
As a result of the adoption of these       practices into the strategy, healthcare practice is therefore now more       effective as screening is targeted at those at risk, with resulting cost       savings of &#163;7.5million to NHS Scotland annually [S8].
The user (patient)       experience has been improved by using the GCU acceptability study findings6       to improve the national patient information leaflet and videos produced by       HPS [S6-7].
These are accessible online and in a range of languages [S7].
Further impact of our innovative research on the acceptability of MRSA       screening6 has been demonstrated by two further research calls       by the UK Department of Health [S4].
The findings from GCU research on MRSA have been used to develop a       national education programme on MRSA screening [S7].
It is an       online short course developed by NHS National Education Scotland in 2011,       and is targeted at all healthcare workers in Scotland.
By September 2013,       1,456 had completed the course.
In evaluations of the course 96% of       participants stated that they thought it would have a lot or some positive       impact on their day to day work as their knowledge, awareness and       understanding of the policy and procedures had increased.
There is evidence from national statistics that our MRSA screening       research4,5 and subsequent change in policy is now having an       impact on patient outcomes with reduced infections rates [S5].
HPS noted       in the 2012 national statistics for Scotland that `the proportion of S.         aureus bloodstream infections, which were MRSA, had significantly       reduced in the last year from 19% to 14% [S5].
This compares favourably       with other European countries with a similar history of high endemic       proportions of this organism and is associated with the introduction of       the national policy for MRSA screening in NHS Scotland.
Investment has also been made in policy to control other HAIs,       highlighted by the PPS study1, including infection control and       antimicrobial prescribing guidance and hand hygiene campaigns [S2], and       these changes to policy and practice in the intervening period have       resulted in a lower prevalence of HAI (9.5% in 2006 versus 4.9% in 2011)       [S2].
28 European countries now use the PPS validation method determined by our       research [S10].
Each member state in Europe participates in an annual       network meeting and the HAI team has presented the findings of the       research and worked with the European Centre for Disease Control to change       the policy for future validation and point prevalence surveys [S10].
Our       research also contributed to a change to the European training programme       for PPS (delivered by Reilly with other experts in Europe).
To-date the       training has been delivered face to face to over 60 national       representatives.
These national representatives are then responsible for       cascaded the training, using web based education, to staff within 1,149       hospitals across the 28 European countries [S10].
