     In March 2012, McLaughlin presented his research to a general audience as       part of the Newcastle Science Festival.
He interviewed a subset of the       audience after his presentation, and realised that such interviews,       evaluation data and user feedback could be used to measure changes in       knowledge and behaviour.
He recognised that a one-off presentation might       influence audience members on the immediate timescale, but a sustained       programme with the same group was needed to embed a lasting benefit.
Consequently, he devised a multiple visit, ongoing outreach programme       where he interacted with the same group multiple times in a       structured set of exercises arising from his recent research.
He worked       with two sixth-form/Further Education colleges: (a) Newcastle         College and (b) Gosforth         Academy in a collaborative outreach programme.
The aim was to       investigate the positive effects and benefits of public engagement at       these sixth-form colleges using outreach materials underpinned by       McLaughlin's research into Solar Physics and MHD since 2010.
During October 2012 to June 2013 (2012/13 school year), McLaughlin       visited these sixth-form colleges on multiple, independent occasions and       delivered five individual presentations (of increasing complexity) on the       following topics: (i) Introduction to the Sun; (ii) The Sun and its effect       on the Earth and Space Travel; (iii) Electromagnetism and MHD; (iv)       Special Relativity; and (v) Mars.
Each presentation session lasted for one       hour, and was divided into a 20 minute oral presentation followed by 5-10       minutes of questions, followed by a second 20 minute session, again       followed by 5-10 minutes of questions.
This format was judged most       appropriate for the audience.
Evidence gathering - Evaluation questionnaires were       completed by the participants at the end of the fifth presentation and an       analysis of the responses was performed.
The questionnaires (available on       request) were constructed using the Likert scale method (with option for       free text and open questions) and were developed in collaboration with a       developmental psychologist.
Registers were taken at each of the five       presentations to ensure that students completing the questionnaires had       indeed attended the whole outreach programme.
Hence, the 50 beneficiaries       represent a subset of the total number of students studying AS-level       Physics across both colleges.
Data from the 50 evaluation questionnaires       was used to evidence the impact on the change in participants' interest,       knowledge, engagement and motivation.
There was 100% response rate from       all 50 participants who individually each answered 100% of the questions.
Impact (on society, culture and creativity) - The       public engagement programme resulted in multiple impacts as defined under       "Impacts on society, culture and creativity":            the beneficiaries' interest in science was stimulated;       the beneficiaries' engagement with science was improved;       their science-related education was enhanced;       the outreach programme made the participants excited about the science         topics covered;       the awareness and understanding of the beneficiaries was improved by         engaging them with the research;       evidence of an improvement in both AS-level grades, and student         retention.
This was evidenced by questionnaire responses (user feedback),       participants' quotes, AS-results and factual statements.
A summary of       responses is given below (e.g.
92% rated overall programme as good or very       good) with full survey feedback available on request.
Specific impacts and specific evidence     The impact, the beneficiaries' interest in science was stimulated,       was evidenced by the results of two feedback questions:             As a direct result of Dr McLaughlin's outreach programme, are you           now more interested in science as a subject than you were before?
54% of responses indicated that they were more (or much more)         interested.
Please indicate to what extent you agree or disagree with the           following statement: "My interest in science has been stimulated as a           direct result of Dr McLaughlin's outreach programme".
64%         of responses agreed (or strongly agreed).
The impact, the beneficiaries' engagement with science was improved,       was evidenced by:             As a direct result of Dr McLaughlin's outreach programme, are you           now more likely to talk to your teacher about science?
32%         of responses indicated that they were more (or much more) likely.
As a direct result of Dr McLaughlin's outreach programme, are you           now more likely to consider studying science at university?
34%         of responses indicated that they were more (or much more) likely.
The impact, their science-related education was enhanced, was       evidenced as follows:             Indicate to what extent you agree or disagree with the following           statement: "My science-based education has been enhanced as a direct           result of Dr McLaughlin's outreach programme".
68% of         responses agreed (or strongly agreed).
The impact, the outreach programme made the participants excited         about the topics covered, was evidenced by the results of the       following feedback question:             Did the outreach programme make you excited about the science           topics covered?
80% of responses indicated yes (or yes to         a strong extent).
The impact, the awareness and understanding of the beneficiaries was         improved by engaging them with the research, was evidenced by the       following illustrative feedback, i.e.
participants' quotes from survey       (quotations may also evidence the other impacts):            "It inspired me to do a space based EPQ (about Mars)".
[Extended Project Qualifications are part of level three of the National         Qualifications Framework].
"I would like to take geology at university and am now             going to look at the courses to see if they include           geology on other planets".
"It has extended my knowledge of science and           gave me more motivation to do well in science.
I am much more enthusiastic about it now".
"It did make me more enthusiastic about           physics, discovering new things, and realising that there are so many           things that you don't know".
"It's given me more knowledge on the           subjects discussed.
It's made me more interested in           learning physics in more detail, rather than just what is learnt in           lessons".
"I realise that I can research topics myself in           order to increase my knowledge".
"I feel more happy going into A2 with             a higher knowledge about space.
A lot of the topics           discussed I wasn't confident on beforehand".
Additional Significance - This was a sustained and ongoing       engagement with the groups (sustainability as well as secondary         reach).
Specifically, the same group of students was seen at five       individual points over the period October 2012 to June 2013 (i.e.
50       students had attended all five presentations).
It was believed that the       information, knowledge and benefits of the outreach programme `take time       to really sink in', and so an outreach programme spread across a school       year seemed appropriate.
Moreover, McLaughlin's research (which       underpinned the outreach material) is specialist material, and it took       time to build the knowledge and context for the audience to a mature level       in order to engage properly with and understand the underpinning research.
A factual statement from the Head of Physics at Newcastle College states:       "The topics covered encouraged several students with a lower than         average ALIS (Advanced Level         Information System) predicted grade to attend the presentations.
Engaging some of these students was an achievement in itself and from         the discussions that followed it seemed to have a motivational effect.
Statistically speaking these students have a lower than average chance         of achieving the high grades required in order to gain a place at         university making engaging and motivating them to learn even more         important".
A comparison of the AS-level Physics predicted grades       versus actual grades across the Newcastle College students showed a clear       increase in grades, specifically:             Predicted grades: A= 0%, B=18%, C=23%; D=14%; E=45%        Actual grades: A=18%, B=27%, C=18%; D=9%; E=27%          with an average increase of +0.86 grade per students (not uniform       increase).
Thus, from the factual statement and grade comparison, there is       evidence that the programme contributed to an improvement in AS-level       grades, i.e.
improved attainment.
A factual statement from Gosforth Academy states: "This year 60% of         students have continued from AS level Physics to A2 level Physics         compared to an average of 50% over the last few years.
I would not be         able to hold Dr McLaughlin completely responsible for this, but do         believe that his delivery of lectures through the year has indeed         partially contributed to this success", i.e.
there is some       (indirect) evidence of increased retention and progression.
Beneficiaries and Additional Reach - The target audience       was the first year of sixth form of AS- level Physics.
Across the two       colleges, data was collected from 50 AS-level students (16-17 year olds),       consisting of 39 males and 11 females where, for STEM subjects, the NCCPE       (National Co- ordinating Centre for Public Engagement) defines female       students as a `hard to reach' audience.
This case study details the impact arising from public engagement       activity and follows the recommendations of the NCCPE and their guidance       for assessing REF impact arising from public engagement with research.
The       NCCPE is part of the Beacons for Public Engagement project, funded by the       UK Funding Councils, Research Councils UK and the Wellcome Trust, and the       NCCPE is at the forefront of the national debate on public engagement.
The       Director of the NCCPE has described McLaughlin's public engagement       programme as "an impressive and thoughtful project".
In 2014, the       NCCPE will be drafting guidelines of best practice and useful tools to       apply to the next REF exercise.
As a direct result of his public       engagement programme, the Director of the NCCPE has invited McLaughlin to       be part of this process.
