     Multiple myeloma is a relatively common haematological malignancy       accounting for ~2% of all cancer deaths.
Several large-scale clinical       trials demonstrated the efficacy of lenalidomide in treating myeloma.
Prior to the advent of thalidomide analogues the median one- and five-year       survival figures for myeloma were 60% and 20% respectively, and treatment       required use of toxic chemotherapeutic agents such as melphalan.
With       thalidomide or lenalidomide the one- and five-year survival figures       increased to 70% and 37% respectively.
The use of lenalidomide for this       indication in the USA was approved by the FDA in 2006 [A].
Its use in the       UK was delayed largely by concerns over treatment costs.
However, NICE       developed a novel cost-sharing scheme with the manufacturer Celgene and       approved the drug for use in myeloma patients who had received two or more       prior therapies in 2010 [B,C].
The development of this cost-sharing scheme       and the highly influential role of patient representatives in this       agreement was explored in a BBC documentary by Adam Wishart on drug       rationing in the NHS [D].
Whilst the immediate beneficiaries of lenalidomide have been patients who       suffered from myeloma or myelodysplasia [E], this drug is now being found       to be effective in chronic leukaemias and lymphomas.
Pomalidomide, the       second analogue originally developed by Dalgleish in conjunction with       Celgene has a more potent immune co-stimulatory action than lenalidomide       and received approval by the FDA in February 2013 for relapsed multiple       myeloma [F].
It is now being trialled for use in other tumours .
Impact on economy and commerce     The development of lenalidomide has had a major impact on the growth of       Celgene.
From being a small non-clinical research organisation when the       collaboration with Dalgleish started in 1993 it is now a worldwide       corporation based in New Jersey, USA, employing over 5,700 employees [G].
Many of these employees are in Europe and the U.K. in particular, and this       has led to the funding of many other research groups and clinical trials       throughout the U.K.
The excellent future investment prospects for Celgene       were discussed in several for a including [H] Lenalidomide sales worldwide       generated $3.8 billion USD in 2012 and U.S sales have increased 16% this       year and international sales 8% [I].
