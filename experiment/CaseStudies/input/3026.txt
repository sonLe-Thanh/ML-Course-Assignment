     Lynton Lasers Ltd and Laser Quantum Ltd are both spin-out companies from       the University of Manchester and were formed in each case by former       members of the School of Physics and Astronomy.
LYNTON LASERS       Lynton Lasers Ltd (formed in 1994) has a core business in aesthetic and       cosmetic surgery using light, that builds directly on the research at       Manchester.
They currently manufacture and market sources for applications       such as tattoo and hair removal, and for the treatment of vascular       lesions.
They operate a clinic in Manchester and also provide regular       training courses for users of their treatment systems.
Staff from the       photon physics area at the University of Manchester teach on these       courses, maintaining regular updates of current research into the market       place (such as a better understanding of laser tissue interactions accrued       from using new sources such as fibre lasers[5][6]).
The core of the       company business is underpinned by the study and application of       light/tissue interactions and uses intense pulsed light (IPL) systems, one       of their main product lines.
Lynton Lasers Ltd now employs [text removed       for publication].
The direct economic impact over the REF period is around       [text removed for publication] but there is also a secondary impact in       that their products and services have helped improve the quality of life       of up to [text removed for publication] clients/patients since 2008 and       over [text removed for publication] people have been trained in the use of       the systems (with Dickinson and Binks contributing to the training courses       since 2008).
With around [text removed for publication] systems in the       field, and 2 treatments per week, there would have been over [text removed       for publication] treatments over the REF period, and at between [text       removed for publication] per treatment that amounts to a monetary value of       up to [text removed for publication].
Lynton Lasers now has a market share       of around [text removed for publication] for IPL sources.
Without the       background research in Manchester on IPLs, this product range would not       exist [text removed for publication].
Lynton Lasers keeps records of testimonials from users of their products,       but one example sums the service up with: `Lynton Lasers provide the         highest standards of customer care, backed by years of research, design         technology and on-going clinical studies........... My Lynton system has         enabled me to deliver 100% satisfaction and results to my patients for         vascular lesions / red veins, sun damage and excess hair removal.
The         client word-of-mouth recommendation has increased my business turnover         by another 55%.'
There are many companies and organisations that can corroborate the       impact that Lynton Laser's products and services have had for them &#8212;       contacts details for three that have provided corroboration are listed in       Section 5 below [text removed for publication].
LASER QUANTUM       Laser Quantum Ltd spun-out of Manchester University in 1994 and [text       removed for publication].
Manufacturing DPSS lasers in the UK, Laser       Quantum delivers over [text removed for publication] lasers a year to over       30 countries covering 13 product ranges from UV through to infrared.
The       monetary impact of the research is around [text removed for publication]       over the REF period.
Laser Quantum now has a subsidiary in the US, Laser       Quantum Inc, and a service centre in Japan as well as distributors and       representatives worldwide.
The research carried out in Manchester on       optical coupling and spectral matching of pump emission to gain material       absorption bands has been instrumental in the design and production of       their current product range [text removed for publication].
Laser Quantum's clients range from academic institutes through to       multi-national OEM companies and include major defence companies both in       the UK and around the world, several measurement instrumentation       manufacturers as well as medical diagnostics and instrumentation.
They are       also amongst the world's largest pump-source suppliers for Ti:sapphire and       dye lasers.
