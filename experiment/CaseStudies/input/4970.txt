     Statins are one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world.
In 2011 an estimated 27       million people in the UK and USA alone took statins to control their blood       cholesterol levels.
Whilst       their clinical benefit in reducing the risk of vascular disease is       irrefutable, there is a need for       improved guidance on which patient populations should be given the drugs       and for a better       understanding of the side effects associated with statins.
Influencing clinical guidelines to stratify patients for statin           therapy      University of Glasgow findings on the accurate assessment of baseline       lipid levels, prescription of       statins to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes as a potential       side effect of statins       (references 1-4 in section 2) have been cited as the leading evidence to       support recommendations       in a number of international clinical guidelines and consensus statements       on statins published       since 2008.
These include guidelines from some of the most high-profile       and influential       organisations in the clinical arena, including the European Society of       Cardiology (ESC; estimated       professional membership of over 80,000), the European League Against       Rheumatism (EULAR;       encompassing 45 member societies throughout Europe) and the American       Diabetes Association       (ADA; the leading US diabetes organisation).
Cardiovascular risk assessment: The 2011 joint ESC and European         Atherosclerosis Society         (EAS) guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemiasa cite         the 2009 ERFC study as the         single evidence source to support their recommendation for the potential         use of apolipoproteins         as alternative markers to total cholesterol (and the high and low         density forms) for assessing         cardiovascular risk.
However, the paper clearly shows that apoproteins         give equal but not         superior information to routine lipids, an important clinical         interpretation of the result.
Rheumatoid arthritis patients: The 2010 EULAR guidelines on         cardiovascular risk management         in patients with rheumatoid arthritisb cite the 2004 TARA         paper as part of the evidence base for         recommendation number 7, which promotes the use of statins to address         the increased         cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
There are an         estimated 3 million adults         living with rheumatoid arthritis in Europe and these guidelines form the         first set of clinical         recommendations in the world to direct statin allocation in this patient         group.
Diabetes risk: The ADA 2013 position statement on standards of         medical care in diabetesc, the         International Atherosclerosis Society 2013 position paper on global         recommendations for the         management of dyslipidaemiad and the 2011 joint ESC/EAS         guidelines on the management of         dyslipidaemiasb all cite the Glasgow 2010 Lancet and         2011 JAMA papers as the primary         sources to acknowledge that statins carry a small, dose-dependent         increase in diabetes risk.
Each of these statements is in harmony with the Glasgow conclusions in         recommending statin         use given that the cardiovascular benefit far outweighs the diabetes         risk.
The impact of these         statements highlights the diabetes risk to both physicians (who should         now check glycaemia         parameters before and after prescribing statins) and patients (who         should be told that lifestyle         changes will also help mitigate against any increased diabetes risk).
Directly motivating revised statin labelling and product           information to inform patients of           diabetes risk     In direct response to the 2010 Lancet paper, which demonstrated       the small, dose-dependent       increase in risk of diabetes in patients treated with statins, the US Food       and Drug Administration       (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) both revised the mandatory       labelling on all       statin drugs.
FDA: In February 2012, the FDA released a drug           safety communicatione, noting reports of         increased blood sugars and haemoglobin A1 in patients treated with         statins with the Glasgow         2010 Lancet paper cited in the evidence base.
Consequently, the         adverse event labelling for         statins was revised to include the potential for the drugs to increase         the risk of diabetes; this         information is distributed within every packet of statins prescribed in         the US.
EMA: The Glasgow 2010 Lancet paper was the catalyst for         a joint EMA, Heads of Medicines         Agencies and Pharmacovigilance Working           Party reviewf of 130 publications which concluded         that:       `[Statins] may increase the risk of [new onset diabetes] in patients           already at risk of developing           this disease, but [that] overall the risk-benefit balance remains           clearly positive ... A warning           should therefore be included in the product information of all           [statins] authorised in the EU ...
The warning should state that patients at risk (i.e.
those with           fasting glucose 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L,           body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2, raised           triglycerides or hypertension) should be monitored both           clinically and biochemically according to national guidelines.'
In March 2012, the EMA formally endorsed these conclusions and         implemented changes to         add diabetes risk to the adverse reaction section of both the Summary           of Product           Characteristics (new class warning sections 4.4 and 4.8) and package           leaflets (sections 2 and           4) for all statinsg; the wording is also published on         their website.
This change in safety labelling         is communicated to every recipient of statins in all 27 member states of         the EMA.
Both the FDA and EMA qualified these amendments to safety labelling by       advising that statins       remain the recommended therapy for cholesterol lowering due to their       overwhelming benefits on       vascular risk reduction.
Informing patients and health professionals regarding           statin-related diabetes risk     The changes to statin safety labelling have been communicated to both       patients and health       professionals via press release statements and media articles that       coincided with the revised       safety announcements in February 2012.
The FDA published consumer safety       announcements on       their websites to raise patient awareness of the issueh and       there was significant press coverage,       including that by Reuters       and Medscape.k,l       In the UK, the revisions to safety labelling were       highlighted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency       (MHRA)i and added as a       side effect in the current British National Formulary (BNF) lipid         lowering section (2.12) on statinsj to       ensure that clinicians are informing patients appropriately.
Consequently, the slight increase in diabetes risk with statin therapy       has highlighted the need for       clinicians to monitor blood glucose and haemoglobin A1C levels in patients       who are at high pre-       existing risk of developing diabetes before and after commencement of       statin therapy.
Furthermore, it has emphasised the responsibility of patients to maintain       lifestyle changes (diet,       weight reduction and increased exercise) to mitigate this small risk while       taking statins.
These       messages are now being widely disseminated to the clinical community.m
