              This research has had an impact at two levels.
Firstly in influencing         policy and practice in Scotland, and secondly in the wider international         context.
The outputs from the research programme outlined above         have provided systematic evidence regarding the         changing role of HNC/Ds, and their increasing importance in providing         progression routes into degree level study in many cases.
This has         contributed to the evidence base which has underpinned the Scottish         Funding Council's (SFC) increasing emphasis on strengthening links         between colleges and universities in its widening access policy since         2007.
The SFC has now established six regional articulation hubs to         develop the pathways from HNC/Ds to degrees.
To ensure that their         research contributes to the strengthening of these articulation links a         communication programme was undertaken by the research team addressed to         practitioners in colleges and universities, and policy makers in the         SFC, Scottish Government and the Scottish Qualifications Authority         (SQA).
This led to a series of meetings, convened by senior staff in         SQA, and involving staff from SFC and the Scottish Government         responsible for widening access to higher education, to explore the         changes in practice which would be required as a result of this         research.
This contributed to the recognition in the White Paper         published by the Scottish Government in 2011 ('Putting Learners at the         Centre') of the need to '&#8230;consider whether HNs need to be refreshed to         improve their ability to prepare learners for university&#8230;' (para46).
An         important outcome has been a programme of work, beginning in autumn         2011, which is being co-ordinated by the SQA, with funding from the SFC,         and involving college and university staff, to review and enhance the         role of selected HNs in providing articulation routes into degree         programmes.
The research identified Social Sciences, Business, Computing         and Engineering as key areas where change was required, and         Qualification Review Teams (QRTs) have been established in these subject         areas.
These QRTs have undertaken a careful analysis of the curricula,         and the approaches to learning, teaching and assessment within these         programmes, which has enabled them to recommend the modifications which         are required.
Some indication of the impact of this work can be seen in         that, in the subject areas involved in these QRTs, the numbers of HN         students progressing to degrees have increased from 2761 in 2006/07 to         3857 in 2011/12.
Gallacher has also been invited to present evidence to         the Education and Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament in         September 2012 and September 2013 in their considerations of the         implications of the Scottish budget for the work of Scotland's         Colleges,reflecting the recognition of his work in this field.
In the wider international context the OECD has emphasised the         importance of post-secondary vocational education and training (PSV) as         contributing to skills development in a globalised economy, and the need         to strengthen links between different parts of the education and         training system (Pukka 2012).
However the work of Gallacher et al has         emphasised the complexities and ambiguities in the changing roles which         these qualifications now have, and the different agendas which they now         address, as they move from focusing mainly on vocational education and         training to also providing pathways into higher education institutions         (Reeve et al 2007; Gallacher &amp; Ingram 2012).
In this context CEDEFOP         (The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training) has         been undertaking work to explore the concept of 'permeability', which         refers to the opportunity to transfer qualifications between sectors,         and in particular between vocational education and training and higher         education.
The work of Gallacher et al has been recognised as providing         important examples of how this idea of permeability can successfully be         operationalized (Pukka 2012).
As a result Gallacher was invited to         present this work at an OECD international seminar in San Sebastian on         17-18 October 2011 and a CEDEFOP Expert Workshop in Brussels on 23-24         January 2012, to assist colleagues in the development of policy and         practice on this topic.
