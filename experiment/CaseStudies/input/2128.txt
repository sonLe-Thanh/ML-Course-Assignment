     The work undertaken at Newcastle has enabled organisations to improve       practice through a better understanding of their stakeholders'       perspectives.
It has contributed towards the sustainability of these       organisations by allowing them to demonstrate the full extent of their       work, particularly in terms of the outcomes for individuals who use their       services.
The research has informed practitioner debate in both the       accounting and third sector communities, and, for the organisations       involved, has resulted in change at both operational and strategic levels.
Improving practice     The initial research undertaken with Jesmond Community Leisure (JCL)       enabled them to better understand their work.
As its Chief Executive       commented: "As a result of [Gibbon's] work the organisation has         benefitted from being able to report on our social impact for         stakeholders...The social accounts have also provided us with a vital         and accessible source of information to support funding applications,         for example, we received grants from Eon and the Carbon Trust to install         solar panels for heating pool water.
We have also used our Social         Accounts to inform the Sita Trust of the benefits of exercise to older         people, which led to a grant of &#163;50,000 to provide the equipment for our         new extension" (IMP1).
During 2009-10 the reach of the impact was increased to include       additional partner organisations.
Gibbon continued to work with JCL along       with three other social enterprises (Tees Active Leisure, Kirklees Active       Leisure and North Country Leisure) to co-produce a Social Accounting       Toolkit.
The toolkit is designed to develop and capture the information       needed to report on the aims and objectives of a typical leisure trust.
It       includes a brief outline of social reporting, a guide to the process,       sample surveys for stakeholder consultation, key aspects reporting form       and a verification check list.
As the Chief Executive of JCL commented: "The         toolkit that JCL developed along with other leisure trusts was a direct         result of [Gibbon's] research in collaboration with a number of         partners, the toolkit is a valuable resource for smaller leisure trusts         when starting to implement their own social measurement system" (IMP1).
The Director of the Social Audit Network (SAN) supported this: "The         research [Gibbon] has undertaken since 2008 has also made a difference         to the [SAN].
[She] was the first to explore in depth over time the         practice and theory of social accounting within the setting of a local         leisure trust.
The findings of [Gibbon's] research are useful to help         practitioners understand and overcome the difficulties and benefits of         social accounting and audit."

The ESRC CASE studentship (grant 1) has further extended the impact of       research to a different third sector context, supported accommodation for       vulnerable adults.
The studentship was hosted by Norcare Limited, which in       2011-12 helped over 500 socially and economically excluded clients,       working in partnership with 151 agencies.
The research developed an       outcomes framework for the delivery and reporting of the services Norcare       provides in such areas as accommodation, health, substance misuse and       money management (IMP3p11).
As the Chief Executive of Norcare       observed, "This resulted in adaptations to reporting methods within         Norcare's paperwork and its IT data capture system...to ensure that the         correct information was being captured throughout the whole of a         client's journey with us...The result of this work now means that         Norcare can effectively monitor and evidence key outcomes achieved with         the clients throughout their time with us.
This enables us to more         clearly demonstrate the impact of the support we deliver.
This         information is used on a regular basis with commissioners to evidence         our impact and therefore help maintain contracts in an economically         challenging environment; it is also used to assist in opportunities for         growing new business" (IMP4).
Enhancing sustainability     The Newcastle research is having long-term as well as short-term impact.
JCL, for example, continues to refine its use of social accounting: "[We]         first produced social accounts for 2004, providing an invaluable,         detailed account of the benefits provided by the pool to the local and         wider community, and to other stakeholders.
Our social accounts have         generated wide interest amongst other projects seeking to move in a         similar direction, both in the UK and abroad.
During 2007 it was decided         in future to prepare social accounts every other year" (IMP5).
Another organisation that continues to benefit from the research is North       Country Leisure, a registered charity managing twelve major leisure       centres, and a range of sports and exercise development services.
Its       Chief Executive commented: "As a direct result of this work we have         agreed a much improved series of impact measures with one of our local         authority contract partners, helping to demonstrate a much wider benefit         from our work than previously available through financial and numerical         measures...We have used the learning from the project extensively in         bidding for new contracts...
I am quite clear that the new perspectives         gained from our work with [Gibbon] have helped us to develop and         demonstrate service quality in a much improved way, playing a part in         winning new long term contracts with an annual turnover of &#163;3.5 million         over the last two years."

Following the Newcastle Council for Voluntary Service Wellbeing and       Health Open Forum (WHOF) held in February 2012 (IMP7), where       Gibbon shared research insights, Tyneside Women's Health (TWH) approached       Newcastle for support in implementing social accounting.
The Director       commented: "TWH has benefitted from engaging with social accounting by         enhancing our understanding of key aspects of what we do as an         organisation...[we] ensure social accounting is included in the future         strategic objectives of the organisation and ensure a wider range of         stakeholders are included in future social accounts...[we] review the         overall mission, aim and values of the organisation as part of the next         strategic planning process and ensure social accounts are undertaken         linked to the refreshed versions...[we] continue to positively respond         to service user feedback ... [and] establish the reasons behind service         users leaving...and use it as a service development tool where         possible...[and we] streamline outcome monitoring systems to ensure         progress and achievement can be measured for individual women..." (IMP8).
Informing the debate on social accounting     Gibbon has been informing the debated on social accounting through her       participation in a number of practitioner-based activities.
These involve       representatives from such organisations as Age Concern, Help the Aged,       National College for School Leadership, and the WHOF.
There is evidence of       participants paying particular attention to the Newcastle research.
Sample       comments in response to "the key thing you will take away with you from       today" include "Social accounting and how it needs to be an integral         part of what we do" (IMP7p6); "next steps" include "Do         social accounts at my org!"
(IMP7p7).
As a result of research at Newcastle, strong relationships have been       developed with a variety of third sector organisations.
At a national       level, the Social Audit Network (SAN) works closely with the University,       with Gibbon providing an advisory role and the University hosting the       regional branch of the Network.
As the Director of SAN commented: "[Gibbon]         has a strong and continuing relationship with SAN and through the SAN         North East group where she is a key member...She is a respected member         of our community and her research regularly informs our work at SAN"       (IMP2).
Impact is also felt at the level of service delivery.
TWH,       for example, are committed to continuing the work initiated at Newcastle.
Its Director said: "We have a continued commitment to producing social         accounts over the next 12 months and this will provide a key part of the         brief for our evidence based interventions and other aspects of our         practice too.
As TWH go forward we will continue working with [Gibbon]         as a part of Needs Assessment and Social Account Group" (IMP8).
The Social Accounting toolkit is beginning to be disseminated at a       national level.
As a direct outcome of the Newcastle research, the Chief       Executive of JCL now sits on the national advisory group of Sporta, a       membership association that represents over 100 cultural and leisure       trusts and social enterprises throughout the UK.
He commented: "Another         direct result of Jane Gibbon's research has been my own professional         development in social measurement, accounting and audit.
I have advised         national and international social enterprises on CSR and social         accounting...Since early 2012 I have been a member of the Sporta Impact         Measurement National Steering Group for social impact measurement" (IMP1).
