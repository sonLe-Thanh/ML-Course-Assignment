     The research has generated three types of impact.
1) Spin out company.
Following the research and user trials Patricia Dieng established TacMap       Ltd (S1) under licence from the University.
TacMap in 2010 was located in       'The Hatchery', an incubation unit within the University.
It helps new       business developments by offering 12 month's support including one to one       advice, workshops and access to networks, as well as use of facilities and       resources.
In 2010 TacMap was shortlisted for the RCUK business       competition (S6)       In 2013 Dieng moved into more permanent offices in the Cultural Industries       Quarter of Sheffield operating as TacMap Ltd. (http://www.tacmap.co.uk/),       providing a design service utilising findings from the research and also       creating tactile maps for a range of businesses and public services.
Dieng       liaises with Mobility officers and vision support services and continues       to work closely with end users.
TacMap has been exhibited at the following       events: Sight City Frankfurt, 2010; Autonimic Fair, Paris 2010; `Sight       Village' Birmingham 2013.       http://www.qac.ac.uk/exhibitors/sight-village-birmingham/1/tacmap-ltd/956.htm     2) Greater independence and dignity for blind and partially sighted.
The engagement of users throughout this research programme has helped       optimise the design of the TacMap and brought direct and tangible benefits       to blind and partially sighted people.
The use of the `TacMap' can improve       the way blind people plan their journeys, travel and move around exterior       and interior spaces.
According to a senior manager at the Sheffield Royal       Society of the Blind: "SRSB has worked with TacMap&#8482; for a number of         years, providing feedback from visually impaired people which has aided         its development.
TacMap&#8482; is a tool which can be used alongside white         canes or guide dogs and has the advantage of enabling visually impaired         people to discover their surroundings.
People I know who have used         TacMap&#8482; think it is an innovative and simple tool which gives them         confidence and independence in their everyday life.
The system has been         praised by users for giving a better sense of the environment than using         voice direction. "
(S2)     End users have responded positively after using the maps.
For example: "This         is wonderful, this illustrates so many things.
The plans are really         useful, and it is great to be able to go in a room such as the toilets         and to know where the basins, the WC and the hand dryers are ".
"I have walked by something a hundred times and I'll never know it's         there, like the main reception and the lift here at the Millennium         Galleries".
(see http://www.tacmap.co.uk/)       ''The benefit of TacMap is the replicability, consistency and         simplicity of the symbols.
Many non-braille users are less used to         receiving tactile information and consequently this can sometimes         present a challenge.
The considered graphics and symbols on TacMap are         easy to understand through tactile interpretation as well as being         meaningful to people with vision and helps provide a communicative         link''.
(S3)     TacMap provides a system that integrates with a range of existing       transport and mobility services.
For example TacMap is promoted by       the Sensory Impairment Team at Sheffield City Council Travel guide for       disabled and older people in Sheffield (https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/caresupport/adult/support-available/travel-pass/support.html)       and also by Describe online (www.describe-online.com)       which provides access solutions for blind/vision impaired people and which       includes a text and audio guide to support TacMap through its website.
3) More inclusive services for businesses       TacMap has been commissioned and adopted by South Yorkshire Passenger       Transport Executive (http://www.travelsouthyorkshire.com/interchangeguide/)       as part of its accessible interchange guide (S7) and for use in The Queen       Elizabeth Olympic Park by the London Legacy Corporation (http://www.londonlegacy.co.uk/the-park/accessibility-and-inclusive-design-2/)       to support its equality and inclusion agenda.
TacMap Ltd has also secured       and delivered a contract for a local school where habilitation specialists       (vision support) have conducted one to one meetings with pupils to assess       the impact that TacMap has had on their orientation around the school.
The       pupils, blind and partially sighted, aged 11-17 commented:     "Symbols are very meaningful and easy to access when out and about'       (pupil with no vision).
"The use of colour makes the buildings stand         out, this would have helped me when I first started at Tapton"       (school) (pupil partially sighted).
The support teachers commented on how the map provided independence for       the pupils and overcame the challenges of escorting boys and girls into       the toilet.
They also commented on how the map has given them greater       spatial understanding of their environment: "Pupils generally are         driven by mini bus to the school building and the map prompted pupils to         comment that they never knew there were two ways into the school and         that there were green spaces surrounding the school".
(S4).
The Equality Act 2010 is placing demands of the public sector and       industry to make buildings and facilities accessible, usable and safe for       disabled people, and TacMap aims to improve provision for the visually       impaired.
TacMap was presented to the UK Universities Safety and Health       Association (USHA) to demonstrate how tactile symbols could support the HM       Government Personal Escape and Evacuation Programme (PEEP).
Health &amp;       Safety officers described `TacMap' as a `well timed intervention in the         quest to improve communication around the health and safety agenda'.
The needs of sighted individuals are usually well catered for regarding       the provision of essential safety information, particularly fire and other       emergency information (http://www.hse.gov.uk/).
The standardised use of colours, shapes and symbols represents most of the       safety communication to date.
TacMap has attracted the attention of a       network of safety and health professionals operating in the UK Higher       Education Institutions (HEI's), one of whom has commented that `TacMap         opens an effective communication to an otherwise disadvantaged group and         could result in lowered risks and wider participation.
There are real         opportunities to take the provision of safety and health information to         completely new levels - making for example, the fine details of risk         assessments more easily communicated to those who might otherwise be         oblivious to those risks'.
(S5)       The research was disseminated at the 'Include' Conference at the Royal       College of Art 2011       (http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/3845/all/1/proceedings.aspx)       Chamberlain was invited to deliver a workshop at the British Royal       Cartographic Society Conference 2013.
