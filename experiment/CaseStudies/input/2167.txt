     The underpinning research demonstrated that providers' voices bring       important new perspectives to the design of ethical protections in the       conduct of clinical research.
It was used to inform and enrich the       understandings of several diverse and important communities, including       those funding, conducting and advising on the ethics of, clinical       research.
(1) Contributing to the design and implementation of ethical         protection of tissue providers in UK Biobank: UK Biobank is an       on-going national collection of tissue and information donated by over       500,000 people to be used in research to improve the prevention, diagnosis       and treatment of a wide range of serious and life-threatening illnesses.
Pathway to impact: In 2003, following dissemination of       Study 1, Haimes was appointed to the Interim Advisory Group of the UK       Biobank by the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council.
The Head       of MRC's Corporate Governance &amp; Policy said that the findings from       Study 1 were `recognised by myself and my colleague at the Wellcome         Trust... to be highly relevant to our discussions about the recruitment         of, and establishing ethical protection for, participants in the UK         Biobank...
This is why we invited [Haimes] to be one of a small group of         9 people to form the Interim Advisory Group (Ethics and Governance) for         UK Biobank' (IMP1).
This Group wrote, from scratch, the       Ethics and Governance Framework (IMP2), a set of principles to       guide UK Biobank's relationship with tissue providers including the       establishment of an Ethics and Governance Council to oversee UK Biobank.
Individuals' contributions to the Interim Advisory Group's deliberations       were not minuted (IMP3); however, as the only social scientist and       the only person who had conducted research with tissue providers, Haimes       clearly enhanced the Group's capacity to develop effective guidelines.
This was confirmed by a fellow Group member who then became Chair of the       Ethics and Governance Council:     `During the deliberations of the Interim Advisory Group Professor         Haimes drew extensively on findings from her research with tissue donors         to the North Cumbrian Community genetic database to alert the rest of         the Group to considerations and experiences that donors themselves         brought to the process of deciding whether to provide tissue to clinical         research.
This evidence closely informed our drafting of the section of         the Ethics and Governance Framework that addressed the relationship of         UK Biobank to its tissue donors...' (IMP4).
Impact: UK Biobank recruited participants between 2007-10       and its data and samples were made available to researchers in late 2011.
Throughout this time the Ethics and Governance Framework has been used `to         set standards...and to ensure that safeguards are in place for         scientifically and ethically approved research'.
The Ethics and       Governance Council is used `to oversee UK Biobank's adherence to the         Framework' (IMP2).
Haimes was appointed to the Ethics and       Governance Council (Jan 2007-Dec 2009), which benefited from Newcastle       research as noted by the then Chair:     `[Haimes] brought her research findings from three related       projects directly to bear on, and informed and enriched our understandings       of, a number of different topics.
... As the only social scientist on the       EGC conducting relevant empirical studies, Professor Haimes played a       central role... [in providing insights into potential participants' views       on]... questions of third party access to the biobank, the       commercialisation of results... and the possibility of "benefit sharing"       by participants...' (IMP4).
In terms of significance and reach, the underpinning research from       Newcastle University has made a major contribution to reducing the risks       of participation in UK Biobank for over 500,000 tissue donors and       continues to influence decisions on access to samples and data.
(2) Contributions to Nuffield Council on Bioethics' policy advice on         the ethics of encouraging donations of human tissue to research: The       Nuffield Council on Bioethics (NCoB) is a highly influential, independent       body that examines and reports on ethical issues in the life sciences; it       has an international reputation for advising policy makers.
The NCoB has       made active use of Newcastle's research on tissue providers in its Working       Party's deliberations on the ethics of encouraging people to donate human       tissue for clinical research and treatment.
In December 2008 they invited       Haimes to present to a closed workshop on `Volunteering, donation and       payment in the clinical context' to stimulate discussion on the social       aspects that should be taken into consideration.
The Director of the NCoB       reports: `This presentation raised, for the first time in our         considerations of this subject, a number of issues that were to prove         significant in the later work of the Working Party' (IMP5).
In November 2010, Haimes was invited to contribute further to the Working       Party's deliberations, through participation in a six-person forum on `The       conflict between public and private "good" in the donation of tissue to       research and therapy'.
Study 3 was at the centre of her presentation and       hand-out, examples from which were featured in the Final Report on pages       123 and 221.
The Final Report also cites the Newcastle research on pages       112 and 182 (IMP6).
Further evidence of the benefit gained by, and       influence on, the NCoB from Haimes' research comes from her appointment as       a full Council member in 2013.
(3) Writing a Position Statement for a global organisation of         practising scientists: Haimes' worldwide dissemination of the       underpinning research led to an invitation in 2009 to join the       international Ethics and Public Policy Committee of the International       Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) (IMP7).
The ISSCR is an       independent, non-profit organization with 3,500 members worldwide; it is       recognised as the voice of the stem cell research community.
Using the       underpinning research, Haimes is enhancing the Ethics Committee's       considerations of the best ways to protect the interests of individuals       providing tissue for stem cell research.
In particular, throughout 2011-12 Haimes led the Committee's discussions,       and the drafting of a report, on ethical approaches to recruiting egg       donors for stem cell research.
The then Chair of the Ethics and Public       Policy Committee says, `Haimes' membership of the Committee transformed         our general discussions... into a focused strategy for bringing the         ethical issues around egg providers' interests to the attention of the         practising scientists who form the membership of the ISSCR' (IMP8).
The Chair notes `the leading role' played by Haimes in the adoption       of that report as a formal Position Statement by the ISSCR as a whole (IMP9),       meaning that this will now act as a socio-ethical guideline to which all       ISSCR scientists will be expected to adhere.
