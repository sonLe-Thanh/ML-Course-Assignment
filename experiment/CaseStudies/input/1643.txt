     The impact of NTU's research on public policy on the sustainability of       consumer goods and the factors that influence product lifetimes is       evidenced by references in policy debate.
It is beginning to shape the       next generation of manufactured goods, bringing more benefits to consumers       and to the environment.
Primary beneficiaries include Defra and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action       Programme), who in developing government policy have commissioned       studies citing our research (WRAP, 2009, 2010; ERM 2011).
Our findings       have been applied to the clothing sector in particular, disseminated to       policymakers and industry stakeholders through various studies (e.g.
Fisher et al., 2008; WRAP, 2012).
Our research has shaped policy documents       such as the Government Review of Waste Policy in England (Defra,       2011a) and the strategic direction of publicly funded bodies such as WRAP       (see research grants).
Public policy has only recently begun to address product lifetimes and       academic research was necessary to establish the rationale and       credibility.
After the UK Government became aware that the EU Waste       Framework Directive required member states to produce waste reduction         plans, Defra commissioned an independent research study on the       potential for increasing product longevity.
The subsequent report (ERM,       2011:13) cited Cooper as "a leading academic working in this field",       and an associated study on consumer behaviour (Defra, 2011b: 2) noted: "While         the review included 60 sources that touch on product lifetimes in some         way, only a few provide comprehensive explorations of consumer attitudes         and behaviour.
The most useful evidence comes from work by Professor Tim         Cooper and colleagues (on appliances and electronics) and by Fisher et         al.
(on clothing, for Defra)."
Previously the House of Lords Science       and Technology Committee (2008) had invited Cooper to present oral       evidence at its enquiry into Waste Reduction (prior to his current       NTU appointment); this was reflected in the report's recommendations.
WRAP has recently begun to address product lifetimes of electrical         goods and clothing and has commissioned research from Cooper,       Fisher, Townsend and colleagues at NTU.
This work builds on a report on       resource efficiency and climate change which utilised data from Cooper and       affirmed his theoretical assertions that efficiency may not lead to       sustainable consumption because of the rebound effect and that relative       obsolescence was of greater significance than technical failure (WRAP,       2009).
Cooper's research findings have also been utilised by NGOs in       developing policy (Friends of the Earth, 2012).
NTU's research has had a particular impact on government policy relating       to clothing, which was chosen by Defra in 2007 as one of ten products for       which `sustainable road maps' were to be created.
Our study for Defra       (Fisher et al., 2008) was cited in the Sustainable Clothing Action         Plan progress report (Defra, 2011c: 7) as having informed industry       stakeholders.
Staff subsequently undertook several projects on clothing       for WRAP working with companies such as Superdry, Monsoon and Primark who       sit on its Design Working Group.
The Evidence Base report for Valuing         our Clothes (WRAP, 2012) acknowledged Cooper as specialist       consultant and staff also worked on projects on design and on a Longevity       Protocol to support industry efforts to increase clothing lifetimes.
This latter work is too recent for changes in production or sales to be       measured, but industry engagement provides evidence of the practical       impact of earlier research.
The reach of the underpinning research is evidenced by invitations (i) to       participate on United Nations, European Commission and UK Government       expert panels and to attend associated workshops, (ii) to write chapters       for two Council of Europe reports and The Handbook of Sustainable         Design, and entries for the Encyclopaedia of Consumer Culture,       and (iii) to make keynote presentations at events led by bodies such as       the Design Research Society, International Solid Waste Association and the       Chartered Institution of Wastes Management.
The significance of the research is that it has provided a systematic       mapping of potential government measures to influence the life-span of       consumer goods and thereby improved awareness and understanding of         government bodies, industry and other organisations.
This policy       field, largely neglected for the past 30 years, has latterly gained       importance in the context of a UN agreement by governments to develop       policies on sustainable consumption and production and EU policy on waste       reduction.
