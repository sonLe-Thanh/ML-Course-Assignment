     The research has led to 3 principal impacts:             application of the algorithms on a North Sea oil field, leading to an         additional 3 million barrel recovery (equivalent to $330M additional         income at a current oil price of $110/barrel) over their original         development plan [S3];        implementation of ERPE multi-objective optimisation algorithms by BP         in their internal `TDRM' code base and        formation of a spin-out company to commercialise application of the         algorithms developed in the uncertainty group to the oil industry [S1].
The first impact is an additional 3 million barrels of oil obtained by BP       using the ERPE multi- objective algorithms.
BP has applied the new code       base to the task of optimising locations of additional injection and       production wells in one of their North Sea fields.
The use of the multi-       objective algorithms discovered a new well arrangement yielding an       additional 3 million barrels over the optimised development plan produced       by their engineer.
In this case, multi-objective optimisation was of       tremendous value as it allowed them to optimise both short-term oil (to       recoup the cost of drilling the new wells), and long-term oil (to maximise       the profitability) of the project.
BP's comment on the project was "The         collaboration between ERPE and BP has resulted in a step-forward in         practical, multi-objective optimisation capability for the industry"       [S3].
The second impact is that BP has taken the ERPE multi-objective       algorithms, developed in the TSB project [G1] and incorporated them in       their internal history matching and optimisation code during 2012 and       2013.
The incorporation of the algorithms was assisted by their       recruitment of Asaad Abdollahzadeh, one of the ERPE researchers, into BP       from Jan 2013.
The third impact was the formation of spin-out company, Epistemy       (SC365481) in September 2009 providing 3 full-time and 3-part time jobs.
The company has made &#163;267k in sales of its Raven history matching and       optimisation software since 2012.
It has recently started attending trade       shows and generating significant interest (10 strong leads, with one trial       set up and one booked for Oct 2013) [S1].
The stochastic optimisation       algorithms in the latest release of Epistemy's Raven code (those developed       in [G1]) have already been deployed in history matching of real field data       by engineers in Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) (DOI:10.2118/164817-MS).
JOGMEC's       comment on the software was: "The software is a practical and simple         tool for history matching real field data and optimising field         developments; it has given us a significant speed improvement over our         previous algorithm, and has made it possible to deploy the advanced         techniques in Raven within our team" [S2].
The beneficiaries of all 3 impacts are: practicing reservoir engineers       who use the techniques in history matching reservoir models to data (see       for example [4] for application to a Russian oil field, and [3] for       application of BOA to history matching a BP oilfield, demonstrating a       significant performance improvement), and the impact on the UK economy of       3 new full-time and 3 part-time jobs created since 2009 [S1].
Additionally, industry support of &#163;2.8M has been received from 10       international oil companies over 4 three-year phases of a Joint Industry       Project [G2].
As a result of the research published, we have also received       &#163;420k funding from AWE [G3] to transfer ideas from the oil industry to       AWE.
The interaction with AWE has led to improvements in their capability       [see example in S4], and has underpinned their decision to support EPSRC       Programme Grant [G6] by continuing Christie's William Penney Fellowship       [G3].
