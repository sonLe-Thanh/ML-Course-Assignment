     Pathways to Impact: The increasing salience of the themes of       immigration and diversity has created a pressing demand for       research-informed expertise.
In order to reach out to policymakers, third       sector groups and communications organisations, the researchers employed       an integrated impact strategy.
This approach began with the `Challenges to       Cohesion' conference (UoM, 11/2008), and has ensured that breadth and       significance are balanced.
It involves:             Disseminating research in partnership with non-academic actors,         as concise policy briefings, or targeted (including media) interventions         on key emerging issues, to inform public debate.
Building long-standing relationships with governmental, party         political and civil society actors, in order to disseminate evidence,         and effectively support evidence-based interventions.
(1) IMPACT ON GOVERNMENT     (i) Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG): Ford,       Goodwin and Sobolewska have worked closely with DCLG, who are active in       policymaking around integration and violent extremism.
This work has       included: a paid expert review of DCLG evidence on attitudes to violent       extremism (4/2010); a private discussion of immigration attitudes       research, with a specially prepared briefing (4/2010); an event on race       equality policy (11/2010); personal consultations on Islamophobia and       anti-Muslim hate crimes (3/2012); a meeting on integration and extremism       with Under Secretary of State Andrew Stunell MP and senior policymakers       (6/2012) &#8212; subsequent to which Stunell's Senior Research Officer e-mailed       to say: "Your presentation was well received and has stimulated much         discussion here"; and a roundtable event on integration and cohesion       issues where key results from the immigration survey were presented in a       specially prepared briefing (7/2012), with subsequent pick up of ideas,       and a series of knowledge exchange workshops with senior policymakers       ensuing (2/2013) [1].
(ii) Home Office Migration Advisory Committee (MAC): Ford and       Sobolewska were commissioned as part of a paid expert consulting team       reporting on `The Impacts of Migration on Social Cohesion and       Integration'.
Findings were presented to Home Office ministers       (23/9/2011), with the MAC Secretariat praising the report: "We are         very pleased with the content of your report and the contribution that         it makes to the literature in this area... [I]t will be useful for the         MAC and policymakers to be able to draw on [your] discussion of         this issue and the distinctions that you make in future" [2].
The       report was subsequently published on the Home Office website (1/2012),       forming part of a widely cited and highly regarded set of evidence-driven       academic reports from MAC to policymakers.
The report led to an important       shift in the policy recommendations submitted to ministers, switching from       an emphasis on negative social impacts to an emphasis on the limited       impact of migration on social cohesion, and a call for greater focus on       economic deprivation [2].
(iii) Government Office for Science (GO-S): Both EMBES and other       core research by the team informed the GO-S report on `The Future of       Identity', with UoM findings &#8212; on generational change in religious       identities, on the role of relative deprivation and perceived       discrimination on ethnic and British identity, and of dissatisfaction with       British democracy on the part of second-generation people of Caribbean       heritage &#8212; highlighting opportunities and challenges for government over       the next ten years, via policy recommendations published in the final       report (1/2013) [3].
(iv) Cabinet Office/Electoral Commission: Findings on electoral       registration have been drawn on, in developing proposals for the planned       move to individual electoral registration (IER).
The Electoral Commission       confirm that: "EMBES has enabled us to better understand the         registration levels of important groups within Britain... [and] will         better facilitate the Electoral Commission's future assessments of the         move to IER.
It will be an important source of evidence for reviewing         the impact of the changes on the five ethnic groups included in the         study" [4].
(2) IMPACT ON POLITICAL PARTIES (Expert Briefings):     (i) The Conservative Party: Ford and Goodwin presented key       findings, on the far right and attitudes to minorities, to senior       Conservative MPs and policymakers, in a meeting chaired by the Tim       Montgomerie, editor of conservativehome.com (5/2009), and two meetings       chaired by Baroness Warsi (12/2009 &amp; 1/2011).
Resultantly, UoM       research helped to inform the `Nothing British' campaign group, founded to       combat the BNP.
The researchers attended a strategy dinner (3/2010),       followed by regular communication with the group's director, who commended       Ford's contribution: "Thank you very much for taking the time to speak         to us yesterday.
I...thought we made good progress on a difficult issue"       [5].
Additionally, Ford and Goodwin's research on attitudes to Muslims and       minorities provided important background information for Baroness Warsi's       influential early 2011 speech on Islamophobia.
(ii) The Labour Party: Ford has been consulted by advisors to Ed       Miliband MP (Leader of the Opposition) concerning the development of       migration and integration policy, briefing senior policy aides (12/2011       &amp; 11/2012), and preparing a paper for Harvey Redgrave, senior Miliband       aide and Head of Home Affairs policy.
This was followed up with an       interchange on migration and integration issues, drawing on EMBES, which       informed the approach outlined in Miliband's prominent speech on       immigration and integration (12/2012).
Redgrave attests: "Your analysis         on public attitudes and segregation made an important contribution to Ed         Miliband's integration speech in December and Ed was personally very         grateful for your efforts" [5].
(iii) The Liberal Democrats: Ford delivered an expert briefing on       British immigration attitudes to the Liberal Democrats `Immigration       Working Group' (20/3/2013).
The specially prepared briefing was attended       by senior policymakers and was well received, with a former Minister       (Stunell) noting that: "We really appreciated your clear and cogent         presentation of public opinion evidence and research...
The information         you provided has helped to inform our discussions and will impact on how         we develop the Liberal Democrat policy in this area come September"       [5].
(iv) All Party Parliamentary Group on Migration (APPGM): Ford has       built a strong ongoing relationship with the APPGM, which aims to develop       a balanced and informed debate on migration among MPs and policymakers.
He       wrote a widely circulated briefing document (7/2011) summarising key       research findings, appeared in person at two MP briefings (7/2011 &amp;       12/2011) and at a Labour conference fringe meeting (9/2011).
The briefing       has been described &#8212; in a letter signed by key figures in the group &#8212; as "a         vital resource, enabling policymakers to inform themselves about the key         academic findings on this important and contentious issue" [6].
(3) IMPACT ON CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS     (i) The `Changing Minds' Consortium has provided over &#163;250K to       develop and analyse two modules of immigration attitudes survey questions.
Key results have been presented to the senior grant managers from these       organisations (a cross-section of the most influential third sector       organisations working in this policy area) in regular briefings, and have       influenced their strategy.
The former co-ordinator of Changing Minds notes       that: "analysis from the British Social Attitudes survey has informed a         number of advocacy strategies of civil society organisations... Ford         has, through introductions facilitated by foundations, briefed and         educated policymakers, opinion formers and decision-makers (including         politicians) directly.
For example, briefings to the All Party         Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Migration were widely circulated beyond         those directly briefed....Dr Ford's work has clearly had multi-level         impacts on public understanding and debate on race, migration,         integration, and identity in the UK.
Similarly, the current       co-ordinator, adds: "Dr Ford has been an invaluable contributor to the         work of funders and NGOs in the field of immigration.
He has presented         to a wide cross section of individuals, provided written briefings, and         developed an important set of immigration focused questions to augment         the data generated by the British Social Attitudes.
Dr Ford's academic         rigour and accessible style has enabled organisations to use his work to         shape their strategies: There is no question he has improved the quality         of evidence and analysis underpinning this policy area" [7].
(ii) The Runneymede Trust: Sobolewska and Heath's ongoing       collaboration with Runneymede led to a successful bid to develop the       website ethnicpolitics.org to disseminate key findings from EMBES       (1997 &amp; 2010) in an accessible format, providing interactive analysis       facilities so that users can easily generate their own data       visualisations.
Heath wrote a briefing paper with the organisation's       research director that was widely circulated to policymakers via the       Trust's website, and through its role as secretary to the All Party       Parliamentary Group on Race and Community.
As Runneymede's Head of Policy       Research attests: "Maria's work is particularly valuable... in         explaining this evidence to politicians, journalists, thinktanks, other         race equality and migrant organisations, and indeed wider society.
With         EMBES, we now have much more robust evidence and are also able to         disaggregate patterns among different ethnic groups.
We have used this         evidence... as our response to the government's proposals on individual         electoral registration... and Runnymede has highlighted Maria's findings         in discussions with ministers, civil servants and indeed wider society"       [8].
EMBES research and data has helped to inform and shape public debate       about how different political parties appeal differently to different       ethnic groups, especially how the Conservatives are still much less likely       to appeal to ethnic minority voters.
There have also been press articles       discussing EMBES data in conjunction with this debate, including twice in       the Economist magazine [9].
This finding also informed a Radio 4 episode       of the `Analysis' programme: `A New Black Politics?'
(6/11/2011).
Online       briefing papers and a video about EMBES have been uploaded on the       Runnymede Trust's website, with the team publishing an article online for       the Guardian's `Comment is Free' column that attracted over 500 responses       [9].
The work was also cited by Lord Ashcroft, conservativehome.com, and       by Gavin Barwell MP in the Telegraph [9].
(iii) British Future: Ford has communicated findings to senior       staff, regularly consulting over research and communications strategies.
In particular, he co-authored a widely discussed report on ethnic mixing &#8212;       `The Melting Pot Generation'.
The director of British Future confirmed the       value of this contribution: "We have regularly made use of Rob's         expert opinions and research knowledge... to ensure our own work is         accurate...
Rob's contributions... have had a genuine impact on the work         that we do... help[ing] to ensure that the accessible frame we         offered to media outlets &#8212; about athlete Jessica Ennis being         representative of an emerging social trend and "generation shift" in         attitudes &#8212; was reported in a solidly informed, evidence-based way,         which used that accessible personal story as a way in to reporting         academic research findings, helping academic research to reach a very         wide public audience" [10].
