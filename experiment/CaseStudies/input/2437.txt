     The work performed at the MRC Human Genetics Unit created the foundations       of OPT and       demonstrated the enormous potential of this technique in the biomedical       sciences.
Huge interest       associated with the original publication (front cover of "Science"       magazine and over 400 citations in       the scientific literature [ISI Web of Knowledge]), together with the       patents secured, rapidly       translated into successful commercialisation and world-wide popularisation       of this new technology.
Impact on commerce       In response to the discovery of OPT, MRC Technology &#8212; the exclusive       technology transfer agent       for the UK's Medical Research Council &#8212; formed MRCT Bioptonics.
MRCT       Bioptonics was       responsible for the promotion and licencing of OPT technology, the       manufacturing and distribution       of OPT equipment and the provision of OPT scanning services [5.1, 5.2].
Five people in full-time       employment managed the development and marketing of OPT between 2008 and       2012.
In       addition, a significant part of the manufacturing work was outsourced to       the Belgian company       SkyScan (employment figures unavailable; SkyScan was acquired in 2012 by       Bruker Corporation       adding ~$13M to Bruker's annual revenue [5.3]).
In 2006, MRCT Bioptonics       developed a       commercial OPT scanner, the OPT 3001.
Since January 2008, more than 30       instruments have       been sold to multiple countries around the world including in the UK, USA,       Canada, Sweden,       Finland and Switzerland.
During this period, MRCT Bioptonics staff       provided specialist training in       the use of OPT technology to approximately 50 users from multiple       countries including the UK,       USA, Spain, Singapore, Canada, and Germany.
The sales figures for MRCT       Bioptonics in the       period 2008-2012 were as follows: &#163;775,129 (financial year 2008-9),       &#163;523,736 (financial year       2009-10), &#163;194,977 (financial year 2010-11) and &#163;773,054 (financial year       2011-12) [5.2].
In addition, in November 2008, the MRC licenced OPT technology to a major       international       microscopy manufacturer (name withheld because of a confidentiality       agreement).
Three of the       patents are licensed to this company for further development and       manufacture [5.2].
MRC and MRC Technology have also invested in OPT's potential use in       pathology diagnostics.
As       a pilot, they have developed a sponsored collaboration of &#163;190,000 with       the University of Dundee,       NHS Tayside and Oxford University to investigate OPT use in the diagnosis       of colonic polyps [5.2].
Impact on professional services       Chapters on OPT are now a standard part of major international microscopy       textbooks [5.4] and       OPT technology was a feature at the EMBO Practical Course on 3D       developmental imaging in       2009 and 2010 [5.5].
OPT instruments are available at scientific       institutions in multiple countries       and have become a routine service offered by their imaging facilities [5.6       a-e].
It is difficult to       estimate the number of people using OPT on regular basis but it must be       substantial judged by the       number of OPT-based publications available in the public domain (over 100       papers are listed on       the MRCT Bioptonics web-site alone; two of the Wellcome Image awards in       2011 were given for       images produced using OPT [5.1]).
In April 2012, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)       workshop supported by the       European Union's InfraCoMP programme agreed on a common strategy to       undertake phenotyping       of embryonic lethal lines.
The IMPC aims to create 20,000 knockout mouse       strains over the next       ten years and it is estimated that at least 30% of all these strains will       die during the embryonic or       perinatal periods.
The IMPC listed OPT as one of the leading 3D imaging       techniques considered       for high-throughput screening of embryonic phenotypes in its Bloomsbury       report on mouse embryo       phenotyping [5.7].
OPT is already used in several other "atlas-type"       projects including EMAP - the       e-Mouse Atlas Project [5.8], the Interactive 3D Mouse Limb Anatomy Atlas       [5.9] and the e-Chick       Atlas of Gene Expression [5.10].
