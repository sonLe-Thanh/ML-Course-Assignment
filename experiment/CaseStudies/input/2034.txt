     Modern high-performance distributed systems such as grids and clouds have       developed rapidly through the wide use of component-oriented approaches       usually using the Java programming language.
The main goal of our work in       this area has been the design and implementation of a highly productive       and efficient component-based framework for the rapid development of       complex distributed applications.
The impact created by this research is       based on the invention of a new abstract model and corresponding       implementation approach for a component-oriented distributed software       development with much higher productivity.
Following the initial ideas and results introduced in the       component-oriented approach for distributed and high-performance       computing, the European Network of Excellence CoreGRID advanced       significantly in this new field.
Our conceptual research results have been       used as an enabling approach for the `invisible' grid concepts and for       developing the Grid Component Model (GCM) specification, as well as       initial proof-of-concept experiments.
These have proved particularly       successful within the vibrant collaboration environment established after       the creation, and as part of the operation and management of the European       Institute on "Grid Systems, Tools, and Environments" with more than 90       individuals participating from 12 different European countries.
The GIDE research team, led by Vladimir Getov, was a main partner in the       European GridCOMP project working in close collaboration with other       partners including INRIA Sophia Antipolis, University of Pisa,       IBM-Research, Tsinghua University, and Atos Origin.
GridCOMP designed and       built a fully functional platform incorporating our GIDE prototype which       has been used for highly productive development of user applications by       industrial partners in the areas of grid and cloud computing.
The reach of the impact (this is more than geographical): Demonstrated         ground-breaking wide-ranging impacts of major significance at world         level.
The significance of the impact: Based on the high-performance Java         component-oriented concepts and research results, Grid and Cloud         computing represent a fundamental shift in the delivery of information         technology services that has permanently changed the computing         landscape.
Evidence of the impact:            Following the initial ideas and results introducing the         component-oriented approach for distributed and high-performance         computing, the European Network of Excellence CoreGRID &#8212; http://coregrid.ercim.eu/         - advanced significantly this new field by using it as an enabling         approach for the `invisible' grid concepts and developing the Grid         Component Model (GCM) specification as well as initial proof-of-concept         experiments.
The GCM definition and specification have been approved and published         in four official industrial standards documents by the Technical         Committee GRID/CLOUD of the European Telecommunications Standards         Institute (ETSI) &#8212; "GCM           Interoperability Deployment", Aug 2008; "GCM           Interoperability Application Description", Aug 2008; "GCM           Fractal ADL", Mar 2009; and "GCM           Management API (Java, C, WSDL)", Mar 2010.
Following excellent technical results but most importantly because of         the unique success in standardisation the EU GridCOMP project was         announced the EC DG-INFSO project of the month for September 2009 &#8212; http://gridcomp.ercim.eu/        Two large companies &#8212; IBM and Atos Origin &#8212; both partners in the         GridCOMP project, have been using the GCM specification, standards, and         results.
Two other small enterprises &#8212; GridSystems and ActiveEon &#8212; have         also been working on the integration and further development of the         component-oriented framework.
The following user applications are known to have been developed using         our component-based methodology and framework http://gridcomp.ercim.eu/content/view/41/39/:                Biometric Identification System &#8212; IBM;         Aircraft Wing Design &#8212; ActiveEon;         Computing of Days Sales Outstanding Value &#8212; Atos Origin;         Extended Data Record Processing &#8212; Grid Systems.
Note: The official participation in the ETSI standardisation process was       done by INRIA on behalf of the GridCOMP consortium.
ETSI and INRIA have       agreed that they can provide appropriate letters confirming our       participation and contribution to the four ETSI standards references       above.
