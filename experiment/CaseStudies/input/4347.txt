     The development and implementation of agrobiodiversity conservation       strategies, specifically on crop wild relatives (CWR) and landraces (LR) in         situ and ex situ conservation by the Biosciences PGR       research group have had impact via both commissioned research from leading       international and national bodies and through leadership of key committees       and working groups.
Particularly noteworthy is the contribution and       influence of Dr Maxted's expertise in relation to the activities of the       United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
FAO, founded in       1943, recognised the need to maintain agrobiodiversity to sustain its       exploitation through plant breeding and other forms of plant utilisation.
This need to link conservation to utilisation was reiterated in the       Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) and the International Treaty on       Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) (2001), both of       which placed an obligation on policymakers to systematically conserve       national, European and international CWR and LR genetic diversity.
In       2011, the PGR group made a significant contribution to the FAO's Second       Global Plan of Action for PGRFA when their research was used as the basis       for in situ conservation and management of LR and CWR which forms       one of the four priority areas in the plan.
Translation of the research is       providing practical tools to help national agrobiodiversity agencies       throughout the world develop systematic conservation and use strategies,       such as the creation of effective national strategies for CWR and landrace       conservation, which in implementation promote their use in underpinning       food security.
The influence of the PGR group continues, with Dr Maxted       providing scientific oversight for the establishment led by FAO Commission       on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) of a global network       for in situ conservation (FAO, 2013).
FAO recognise the         significant impact stretching back to the 1980's of Maxted's research         and scientific leadership on global conservation and use of plant         genetic resources, especially in developing in situ conservation         methodologies and practical tools, which have been used to underpin         global food security (s1, s2).
The national conservation techniques developed by the PGR Group have now       been or are being applied through the EU FP7 funded PGR Secure project       (2010-2014) (http://www.pgrsecure.org/)       to conserve and promote use of agrobiodiversity in Albania, Azerbaijan,       Belarus, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Rep., Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy,       Portugal, Norway, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom, as well as countries       in Africa, South America, Central Asia, China and the Middle East.
The         Director General of Bioversity International has recognised Maxted's         work with their regional offices in West Asia and North African and         Sub-Saharan Africa on technology transfer and practical conservation         (s3).
He also notes Maxted's research leadership in European plant         genetic resource conservation through his chairing of committees and         obtaining of research funding, recently EU FP7 PGR Secure, which has         assisted national programmes in Europe to develop CWR conservation         strategies and action plans, as well as closer links between the         conservation and user communities to generate both sustainability and         commercial benefits.
Experience gained from PGR Secure has also been       used by the European Parliament `Technical options for feeding 10 billion       people' which investigates options for greater integration of plant       genetic resource conservation and crop breeding (s4).
The PGR group's research is also achieving policy and practical effects       through work with the Species Survival Commission (SSC).
The SSC is part       of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which was       founded in 1948 and describes itself as the world's oldest and largest       global environmental organization.
PGR interaction with SSC has led to the       establishment of the first global priority list of CWR species based on       their value as actual or potential trait donors for breeding and climate       change mitigation; the production of checklists for the countries of       Armenia, Bolivia, China, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, among others;       the gap analysis of 174 major crop gene pools and the development of       appropriate conservation strategies; the publication of a CWR manual for in         situ conservation and a toolkit to help national and regional       agencies plan agrobiodiversity conservation; and coordination of the       development of national and regional conservation strategies at an       international meeting held in Palanga, Lithuania (Sept 2011) attended by       110 agrobiodiversity conservationists from 43 countries.
The meeting       fundamentally changed the way agrobiodiversity is conserved.
There was a       shift from an ad hoc approach where each country acted       independently and agrobiodiversity was widely under-conserved, to a more       scientific approach where each country systematically conserves its most       important agrobiodiversity (those most likely to have exploitation       potential) and countries in turn collaborate to ensure regional and       ultimately global conservation of the species that are perhaps of highest       priority in sustaining humankind; this is now referred to as the       provisioning ecosystem service.
The SSC Chair notes that most         conservation work is focused at the ecosystem and species level, but         confirms the extent of Maxted's leadership and impact in conservation at         the genetic level within species, researching the threat facing the         1,300 priority species and making the link between conservation and         utilisation, so ensuring the conserved diversity is maintained and used         by plant breeders and other users to benefit and safeguard humankind         (s5).
Further the PGR group's research is playing an important role in the       developing world, through collaboration with Bioversity International in       Italy, International Centre for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia and the       International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas in Syria, each       of them members of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural       Research who are independent, non-profit research organizations whose       remit is to undertake innovative agricultural research on behalf of poor       people in developing countries.
The PGR group are contributing expertise       on practical conservation and technology transfer for a wide range of crop       species in Africa, South America, Central Asia, China and the Middle East.
Most recently, in 2009 Maxted played a central role in formulating and       implementing a new $50 million project funded by the Government of Norway       (s6).
This massive effort is focused on permanently conserving the       genetic diversity of the wild plants that are most closely related to the       world's most important crops.
The rationale is to protect and make       available the genetic diversity that underpins important ecological       characteristics in wild plants, with a view to introducing them into key       crops, either by conventional plant breeding or by genetic engineering.
The PGR group was responsible for researching the first global priority       list of 1,647 crop wild relative taxa that were most likely to be used by       plant breeders (http://www.cwrdiversity.org/checklist/)       and identify where globally these species required ex situ or in         situ conservation.
The former Director of the Royal Botanic         Gardens, Kew, acknowledges the central role Maxted played in planning         and implementing this critical global project and comments that "Dr.         Maxted is one of the world experts in the important work of conserving         plant genetic resources to underpin food security for the future" (s7).
Closer to home the PGR group's research is underpinning CWR and LR       conservation in the UK and Europe.
In his role as Chair of the UK PGR       Group (Defra Committee), Maxted oversees UK PGR policy and conservation       implementation.
The results from the Birmingham led UK inventory of crop       landrace diversity project which is on-going, has contributed to the UK's       national report to the FAO on the state of the UK's Plant Genetic       Resources for Food and Agriculture (2009).
Maxted has played an       instrumental role in establishing the Scottish Landrace Protection Scheme       for the Scottish Executive and jointly wrote the English CWR Conservation       Strategy document published by Natural England.
The latter led to joint       work with Natural England to designate the first European genetic reserve       for in situ CWR conservation in the Lizard National Nature Reserve       in Cornwall.
The Defra lead on PGR concludes "Both these lines of work         helped secure the UK's commitments to Aichi Target 13 agreed by the CBD         Conference of Parties in Nagoya in 2010 and was subsequently reflected         in England's Biodiversity Strategy 2020 which contains explicit         commitments to conserve both wild relatives and landrace" (s8).
