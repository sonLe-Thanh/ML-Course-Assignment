     Research on coloured glass forms the basis of impact on the social       enterprise Ten Green Bottles       (TGB) [5.7], a company based in New Radnor (Powys), that uses recycled       glass to make a variety       of products including jewellery, tableware and stained glass artefacts,       thus providing innovative       and interesting uses for recycled glass.
As part of its mission to secure       a more sustainable future       by reducing the amount of waste glass, TGB also aims to provide employment       opportunities for       individuals that would normally be excluded from the workplace, for       example those with learning       difficulties and mental health issues.
The collaboration between DMAP and TGB includes a jointly-funded KESS PhD       project that       contributes to the use of coloured glass in TGB's products, such as the       development of a solar       water heater made from recycled glass.
The connection between the       fundamental research on       colour centres and the optical properties of the recycled glass (and       simple analogues) allows the       effectiveness of the heat transfer of solar radiation to be optimised.
Here a fundamental and       practical understanding of the optical and thermal properties of the       recycled glass is required; this       is coupled with advanced thermal and fluid-flow modelling, a level of       expertise and insight that has       not been previously available to this small company.
Thus the KESS       partnership acts as an       enabler for impact as it enhances the level of communication between DMAP       researchers and       TGB.
Ten Green Bottles is able to benefit directly from access to DMAP       research into glasses and       liquids, which has enabled new processes and products to be developed.
As       the CEO of Ten       Green Bottles acknowledges in a letter to one of the key DMAP researchers,       it is because of the       SME's `interaction with [DMAP that they have] been able to         benefit from direct access to physics         research' which has `provided an opportunity [...] to enhance       [TGB's] current business and also the         potential to develop new products, specifically the development, design         and manufacturing of solar         water heaters, made from recycled glass' [5.1] Thus the DMAP       research makes a major       contribution to the `tangible, economic advantage' [5.1]       acknowledged by Ten Green Bottles.
As a social enterprise, Ten Green Bottles has a direct and positive       impact on the community in       south Powys and its regeneration.
In its capacity as one of the UK's       Community Interest       Companies (CIC), TGB offers workshops that allow participants to make       their own piece of       recycled glass, thus gaining an understanding of the process and       benefiting from the SME's       knowledge [5.2].
Ten Green Bottles CIC is also a recognised training       centre that offers community       members the opportunity to gain qualifications and to develop work skills,       which creates benefits       for socially challenged individuals as well as the long-term unemployed.
TGB's website states that       `previous trainees have been very successful with a high percentage         acquiring long term         employment after their time here.'
[5.3].
It is therefore vital for       Ten Green Bottles to continually gain       further insight `into the atomic scale structure of their aesthetically         pleasing materials' [5.1].
The       CEO of Ten Green Bottles also states that `The research and development         into coloured glasses         not only provides [the] social enterprise with a strong         commercial foundation but in a wider sense         will provide [the SME] with the knowledge and insight into the         use of recycled materials such that       [Ten Green Bottles] can contribute and inform the sustainability and         environmental debate' [5.1].
Including socially challenged individuals as well as student volunteers,       the diversity of Ten Green       Bottles' workforce underscores the SME's CIC mission which is promoted       through a number of       events including presentations and visits to other countries.
This is       exemplified in the SME's recent       visit to the Czech Republic, which proved beneficial to one of the student       volunteers.
As part of its       mission Ten Green Bottles is `pleased to offer a forum for students to         understand business with         social values and enterprise that is sustainable.'
[5.1].
It is       through its ties with academic       researchers, strengthened by the KESS studentship that contributes to the       knowledge transfer       between DMAP and Ten Green Bottles, that the SME can be `recognised as         having research         innovation and design at the heart of [their] business'       [5.1].
Considering Ten Green Bottles' efforts       to support those who work for the SME, a major success of the knowledge       transfer between DMAP       and Ten Green Bottles is that it `introduced [Ten Green Bottles'] workforce         and volunteers to         academia and extended their ambitions to higher education.'
