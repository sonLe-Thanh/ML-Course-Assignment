     1) The Barriers to Economic Activity Report contributed to important       labour market debates in both Wales and the UK (R6).
The Report       noted the importance of introducing more effective `gateways' for the       unemployed and also introducing new `gateways' for the inactive on       incapacity benefits.
Both these recommendations have been taken on-board       by the UK government in recent changes to labour market legislation.
The       report was cited in Government Reports including in "A Review of Local         Economic and Employment Development Policy Approaches in OECD countries",       OECD 2008 (C5).
In 2009 Blackaby and Murphy were       also requested to provide written and oral evidence to the Enterprise and       Learning Committee of the Welsh Government on unemployment and the       recession, given their research in the area of skills, unemployment and       the Welsh economy (C9).
R6 also noted the importance of redundancy on increasing       inactivity in Wales and the role of training and wage subsidies in       reducing unemployment.
During the recent recession (October 2008), the       Welsh Government introduced ProAct, based in part on this evidence from (R6).
The ProAct programme is unique in the UK and involves offering wage       subsidies and funding for training to firms to keep workers in employment       who would otherwise have been made redundant.
Estimates suggest 10,000       people were helped by ProAct to stay in work in Wales (C1).
An       Impact Evaluation of ProAct (C2) found 13% of companies supported       believed they would have closed altogether without help.
One manufacturing       company employing between 25-49 employees stated "without the wage         subsidy we would have lost at least another 5-6 staff".
A       multi-union spokesperson for the global conglomeration Tata said "unique         to Wales the ProAct scheme is set to benefit a large number of the         workforce protecting their jobs and further improving their         employability" (C4).
Rhodri Morgan First Minister for Wales, stated in 2005 (Forward C3)       "The Welsh Assembly Government is committed to developing policies on         the basis of a firm body of evidence and I am pleased to see that the         programme recommended by the Panel is beginning to make a real         contribution to policy development in Wales.
The major research into         `Barriers to Economic Activity' (R6) has been         particularly useful... and this has contributed to new proposals to help         raise economic activity".
A number of seminars were given to civil servants of the Welsh Government       outlining the findings and recommendations of the research.
Jonathan       Price, Chief Economist, Welsh Assembly Government stated in 2012, "The         major report produced for the Welsh Government on `Identifying Barriers         to Economic Activity' (R6) was very insightful and         contributed to Welsh Government policies to reduce economic inactivity         in Wales, which have seen the gap between Wales and the rest of the UK         fall and included the ProAct and ReAct programmes."
2) The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Autumn Statement of       2011 that the public sector pay free freeze would come to an end in       2012/13, with public sector pay awards of 1 per cent planned over the next       2 years.
Emphasis was also placed on making public sector pay more       responsive to local labour market conditions.
Evidence from the IFS was       quoted which revealed a public/private sector pay premium of around 8 per       cent and which found substantial differences in the regional pay premium.
Given their research background in this area Blackaby, Murphy O'Leary       and Staneva undertook a robustness test of the IFS research (R3)       and found it very sensitive to measurement issues and time period choice.
In particular regional differentials varied over time and were generally       much smaller in periods before the current recession and when plant size       was introduced (R1, R2, R4).
This research was quoted in the       evidence of the Welsh Government to the Pay Review Bodies which argued       against the introduction of market-facing pay (C6).
In the Autumn statement 2012 the Chancellor announced he would not be       pursuing market-facing pay in the public sector, "this means continuing         with national pay arrangements in the NHS and Prison Service and we will         not make changes to civil service arrangements either".
Margaret McEvoy, Deputy Director and Chief Economist Office of Manpower       Economics stated 2012, "In December 2011 the Chancellor asked the Pay         Review Bodies to consider how to make pay more market facing for certain         remit groups, including Agenda for Change staff in the NHS, teachers,         prison staff and senior staff in the public sector.
He noted that there         was substantial evidence that the differential between public and         private sector wages varies substantially between local labour markets.
The research 'An investigation of the IFS public- private sector pay         differential: a robustness check' by Blackaby Murphy O'Leary;         and Staneva (2012) on overall public-private         sector pay differentials was timely and its finding that for many         regions the differential is not significantly different from zero played         a valuable role in helping Review Boards assess the evidence on the         issue.
The research has been referenced in a number of the reports"       (R2, R3, C7, C8).
Subsequent research by the ONS (2012) found, when introducing       organisational size into wage equations, that the public/private sector       differential fell from 7.3% to 2.2%.
Ole Black, Deputy Director, Public       Policy Analysis Division ONS stated in 2013, "An important priority         for ONS was to improve our model to assess public and private sector pay         differences to help provide independent evidence to inform the debate         and policy on regional public sector pay.
As part of this work we looked         at and evaluated external work across a wide range of organisations.
One         piece of work that was particularly useful was the analysis carried out         by Swansea University which offered new insights into some of         the variables that influence the pay gap.
A particular area of interest         was the use of firm size within our model which we had not considered in         our earlier work.
Having studied the work of Swansea on this variable we         then explored using this within our model, which improved our analysis         and offered new insights".
In summary impacts include a) research that provided the needed support       for the introduction of ProAct in Wales (safeguarding 10,000 jobs) and b)       an important input into the debate initiated by the Chancellor of the       Exchequer in 2011 for more market facing pay for over 6 million public       sector employees in the UK, subsequently abandoned in 2012, which would       have resulted in millions of public sector workers in relatively less       prosperous areas of the UK seeing a reduction in their real wage rate.
Reflecting their research on the Welsh economy, and the labour market in       particular, members of the team have been in demand by the press and media       to discuss issues in the areas of unemployment and public sector pay.
Since 2008, they have undertaken 4 media appearances for the BBC       nationally, 14 for BBC Wales, 3 for ITV Wales, 2 for national radio, 28       for BBC Radio Wales and numerous interviews for the press.
Blackaby       was also extensively interviewed for two BBC Wales, Week-In Week-Out       documentaries on unemployment in 2008 and 2009. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8326865.stm       "Given his research in the area of labour markets and knowledge of the         Welsh economy Professor Blackaby is our first port         of call on a number of labour market issues particularly unemployment."
