     The immediate impact of this work is on the behaviours and policies of       commissioners and providers of criminal justice services.
At a national level Fox and Albertson have engaged in a range of       dissemination activities.
Their membership of the Home Office Economic       Research Advisory Group (2011 - present) and Chris Fox's membership of the       Ministry of Justice Evaluation Advisory Group (2012 - present) have       provided opportunities to influence national policy.
Fox and Albertson met       with the civil servant at the Ministry of Justice leading their Payment by       Results policy and subsequently members of the Payment by Results       policy-team.
Fox was invited to a roundtable discussion with the Policing       Minister to discuss how the new Policing and Crime Commissioners could       develop policy with an offender dimension.
Fox presented their model at       two seminars on `Personalisation in the Criminal Justice System' hosted by       the Ministry of Justice Academy for Commissioning in London (November       2012) and Manchester (April 2012).
The membership of the Academy is senior       managers from within the criminal justice system.
A total of 110 delegates       attended the two events.
Approximately 50% were from the Ministry of       Justice, the National Offender Management Service, Her Majesty's Prison       Service and Probation Trusts and approximately a third were from the       voluntary and private sectors.
Typical comments in the delegate evaluation       forms were "Chris Fox gave an interesting challenge to think about the way       we operate differently", "Challenged me to think differently".
The impact of this dissemination activity is summed up by a senior staff       in the criminal justice system:       "Professor Fox .
.
.
has worked with me to develop thinking about         personalisation in the criminal justice system, and consider what         learning can be applied from health and social care experience.
This has         led to publication of a number of articles, and he has spoken at         seminars for criminal justice professionals, policy makers and managers         to share research and provide practical examples for development.
Some         of this thinking is reflected in the recent Ministry of Justice         announcement on Transforming Rehabilitation."
(Former Director of         Offender Management, NOMS) [A]     "[Chris Fox's] work has become increasingly prominent within prisons         over the last two years.
By applying a humane approach to economics,         with an appreciation of the humane and social context of public policy,         he makes a particularly significant contribution.. .
[Through his work         on Justice Reinvestment] Professor Fox has helped to focus on creating a         more compelling case for this approach and helping to clarify what it is         and how it might have a positive impact."
(Senior Prison Governor) [B]     We have also worked with specific organisations including running       seminars about our approach for the senior management teams of two       Probation Trusts.
Our work has had a particular impact in Greater       Manchester where we work closely with the Transforming Justice       team.
Fox was a member of the Greater Manchester Transforming Justice       Steering Group (2010 - 11) and the Greater Manchester Reducing       Re-Offending Group (2010 - 2012).
MMU's research has supported a transformation agenda that has resulted in       a fundamental change in the way criminal justice services are organised       and commissioned:       "MMU has supported the programme of transformation work within Greater         Manchester by providing advice, guidance and academic rigour to local         proposals.
.
.
.
This has helped to build local capacity and capability         .
.
.
The provision of advice in relation to the potential for a Justice         Reinvestment approach .
.
.
has also supported Greater Manchester to         move to a broader model of "Transforming Justice"."
(Senior Manager from         Greater Manchester Public Service Reform Team) [C]     Our research has provided local policy-makers and commissioners with       stimulating innovations grounded in academic theory:       "Professor Fox worked with myself as Director of Offender Management         for NOMS, (2009 - 2011) and other colleagues from the criminal justice         sector and local authorities to help us explore the application of a         Justice Reinvestment approach to the Greater Manchester area.
He         provided research information about how such models have worked         elsewhere, and stimulated ideas about innovative practice.
He attended         multi-agency meetings and met with colleagues on a one to one basis."
(Former Director of Offender Management, NOMS) [A]     The MMU research is supporting organisational change within criminal       justice agencies in Greater Manchester:       "[T]he work [PERU] have done on Personalisation /Justice Reinvestment         is being noticed by Greater Manchester Probation Trust and chimes with         the learning we have gained from our own personalisation practice pilot         in Tameside.
My attendance at two of your seminars .
.
.
has provided me         with the academic underpinning needed to gain attention and land ideas         in my own organisation and in the GM public service reform team."
(Assistant Chief Executive Greater Manchester Probation Trust) [D]     Our impact extends to the private sector.
Since 2012 Chris Fox has been       an advisor to a FTSE 250 company working in the justice sector.
The       Managing Director of the Justice Division said [E]:       "Professor Fox has worked with us for 18 months to support our         understanding and development of an evidence based approach to         developing the government's Payment by Results policy as it relates to         offending.
In addition, he has provided independent evaluation and         advice which has assisted us in the preparation of submissions to the         Ministry of Justice supporting our approach to reducing re-offending.
Professor Fox's work on Justice re-investment has been widely shared and         appreciated by the justice community, including policy makers and         providers such as Interserve.
It is supporting a new approach to         solutions for better criminal justice outcomes."
(Managing Director)
