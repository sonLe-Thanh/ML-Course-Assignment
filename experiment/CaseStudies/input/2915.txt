     Context       Globally, ~two billion people have gut worm infections, with pregnant       women and children worst affected (WHO estimate).
Worm infections have an       enormous impact on the primary education of children who become too ill to       go to school.
Worm species also infect livestock, thus affecting the       global economy.
Although there are cheap, effective medicines for gut       worms, their use encourages drug resistance and does not prevent       re-infection.
Therefore these medicines are not a sustainable solution.
Education about worm transmission and appropriate treatment is critical to       reduce the impact of worm infection worldwide.
Pathways to impact       The research focuses on tropical diseases that do not affect the western       world, so Cruickshank and colleagues work with endemic communities to       improve their understanding of worm infections and appropriate treatment.
Grencis contributes to an internationally funded training/educational       course based in Uganda.
Nationally, the research is presented via `The Worm Wagon', which is a       comprehensive suite of engagement activities.
Activities are designed for       groups of mixed age, ability and language.
There is a direct link from       research to engagement activities, as shown in the table below:                                Research               Topic           Public               Resource                             Immune factors underlying susceptibility to parasitic worm             infection           Interactive computer simulation of the immune response and card             based games                             Immune response to parasite infection           Displays of parasites and &#8220;parasite uses&#8221;                             Biology of whipworm infection           Games, pamphlets, YouTube video                          Events are assessed via resource uptake (e.g., number of video views),       participant feedback and engagement in activities, questionnaires and       participant drawings to demonstrate learning.
Additionally, the UoM       Immunology Group trains researchers and museum educators in public       engagement practice.
The success of these engagement activities has been recognised:       Cruickshank, Pennock and Else were awarded the Manchester International       Women's Day 2013 Award for Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and       Mathematics for their work with the Worm Wagon.
Cruickshank was also       awarded the 2013 Society of Biology Science Communication Award for       Established Researchers.
Reach and significance of the impact     The impact has three components:     i.
International impact: through the `Immunology in the Tropics' course       in Africa     ii.
Working with immigrant communities in the UK: via engagement with the       `Inspired Sisters'     iii.
National impact: through public events such as the `Big Bang'       science fair, and engagement with primary and secondary schools across the       UK, including a majority of students (&gt;60%) from disadvantaged       backgrounds     Cruickshank and colleagues have hosted/been involved in over 40 events       from 2009 to date, with over 68,000 participants.
i.
Training African healthcare workers     Trained health workers and educators in endemic countries are critical in       improving the understanding of worm infection and distributing health       education messages.
Grencis contributes to the `Immunology in the Tropics' course in Uganda       (2009-2012).
Attendees from across Africa are primarily from educational       and research establishments.
This includes people from Uganda, Kenya,       Tanzania, Nigeria, Malawi, Cameroon, Ghana, Gabon, Rwanda and Burkina       Faso.
Attendees highly rated the course with feedback including: "Gained         good experience in research involving worms and how they cause         infections in humans" [A].
A Ugandan doctor studying an MSc in Immunology at UoM, provided the       following feedback: "You gave wonderful presentations about helminths         infections.
It was very interesting and I wanted to do some work in your         field...
The course [Immunology in the Tropics] was very helpful         to me in making my decision to enroll for this course [MSc in       Immunology]" [B].
ii.
Educating immigrant communities from Asia, Africa and the           Middle East     In collaboration with the Development Education Project (DEP), the UoM       Immunology Group worked with the "Inspired Sisters" to raise their       awareness of the causes and impact of worm infection [D].
Inspired Sisters       are a female community group who are recent immigrants from Asia, Africa       or the Middle East, based in Manchester.
It is important to educate this       community so that they can feed back information to relatives in affected       countries.
Cruickshank and colleagues correct misunderstandings about parasitic worm       infections, dispel mistrust and encourage uptake of anti-worm therapies.
A       key message is the importance of worm treatments in preventing children       losing education and improving immunity to co-infections such as malaria.
Sample feedback: "this is really important thank you" (Inspired       Sister community group participant) and "You are breaking barriers"       (Student/ex refugee from Sierra Leone) [A].
iii.
Increased student engagement with science and uptake of           science subjects     Feedback from teachers states that events like the Worm Wagon enrich the       science curriculum and influence student career choices.
For example: "It's         actually events like this that can determine what they [school       pupils] study and where they study at University" (Year 8 teacher,       Calday Grange Grammar School) [E].
Student questions indicate understanding/interest of fundamental       immunological processes, for example, "What happens to the debris once         the T cells have killed the bugs?"
(Year 6 pupil, St Mary's Primary       School, Horwich) [A].
Students who had not been taught immunology were       able to answer questions and complete scientific drawings, such as       parasite life cycles [A].
