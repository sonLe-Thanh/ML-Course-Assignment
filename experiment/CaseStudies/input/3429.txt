     Over a million people worldwide in many audience sectors have been       reached by UoL outreach.
The programme communicates LHC physics, of which       ~10% has direct input from UoL; that which is solely reliant on UoL is       highlighted in bold type.
Schoolchildren and teachers: PP forms part of the `A'-level       syllabus.
Tara has delivered talks in schools, masterclasses, and for       institutions (Institute of Physics (IoP), Royal Institution (RI), Science       Learning Centres) to ~1000 pupils and teachers (2008 onwards).
With an       STFC award (ST/F500456/1, 2008), she hosted and co-wrote five PP films,       distributed to schools in 2008 via IoP School's lecture DVD, which are       used as teaching aids in the UK/Ireland.
Success, quality and       sustainability is evidenced by: film interviews for Pearson to supplement       their A-level physics materials (2009); membership of the Pearson Physics       Expert Panel to review the A-level syllabus (2012, 2013); invitations to       address 6th formers (RI 2010, 2013, IoP); an STFC film       shortlisted for the International Science Film Prize (2008); films listed       on the STFC education website.
Science-inclined public: are targeted through talks at science       festivals (Edinburgh 2010/2012; European Science Open Festival 2010/2012;       British Science Festival (BSF) 2010/2012; Manchester 2012; Hay 2013;       Cheltenham 2013), learned societies (Royal Society 2008/2010/2011[2];       Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) 2009 [3]/2010; Royal         Irish Academy (RIA) 2009/2012; RI 2011/2013;       Gustavus Nobel Conference 2013), local societies and museums (IoP 2008,       2009; Science Museum 2009; University societies in Edinburgh 2008; Open       University 2010; University College London 2010; Liverpool 2011; STFC       2012).
The talks reached ~3000 in person, ~12,000 through lecture       webcasts, ~100,000 through follow-up media coverage of the Edinburgh, IET,       RIA and BSF events.
Success and quality is evidenced by:       invitations by science festivals and learned institutions, sell-out events       (Edinburgh 2012, BSF 2012, Manchester 2012); requests to host and edit       films for CERN on LHC (2008, &gt;500,000 views), LHCb (2011,       shortlisted for 2011 NHK Japan film prize festival, 2012 European Science       TV and New Media festival; 37,000 views).
The film work has led to       speaking engagements at film awards ceremonies (EuroPAWS 2010), and an       advisory position (RI video channel advisor, 2011 onwards).
Sustainability       is shown by appointments to enabling and advisory positions and by the       high number of invitations to talk nationally, and now, internationally.
General public: are engaged through big-screen presentations of PP       and media work.
Tara devised a project to play the STFC films on all BBC       UK Big Screens coinciding with the LHC-startup (2008).
The footfall was       ~20,000/screen, with an audience representative of the regional       gender/ethnicity/socio-economic composition.
This resulted in follow-up       local radio coverage.
Millions worldwide are reached through media work:       LHC-startup 2008 press/television; "Angels and Demons" release 2009       press/radio; LHC-startup 2010 press/radio; UK CERN press media visit         2013; Higgs news 2011/ 2012,/2013 press/radio/television; Antimatter         news 2010/, /2011, /2012, /2013 press/radio; Neutrino news 2011       press/radio/television; New physics news 2012, /2013 press/radio.
Quality is evidenced by repeat interviews with press (BBC news online,       Guardian, Irish Times, Financial Times, Sunday Times), radio (BBC World       Service/local radio/Radio 4, Drivetime (Ireland)), television (BBC news),       anecdotal evidence, contributions to series/documentaries on radio and       television.
Sustainability is evidenced by the high number of requests for       interview (Tara is a University, STFC and CERN press contact) and an       increasing demand for expert blog posts.
Technology-inclined public: are targeted through new media and       presentations.
Tara has delivered LHC news briefs to: technology       conferences Thinking Digital 2009; LIFT 2011; TEDxManchester 2012, ~700       reached in person, 8000 through web hosted talks; TEDxCERN 2013;       web-hosted video interviews for CERN, Google science fair and         follow-up interviews (18,000 hits), webcast lectures, short films, CERN         Google hangouts discussing latest research (2013).
Tara maintains       her own Twitter account (2010 onwards) to tweet LHC events and answer PP       queries.
Success is demonstrated by web hits, and the positive comments       posted by viewers.
Impact is evidenced by links on YouTube, and by       interviews being remixed for Symphony of Science ~730,000 views.
Sustainability is demonstrated by: requests for talks; continual hit       growth in web- based material; a rising Twitter follower count (&gt;2000).
Arts, media and policy makers: Approximately 500 have been reached       in person in discussion at: RFH (2011); Wellcome Trust (2012); Guardian         Open Weekend (2012).
Several thousand have been reached through       arts-based radio exploring ideas from PP and elsewhere.
Tara has worked       with: artists through Collide@CERN (Michael Trainor 2013, Christoph Keller       2013); novelists (Sara Maitland 2012-2013, Lucia Cox 2013).
Impact       is shown by requests for: discussions on Radio 3 and Radio 4; novelist       collaboration; participation in arts/science events.
Following       participation in the RS MP pairing scheme with Andrew Miller (2006), Tara       has: briefed the Science and Technology Select Committee on CERN (2011);       guided local MPs at CERN (Select Committee 2011, Esther McVey 2010).
That       this is useful is evidenced by follow-up work with Andrew Miller (ad hoc       briefing).
Sustainability and inspiration to others is evidenced by a UoL       PhD student being awarded an internship with the Science and       Technology Select Committee (2013).
