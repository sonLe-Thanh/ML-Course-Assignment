     The impact of this project lies not only in the musical works which have       been produced during the research but also in the new understandings which       have been developed as the project has progressed about the ways in which       listeners respond to and understand multiple streams of auditory       information in these musical works and, by extension, in texted vocal       music in general.
Performance of the musical works has generated new       hypotheses about auditory streaming and in the latter phases of the       project the testing of these hypotheses has embraced both compositional       practice and scientific investigation, a process enabled by substantial       support from the Wellcome Trust.
Although the impact of the latter phases of this project are potentially       the most wide-reaching and influential, there has nevertheless been       considerable impact at every phase.
The initial output, 20 Ways To         Improve Your Life, generated extensive interest through its musical,       textual and social significance.
The work was presented and discussed on       BBC Radio 3's The Verb while it was still a work-in-progress; it       received concert and street performances at the Spitalfields Festival and       was recorded by Signum Records for a CD which on release was in Gramophone       magazine's Top Ten for January 2010.
It was also heard on the soundtrack       of Channel 4's Dispatches documentary, `The trouble with Boris',       and a new version for mass participation was commissioned by the Greater       London Authority and performed outside the Tower of London.
Sing a new song has been published by Faber Music and is also       available as a download from the Sing Up website.
It has been       adopted by a number of schools, particularly in east London and in       Cambridgeshire and was broadcast in BBC Radio 3's The Choir.
The impact of the initial stages of this research were recognised by the       Wellcome Trust when they chose to support the application made by The       Clerks to develop the project further with a grant from the Trust's Small       Arts Award scheme.
The impact was also demonstrated by the willingness of       three scientists, Professors Ian Cross and Sarah Hawkins of Cambridge       University and Dr Antje Heinrich of Leicester University, to join the       project team for the development of Roger go to yellow three.
They       were involved in presentations of the research at the 2011 Cambridge       Festival of Ideas and further interest in the project was reflected in its       discussion on BBC Radio 3's Music Matters programme and public       performances in Cambridge and Huddersfield, The performances of Roger         go to yellow three drew a further positive response from the       Wellcome Trust, who were impressed not only by the work's impact in       developing public understanding of the phenomenon of auditory streaming       but also by the way that the auditory tests embedded in the work enabled       the project's scientific advisers to undertake new scientific research.
The data collected in the Roger go to yellow three performances       was extensively analysed and yielded findings which offer new insights       into the phenomenon of masking.
Dr Antje Heinrich presented an initial       survey of these findings, under the title `Stream segregation of speech in       live concert-hall performances of a 6-voice choir', at the British Society       of Audiology's 2012 conference.
The success of Roger go to yellow three, as a project which not       only encouraged public engagement in science but also enabled scientists       to gather new experimental data, led to the Wellcome Trust inviting The       Clerks to submit an application for a Large Arts Award to develop further       the work begun in Roger go to yellow three.
Confirmation of the       impact of the research and the Wellcome Trust's commitment to the project       came in summer 2012 when this application was approved and the impact of       the project was further demonstrated by the widespread interest of       festivals and concert promoters in presenting the new work, Tales from         Babel.
A fourth scientist, Dr Sarah Knight, joined the team to       oversee data collection and public presentations of the scientific aspects       of the project.
Scenes from Tales from Babel were presented on 5th       April 2013 during the Second International Conference of the AHRC Research       Centre for Musical Performance as Creative Practice, at the British       Neuroscience Association's biennial meeting at the Barbican, London on 8       April 2013 and at Addenbroke's Hospital; the premiere of the complete work       was given as part of the Cheltenham Festival of Music on 7 July 2013, the       first date in a concert tour which extended into the autumn of 2013.
In       the wake of the Cheltenham Festival there has been extensive media       coverage including BBC Radios 3 (In Tune and The Choir) and       5 Live, and articles in the Independent, NME, Times, London Evening         Standard and Guardian.
