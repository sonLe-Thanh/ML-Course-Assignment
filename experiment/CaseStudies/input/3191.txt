     The close interaction and collaboration with BAE Systems resulted in the       creation of a computational electromagnetics technology that has empowered       design engineers to use computational modelling to shorten design cycle       times.
In addition, engineering insight, hitherto unavailable, has been       gained through the comparison of high fidelity modelling results with       trials data.
The adoption and use of robust, low-order, Galerkin-based       schemes, using unstructured grids, for the time-domain solution of       Maxwell's equations for the analysis of scattering from complex       multi-material bodies, resulted in a step-change in capability for       modelling electromagnetic systems within BAE Systems.
The work guided the       adoption of mesh refinement strategies at BAE Systems, resulting in       increased accuracy in Radar Cross Section (RCS) prediction for problems       involving scattering from electrically large objects with localised       small-scale features.
The accurate modelling of multi-material,       multi-layer structures enabled the optimisation of radar absorbing       material, the characterisation of in situ frequency selective       surfaces by means of full-field optimisation and the investigation of       sophisticated Jaumann absorbers for low observable platforms.
"BAE Systems has worked very closely with the Swansea group both         defining the requirements and guiding the research.
This has involved         co-working and the exchange of research personnel between Swansea and         the Advanced Technology Centre (ATC), including the recruitment of         experienced research personnel from Swansea as an adjunct to technology         transfer.
The success of the high-risk research undertaken by Swansea         has resulted in developed technology being taken in-house and further         developed by BAE Systems' personnel for business-specific requirements,         not least of these being the inclusion of sophisticated frequency         dependent material's models.
Given the scale of BAE Systems and its         diverse interests, the enormity of the breadth and scope of problem to         which the resulting time-domain capability has been applied is extensive         and its geographic application international.
The technology has enabled         the analysis of problems across the broad spectrum of the         Electromagnetic Engineering (EME) domain."
[Former Executive       Scientist and Technology Fellow, BAE Systems, ATC, Filton]     The results of electrically large simulations were also used to devise       trials for complex engineering platforms.
The modelling process was used,       and further developed to a high degree of sophistication, by BAE Systems       Military Aircraft and Information.
This led to savings, in both time and       money, on the radar range and in the quantification of the manufacturing       and engineering tolerances required to avoid spurious scattering from       features on low observable platforms.
The developed capability was used on such diverse programmes as TYPHOON       and the Taranis UCAV.
In 2009, the four nations of the Eurofighter       consortium signed the contract for the first 112 of the Tranche 3       production aircraft.
The underpinning modelling capability developed by Swansea assisted BAE       Systems participation in European Framework projects FULMEN, CATE and       EMHAZ which addressed aircraft protection from the direct and indirect       effects of lightning, issues of electromagnetic compatibility and       protection against electromagnetic interference.
The ability of the       approach to model non-coordinate aligned wires and cables, contributed to       analyses performed in the pan-European 26M&#8364; HIRF-SE (High Intensity       Radiated Field Synthetic Environment) 7th Framework project.
"In the area of electromagnetics, financial support from, and close         technical liaison with, BAE Systems ATC led to the adoption of the         Swansea unstructured mesh approach as a design tool within BAE Systems         at the ATC, at Naval Ships and at Military Air and Information.
The         technology has had critical impact on:     (a) unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) design, demonstrating the         principle of rapid full field solutions, showing the art of the possible         and formulating the future technology direction for key programmes for         the MoD;     (b) testing and evaluation for the analysis of design options prior to         trials and subsequent comparison with experimental range results;     (c) the modelling of frequency selective surfaces (FSS) for radomes         and aperture windows;     (d) the analysis of lightning strike induced arcing and sparking         phenomena for product reliability;     (e) EMC analysis and meshing for aircraft and naval vehicles,         radiation hazard (RADHAZ) analysis for naval platforms including Type 23         and Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF, Elizabeth Class);     (f) greater integration of EM and CFD modelling as the commonality of         unstructured numerics ensured that the subsequent development and         industrialisation cost of the delivered codes was greatly reduced,         enabling BAE Systems to capitalise on its expertise and deliver tighter         integration between electromagnetic and aerodynamics, which is the key         to BAE Systems core competencies in integrated design and utilised on         the Taranis UCAV programme for example."
