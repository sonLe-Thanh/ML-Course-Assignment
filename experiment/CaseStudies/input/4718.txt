     There were four key strands to the activity and impact       arising from this bedrock research.
Strand 1, 2002-present.
This strand generated significant new,       open-access, online resources for family history researchers.
As well as       digitizing and posting online data secured from the archive, the project       located, digitized and disseminated related materials through its site,       including 22,000 staff records from Customs files.
The project also       involved setting up an email facility through which to respond to       genealogical and research queries.
This facility has garnered some 400       family and other contacts and exchanges to date, and has also led to       transfers of significant private materials to institutional repositories.
[a]     Strand 2, 2006-present.
The researchers interacted with a range of       contacts to build up a significant online digital resource of `Historic       photographs of China' (HPC).
These images, which were held by families or       institutions, support teaching and learning, genealogical research,       academic research and simple popular interest.
There are 9,803 uploaded       images; 8,572 are currently live; and over 30,000 images have been       digitised in total to date.
Users contacting the project state that they       are using them for private family research; for scholarship across       disciplines (including scientific research - eg photographs which evidence       changing river-levels); because they wish to exhibit some of the pictures       in museums (eg Changsha &amp; Wuhan Municipal Museums) or on websites (eg       a site illustrating the built heritage of the Russian Orthodox Church in       China); for local heritage research (eg in Ningbo city [b]); and       for commercial purposes in publications, including books, academic and       popular journals, including the 26,000-circulation International         Institute of Asian Studies Newsletter [c], and Deutsch-Chinesische         Zeitung (a German newspaper about China).
This resource, accorded British Academy Research Project status in 2006       (renewed 2011), has been the exclusive subject (in this review period) of       four different exhibitions at seven sites in three cities across the UK:       Bath (Jan-Apr 2008: 1,700 visitors); Durham (Apr-Aug 2008: 7,096       visitors); Bristol (Jan-Feb 2009: 2,700 visitors), and 2 in China (2013:       see Strand 3).
There have also been exhibitions in Spain       (Pamplona: Nov, 2009; Navarre: three sites, Feb-April 2011), and       collaborations with the British Library on an exhibition at the National       Library of China (`Western Eyes': Sept-Oct 2008), with Hong Kong Museum of       History (two exhibitions - `Modern Metropolis': Apr-Aug 2009; `Centenary       of China' s 1911 Revolution': Mar-May 2011), and the Dr Sun Yat-sen       Museum, Hong Kong, on `Revolution Once More': Sept 2010-Mar 2011.
The last       of these was also shown in the Guangzhou Museum (Mar-Jun 2011) and the       Jinan Museum (Oct 2011).
This strand has involved collaboration with the Institut d'Asie Orientale       on developing the website, and with the Institute for Learning and       Research Technology's Web Futures team on a JISC-funded project to create       a new, cross-site search tool (`Visualising China').
The strand has also       entailed dissemination through other media.
For example, an article by       Robert Bickers entitled `China through a colonial lens' appeared in History         Today magazine (October 2011); the online activity was featured by       AHRC as a website case study as well as in its 2009 report `Leading the       World' [d], and in 2013 in its new online Image Gallery [e],       and was also the subject of a Weekly Telegraph article (31 Aug-6       Sept 2011); and the project was the sole focus of a BBC Radio 4       documentary (`Old Photographs Fever', 11 July 2012, [f] also       excerpted on `Pick of the Week') which was complemented by a BBC News       Magazine website article, `The search for photos of China's historic       past'.
[g]     Between May 2012 and October 2013, the combined project websites HPC and       `Visualising China' received an average of 154 unique visits a day.
The       number of unique visitors was 63,385, with 102,762 total visitors.
On       average, 64.11% a month of these were new visitors.
Between March 2010 and       November 2011 HPC alone had already secured a further 39,813 unique       visitors.
Strand 3, 2006-present The project engaged with a range of UK and       foreign state contacts, including, for example, the UK Foreign &amp;       Commonwealth Office FCO), China's General Administration of Customs, the       Danish Consulate-General in Shanghai (which was preparing a centennial       review of Sino-Danish relations (2008)), the Norwegian Customs Museum,       Trinity House, the Hong Kong Maritime Museum, the United States National       Park Service, the US Defense Prisoner of War Missing Personnel Office       (2010) the Eire Consulate General in Shanghai (about commemorating Sir       Robert Hart (2012)), the Taiwan UK Representative Office (2013).
More       widely, the work has been used to attempt to bridge asymmetries in       understanding of the impact and legacy of Britain's wider historic role in       modern China.
[h] This has been pursued through public talks in the       UK, Hong Kong and China, including a talk to the FCO (December 2011);       through involvement in a British Inter-University China Centre (BICC)       seminar in June 2009 which enabled the FCO to consult with university       academics on its 2010 China Policy document (The UK and China: A         Framework for Engagement); and through popular journal articles (eg       Robert Bickers, `China's Age of Fragility', History Today (March       2011)) and other media.
These have included Robert Bickers, `Chinabound:       Crossing borders in treaty port China', History in Focus 11       (Autumn 2006); BBC Radio 3, `Nightwaves', February 2011 - a discussion       about The Scramble for China; interviews on RTHK Hong Kong and       Dublin City Radio; and a television series and film, `The Bund' [59166ee9]       (China Central Newsreel &amp; Documentary Studio       (4e2d592e65b0805e7d00930496fb5f7188fd72475ee0), 2010, for which Bickers       was academic consultant and interviewee.
In August, 2011 BICC organised a       public event on `China and Britain' with speakers from the FCO, as well as       journalists and policy makers.
In February 2013, a variety of stakeholders       in current China-UK relations, and families with historic China links,       were brought together in a public event to mark the restoration of the       tombstone of Sir Robert Hart (1835-1911) and to mark his contribution to       modern China, with a film about this initiative now in the late stage of       development.
[i] In Spring 2013 the FCO's Beijing embassy press       team, and Chongqing Consulate General press team organised public       exhibitions of HPC photographs in their respective cities.
At Beijing       (where the exhibit was opened by the Ambassador), audience reach was       estimated by the Deputy Head of Communications at: visitors 22,000; social       media campaigns reach: 1,635,402.
The Ambassador stated that the resource       provides: `a unique visual record of the longstanding shared history       between the UK and China.
They are a reminder of the strength and depth of       our relationship, one which is increasingly important to both countries as       China continues its development'.
The audience reach at Chongqing was:       visitors 80,000; social media reach 200,000; articles in press with       readership of 3 million+.
The Chongqing Consulate General Head of       Communications reported that the exhibition, and opening reception and       workshop "supports our public diplomacy objectives through demonstrating       the strength and depth of UK-Chongqing bilateral relations, but also       provides a platform for us to access to key contacts in humanities       research and creative industry", which also involved collaboration with       the Dept of Business Innovation &amp; Skill's `Science and Innovation       Network', and the British Council in China.
[j] In August 2013,       building on these collaborations, Robert Bickers was appointed by BIS its       China Science Focal Point for the Creative Economy.
Strand 4, 2008-present The project worked to facilitate access to       the resource by other scholars, including historians from a range of       sub-disciplines, but also scientists.
There was interaction with a climate       change scientist exploring historic tidal bore water levels in East China       (2009), and the project also worked closely with the Met Office's Hadley       Centre's ACRE (Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth)       climate change research team to locate historic climate records generated       by the Chinese Maritime Customs and provide a 10,000-word report on the       history of its meteorological activity.
This was published to the ACRE       website and was funded by a 2008 AHRC Knowledge Catalyst Partnership       award, and by ACRE.
The AHRC chose this project as one of its Knowledge       Transfer case studies [k].
Within the AHRC-funded 2012-14 second       phase award of the British Inter-university China Centre, Bickers has       co-ordinated new knowledge exchange placements which deploy this body of       research and skills with Penguin Books China, John Swire &amp; Sons Ltd       and a new phase of collaboration with the Met Office.
The unifying element in all these strands was that by pioneering research       into the archive in China, the team was able to bring its findings to a       very wide range of users, engage with them and secure new materials and       findings from them.
It worked with the general public, libraries and       archives, government agencies and the private sector, as well as with       academics internationally from a wide range of disciplines.
It aimed to       provide detailed evidence about the extent and impact of the British       record in China, and its contemporary salience and legacies.
As a result,       British diplomats are engaging with and deploying this research in China       as part of their strategy for Sino- British relations.
