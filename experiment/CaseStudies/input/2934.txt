     Family visitor appeals: This research was referred to extensively       in a consultation paper issued       in 2010 by the Ministry of Justice on the re-introduction of fees for       immigration appeals, and       comprised part of the evidence base for that consultation.
Concerns had       been raised that appeals       fees restrict access to justice.
The consultation paper said that there       was a sound policy reason to       set fees initially at a level considerably below the full cost of       particular appeals and it drew directly       upon the research.
According to the consultation paper:     "In reaching this decision, we took into account that fees were         introduced by the previous         Government for Family Visit Visa appeals in 2000.
Suggestions were         raised that those with         legitimate claims were being deterred from appealing.
Research was         undertaken between         August 2001 and January 2002, with the results published as a Home         Office paper in 2003       [paper 6 above]...
The paper found no conclusive evidence that the fee         was a deterrent to         legitimate appeals."
[1]     The research findings were then directly utilised by the Ministry of       Justice, with a consultation       paper noting that "the research found no clear evidence that the fee         in itself was a deterrent to         making an appeal."
Fees were subsequently reintroduced through       secondary legislation, prior to       the removal of the appeal right altogether in 2013.
Ultimately applicants       will be encouraged to re-apply, avoiding the need for an appeal procedure.
Asylum appeals: The principal beneficiary of the research has been       the Upper Tribunal.
Given the       unique and innovative nature of the country guidance system &#8212; relying on       factual precedent       concerning the conditions in countries from which asylum claimants seek       refuge &#8212; the Tribunal       must manage the process carefully in order to reconcile competing aims       such as individual justice,       consistency, efficiency and flexibility.
The research recommended that the       Tribunal adopt       innovative methods of managing its country guidance system.
The research was presented to the Administrative Justice &amp; Tribunals       Council at their away day in       2008, and considered at a roundtable seminar (June 2009) involving       Tribunal judges,       representatives and other stakeholders (organised by Professor Thomas as       part of the research       project) [2].
In 2010 an Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)       case, noted that the       country guidance system "has recently been described by Robert Thomas       [C]... as his article         makes plain the development of the system has been encouraged by the         higher courts, who have         been concerned with the problem of inconsistent decisions in different         panels of the Asylum         Tribunal" [3].
Also noting that the research had influenced the       Asylum Tribunal's country guidance       system, the judgement of Lord Justice Carnwath (then Senior President of       Tribunals, now Justice       of the Supreme Court) recommended that "For an up-to-date review of         the development of the         system and of the modern practice it is unnecessary to do more than         refer to Robert Thomas'         comprehensive study: Administrative Justice and Asylum Appeals (2011)         chapter 7" [4]; this       monograph was also been explicitly referenced in an official report, and       disseminated via a       national newspaper [5].
To this date, Professor Thomas' work continues to       be cited within asylum       appeal cases [6].
In addition to presentations and publications to practitioners, a       specially convened roundtable       seminar was organised by the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum       Chamber), which was       attended by judges from the High Court and the Court of Appeal as well as       tribunal judges and       other stakeholders.
Professor Thomas gave an invited keynote speech, and       in that speech a       number of recommendations were presented, relating to how the country       guidance process could       be more effectively managed, in order to ameliorate concerns that had been       raised and to enhance       the country guidance process to enhance the tribunal system and access to       justice.
Direct impacts resulted from engagement with the Tribunal.
In June       2011, It was suggested       that the Tribunal should produce more detailed guidance on the criteria       relating to the reporting of       Tribunal decisions and have an internal committee to keep the system under       review.
The Tribunal       subsequently produced a detailed `Presidential Guidance Note' on the       reporting of its decisions [7].
The President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)       commented that he was       "grateful for the research... [It] was not confined to         publication [and] has indeed contributed to the         thinking of lead judges in this Chamber".
He continued by outlining       the specific areas of impact:     "That seminar has led to judicial reflection on best practice, a new         Guidance Note on the         reporting of country guidance, an engagement with the Immigration Law         Practitioners'         Association on problems their members see arise, and an engagement with         the Home Office         Presenting Officers unit on management of country guidance cases.
This         has proven to be         of considerable utility and has enabled us to case manage country         guidance cases with         more insight into common problems."
[8]     The Upper Tribunal Judge with responsibility for the Tribunal's country       guidance work, has also       confirmed the value of Professor Thomas' work, noting that the Tribunal       now has "an internal         Country Guidance Committee that keeps under review country guidance         issues and your book         continues to provide a helpful compass for us in deciding how to case         manage country guidance         cases better in the light of ongoing challenges" [9].
The research has thus exerted direct and significant impact upon judicial       thinking and policy within       the Upper Tribunal, and in addition has studied the use of country of         origin information and         the operation of judicial remedies in asylum cases.
As the       aforementioned Senior Immigration       Judge confirms, following the transfer of asylum `fresh claim' judicial       review cases to the Upper       Tribunal, and in developing the Tribunal's plans for handling this work:"     "... we are once again grateful for the background analysis that you         provide of UK remedies         in the asylum field.
Partly inspired by observations made in your book,         one of the Working         Parties of the International Association of Refugee Law Judges is         currently planning a         London roundtable in May 2012 designed to develop international         guidelines relating to         procedural fairness in the use of Country of Origin Information (COI)"       [9].
The impact from this research is still live, and continues to be drawn       upon by the courts in 2013 [9].
Moreover, the research has an ongoing and wider relevance in terms of       informing the wider       developments and debate over the Upper Tribunal's guidance-setting role,       with the research       funders &#8212; the Nuffield Foundation &#8212; noting that the success of the       research "has made it more         likely that the judiciary will not only grant access to future research,         but also engage with the         findings", suggesting also that Thomas':     "...sensitive approach, combined with the ability to deliver findings         which were interesting,         relevant and useful to judges has helped the tribunals judiciary to         value the contribution that         research can make to practice... [the] study had relevance         beyond the field of asylum... for         example on the difficulties judges face in balancing accuracy, fairness,         consistency and         timeliness when there is not a level playing field in terms of         appellants' understanding of the         process or access to legal advice."
