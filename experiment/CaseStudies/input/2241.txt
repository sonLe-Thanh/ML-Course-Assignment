     Impact of the research: overview     The two major impacts of the research have been: i) to distinguish DLB as       a subtype of dementia that is distinct from AD, both pathologically and       clinically, thereby allowing the development of diagnostic criteria (EV       c); and ii) to develop the use of the DaTSCAN imaging tool to enable       diagnosis (EV d, e, f).
The ability to diagnose DLB is vital to determine       appropriate treatment and management, since incorrect treatment can have       severe, even fatal, consequences.
For example, DLB patients show a       positive response to cholinesterase inhibitors, but show severe adverse       responses to neuroleptic medications and L-dopa (EV b, g, d).
DLB patients       often require more intensive care than AD patients; some DLB patients have       symptoms that are specific to the condition, such as hallucinations and       sleep disorders, which require specialist treatment (EV g).
Commercialisation of the DaTSCAN imaging tool for use in diagnosis of         DLB     The research conducted at Newcastle, which showed that dopamine       transporter imaging could distinguish DLB from AD, led GE Healthcare to       adapt DaTSCAN (approved in 2000 as a diagnostic tool for AD, EV f) for use       in the diagnosis of DLB.
It was the first, and remains the only, SPECT       imaging tool available that can distinguish between AD and DLB.
In 2009,       DaTSCAN was approved for use in DLB diagnosis by the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA, EV e, which cites R2), and in 2011 the European       Medicines Agency (EMA) granted market authorisation for the specific use       of DaTSCAN to distinguish between DLB and AD (EV f).
The 2011 EMA       scientific discussion (EV d) includes R4 as one of two proof-of-concept       studies included to assess whether DaTSCAN is a clinically useful tool to       distinguish DLB from AD, and states that R4 does not show the       "methodological weakness" associated with the other study included.
This       document states "DAT scanning [is] particularly useful in         distinguishing between the two disorders, as explained by McKeith et al.
Hence DaTSCAN can be of particular value in ... dictating future patient         management... To conclude, the study results show that DaTSCAN can         differentiate DLB from AD."
Incorporation into national and international guidelines     Diagnostic criteria for DLB and the use of the DaTSCAN are now included       in five national and international guidelines:            European Association of Nuclear Medicine Neuroimaging Committee         guidelines from 2009 (EV h) state "[DaTSCAN] imaging is indicated           for the differentiation of dementia with Lewy bodies from other           dementias," citing R4 and R5.
In 2010, DaTSCAN was included in the European Federation of         Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines (EV a).
It is the only         diagnostic agent for any type of dementia that is given the highest         level of evidence strength (I) and strength of recommendation (A): "Dopaminergic           SPECT imaging (FP-CIT or DATScanTM, GE           Healthcare, Amersham, UK) is useful to differentiate AD from DLB with           sensitivity and specificity around 85% (I)" and "Dopaminergic           SPECT is useful to differentiate AD from DLB (level A)."
The British Association for Psychopharmacology included R5 in their         2011 guidelines (EV b), stating that "Dopaminergic SPECT ... can           distinguish DLB from AD (McKeith et al.
2007)".
The paper was         accredited with the highest of four levels of evidence quality (type I)         and was given a grade A recommendation.
EFNS guidelines from 2012 (EV g) classified R6 as level II evidence,         and accredited it with the second highest of four levels of evidence         quality.
These guidelines state that "SPECT pre-synaptic dopamine           transporter imaging is useful to distinguish DLB from non-DLB           dementias", directly citing R6.
The 5th edition of the authoritative diagnostic system "Diagnostic and         Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (EV i), published in May 2013,         includes an entire section on DLB ("the criteria are met for major or           mild neurocognitive disorder", pg 618), and the use of SPECT in         its diagnosis ("a diagnostically suggestive feature is low...dopamine           transporter uptake on [SPECT] scan", pg 620), compared to only a         brief mention in the 2000 version, and no recognised diagnosis in 1994.
Impact of the research on patients     The National Clinical Director for Dementia, NHS England, states that "Since         its approval for use in DLB by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in         2009, and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2011, the DaTSCAN has been         widely used for diagnosis of DLB, both in the UK and worldwide.
The         DaTSCAN is a safe and quick method of obtaining an accurate diagnosis."
(EV j).
In summary, Newcastle work into DLB has led to the understanding       that this disease is a separate subtype of dementia, with a distinct       progression pathway and requiring specific treatment, care and management.
The use of the FDA- and EMEA-approved DaTSCAN imaging tool is now       incorporated into five guidelines, aiding diagnosis and allowing       appropriate treatment and management of DLB.
