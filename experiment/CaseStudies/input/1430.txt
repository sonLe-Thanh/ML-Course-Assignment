     In addition to the continuous dissemination of research findings during       2004-2008, the research team undertook a range of targeted Knowledge       Transfer activities from 2008-2013.
Newsletters, teaching resources and       user-guides, drawing on the extensive learning from the USP, were       distributed (Source 7).
The Knowledge Transfer national conference in       November 2012 was attended by representatives from universities (n       = 63) in the UK and schools (n = 43).
The Rt Hon Dr. Vince Cable,       the Business Secretary, gave a keynote speech on the government's social       mobility agenda.
A toolkit for users that includes the USP outline,       research findings, resources, lesson plans and evaluation tools was given       to all attendees (Source 7).
Follow-up support was requested by 57       universities in England.
Scotland and Wales.
A total of 123 additional       toolkits have been requested from schools across the UK to support WP       activities, either for use of the programme model or specific components       of the intervention.
Insights from the research developed a number of strands that resulted in       impacts on the aspirations and achievement of students from lower       socio-economic backgrounds:            Teachers felt uneasy about following the government policy requirement         of selecting and labelling 5 to 10% of the brightest children (who in         most cases formed the intervention groups at university programmes) as         globally `gifted and talented', which was seen as a `flawed' concept and         unworkable, especially in schools where levels of achievement were low.
The need for non-traditional assessment guidance to identify `submerged         talent' was raised (Koshy &amp; Pinheiro &#8212; Torres, 2012).
This resulted         in designing tools for non-traditional assessment of potential ability         and providing selection criteria to the 33 participating schools and         through the KT activities to a further 123 schools during 2005-2013.
Contrary to the general perception that parents from poorer families         need their aspirations raised, it was found that parents of the USP         students already had high aspirations for their children.
They needed         greater knowledge of pathways to achieve their aspirations and greater         support from schools.
They perceived both their children's peer groups         and the neighbourhoods as threats to their children's wellbeing and         advancement and sustained interventions were seen to be a necessary step         to address these.
This insight had the impact of addressing and         involving parents in a novel way and has also led to providing schools         with guidelines for conducting parents' workshops and the publication of         a book funded by HSBC entitled `Nurture' &#8212; Parents, it is in your           hands' for wider use.
The booklet is freely disseminated through         KT activities, Brunel national conferences and given to all         participating schools and parents, distributing 1830 copies so far.
The second cycle of the 4-year programme (2006-2010) was attended by         100 students from 30 London schools across 9 LAs and 83% completed the         full programme.
40.6% received A or A* for their Mathematics and 43%         received A or A* for English Language (higher than school predictions).
The second cycle of the programme also showed that the students'         attendance at the USP had a direct impact in terms of improving their         academic performance and HE orientation compared to that of a control         group (Koshy et al., 2011.
(cited as Source 5 in Section 5).
Short `widening access' interventions may not be sufficient to change         deep-rooted feelings in youngsters that `universities are not for us'.
The drop-out rate of participating students in the first 6 weeks of the         programme was 16%, whereas the remainder of the students remained on the         programme (only four dropped out due to moving out of the area) had at         least 86% attendance over the 4 years (Koshy et al., 2011).
Students (93%) reported a higher level of self-confidence,         determination and critical thinking skills as a result of their         attendance at the programme.
Students' confidence is a critical factor         for academic achievement.
The evidence of the USP's success in raising         students' self-confidence was reported as one of the reasons for its         adoption by schools.
As well as raising the attitudes, aspirations and engagement in learning       of the pupils who attended the programme, we have evidence of impact of       our research on:            Parents were guided in their relationships towards building young         people's aspirations and enhanced life chances.
These were achieved         through parents' workshops and sharing the resources we used with all         participating schools.
We explored the theme `what parents of children         who live in relative poverty need and want' and the results were         published.

(Source 6)       Teachers from the 33 participating schools and others through their         attendance at our four additional national conferences (100+ each time)         which specifically addressed aspects of the Urban Scholars Programme,         have benefited through professional development.
We have supported         teachers and their practices regarding the national agenda for equity,         inclusion and closing the gap between students from affluent and less         well-off families.

Koshy was invited by Professor Les Ebdon (Director of the Office for         Fair Access) in July 2013 to discuss the USP as a model for         interventions and its transportability.
In addition to both quantitative and qualitative evidence gathered         during the programme presented at a Brunel national conference (Source         2), there was some evidence from pupils from an area of high social         deprivation who made presentations on the variety of ways they have been         able to deal with drug crimes and gun culture as a result of the         resilience and critical thinking skills they developed through their         participation in the USP.
This high-profile conference was attended by         Mrs Sarah Brown (the then Prime Minister's wife) and the then UK         School's Minister Lord Adonis.
