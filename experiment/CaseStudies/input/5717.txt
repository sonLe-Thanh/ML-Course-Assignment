     Background     Commercial oil palm is a world commodity providing around 40% of world       vegetable oil, valued at $46 billion (USD), but is constrained by the two       fungal diseases caused by Fusarium and Ganoderma.
Palm oil       is important globally for human nutrition and as an income generator at       local and national levels (80% for food purposes, remainder includes       biodiesel and detergents).
The prevention of these diseases and       development of resistance to them also has significant quality of life       benefits for the sustainable existence of smallholders and alleviating       rural poverty.
Approximately 40% of the total area under oil palms in       Malaysia is run by an estimated 500,000 smallholders on very low incomes       (FELDA [A]).
In Indonesia where &gt;17% are below the poverty line, 41% of       plantations are owned by smallholders.
The industry there employs       approximately 2 million people [B].
Past yield losses from Ganoderma have been estimated at 19-46% in       Malaysia and in 85% death of mature palms in Indonesia [C].
One estimate       gives annual losses in Malaysia as &#163;2 Bn (Malaysian Palm Oil Board; MPOB       [A]).
Fusarium wilt in Africa reduces yield by 30-54% before the typical       death of the palm [D].
The gain from disease prevention and control is       clearly considerable.
The control methods described are sustainable and       bring environment benefits.
Impact from Fusarium research     1.
Improving the performance of existing businesses: efficiency,       throughput, seed sales and prices.
Seed treatment as developed at Bath and       patented [E] is currently adopted by two main companies:     (i) Feronia in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), since 1911 one       of the largest palm oil producers in Africa with 107,892 hectares and       around 400 employees.
The Feronia website refers to, "In a         joint research project with Bath University, Yaligimba Research Station         [DRC] developed a technique which removes all fungi including         Fusarium spores, even those between the kernel and shell.
The seed is         subjected to this special treatment prior to export."
[F].
(ii) Ghana-Sumatra (CSIR-OPRI) in Ghana, who have an extensive       collection of oil palms gathered from wild populations in the region.
Ghana Sumatra is a seed company recently set up as the research link with       LONSUM, Indonesia [A].
Ghana-Sumatra commented:     "A market lead for seed sales is given by certifying our seed is         Fusarium-free; at our request he [R Cooper] adapted and shipped         equipment in 2011; it is currently treating 2 million seeds p.a;         treatment has allowed a price increase of 15%".
[F].
Also the method is used by CABI-Europe-UK who provide seed quarantine for       shipments exported from Africa, because the pathogen is not found in South       East Asia or most of South America [A].
This creates an effective       intercontinental barrier to disease spread.
CABI-Europe-UK has been       charging for seed quarantine service between other countries and S E Asia       for more than a decade.
They state "The current methodology used at         CABI E-UK is an adaptation of...this technique initially developed in         1994 by research staff in Dr Cooper's laboratory" [F].
2.
Delivery of highly skilled people:     a) A main team member into a global role: Dr Julie Flood was a member of       the Cooper laboratory for about 11 years working on Fusarium, then       secured a position with Centre for Agricultural Biosciences International       (CABI) and is now Global Director-Commodities [A].
b) A Malaysian researcher into a key country position: M. Rusli trained       at Bath in Fusarium research; employed in 2012 by MPOB in oil palm       biosecurity, in particular to prevent Fusarium.
3.
Technology Transfer:     In 2011 apparatus was designed in the Bath laboratory to handle thousands       of seeds per treatment and sent to Ghana (Oil Palm Research Institute).
A       visit there by Cooper in 2010 demonstrated superior methods for sampling       and screening palms for Fusarium infection [G].
Impact from Ganoderma research     As a direct result of our work [3], shading is used routinely in Sumatra       and Malaysia when testing for oil palm disease resistance by inoculating       with Ganoderma.
Earlier work by us led to introduction of shading       also to DRC for screening for Fusarium resistance, as this       pathogen is also inhibited or killed at high temperatures [H].
Specific       forms of impact include:     1.
A change of practice in the way organisations test for disease       resistance: Shading of seedling palms to maintain ambient soil       temperatures has been introduced by various companies including LONSUM,       Indonesia; FELDA/FASSB, Malaysia.
LONSUM commented: "Dr Cooper         and his team made a discovery that has markedly improved our ability to         inoculate and select for disease resistance to Ganoderma.
Shading is now         used routinely for nursery screening; their finding allowed development         of a fast screening test; results correlate with long term field trials;         Ganoderma threatens sustainability of S E. Asian oil palm industry; up         to 87% of palms may be lost" [F].
FELDA stated:     "..650,000 ha of oil palm [is grown] in FELDA; BSR [Ganoderma]         results in estimated loss of USD 6.6 million p.a; following a discovery         in Dr Cooper's laboratory we now use artificial shading routinely in         resistance screening; shortens duration from 12 to 8 months; number of         progenies tested increased significantly" [F].

Progress towards sustainable development:     Efficient screening for resistance to Ganoderma is revealing       resistant palm lines [I].
Fungicide use would cease, reducing pollution in       environmentally sensitive tropical locations.
Dr Cooper's role and wider impact of oil palm pathology research            Research investment from and collaboration with overseas         businesses (see funding, Section 3): LONSUM (2002-2005) and FELDA (2011)         funded research on Ganoderma and Agrinos (2010) on Fusarium         control; collaboration is ongoing also with Sime Darby Ltd., another         major player in palm oil production and with Applied Agricultural         Resources (AAR) [G].
LONSUM is the 2nd largest public listed         plantation company in Indonesia, with 81,000 ha dedicated to oil palm,         sale of 26.4 million seeds and 2.3 million tonnes of palm fruit in 2011.
FELDA, founded to resettle rural poor and organize smallholder farms,         cultivates &gt;650,000 ha of oil palms (approximately 18% of total         Malaysian oil palm area), has &gt;600 employees and is the world's         largest producer of certified, sustainable oil palm (Financial Times,         2012) [A].
Research investment and collaboration with government organisations:         The MPOB, the overarching advisory organisation [A], funded Fusarium         research (2008-2012 and 2013), and Ministry of Higher Education Ganoderma         research (2011-2014).
Also MPOB sponsored field studies in South America         (2012) to assess a major palm disease (Phytophthora) in the         context of quarantine to prevent spread to South East Asia [G].
Invitation onto advisory panels:         FELDA and MPOB invited Dr Cooper to be a member of their international         advisory panels (2011-2014) involving annual visits to Malaysia [G].
Knowledge transfer:         During 2009-2013 Dr Cooper delivered 18 invited seminars on Fusarium         and/or Ganoderma control to non-academic stake-holders,         including growers, companies and researchers in Malaysia, Indonesia,         Ghana and Brazil, Two lectures were to audiences of &gt;600; two talks         were published as reviews in a professional journal for S E Asia [H].
Additionally, two workshops were held (Malaysia and Brazil) based around         these invited presentations.
The companies involved included FELDA, Sime         Darby, Agrinos, Agropalma, Marborges and Denpasar; government         organisations were MPOB, EMBRAPA, Oil Palm Research Institute (Ghana)         and IOPR Indonesia [A].
