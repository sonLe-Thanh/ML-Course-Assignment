     Impact 1: Worldwide Pharmaceutical Industry       As a consequence of the underpinning research by Professors Baker and       Hill, and others, in 2003 that identified "dual efficacy" ligands at       different GPCRs, the novel pharmacological concept &#8212; that drugs acting at       the same GPCR could selectively influence different downstream       signalling pathways &#8212; became accepted worldwide by the academic and       pharmaceutical communities.
This led to the major pharmaceutical companies       screening compounds in parallel for G-protein mediated and G-protein       independent signallingA, in particular via &#946;-arrestin       proteins, in order to identify pathway-selective GPCR drug candidates.
It       also led to the establishment of speciality `biased ligand' drug discovery       companies, e.g.
Trevena Inc (www.trevenainc.com)       founded in 2008, seeking biased ligands to avoid signalling pathways that       lead to detrimental side effectsB.
Indeed, the first such       `pathway-biased' ligands have reached clinical trials (SM DeWire &amp; JD       Violin (2011) Circ Res 109, 205-16).
Impact 2: Commercial Development       The demand for GPCR assays that can be used to assess compound activity at       different G-protein- and &#946;-arrestin-dependent signalling pathways has       generated a new market for companies to develop cell lines, reagents and       assay systems to facilitate this new mode of screening for drugs and       compounds that selectively signal through the &#946;-arrestin pathway.
Assay       platforms have been developed by DiscoveRx (&#946;-arrestin PathHunterTM)D,       Molecular Devices (TransFluorTM)E and Life       Technologies (TangoTM)F. In 2005, Prof Hill's group       contributed to characterisation of the GPCR-&#946;-arrestin assay of Applied       Biosystems that was based on galactosidase complementation.
This was later       developed into the GPCR-&#946;-arrestin-PathHunter screening platform5       by DiscoveRx using a different-sized galactosidase fragment.
DiscoveRx       launched the PathHunter &#946;-arrestin assay technology and a range of       &#946;-arrestin-coupled GPCR cell lines, mid-2006.
Their       &#946;-arrestin-coupled GPCR cell line catalogue was expanded over the       following 2-3 years, and the screening technology was subsequently       partnered in 2009 as a 3-way allianceC with MRC Technology and       GSK to identify natural substances as ligands for orphan GPCRs.
In       addition, contract research organisations such as BioFocusF       began to provide &#946;-arrestin screening services using DiscoveRx assays       (introduced from 2009).
The G-protein-independent GPCR functional assay screening technology       market (specifically including &#946;-arrestin assays) had already reached       11.5% of all GPCR functional screening assays in 2008 and continued to       increase over subsequent years, with DiscoveRx already taking 26% of the       market in 2008 (HTS-Tec, 2008)G. In 2010, the cell-based       screening consumables market (of which &#946;-arrestin reagents are a part)       was estimated to be $405million, with a compound annual growth rate of 6%       (HTS-Tec, 2009)G. DiscoveRx had a market share of ~ 3.2%       (~$13million) of this worldwide cell-based screening market in 2008 &#8212; of       which sales of GPCR &#946;-arrestin screening reagents are a significant       proportion (HTS-Tec, 2009)G. DiscoveRx (UK) reported &#163;4.2       million European sales revenue in 2011, an increase of nearly 40% over the       previous yearC.
This indicates the impact of G-protein       independent GPCR signalling on the drug discovery and compound screening       market in the period from the original discovery of biased signalling in       2003, through the launch of the first &#946;-arrestin screening reagents in       2006, to widespread adoption of the technology by the pharma industry from       2007-2008 onwards.
Impact 3: Healthcare Benefits       Drugs that operate specifically through biased signalling pathways have       been avidly sought by the pharma industry (e.g.
Flordellis CS (2012): Curr         Pharm Des.
18:145-60).
As examples, TrevenaB       have: 1) an angiotensin II receptor &#946;-arrestin-biased ligand in Phase       II clinical development for heart failure (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov;       study identifiers: NCT01187836, NCT01444872) a condition affecting an       estimated 23 million people worldwide and for which the current drug       market was estimated at $11.2 billion in 2010 and predicted to grow to       $18.6 billion by 2016)H; and 2) a G-protein-dependent biased       ligand for the mu-opioid receptor in Phase I for acute post-operative pain       (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov,       study identifier: NCT01514578), addressing an opioid analgesic market       predicted to reach $17 billion by 2015I.
The company also has a       number of other projects in preclinical development and lead optimisation.
Thus, arguably, patients in the Phase II trial are already beginning to       benefit from the first of these biased signalling drugs.
With the usual       timeframe for drug discovery to new drug regulatory approval being 10 - 15       years, the majority of new biased ligand drugs are likely to have an       impact on human health within the next 5 - 10 years.
Impact Beneficiaries       The principal beneficiaries of the impact of this research have been the       global Pharma and Biotech drug discovery industry (e.g.
GSK, Novartis, AZ,       Heptares), reagent providers to that industry (e.g.
DiscoveRx, Molecular       Devices, Perkin-Elmer, Life Technologies) and contract research       organisations providing compound screening services (e.g.
BioFocus).
For       the latter two categories, the direct benefits have been increases in       revenue from the enhanced range of products and/or services they have       provided as a consequence.
For the pharmaceutical and biotech industry the       benefits have been an improved likelihood of successful drug development.
