     The Minister of State's independent review panel, chaired by Professor       Anne Murcott made repeated reference to our research in its final report       to the Minister of State and used our key findings to justify its       recommendations on the regulation of infant formula advertising (5.2).
The panel recommended to the Minister that formula manufacturers should       make changes to the advertising of infant formula products that improved       text legibility and that the use of imagery in formula advertising should       give clearer indications of the age suitability of these products.
The       changes include clarification of text about the age suitability of infant       and follow on formula products and the clarity of pack shots in       advertisements (pages 6 and 68 of 5.2).
These recommendations       derive from the secondary research analysis and primary data collection of       the University of Leicester project.
Further changes concerning       identifiers of the age of any infants shown in follow-on formula       advertising were also underpinned by the primary analysis of formula       advertising we undertook.
The robustness of our evidence base has been further reinforced by the       publication of two peer-reviewed papers.
One of these papers went beyond       the original brief to highlight the way formula manufacturers were able to       circumvent restrictions to their product promotions in regulated       advertising by presenting product information for infant formula products       alongside that for follow-on formula products on their company web sites       that can be readily accessed by consumers.
Follow-up research indicated       that three years on from the original research, four out of the five major       formula product manufacturers had addressed this issue and removed       publicly accessible links to infant formula product information.
The research therefore had a direct impact on a government policy-making       process; in spite of the change of government in June 2010 and the lack of       formal response to the panel's recommendations, the manufacturers have       nonetheless acknowledged and responded to our findings.
Current television advertising for follow-on formula adheres to the key       recommendations underpinned by Leicester's research.
The recommendations       were that television advertising should:            Provide text relating to age suitability in a box, in bold or         underlined.
Specify, unambiguously, the age of the child for whom the product is         intended in the voiceover of television advertisements.
Ensure that the infants shown in follow-on formula advertising are         unambiguously aged six months and over: for example by demonstrating         features such as good head and arm control; sitting upright; having hair         and teeth; showing emotional facial expression; being in an outdoor         environment; self-feeding.
Increase the size and enhance the clarity of product images (i.e.
packshots)          These recommendations can be seen translated into practice in 2013       television commercials by leading formula manufacturers.
