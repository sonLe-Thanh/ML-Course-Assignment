     Campbell Orr's scholarly reputation in the overlapping fields of Gender,       Enlightenment and Court Studies in the English, Irish and Continental       European contexts has led since 2008 to invitations from Yale Centre for       British Art (YCBA), and Yale University Press, to contribute essays or       lectures for a variety of exhibitions they have organised.
The first was       an essay on `Mrs. Delany and the Court' for the book, Mrs Delany and         her Contemporaries, edited by Mark Laird and Alicia Weisberg-Roberts       (Yale Centre for British Art/Yale University Press, 2009, pp.
40-63) This       book accompanied the exhibition shown in Yale Centre for British Art, New       Haven USA and the John Soane Museum, London, 2009-10.
Unlike academic       publications, print runs of exhibition catalogues are normally numbered in       the thousands rather than the hundreds.
6250 copies were sold for the Mary       Delany exhibition, which necessitated a second printing [1].
The       attendance figures at YCBA, New Haven were 24,777 [2].
The Yale Centre for British Art also commissioned Campbell Orr to       contribute an essay `Six Courts and Four Empires: Johann Zoffany as       Courtier', as well as catalogue entries, to the book edited by Martin       Postle, Johan Zoffany, Society Observed.
This accompanied the       eponymous exhibition shown in the Yale Centre for British Art, USA and the       Royal Academy of Arts, London, 2011-2012.
The exhibition was the first to       be held in the UK on this painter since 1975, and the first ever held in       the USA, and there were positive reviews of the exhibition in the       mainstream quality and specialised art history press, which helped       encourage the number of visitors [3].
The exhibition book had a print run       of 9000 copies, 5000 of which were paperback copies for the Royal Academy,       London venue.
Brian Sewell, writing in The Evening Standard, said       the book was `...the be-all and end-all of a book...weaving his life into       his art and both into the several societies in which he moved.'
[4] Mary       Beard said in the TLS that the book `opened my eyes to the complexities of       an artist that I had rather taken for granted' [5] The book was also among       the six short-listed for the William T Berger Foundation annual prize for       a book on British Art in July 2012.
For the Zoffany exhibition at the Royal Academy, visitor numbers were:       57,177, comprising: 16,558 paying visitors, 37,480 Friends and 3, 139       corporate or complimentary admittance visitors [6].
Lectures and talks have also reached the wider public.
Campbell Orr gave       two talks at the National Portrait Gallery in November 2010 and January       2011 on a YCBA exhibition on Sir Thomas Lawrence, Thomas Lawrence:         Regency power and brilliance, which opened in London before       travelling to YCBA.
Both lectures sold their capacity of 30 tickets.
In       October 2012 she spoke at Kew Palace on `Queen Charlotte and the       Bluestockings' for Historic Royal Palaces Adult Learners' programme.
The       venue of 60 seats was filled.
Finally, Campbell Orr gave a talk to the conference accompanying the       National Portrait Gallery exhibition, Brilliant Women: 18th century         Bluestockings 2009.
The conference was open to the general public as       well as to specialist academics, with an auditorium seating 100 which was       sold out.
This talk was subsequently developed into the chapter `The Queen       of the Blues, the Bluestocking Queen, and Bluestocking masculinity' in the       book directed to an academic audience: Elizabeth Eger, ed., Bluestockings         Displayed: Portraiture, Performance and Patronage, 1730-1830 pp       233-253 Cambridge University Press, 2013 (see REF 2, CCO 3).
