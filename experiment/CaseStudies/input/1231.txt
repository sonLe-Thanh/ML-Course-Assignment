     Jones's public engagement work on nanotechnology has had distinct types       of impact: it has improved the quality of public debate, including through       its influence on the work of NGOs, and it has directly influenced science       policy.
Jones has been involved in many science communication activities around       nanotechnology since publishing a popular science book on the subject in       2004 (Soft Machines: Nanotechnology and Life, OUP), including       lectures, Caf&#233; Scientifiques and schools visits.
He has maintained a blog       (www.softmachines.org) concentrating on nanotechnology, public engagement       and science policy, which has now accumulated 440 posts since it began in       2004, and currently attracts an average of 43,000 visits a month.
He has       written extensively in other media &#8212; some examples from the assessment       period are given below.
Since 2005 he has been involved in many two-way       public dialogue events, including Nanojury UK and the Nanodialogues.
He       chaired the Nanotechnology Engagement Group, a body set up by UK       Government to support the development of best practice in public       engagement around nanotechnologies, and to ensure that public engagement       feeds into policy and decision-making.
[S2]     Between June 2007 and 2009, Jones was Senior Strategic Advisor for       Nanotechnology at EPSRC [S1], and in this capacity acted both as       the public face for Research Council-funded nanotechnology in the UK and       worked with the Research Councils to implement their nanotechnology       strategy, which included an important role for public engagement.
As       Strategic Advisor, he was centrally involved in the commissioning of a       public dialogue on nanomedicine, which was a highly innovative use of       public engagement to inform science policy.
Specific examples of ways in which this engagement activity has had an       impact on the awareness, attitudes and understanding of the public during       the assessment period include:     1.
More realistic depictions of the future of           nanotechnology, contra "grey goo" and nanobots     Jones's research &#8212; with its emphasis on understanding the profound       difference between the nanoscale design principles of cell biology and       human-scale engineering &#8212; gave him the perspective needed to write what       remains the most comprehensive and widely circulated critique of the       popular, negative vision of nanotechnology.
"Rupturing the Nanotech       Rapture" appeared in the June 2008 edition of the US popular engineering       magazine, IEEE Spectrum (300,000 circulation worldwide) [S3].
This counteracted the popular depiction of nanotechnology in the media,       and in films, video games and comics, which derives from a particular       vision of the future of the technology popularised by K. Eric Drexler.
It       is this vision of nanotechnology as conventional engineering scaled down       to molecular scales that underlies popular tropes such as the idea of "grey         goo" and medical "nanobots".

Informing the public debate about nanotechnology in           consumer products     Jones's public engagement activities have been aimed at informing the       public debate on nanotechnology, presenting a balanced assessment of the       science while giving due weight to real risks and hazards, to help avoid a       consumer backlash similar to that observed with GM foods.
One particularly       important theme has been the need to distinguish between engineering       nanoparticles and self-assembled nanoparticles (of the kind studied in       Jones's own research), which have quite different risk profiles.
An       example of Jones's popular writing on nanotechnology setting this general       context was an article in BBC Focus Magazine, July 2008 (73,600       circulation).
More reactive examples include a BBC Radio 5 live interview       on 12 November 2008, setting in context a report from the Royal Commission       on Environmental Pollution.
When a paper was published on 20 May 2008       demonstrating the potential for some carbon nanotubes to have toxic       effects analogous to those of asbestos, Jones briefed the Research       Councils about the forthcoming paper, allowing them to prepare       well-considered positions to the news when it emerged, and provided       comments for the Science Media Centre, who summed up the resulting       extensive press interest thus: "despite the potential for a huge scare         story the majority of coverage represented the research fairly."
[S10]     Jones had a sustained involvement with the consumer group Which?
during a campaign about the use of nanotechnology in consumer products.
He       supplied background information for, and was extensively quoted in an       article in the January 2008 Which?
Magazine (circulation ca.
1.2 million), and was the scientific consultant for another article in       November 2008, focusing specifically on cosmetics.
Which?
ran a       Citizen's Jury on Nanotechnology, for which Jones acted on the steering       group and appeared in person as a witness; he was a panel member, together       with the Science Minister, at the public event that launched the results.
[S4,         S5]     In the potentially very sensitive area of the use of nanotechnology in       food, Jones was the only academic invited to a round table at CIAA       (Confederation of the Food and Drink Industries of the EU) on 19 September       2008.
This involved food manufacturers, leading NGOs, and the European       Commission.
Jones spoke at a House of Lords Seminar on Nanotechnology on 4       November 2008, and gave both oral (30 June 2009) and written evidence to a       subsequent House of Lords Science and Technology Sub-Committee on       Nanotechnologies and Food.
One area that Jones highlighted was the       importance of nanostructures and nanoparticles in food that are naturally       occurring or result from traditional food processing techniques (see final       report, paras 5.27-5.32), resulting in recommendation 14: "We         recommend that, for regulatory purposes, any definition of         `nanomaterials' should exclude those created from natural food         substances, except for nanomaterials that have been deliberately chosen         or engineered to take advantage of their nanoscale properties."
This       recommendation was accepted by government [S6].
Causality, of course, is very difficult to prove, but it is notable that       early fears of a GM-style campaign against nanotechnology in the UK have       not materialised, and major NGOs in the UK have not come out in blanket       opposition to the technology.
For example, Greenpeace UK states "Greenpeace         does not have a stance on nanotechnology as a whole, because the         applications will be too diverse...
There may be some very beneficial         uses of nanotechnology...." [S7].
In contrast, a series of       public debates on nanotechnology in France in 2010 had to be abandoned       because of disruptive protests and nanotechnology labs in Mexico have been       the subject of bombing attacks [S8].

Influence on science policy nationally and internationally     As nanotechnology senior strategic advisor, and with the strong support       of EPSRC's Societal Issues Panel, Jones was central to the commissioning,       implementation and use of a major multi-site public engagement       exercise as part of the framing of Nanomedicine Grand       Challenge &#8212; the Nanomedicine Dialogue.
This was an important and       innovative experiment in the incorporation of public engagement in science       policy.
The current EPSRC Nanotechnology Landscape Document [S9]       states:     "The RS/RAEng report highlighted the importance of public engagement in       this area, and this has led to a number of activities coordinated by Task       Force 5 of the NRCG.
EPSRC has involved its researchers in 2 public       dialogues about nanotechnology, the latest of which fed public views and       aspirations into the development of the Nanotechnology Grand Challenge in       healthcare.
This was groundbreaking in using the results of the public       dialogue to help inform the choice of research area.
This area benefits       from having Professor Richard Jones as an ambassador for broader       engagement.
The public acceptability of research and nano products can       often impact on their potential for commercialisation, further debate is       likely on the risks versus benefits for areas where nanotechnology is seen       to directly impact on human life e.g.
food and drink, medicines, consumer       goods, household care products, or the discussion into the use of       nanosensors."
This exercise has had a direct impact on Research Council policy, as       demonstrated by a paper to EPSRC Council, 11 December 2008 (EPSRC57-08) on       public dialogues, which summarises the recommendation of EPSRC's Societal       Issues Panel on the Nanomedicine dialogue:     "It concluded that the exercise had been a ground-breaking and       "brave" endeavour which had provided a very positive contribution to         the decision-making process.
SIP commended this approach to the         Executive and Council."
The paper goes on to say "EPSRC executive         considered the advice from SIP and accepted the recommendations made.
The executive agree that, under the right circumstances, public         dialogues provide a useful generic tool in developing the strategy and         direction for specific research areas ...
Indeed, following a discussion         at SIP in September, EPSRC and BBSRC have agreed to conduct a joint         public dialogue exercise around the area of synthetic biology."
In the field of science policy, the UK has been regarded as a leader in       the area of public engagement around nanotechnology, and Jones's important       role in this has been reflected by, for example, an invitation to give an       invited talk at Polish EU Presidency event "Governance and ethics of         nanosciences and nanotechnologies Nanoethics 2011", involving       National Academies of Science from across Europe and senior       representatives of the European Commission.
