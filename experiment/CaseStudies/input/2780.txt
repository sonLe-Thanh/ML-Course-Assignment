     Effective, equitable natural resource management poses increasingly       complex challenges for (inter)national policymakers and local communities       in the context of climate change, population growth and potentially       conflicting agendas on biodiversity conservation, livelihoods and economic       growth.
Local participation, knowledge and environmental justice are       increasingly seen as integral to sustainable solutions and trade-offs       between multiple goals, but their realisation through policy and practice       remains a major challenge.
Leicester research is making important       contributions here in diverse geographical contexts:     A. Mongolia: Shaping the debate on environmental and pastoral         development issues     Since 1999, Dr Upton has worked collaboratively with herding communities       from across a 600,000km2 area of central and southern Mongolia       and with government officials, policy makers and international donors, to       explore critical issues in livelihood and ecosystem sustainability and       appropriate policy responses.
Key stakeholders including government officials, herding communities and       donors, have been brought together to debate critical issues such as land       legislation, collective action, mining and development.
Associated       workshops and activities have created new interfaces and forms of       knowledge exchange between rural resource users and policymakers, through       mapping, participatory video-making and workshops, notably at the end of       project Leverhulme workshop.i,ii The significance of this and       earlier underpinning research is in enhancing herders' understanding of       working as community groups, barriers to collective action and ways in       which these may be overcome, shown by revival of collective activities       post-project.i,ii According to local governors, these workshops       and other research activities have helped to share valuable knowledge on       pasture management, community development and implementation of government       policy.
Project outputs are also informing further development of policy       on herders.ii As one local governor stated `The (Leverhulme)         research project ... was very successful and helped us and our local         people...it will help us to develop an efficient policy on animal         husbandry...'ii Processes of participation and community       engagement are being further enhanced through identification of       `ambassador herders', who will work with other herding communities to       spread learning outcomes from Upton's projects.
In addition to academic       papers, Upton's publications have been cited in project and       policy-oriented reports in-country.
As well as being supported by Mongolia's Special Envoy for Climate       Change, the current Darwin Initiative work is recognised by the Mongolian       Ministry of Nature, Environment and Green Development as `significant         in bringing new approaches to biodiversity conservation by valuation of         ecosystem services and efficacy of PES (payment for ecosystem services)         schemes...it is important to develop conservation practice and policy in         Mongolia...
I fully support the efforts of Dr Caroline Upton.....'       (D. Enkhbat, 2011).iii, iv This clearly highlights the reach       and significance of the project which is the first to link herders' groups       in Mongolia to the voluntary carbon market, through development of an       innovative tri-partite Plan Vivo certificate, incorporating soil carbon       sequestration, livelihood benefits and cultural/ biodiversity values.

Addressing water poverty and promoting well-being; Lake Naivasha,         Kenya     Leicester's participatory research involves local water user groups,       women's groups and pastoralist communities in collaborative work on       ecosystem services, capacity building and livelihood security across the       Lake Naivasha catchment, from where 70% of Kenya's cut flowers are       exported, providing livelihoods for at least 100,000 people.
Over recent       years, serious degradation of the lake and wider basin have raised       national and international concerns over its capacity to sustain       livelihoods and ecosystem service functions into the future.
In 2009 Harper was invited to address a consortium of European retail       flower buyers to advise on how they could sponsor sustainable water use,       livelihoods and ecological restoration activities at Naivasha.
Subsequently Upton and Harper led projects funded by two supermarkets       (Swiss COOP, 2012-2014; German REWE 2011-2013), collectively delivered       through the Leicester-initiated Naivasha Basin Sustainability Initiative       (NBSI).
The significance of this research include a) behavioural changes       in terms of sustainable resource management, water use and conservation       practices amongst local stakeholders,vi,vii and b) reductions       in water poverty amongst the most marginalised communities.vi,vii       Its reach extends to influencing new national strategies for sustainable       development in the basin, notably the Imarisha Naivasha (`Arise Naivasha')       Sustainable Development Action Plan 2012-2017 (SDAP, 2012),       `Imarisha' being supported by the Kenyan government and the Prince of       Wales' International Sustainability Unit.
Imarisha produced its 5-year       Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) in 2012, funded by Asda,       Sainsburys, Tesco and M&amp;S. Imarisha was further awarded (September       2013) 400,000 Euro by GIZ, the German Development Agency, partly to       organise knowledge transfer from the scientific community to the Naivasha       stakeholders (November 2013).
In 2013, Imarisha, in partnership with WWF       with 900,000 Euros Dutch Government funding launched the Integrated Water       Resource Action Plan.v,vii     Research workshops have brought together decision-makers with community       members across the basin to facilitate development of consensual planning       and governance solutions.v Environmental education workshops       designed, developed and led by Leicester, have trained over 100 `Water       Ambassadors' and `Water Friendly Farmers' from marginalised communities on       wise water use and resource management.
Training evaluation returns show       that trainees rate these as excellent.vi Project beneficiaries       further state, `The projects we have completed in partnership with NBSI         have all been very successful and enlightening...after attending the         Water Friendly Farmers training workshop.. our thinking was greatly and         positively challenged and now we have implemented most of the ...         techniques on our own farms' and `ever since some of our Youth         Group members and I attended the Water Friendly Farmers training         workshop we have implemented a lot on our small piece of land... this         has caused our neighbours to come and learn from our success...'.
viSignificant       improvements in knowledge amongst workshop attendees and reductions in       water poverty are evident.v,vi The introduction of ecosystem       services-based assessments and valuations have provided a valuable tool in       planning (Morrison et al., 2012, cited in SDAP, 2012).
In addition       to citing key papers by the Leicester team, the SDAP repeatedly highlights       the contribution of Leicester/NBSI work to sustainable lake management and       livelihoods and identifies them as one of the Critical Research       Organisations operating in the basin.vii
