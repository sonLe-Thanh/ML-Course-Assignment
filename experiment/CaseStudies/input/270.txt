     The demonstration by Warwick researchers that reduced dietary salt intake       lowers BP in a dose- dependent manner (1) and in different geographic       settings (3-4) across individuals with various baseline levels of BP (1)       gave impetus to national and global health policy developments.
Crucially,       the prospective association of reduced salt intake with a lower risk of       fatal and non-fatal CVD events underpinned the development of national       salt reduction programmes in the UK (2008 - 2012) (a) and internationally       (2010-2013) (b-e).
National and international recommendations on dietary salt intake.
Dietary salt intake is high in almost all populations, and its reduction       would lead to a reduction in strokes and heart attacks (2).
Through the       WHO Collaborating Centre at Warwick and Cappuccio's participation in       various committees (Population Reduction in Salt Intake, WHO, Geneva         [2006]; European Salt Initiative, WHO, Copenhagen [2006]; European       Salt Action Network [2007; founding member and lead of a subgroup], Public         Health Program Development Group for NICE Guidance on Prevention of       Cardiovascular Disease [2008-2010] and Expert Testimony; Cardiovascular         Disease Prevention through Dietary Salt Reduction, PAHO/WHO,       Washington DC [2009-2012; subgroup lead]; and Advisory Group on Nutrition,       WHO Geneva [2012-2016]), we have influenced the adoption of policies       leading to reduced salt intake and have written protocols, guidelines and       recommendations on how to encourage lower salt intakes (a; b; d; g; j-l).
Policies to control salt intake are now recommended by the WHO and most       governments, and have been endorsed at the United Nations High Level       Meeting on the Prevention of Non- Communicable Disease (2011).
In 2007,       WHO re-stated recommendations of salt targets of 5g per day.
Since then,       it has developed policies in every continent for the implementation of       population salt reduction programmes under the WHO Action Plan on Obesity,       Diet and Physical Activityb.
The WHO 65th World       Health Assembly (2012) decided that population dietary salt should be       reduced and should be a priority alongside tobacco control for the       reduction of non-communicable disease worldwide.
Examples of early       adopters of these policies are Slovenia (monitoring and surveillance       2008-13), Argentina, Costa Rica and Chile (monitoring tools 2010-13) and       South Africa (regulation 2012) (b; d; e).
Increased public awareness.
In addition to scientific       dissemination through publications, reviews, editorials and international       meeting presentations on the findings of underpinning research, Warwick       researchers have contributed to the three-pronged approach of salt       reduction programmes: consumer awareness, food reformulation, monitoring       and surveillance (Sutherland J et al.
Br J Nutr 2013;110:552-8 -       Brinsden HC et al.
BMJ Open 2013;3:e002936).
Since 2008, the WHO       Collaborating Centre at Warwick has held the mandate to work within a       global platform to increase research output and operational support to WHO       offices (Geneva [Global], Copenhagen [Europe], Washington [PanAmerican],       and Cairo [Eastern Mediterranean), and to lead and support monitoring and       surveillance in individual countries.
We have participated and contributed       directly through the WHO Global Platform to all aspects of the       three-pronged approach (b; d; e).
We have engaged in additional       dissemination activities through our website (www2.warwick.ac.uk/go/cappuccio/research_impact)       and partnership with non-governmental organizations, such as Consensus       Action on Salt and Health (CASH) (h) and the UK Health Forum (i).
Impact on public health and economy.
Public health benefits       have been achieved through an increased public awareness about the       importance of lowering individual salt intake; through industry engagement       for the re-formulation of food with lowered salt content; and in the       monitoring of salt intake nationally through repeated surveys (Millett C et         al.
PLoS ONE 2012; 7(1): e29836 - Shankar B et al.
Health       Econ 2013; 22:243-50).
Crucially, in England and Wales the salt reduction       programme has led to reduced salt intake from 9.5g per day in 2001 to 8.1g       per day in 2010, a reduction of 1.4 g per day (or 15%).
This reduction is       estimated to have averted 20,000 CVD events in the UK, of which 8,500       would have been fatal (f) with ~131,000 Quality-Adjusted Life       Years (QALY) gained.
A gain in QALY indicates an extension of life free       from illness.
Our contribution is clearly listed in a salt reduction       timeline published by CASH (h).
In addition to substantial health gains for the population, reduction of       daily salt intake by 3g per day would lead to economic gains, an annual       equivalent savings of at least &#163;40M a year in the UKf.
Globally, a 15% reduction of salt intake over 10 years could avert 6.5M       deaths from CVD at a cost ranging between $0.04 and $0.32 per person (g).
