     The impacts of ERPE research in Drainage systems are the PAPATM       device to limit positive transients and the trap seal detection device       (DyteqtaTM) to enhance public health for all building users.
Studor &#8212; an international company working in the area of drainage design       and surge suppression, market the PAPATM and DyteqtaTM       devices and promote, where applicable, use of the sealed building       methodology (referred to by Studor as the `Studor Single Pipe System,       SPSS').
Impacts include:            Enhanced protection of the internal space within buildings that now         integrate the PAPATM.
The PAPATM has been widely         used in remedial action to limit the adverse effects of positive         transients in apartment blocks and housing complexes both in the UK and         internationally.
Examples include their use in the Greenwich Creekside         building in London which, prior to this retrofit, had experienced         unpleasant smells that made their way to the 15th Floor         penthouse apartment, and the retrofit of 63 PAPATMs in the         1025 apartment Pak Tin Housing Estate in Hong Kong where continual trap         seal loss and water ejection into the habitable space have now been         prevented.
Installation of both the PAPATM and the `already-in-use'         Air Admittance Valve (AAV) to limit both positive and negative         transients.
The initial thrust of this development was aimed at security         sensitive buildings but its first application was the refurbished O2         Dome venue in East London.
The AIRNET simulation allowed the feasibility         of a sealed system, relying on PAPATM and AAV technology to         limit both positive and negative transients, to be understood.
During         conversion of the O2 Dome (http://www.studor.net/reference/title/theo2/id/435)         from a temporary structure to a permanent entertainment and conference         space, a local council directive deemed the in-situ ventilation stacks         inadmissible as a future design solution; meaning that, at that time,         the only options were either to penetrate the tented roof structure or         to run long lengths of pipework externally.
However, the subsequent         specification and use of PAPAs and AAVs meant that the Dome's iconic         roof design was able to be preserved and the installation of costly         external pipework avoided.
This impact has provided an exemplar for         similar installations worldwide.
An example is the Ferrari World Theme         Park in Abu Dhabi that utilises 110 PAPATMs (http://www.studor.net/blog/2013/06/sleek-roof-for-ferrari/)         which enabled construction of the eye-catching car-like roof structure         and in doing so, reduced associated material, time and labour costs.
In         addition, for the Hamilton Harbour housing development in Brisbane,         Australia, the use of the SSPS system has been shown to have reduced the         cost of drainage provision by $52,365 Aus.
&#8212; more than 17% compared to a         traditionally vented solution.
The ability to identify defective trap seals in complex buildings         through use of the DyteqtaTM device, launched as a commercial         entity in 2009.
This device makes direct use of the AIRNET simulation         model developed by the Drainage Research Group and by coupling this with         a pressure surge generator, can be installed in a building to detect         system failure; irrespective of its location or the cause of the trap         seal loss.
This removes the need for visual inspection of trap seals; an         activity that is both impractical and difficult to sustain.
The target         market for the DyteqtaTM is that of Healthcare (Dyteqta.com),         where the prevention of cross-transmission of pathogens is particularly         crucial.
The DyteqtaTM device is now marketed internationally         and underwent an initial in-situ 8-day Proof of Concept trial in         Gothenburg, Sweden in November 2012.
The PAPATM continues to mature and gain acceptability       globally.
The device complies with the Australian Technical Standard ATS       5200.463-2005, and has been approved for installation in USA based on the       ANSI approved standard ASSE 1030:2013 `Performance Requirements for         Pressure Reduction devices for Sanitary Drainage Systems' (which has       performance requirements written by Gormley).
This document includes the       international test standard for the evaluation of all pressure reduction       devices used in sanitary drainage systems for buildings.
An exact replica       of the test apparatus has been constructed by the National Science       Foundation (NSF International) in the U.S. for accreditation of all       pressure reduction devices.
Additionally, the PAPATM is       currently being evaluated by the British Board of Agr&#233;ment (BBA) for       further certification for applications in the UK.
