     Research by Nester et al has accelerated innovation of footwear, foot       orthotic and footcare       products, and related services and processes to increase mobility,       independence and quality of       life for a wide range of users &#8212; from health care consumers to patients in       NHS settings.
Commercial and public sector partners are integrated into our research       throughout its       development and translation into practice or product, and range from SME's       such as       salfordinsole to global brand owners such as Scholl, FitFlop.
Commercial       partners commission       research only where they can identify economic benefit in doing so.
Nester       et al have secured       continuous funding contracts totalling an investment of &#163;2M at Salford       since 2008, plus further       &#163;0.5M in EU funds during a challenging economic climate and acquisition of       partners by       competitor companies.
Foot Health Devices demonstrates the       following impact:     Bringing credible and science led innovation in foot health devices to         commercial partners and         the market, contributing significant economic benefit internationally:            The salfordinsole brand and company was launched in 2008 and         more than 50,000 pairs of         orthoses have been sold to the NHS and private sectors, with two         overseas distributors         appointed.
The company has turned over circa &#163;750k in this period,         creating 3 jobs.
In         addition, the company supports 1 EU and 1 TSB funded research projects         with the         University (worth &#163;460k to the University).
The latter aided an additive         manufacturing micro         SME attract &#163;860k of venture capital funding for its own growth.
Salfordinsole has also         made equipment/software donations to the University.
Research using the salfordinsole led to a new orthotic design (EU         registered design) for         knee arthritis, adopted by the Arthritis UK ROAM programme between         Salford and         Manchester Universities.
In April 2013 this design was launched under         the Boots         Pharmaceutical brand, projected to sell 12,000 per annum across over 400         Boots stores.
Research from the EU SHOES project concerning optimal rocker shoe         angles was adopted         by the Langer Orthotics company (in collaboration with Salford) to         improve the design of         their recently launched diabetes shoe range (June 2013).
Langer also         adopted research         by Williams to inform the position of this footwear in the marketplace.
Foot skin research is benchmarking various branded home treatments for         common foot         skin problems against Podiatry management and assessing how severity of         skin lesion         affects treatment response.
Results have directly influenced future         global R&amp;D strategy         and expenditure for the Scholl foot skincare brand (and led to further         funding).
Research in the area of footwear and orthotics helped create a more         creditable explanation         for industry partners (Scholl, FitFlop) and consumers as to why products         might offer health         benefits (e.g.
reduce pain, improved comfort).
The stronger consumer         message and         intention to purchase, and increased product and brand equity have been         valued by         commercial partners.
In addition, this research helped commercial partners reduce risk and         financial exposure by         aligning product claims to research data.
Research data was central to         their CE marking         and product technical files for regulatory purposes (e.g.
FDA         regulations).
Scholl         commissioned biomechanics research led to moderation of product claims         on how         footwear affects muscle function (so called "toning" footwear).
They         avoided expensive         litigation and fines applied to a number of other footwear companies         (fines in excess of         $20M in some cases).
Supporting innovation in clinical practice and improved quality of           life for people with a range of           health challenges: 		         All orthotic projects involve direct involvement with a large number         of clinicians from across         the UK, typically through focus groups (Nester, Williams) ensuring         projects and orthotic         products/tools are informed by issues facing current and future NHS and         private sector foot         health services.
Expected to enhance adoption of technologies and the         quality of patient         care and orthotic devices available by educating clinicians are also         engaged in the         research process and improving their willingness to engage with         research.
The knee arthritis orthotic developed by Jones has demonstrated equal         benefits at a         fraction of the cost of knee braces and other therapies.
This offers         excellent opportunities         for reduced use of analgesics, expensive manual therapy, improved         mobility and quality of         life, as well as some reduction in demand for knee surgeries (a small         number of patients         have come off knee surgery waiting lists).
Evidence for the potential to         prevent arthritis in         the contralateral knee is now emerging.
Footwear and orthotic designs for the health care sector remain         largely craft and intuition         based.
Research in EU projects is creating a more systematic         understanding of the         interaction between foot biomechanics and orthotic/footwear device         design.
For example,         in the SSHOES project Preece and Nester developed an algorithm to         support decisions on         the choice of shoe sole rocker angle for each specific patient, which         has been incorporated         into a software system that manages data flow between clinicians and         footwear         manufacturers (with INESCOP (Spain) and DUNA (Italy)).
A similar process         for foot         orthoses is now in development.
Salfordinsole orthotic materials have been shown to offer greatly         improved durability and         hygiene compared to market leading orthotic materials.
This addresses         clinician issues of         durability and user issues of hygiene, the orthotic being pioneering in         being entirely         machine washable and guaranteed for 5 years.
The EU SMARTPIF and UK funded Additive Manufacturing orthotic projects         are building on         prior research by Williams, focusing on the potential for digital         technology to enhance         patient education and improve compliance with foot orthoses and         footwear, leading to         improved health outcomes.
