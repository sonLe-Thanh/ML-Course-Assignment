     Pathways to impact: The impacts emanating from this research are       grounded upon thoroughgoing engagements with policymakers, with specific       areas of impact around the mobilisation of civic participation and       positive action within society, and the development of a robust and       demonstrable methodological grounding that has influenced policymakers       in a range of settings.
A number of targeted engagements, from public       events to private meetings, have been undertaken with senior politicians       and nominated policy leads in the civil service.
This has served to       stimulate and inform policy debate on the `Big Society' and localism,       providing the foundation for research impact.
For example:             Ministerial (DCLG): There has been ongoing engagement with Greg         Clark MP (former Minister of State for Decentralisation) who wrote the         foreword to publication [E] where he notes that: "from the `nudge'           of giving cues and signals, introducing small incentives and           harnessing the power of peer pressure, to the `think' of providing           people with information and asking them to reflect on the evidence           before making choices.
This book's great strength is that it gives           practical and tangible examples of the benefits and shortcomings of a           variety of different approaches...
Adapting to different ways of           working will, I suspect, be a steep learning curve for many           policy-makers.
For the light that it sheds on the path ahead, this           book is both timely and welcome."
Clark has subsequently shared a         platform with UoM researchers at a number of events, including the         concluding ESRC project event where the final report was presented (23rd         June 2010), involving 95 invited attendees &#8212; from DCLG, the Cabinet         Office, civil society and voluntary organisations, local government and         academia.
Another occasion was the launch of publication [D] on 16th         May 2012 [1].
Governmental (DCLG) Subsequent to two meetings with the Deputy         Director (Decentralisation and Neighbourhood Planning) in April 2011 and         July 2012, the research has been utilised in the regular policy cycle of         DCLG.
As the Principal Social Researcher, (Decentralisation and Big         Society Directorate) notes: "The research, alongside the methods it           champions are important for DCLG analysts and policy officials in that           they point clearly to the kinds of simple messages and approaches that           can be conveyed to citizens, through our policy, that will in turn           `nudge' individuals towards more civic contributions and further           social action at the neighbourhood and local level.
The methods and           models that emerged from the research have been used in a number of           ways within DCLG research and policy formation &#8212; they have informed           the evidence base underpinning the implementation of our           decentralisation and localism policies &#8212; including our work to           encourage more communities to take up opportunities linked to...           community rights and neighbourhood planning in their communities.
The           research has also informed discussions around the development of the           neighbourhood community budget pilots...Taken as a whole, this           research has been very valuable because it is both conceptually robust           and innovative, yet distinctly pragmatic" [1].
Additionally, the research has fed into workshops, roundtables and           advisory work, including: involvement in a seminar run by the         charity Involve (2009); three seminars at DCLG &#8212; `Value for Money,         Localism and the New Policy Agenda' (2010), `Neighbourhoods and         Localism' (2011), and `Decentralisation and Localism' (2011); an expert         contribution to the Commissioners seminar `The Role of Law and the         Limits of Law', as part of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission         (EHRC) Strategic Review (2011); and a Local Government Information Unit         `Civil Society Innovation Network' event (2012).
It has made specific contributions           to policy, including: within `A National Framework for Greater         Citizen Engagement' (2008); and in the House of Lords `Science and         Technology Select Committee Call for Evidence: Behaviour Change' (2010).
Finally political parties have demonstrated an interest; a         meeting with the Chair of the Conservative Party Research Department         took place in 2011.
It is notable that whilst the research was funded during the previous       Labour administration, it was one of the key pieces of research presented       to new ministers in the Coalition government within their introductory       brief from civil servants.
This encouraged policy dialogue across central       government, and has strengthened the impacts of the engagements documented       below.
Impact 1: Mobilising civic participation: Through the use of RCTs,       increases in civic activity could be directly attributed to the research       [E].
Specific examples of civic participation, included:            Encouraging 1,000 Manchester households to make a charitable donation         of 7,000 second hand books to children's libraries in South Africa,         through a Manchester-based pledging RCT with the charity Community         H.E.A.R.T.
Their director recognises that: "such research is           valuable in that it gives direction to activities and ensures valuable           resources are not spent on activities that are not effective...
The           University of Manchester... took us through the whole process which           has helped to inform us about our activities regarding the book           campaign in particular but also other projects we are involved in"         [2].
A door-to-door canvassing campaign (6,580 households), in conjunction         with Trafford Council and the Greater Manchester recycling social         enterprise EMERGE, resulting in extra funding for EMERGE, and the         raising of household recycling rates in Old Trafford by 5% [3].
Similarly, feedback cards (9,082 households) in an Oldham RCT raised         participation in a food waste recycling scheme by 6% [E].
Triggering responses from local councillors (18% of 248) across eight         local authorities to requests from community lobby groups around issues         as diverse as asylum, access to services (including for those with         learning difficulties), art programmes for ex-prisoners, and sexual         violence.
Informing public attitudes towards tolerance between social groups,         via online deliberative RCTs that considered attitudes towards         antisocial youth behaviours, and interracial relationships.
Participants         were selected via an Ipsos MORI on-line panel, and modest attitude         changes were evident in the direction of increased toleration.
The research thus impacted on specific community enterprises and public       services.
In particular, EMERGE and Community H.E.A.R.T.
reaped benefits       from ensuing take-up of their services and/or donations, and were further       promoted in the marketing of research findings.
Impact 2: Influence on policymakers.
The paperback of [E]       sold out in four weeks and was re-printed, suggesting the work is reaching       a wide audience.
It is the 46th best-selling e-book (out of       5,000 in Bloomsbury's catalogue); more remarkable when it is noted that       the book is available free in HTML: "The Bloomsbury Open edition of         the book has had 9567 hits as of July 2013, which places it amongst the         five most popular books of our Bloomsbury Open programme to date"       [4].
Additionally, a precursor paper to [E], was picked up on (amongst       other outlets) the influential blog of the Royal Society for the       Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), with Chief       Executive, Matthew Taylor referring to the article as a `brilliant paper'       [5].
The research also influenced the publication of `The Capital Ambition       Guide to Behaviour Change', which included input from 21 Greater London       councils.
[6].
Influence on policy-makers is also observed through on-the-record         statements.
Greg Clark made his first public speech on the `Big       Society' at the project conclusion event (23rd June, 2010).
In       the press release accompanying the speech, he states: "This research         confirms my fundamental belief that people are perfectly willing and         able to take the lead in transforming their neighbourhoods; and the more         they take pride in the places they live, the more they want to         contribute.
The old fashioned use of rules, instructions and directions         often fails, whereas helping people to do the things they want to         succeeds.
I welcome the work by Manchester and Southampton Universities         &#8212; it shows that citizens together can create the Big Society" [7].
Moreover, in a subsequent letter to John and Richardson he adds: "I         was particularly struck by the important role that recognition and         reward can play in encouraging people to take part in civic life and by         how vital it is to feel part of a wider social movement... perhaps the         most encouraging finding is the observation that in a decentralised         setting you can stimulate innovation and get value for money from public         services and programmes.
However, rest assured I also recognise that         this research does not invite government to rest on its laurels.
I have         taken away with me some clear views emerging from discussion at the         event, in particular about what we should be doing differently here at         the centre in order to generate the trust and support we need to deliver         the Big Society...
I look forward to a continuing dialogue with you all         as we develop and realise our vision for the Big Society" [8].
Finally, the Government's `Behavioural Insights Team' (BIT) &#8212; who       have been engaging with Professor John in an advisory capacity &#8212; have       expressed a continuing interest in further understanding the experimental       methodologies at the heart of this research, noting that: "randomised         controlled trials of nudges to encourage the payment of court fines, and         reduce tax avoidance... showed positive results, and offer insights         which, if used more widely, could lead to significant amounts of money         being recovered for the taxpayer."
[9].
BIT cites pilot work       undertaken with Manchester City Council (MCC), who confirm that: "we         have deployed the RCT method &#8212; again relying on the support of Liz and         Professor Peter John &#8212; within our work with `Troubled Families' in         Wythenshawe and Gorton... part of a wider Government pilot, with the         evidence that is being produced, on efficiencies and cost-benefit,         assisting MCC in its discussions with partners around the pooling of         public sector budgets.
This is particularly important in... ensuring         that the demand for services is reduced in line with the cuts.
This         long-term collaboration has led to two key outcomes for MCC.
Firstly, it         has informed decisions about flagship programmes such as Public Service         Reform.
Secondly, it has provided an evidence base for specific         interventions that we have been considering such as Outreach" [10].
