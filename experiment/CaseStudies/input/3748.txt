     Public Policy: Air quality and climate change science and policy       actions have complex linkages.
The research above provided both the sound       scientific evidence base and expert interpretation of that science for the       UK government and regulatory agencies to establish air quality measurement       standards and policy actions.
[S1]     NO2 The research in Section 2(A) underpinned       major parts of the standardisation and improvement in protocols for the       measurement of NO2 by passive diffusion tube in the UK.
Heal       was an invited member on the working group for 'Harmonisation of Diffusion       Tube Methods' and references [1-3] are cited in the 2008 Defra report.
'Diffusion       tubes for ambient NO2 monitoring: practical guidance for       laboratories and users.
'[S2]       The beneficiaries are Defra and the Local Authorities which are required       to measure ambient NO2 in their areas under the legal framework       of the UK Air Quality Strategy, and the commercial laboratories contracted       to provide these measurements for the Local Authorities.
These procedures       are now compulsory for air quality reviews to be accepted by Defra.
The 2011 AEA group report [S3] indicates that the implementation of these       standardised procedures is slowly making improvements to the measurement       of NO2 by passive diffusion tube.
The impact of Heal's research is testified by the Senior Air Quality       Consultant at AEA Technology plc a corroborating letter [F1] which also       states:       "Dr Heal was an active and productive member of the working group.
In         particular, Dr Heal's research findings in this field were important         contributions to the desired impact of harmonised protocols for         application by users of NO2 passive sampler measurement across the UK...
The measurement results often feed into potentially expensive decisions         (such as declaration of an Air Quality Management Area).
It is therefore         important that the results of these measurements are consistent and         reliable...Dr Heal's ongoing research in this field (in particular, the         effects of meteorological factors on diffusion tube performance)         continues to provide important input to the scientific community's         understanding of this much-used measurement technique..."     PM2.5 The research quantifying sources of carbon       in PM2.5 described in Section 2(B), and ref 5 (section 3) is       cited in the report 'Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the       United Kingdom' 2012, PB13837,[S4] written for Defra for assessment and       recommendations on the concentrations, sources and trends of PM2.5       in the UK.
The research is also part of evidence contained within the 2010       report commissioned by the UK environment agencies (EA, SEPA and DENI) 'PM2.5       in the UK'.
[S5] The research described in Section 2(B) on emission sources       potentially controllable within Scotland is part of the 2012 report 'PM2.5       in Scotland' presented to SEPA which analyses potential policy levers       available to SEPA for amelioration of PM2.5.
[S6] SEPA is       currently considering this report; SEPA's Local Air Quality Management       Specialist states in a supporting letter [F2] " this kind of research         helps SEPA to carry out its duties (such as protecting and improving the         environment)...We are also pleased to see that sections of the PM2.5       in Scotland report have been referenced in several internal and         external reports."
O3 The research (sect 2(C), [6]) has led to new       public health recommendations to raise public awareness of the adverse       health effects of surface O3, and to strengthen warning systems       with targeted ozone alerts for high risk groups.
It forms part of the       evidence presented in 2012 to the Dept of Health and the Health Protection       Agency for their plans for preparedness and mitigation of health effects       from air pollution and climate change.
[S6] Air Pollution and Climate       Change Group Leader at Public Health England confirmed, in a supporting       letter "The Health Protection Agency...commissioned the research         presented ...
The research showed that present-day ozone-related         mortality in the UK is estimated to be up to around 11,900 premature         deaths per year, and ... increase of around 500 additional premature         deaths due to increasing surface ozone in a higher-temperature         future...The output and recommendations in this report are helping         inform policy options and preparedness actions for the future impacts of         ozone on the population...Dr Heal led a team that carried out this         excellent research work ..."[F3]
