     Graz is Austria's second largest city, and the federal capital of the       Styria region.
The Kunsthaus       opened in 2003, the year in which the city was awarded the status of       `European Capital of Culture'.
Since then, the Kunsthaus Graz has contributed to regenerating the city's       cultural and economic       esteem in Austria, Europe and globally.
These major impacts have continued       and indeed       increased since 2008, both in terms of economic influence by establishing       Graz as an international       arts capital for specialist and non-specialist visitors, and terms of in       providing the city, and the       country, with an unique and powerful architectural emblem for the 21st       century.
The `biomorphic' design of the Kunsthaus has therefore raised the       cultural value of architecture in       Graz and its region, contributing to its international reputation as a       locus for new architecture.
Within the history of iconic cultural buildings, it can be situated       between the Guggenheim Museum       in Bilbao (Frank Gehry, 1997) and the MAXXI National Museum of Modern Art       in Rome (Zaha       Hadid, 2010).
Its role as a world-class architectural exemplar was central       to Graz's selection in       2011 as an UNESCO `City of Design', the testimonial for which cited the       Kunsthaus as `among the         city's most prominent pieces of architecture and is considered         internationally to be one of the most         discussed contemporary exhibition buildings' [1; pp.
23-24].
The success of the building's innovative design in achieving a complex       double-curved geometry       has undoubtedly contributed to its worldwide fame.
Its fa&#231;ade, which is       skilfully integrated into the       outer skin of the building, has been used as a key `performative' medium       through which to display       the museum's curatorial programme directly into the streets around,       thereby turning this quarter of       the city into a living capital of culture [3, 4, 5].
Thanks to this innovative and recognisable design, since 2008 the museum       has been used, almost       exclusively, as the iconic image of Graz in international tourist       literature, the broadsheet press and       media, and even crossing over to publications in       building technology, computer science, arts,       museology, urbanism, conservation and popular       culture.
This includes a 50-minute documentary film by       coop99 and Wien Film in 2012 - titled Kunsthaus Graz - A         Friendly Alien &#8212; which contains interviews with two       leading Austrian architects, G&#252;nther Domenig and       Volker Gienke, and the Kunsthaus's former Director,       Peter Pakesch.
The Kunsthaus, as the synonymous       image of Graz, and of Austria more generally, has       been celebrated in many ways: for instance, a       standard-letter postage stamp issued in 2011; the       front-page banner image for the Graz Municipality's       website; the opening credits for daily news programme on Graz TV; and       reviews broadcast by       CNN on 9 October 2008 (`10 of the World's `Blobbiest' Buildings') and by       Graz TV on 6 August       2013.
For Graz's umbrella organisation for cultural heritage, called the Johanneum,       the museum       continues to provide significant ongoing value as its leading public       `brand image' [10].
The       Johanneum has even developed a mobile phone app, the `Kunsthaus App',       which includes an       illustrated guide to the building with a German/English architectural tour       for adults and a       German-language-only guide for children [4].
The local tourist board, Graz Tourismus, has stated that the city's       museum visitor numbers       increased dramatically to teach 70-80,000 per annum by 2008 [6].
More recently, the organisation       notes that total visitor numbers to the city has continued to rise       steadily, reaching a high-point of       800,000 `overnight stays' in 2011 [9, 10].
The central role of the       Kunsthaus in this sudden increase       is demonstrated by the fact that the building receives a much higher       percentage of the city's       cultural tourists than do comparable museums in other renowned `cultural'       cities, such as       Barcelona [6 - see also 4, 5].
Between 2008 and 2011, the       Kunsthaus Graz received an average       of 69,826 visitors per annum, equal to an astonishing 87.2% of the total       cultural tourism in the city.
The museum's own market research, conducted in 2008, has shown that the       building's bold design       is key to its economic and cultural success, with 79.1% of visitors       considering the tours of the       architecture itself to be either `very important' or `important' [2;         p. 13].
Furthermore, the Kunsthaus was purposely located in a historically       deprived part of Graz, but       through its performative fa&#231;ade it has become consciously integrated into       the lived life around it.
The building has hence since been instrumental in the economic and social       regeneration of this       previously rundown district.
During the REF impact period, some 21 new       businesses have opened       locally &#8212; these include 3 offices/creative studios; 5 cafes/restaurants;       11 fashion/retail outlets, and       2 galleries.
In addition, in 2008 the House of Architecture, a major local       cultural institution,       relocated next door into the renovated Palais Thienfeld [7 - see also         5, 9].
Duly, the city's       successful application to become an UNESCO `City of Design' stated: `It         is not a coincidence that         more and more creative businesses have settled in the area around the         Kunsthaus Graz ... having         profited from the revival of this area that had until just recently been         considered by the general         public as rather underprivileged' [1; p. 23].
Market research into the cultural value of the Kunsthaus has also       demonstrated the success of the       site-specific interaction between the building and its exhibition       programmes [2, 10].
The building       itself has impacted on the visual arts, and on museum and curatorial       working practices.
It has       enabled new approaches by its curatorial team in terms of design, display       and operation, gaining       international recognition for site-specific curation within contemporary       art museums [3, 4, 10].
The       building's `anti-white-box' design has continuously underpinned curatorial       strategies for exhibiting       post-1960 avant-garde art and design (e.g.
Life: Biomorphic Form in         Sculpture, 2009; Capital +         Code, 2009; Human Condition: Empathy and Emancipation in         Precarious Times, 2010; Robot         Dreams, 2010).
Its former lead curator, Adam Budak, highlighted its       catalytic role for `anti-modern'       curatorial methods [3] in the press release that accompanied the       2011 exhibition on `Anti/Form', by       noting that `this building [is] triggering new ways of thinking',       and adding `we quite consciously         selected this particular group of sculptures for the Kunsthaus Graz, a         building designed ... in the         spirit of the Archigram group' [8].
Also notable is that these innovations at the Kunsthaus Graz in       architecturally responsive curatorial       practice have been applied to other projects elsewhere, especially by its       former Director, Peter       Pakesch (who is now the overall Director for all of Graz's museums) and by       Adam Budak, who has       since been awarded international appointments for Manifesta 2008       and for a period was a curator       at The Smithsonian Hirschhorn Museum in Washington, DC.
Each of these       figures, plus other       colleagues, have been able to use the groundbreaking curatorial techniques       developed in the       Kunsthaus Graz in their subsequent careers [3, 4].
