     Research findings were initially demonstrated and communicated through a       series of events (outlined below) within in the AHRC/ESRC Religion and       Society Grant.
At them, Emma Hornby explored the theological content and       musical aesthetic of Old Hispanic chant, and gave audiences the       opportunity to sing some of the pitch-readable chants.
Each event was       designed to appeal to a different constituency in order systematically to       open out the research to a wider audience, concentrated primarily around       Bristol.
The University of Bristol Music Department Schola Cantorum       participated in all the events.
The first public lecture-recital at the Victoria Rooms, Bristol was       advertised through the Music Department's events brochure (February 2010).
It was attended by a conventional audience for activities in this       discipline: university students and staff plus members of the public who       regularly attend departmental events (35-40 in total).
The event piloted a       lecture-recital format which was subsequently tailored to maximise       accessibility for hard-to-reach audiences.
The programme continued with a public workshop and meditation on Old       Hispanic chant at St Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol (March 2010; sponsored       by AHRC/ESRC).
About 40 singers and 45-50 congregation members attended       including early music enthusiasts from across the region and local       parishioners.
The Reverend Dr Simon Taylor, Priest-in-Charge, explained       that the event enriched participants' worship: "the meditation was always       envisaged as an act of worship, which is the fundamental business of St       Mary Redcliffe.
[It] was designed to fit within the liturgical calendar of       the church...
I know from conversations with parishioners that it made an       important contribution to their exploration of worship at Lent."
Taylor       also commented "This has been a great piece of work enabling us to open up       this time of reflection and preparation to a wider group of people ...
Were you ever able to put on an event like this again, we would be       overjoyed to host and contribute liturgically."
[a]     This repeat invitation demonstrates the potential for a sustained       engagement with that specific audience, especially given that Hornby and       Schola Cantorum had previously performed at St Mary Redcliffe (November       2008).
The feedback from participants also indicated a more general       spiritual impact: "I found it a deeply spiritual and moving experience.
It       is proof that the fruit of your research can have a profound effect on       people today, 1000+ years on, and what better reason to pursue it can       there be?"
[b]     A workshop with local schools at the Victoria Rooms, Bristol (March 2010;       sponsored by AHRC/ESRC; 18 visitors) was designed to expose teenagers to       research-led teaching at university level, and to enhance their technical       skills.
The workshop also promoted wider participation in higher       education.
One of the teachers in attendance commented, "The students were       interested to get a taste of a university at work and to take part in a       challenging musical activity.
...
The workshop [was] pitched at the right       level to challenge the students while keeping them fully on board.
...       Sean has now taken Grade 8 singing and is going to Bath Spa to read       Music."
[c]     These initial events demonstrated clear impact in terms of influencing       the worship practices, developing musical practice and exposing new       audiences to the repertoire.
Subsequent events then exposed a wider       audience to the research:            Public lecture-recital at Goodenough College, London, through the         Institute of Musical Research, sponsored by the John Coffin Trust (May         2010), bringing the project findings to a mixed academic and         non-academic audience of 30 people [d].
Recital and workshop at the Leeds International Medieval Congress         (July 2010).
Ticket sales totalled 99, and the event was warmly received         by an international audience including students, academics, people in         the museums/heritage industry and interested members of the public [e].
Illustrated lecture at Spode Music Week, Tunbridge Wells, August 2010         (without Schola Cantorum).
The lecture helped to enrich the musical and         worship practices of the 35-40 Roman Catholic musicians who attended.
A sell-out recital at the Priston Festival, near Bath, in September         2010, with audience drawn entirely from the local community.
Public lecture called "Inscribed on the Heart: the power of medieval         music" within the InsideArts festival (October 2011) and         subsequently made available as a podcast [f].
The audience of over 200         included more than 100 members of the public, broadening the spectrum of         participation significantly: many of the non-university attendees were         entirely new to university research-led events.
The overall goal of the         Festival was to "To show Why the Arts matter, raise the profile         of the Faculty of Arts by presenting a sample of its work in various         formats, and contribute to public understanding of the important role of         the Arts and Arts graduates in Bristol society and nationally".
Workshop and meditation at St Pauls Church, Clifton, with ca.
20         singers (March 2013).
Several attendees commented on the spiritual and         emotional power of the occasion; another wrote "it is such a privilege         to be involved in someone's committed research in a live way" with         specific reference to having learned "about form, pronunciation, the         dialogue between formal structure and a kind of ambulatory mode" [h]          A YouTube channel was developed to build on this successful programme of       events and to make Old Hispanic Chant more widely accessible.
This channel       has had over 6000 visits since its creation in September 2010 (data       correct as of May 2013) [g].
The events described above were specifically designed to build local       engagements with the research, with events outside Bristol capitalising on       relationships already established by Hornby and the University of Bristol       Music Department.
Benefits to the audiences varied, but were cultural and       spiritual as well as contributing to the growth of knowledge.
Some saw       deep resonances with their own spiritual life, which served to enhance       their religious practice, others developed their own musical practice, and       many found the engagement with Old Hispanic chant to be a richly rewarding       experience.
