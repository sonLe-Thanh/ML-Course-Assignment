     Active dissemination of the research as a pathway to impact     We planned a targeted dissemination and implementation strategy to       promote the adoption of our research findings into practice in health       services across England.
This included distribution of 60,000 copies of an       Effective Health Care bulletin (http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/EHC/ehc62.pdf), which       summarised the findings of our systematic review of interventions to       promote the initiation of breastfeeding, to NHS practitioners and       service-users and supported this with a targeted media campaign.
Second,       we produced a NICE `Evidence into Practice' briefing based on our       systematic reviews of interventions to promote breastfeeding.
Finally we       conducted a national consultation with health professionals and       management, government, service user and voluntary organisations which       highlighted that the routine implementation of multifaceted, local       packages of breastfeeding services and the UNICEF UK BFI standards for       maternity services should be priorities for action (nice.org.uk/aboutnice/whoweare/aboutthehda/hdapublications/promotion_of_breastfeeding_initiati         on_and_duration_evidence_into_practice_briefing.jsp).
Our       dissemination and implementation strategy has helped our research have a       significant impact on national and international health policy, clinical       guidelines, staff education, practice, and infant feeding behaviour as       outlined below.
Impact on policy statements, guidelines, toolkits and care pathways     Our work has directly contributed to the development of national and       international policy, including NICE Clinical Guidelines (CG) which UK       healthcare professionals are expected to follow.
--Initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding            The NICE `Evidence into Practice' briefing which we produced was         referenced explicitly for its specific contribution to formulating         recommendations in the full NICE Clinical Guidance on postnatal care (in         2006 and updated in 2012) as well as being cited 16 times in the text.
This included the priority recommendation that all maternity care         providers in acute and primary settings should implement care using the         UNICEF UK BFI as a minimum standard (source 1).
Our reviews and evidence summary documents were incorporated into the         NICE Maternal and Child Nutrition Public Health Guidance CG 037 (source           2) and the 2008 NICE CG on antenatal care (source 3).
Both         NICE documents cited the reviews as evidence to support specific         recommendations for "interactive antenatal breastfeeding education" and         "one-to-one counselling and peer support", using the UK UNICEF BFI as a         minimum standard.
The recent evidence document underpinning the 2013 revision of the UK         UNICEF BFI standards cited our reviews and evidence summary documents         more than 20 times (source 4).
Our systematic reviews are cited in guidelines in Australia and the         USA:                The Australian National Health &amp; Medical Research Council           (NHMRC) Infant Feeding Guideline cites reference 3 in recommending           "evidence-based actions for promoting the initiation and duration of           exclusive breastfeeding" (source 5).
The US Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding           cites our research (refs 1 and 3) as the basis for recommending           "professional and lay support [.]
to increase the duration of           breastfeeding", and for adoption of UNICEF-BFI training (source 6).
--Breastfeeding in neonatal units            The systematic reviews of interventions to promote breast (milk)         feeding for infants in neonatal units (refs 4, 6) informed the         development of the NICE CG on donor breast milk banks (source 7),         the Department of Health toolkit for high-quality neonatal services (source           8), and the UNICEF-BFI guideline for neonatal units (source 9).
The Australian NHMRC Infant Feeding Guideline cites ref 4 as providing         evidence that "expressed breast milk reduces the incidence of         necrotising enterocolitis" among preterm infants (source 5).
WHO Guidelines on optimal feeding of LBW infants in low/middle-income         countries cites our review (ref 6) as evidence to recommend feeding         infants based on hunger cues (source 10).
Impact on education and training     Our work has had a direct influence on staff education and training.
It       has formed the basis for the three modules on infant feeding of the       Department of Health-funded Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health       e-learning programme on early years, freely available since 2009 to all       health professionals in the UK [www.rcpch.ac.uk/hcp].
Prof Renfrew worked closely with the charity "Best Beginnings" to produce       a DVD ('From Bump to Breastfeeding') www.bestbeginnings.org.uk/fbtb       which promotes and supports breastfeeding based on evidence from our       systematic reviews.
1.5million copies have been distributed free to       pregnant women throughout the UK since 2008.
Impact on behaviour and outcomes     -- Initiation of breastfeeding     Data from the Infant Feeding Survey, collected every 5 years since 1990       and standardised for factors associated with breastfeeding (age, education       and social class), show that breastfeeding initiation remained static at       62% of all women in England &amp; Wales between 1990 and 2000.
Comparable       data in 2005 and 2010, however, show a 5% point increase at each time       point in the number of women starting to breastfeed since the start of the       York research programme, from 62% in 2000 to 72% in 2010 (source 11).
Standardised data are not available by socio-economic group, but non-       standardised data (see graph) indicate relatively larger and sustained       increases in the proportion of women from lower socio economic groups       starting to breastfeed in England &amp; Wales from 2000 to 2010.
This is       consistent with York's research (source 11).
Changes in the       definitions used to categorize "socio-economic status" limit the direct       comparability of data from the IFS prior to 2000.
However, no increases in       breastfeeding initiation rates were observed between 1995 and 2000 for       both "non-manual" (81%) and "manual" occupation households (61% ) before       this research was carried out.
-- Maintenance of breastfeeding     The 2010 UK Infant Feeding Survey found that the proportion of women       maintaining breast-feeding has continually increased from 2005.
The       prevalence of breastfeeding at six weeks was static at 45% between 1995       and 2000, but then rose to 48% in 2005 and 55% in 2010.
Six months rates       were 21% in both 1995 and 2000, but then rose to 25% in 2005 and 34% in       2010.
Exclusive breast-feeding rates have also increased (at three months       they were 17% in 2010 compared with 13% in 2005, and at four months they       were 12% in 2010 compared with 7% in 2005).
Rates of increase were highest       in low income women, reflecting our research recommendations to focus on       those where the potential to impact on important health outcomes is       greatest (source 11).
-- Health outcomes     Increased rates of breastfeeding, particularly amongst those at higher       risk improves health outcomes in infants in the short and long term.
The       UNICEF report, Preventing           Disease and Saving Resources, estimates that even       moderate increases in breastfeeding could see millions in potential annual       savings to the NHS from improved health outcomes (source 12).
--Breastfeeding in neonatal units     In 2010, as part of the DH-funded regional Health Innovation and       Education Cluster (HIEC), York developed educational packages to support       quality-improvement initiatives to promote bonding, attachment and       breastfeeding in neonatal units based on our research.
Following       implementation of recommendations from our reviews, the prevalence of       skin-to-skin care in neonatal units across Yorkshire &amp; the Humber       increased from 20% in 2010 to &gt;40% in 2012 and receipt of breast milk       on discharge from 40% to 52% (source 13).
This has resulted in all       UK units now collecting breast (milk) feeding outcomes within the UK       national routine audit systems and the RCPCH National Neonatal Audit       Programme.
This national audit found that the proportion of very preterm       infants receiving any breast milk at discharge rose from 54% in 2011 to       58% in 2012, which will reduce mortality and morbidity associated with       diseases such as necrotising enterocolitis (source 14).
