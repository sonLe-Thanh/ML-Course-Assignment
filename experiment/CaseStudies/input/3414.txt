     The impacts of the underpinning research have affected a wide range of       audiences and       beneficiaries at regional, national and international levels.
These       impacts may be categorised as       follows:     Direct impact on design: The underpinning research, through       investigation into autonomous eco-building       systems and techniques, identified and developed a range of best practice       and innovative       novel systems for low-carbon buildings.
The research findings were applied       and validated through       the design and construction of the award winning Sustainable Community       Building.
The building,       as one of the main outputs of the research, has been used as a model for       education and       replication by different actors in the built environment.
The building has       not only demonstrated the       practical potential of low carbon construction techniques, whilst       challenging conventional wisdom,       but has also influenced mainstream architectural design practice by       showcasing the economic,       cultural and environmental potential of low carbon construction.
Selected       images are included       below depicting the building and its construction process.

The research remains ongoing, but its dissemination has already       demonstrated its impact potential       in a number of key areas involving practitioners and professionals, as       well as its environmental       benefits and its impact on public opinion.
In particular there have been:     Impacts on practitioners and professional services: Hill Holt Wood       Social Enterprise, acting as       the industrial partner for the research project, directly benefited from       the research by gaining skills       and expertise to establish a sustainable design and construction arm for       the organisation       (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk-kNtEBDUo).
Simons Design, part of the Simons Group, a       major construction company in the region, directly benefited from the       research through its       collaborative work with the research programme which enabled them to be       recognised as a       pioneer in sustainable construction practice.
This visibility resulted in       the company winning       prestigious contracts, and in addition the practice was awarded "Business       in the Community East       Midlands Region Prohelp Award 2007" for their pro bono work through the       Prohelp scheme for       their involvement in a number of projects, the most significant of which       was the Sustainable       Community Building.
In addition, a wide range of architectural practices,       planners, construction       companies, suppliers, manufactures, and local authorities benefited from       the research through       accessing its findings at different platforms including visits to the       building, workshops, conferences,       publications and press coverage.
Impact on raising awareness of the public: The research has       substantially raised the public       awareness and acceptance of the potential of sustainable planning and       development through a       wide &#8212; ranging programme of public events, talks, workshops and visits to       the building as outlined       below.
It has also resulted in specific changes in policy makers'       awareness and behaviours       towards the role and potential of low carbon design in safeguarding the       environment.
For example,       following the involvement of North Kesteven Council in the Sustainable       Community Building, the       Council commissioned social housing projects in the region built in       load-bearing straw-bale       construction (reference 1 in Section 3).
Impacts on the environment: The research has demonstrated       significant and quantifiable       impacts on the quality of built environment by highlighting the potential       of low impact       environmentally friendly buildings.
The Sustainable Community Building has       been used as a       precedent at national and international levels to demonstrate the       practical application of low impact       construction techniques and design.
For example, Sustain Magazine       has selected it as one of the       top 10 most sustainable buildings in the UK, making it an important       reference point that will       underpin future developments in the field.
