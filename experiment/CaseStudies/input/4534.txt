     Preserving, conserving, and presenting cultural heritage; contributing         to processes of commemoration and memorialisation     Extensive attention to the 2009 Ride in the Turkish national press and       TV, including interviews with MacLean, `was crucial' to the case made by       Turkey's UNESCO committee for declaring Evliya `Man of the Year' for 2011       (5.1).
The ride was `a major influence in making him and his work       better known here in Turkey and overseas', `prompting UNESCO to support       two major international conferences, in Ankara and Paris', and leading to       numerous conferences and festivals throughout Turkey (5.1; 5.2;       5.3).
International coverage includes Time magazine's       report of how `the spirit of Turkey's greatest adventurer rides once again       ... travelling on horseback ... truly conjures up Evliya's ghost' (23       January 2012), and The Guardian's recommendation of travelling the       Evliya &#199;elebi Way to explore `some of the country's most spectacular       landscapes' and `villages off the beaten track' (23 March 2012) (5.4).
Since 2007, MacLean has presented his research on early Anglo-Ottoman       relations to public audiences, including 4 annual lectures at the V&amp;A       (2008-10), radio interviews in the UK (2007),Turkey (2007, 2008), India       (2012), and an invitational lecture at the Turkish embassy in London       (2009).
MacLean has delivered public lectures on the Evliya &#199;elebi Way       project including `How the Ottomans helped shape Europe' (City Circle,       London, 10 May 2010) and `From Yalova to Mecca with Evliya &#199;elebi,'       sponsored by the Istanbul Municipality (Istanbul, 26 March 2011) (5.5).
He has written about the re-enactment for public interest magazines (BBC         History Magazine, 2008; Cornucopia, 2010), the Evliya &#199;elebi       Way project blog, and the Turkish national press (5.3).
MacLean, Landry and Finkel were appointed consultants to the London-based       NGO, Maslaha, on the British Council and Young Foundation sponsored       exhibition, `Evliya &#199;elebi: The Book of Travels.'
The exhibition opened in       Bethnal Green in May 2010 for three days, attracting over 500 visitors a       day, including classes from local schools.
It has since opened in Turkey       (K&#252;tahya, March 2011), in Athens at the world-famous Benaki Museum       (April-July, 2011), and Thessaloniki (January 2012).
The online exhibition       has been visited by 17,867 people in 105 countries including the UK, the       US, Canada, Greece, Bulgaria, Australia, Malaysia, Sweden, Germany,       France, Turkey, and Oman (5.6).
Developing stimuli to tourism and contributing to the quality of the         tourist experience     Public interest generated by the 2009 Ride played a leading role in the       creation and recognition of the Evliya &#199;elebi Way by the Turkish Ministry       of Culture as Turkey's first equestrian Cultural Route, following approval       by the TURSAB Eco-tourism group for promoting sustainable tourism in rural       areas to benefit local economies (15 January 2011) (5.7).
The 2009       Evliya &#199;elebi Ride was sponsored by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and       Tourism, The Turkish Jockey Club, the Joukowsky Foundation, and local       Turkish businesses Avis-Ko&#231;, K&#252;tahya Porcelain, and Zetino&#287;lu Yem.
The       number of tourists visiting Evliya's ancestral province of K&#252;tahya doubled       from 81,855 in 2008 to 170,597 in 2010 (5.8).
The owner of a horse-riding centre in Turkey began commercial equestrian       tours along the Evliya &#199;elebi Way in 2010, and reports that, through       international equestrian agencies&#8212;e.g.
Equitour (US) and In The Saddle       (UK)&#8212; the income from his business has grown from 17,000 euros in 2009 to       55,000 in 2012 and 91,000 in 2013 by 31 July alone (5.9).
The       Evliya &#199;elebi Way has already attracted over 60 riders from the US,       England, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, and South Africa.
Commercial       benefits to local communities cannot yet be measured, but the       municipalities of Bursa and K&#252;tahya are supporting development of the       Evliya &#199;elebi Way and further cultural routes based on Evliya's journeys (5.7).
A guidebook to the Evliya &#199;elebi Way, authored by Finkel, Landry and the       publisher, Kate Clow, provides detailed itineraries for walkers, cyclists,       and equestrians, alongside historical descriptions of sites noticed by       Evliya.
The Evliya &#199;elebi Way: Turkey's First Long-Distance Walking         and Riding Route (Istanbul: Upcountry [Turkey], 2011) was favourably       reviewed in the Times Literary Supplement (1 March 2013).
The       Turkish translation (2011) was sponsored by the Mayor of Bursa and has       sold 1900 copies.
The Evliya &#199;elebi Way team inspired travel publishers       Eland to commission An Ottoman Traveller: Selections from the Book of         Travels of Evliya &#199;elebi (2010), the first substantial collection of       English translations of Evliya.
The initial hardback and paperback       editions of 2,000 each sold out, and a second paperback issue of 2,000 has       been reprinted (5.10).
