     Professor Van der Eijk's innovative research in advanced survey design,       advanced analysis of       complex survey data and the study of public opinion has made a unique and       vital contribution to       the work of the Cabinet Office's Committee on Standards in Public Life       (CSPL), the body that       advises government and informs parliamentary debate on the development of       policy and regulation       in relation to public probity in general, as well as on issues such as       voter registration, MPs'       expenses and party financing.
In recognition of his expertise and innovations in social science         methodology and         advanced survey and public opinion research, in 2007 the CSPL invited         Van der Eijk         to become a member of its Research Advisory Board (RAB), which is       instrumental in       shaping and implementing the research agenda of the CSPL [source 1].
This       invitation was       motivated by the Committee's aspiration to obtain more in-depth insights       than had       previously been forthcoming from its bi-annual public opinion surveys and       which could be       provided by the traditional approaches used by most survey research       companies and       applied survey analysts.
As Peter Hawthorne, the Assistant Secretary to       the CSLP until       2013 noted:     He [Van der Eijk] introduced new elements in the design of the survey       that provided       the means to look below the `surface' of public opinion and to illuminate       otherwise       unseen relationships between different kinds of perceptions, attitudes and       orientations of citizens.
This was matched by the usage of novel ways of       analysis       which made it possible, in contrast to earlier surveys, to test rivalling       interpretations       of the dynamics of public opinion.
Although some of the underlying       analyses were       methodologically quite complex, Professor Van der Eijk was always able to       report       the resulting findings in non-technical ways, thus making the implications       of the data       more informative to the Committee as well as to a wider audience.
[3]     Driven by its aim to explore British public perceptions of standards in       public life, CSPL then       financed a series of large-scale surveys of British public opinion between       2008 and 2012.
These       studies were designed using the methodologies developed by Van der         Eijk, and were         analysed by him and his colleagues on the Research Advisory Board, and         formed the basis         of three major publications by the CSPL.
[4] Additional analyses and       minor reports provided       materials for the Committee to formulate its policy recommendations about       more specific issues       including voter registration, MPs' expenses and allowances, political       party finance, best practice in       promoting good behaviour in public life and strengthening policy and law       on whistleblowing.
[4]     The research conducted by Van der Eijk and his colleagues on the Research       Advisory Board       provided the empirical basis for the policy recommendations made by the       CSPL and in turn       informed government and parliament on issues concerning public probity in       general as well as on       more specific issues, such as party finance, MPs' expenses, and voter       registration.
As the       Committee's Interim Chair, David Prince, notes: `...the underlying         research not only informs         policy recommendations... but also contributes to Government's and         Parliament's         understanding of how citizens experience and evaluate public probity'.
[1]     The research conducted by Van der Eijk and other members of the Research       Advisory       Board on citizens' perceptions and evaluations of different procedures of       voter registration       informed the Government's new approach to voter's registration, by showing       that a broad       base of public acceptance existed for a system of individual registration       to replace the       system where one member of the household registers all eligible voters in       the household.
As Prince notes:     Without solid evidence of public acceptance of such a procedure it         would have         been much more difficult for the Committee to continue to lobby         Government for         this change...
In 2012 the Government brought forward the Electoral           Registration         and Administration Bill to introduce individual voter         registration.
[1]     Findings on citizens' perceptions and evaluations of donations to       political parties were also drawn       upon for the Committee's investigation into party finance.
Research       findings demonstrated the       widespread concern and distrust amongst the public concerning all forms of       sponsorship of political       parties beyond a relatively low threshold, and a broad acceptance of the       principle of public co-funding       of political parties if that would drive out large donations by       individual, corporate, charitable       or union donors.
As David Prince notes, the work revealed:     ...broad public support for a scheme of limited public financial       contributions to political       parties... [and] a ban on large donations to parties by individuals, group       or       organizations.
Without these findings the Committee would not have         been able to         confidently put forward its own recommendations for such a scheme.
[1]     With respect to the issue of MPs' expenses, Van der Eijk's research for       the CSPL       demonstrated the breadth and depth of public concern about the issue, and       its potential       effect in undermining trust in representative government and acceptance of       its policies.
As       Prince notes, the work revealed:     ...important insights about the relationship between citizens' trust in       politics and the       way in which scandals resulting from improper behaviour are addressed...       were       particularly helpful for the Committee to appreciate how regulatory       principles are       perceived by the wider public, and thus also for its recommendations       following its       investigation of the MPs' expenses scandal.
[1]     In addition to its contribution to informing government and parliament,       and providing       empirical information for policy, the research conducted by Van der Eijk       and the Research       Advisory Board has also influenced public debate in the UK and the work of       organisations       involved therein more widely.
Van der Eijk presented the research in three       public seminars,       organised by the CSPL in 2008 (in collaboration with the Social Research       Association, the       Academy of Social Sciences and the British Library), in 2012 (at its       Annual Public Meeting),       and in 2013 (in collaboration with the Institute for Government).
Each of       these events was       attended by 55-75 participants, including invited politicians and       regulators with an interest in       standards issues, delegates from independent think-tanks and from the       media.
As Ruth Fox, Director and Head of Research of the Hansard Society states:     ...the impact of the work of Professor Van der Eijk and his colleagues is       not limited to       providing an evidence base for policymaking and recommendations, but       extends much       more widely by making a distinct contribution to help inform and         sustain the work of         civil society organisations and parliamentary monitoring groups such       as the Hansard       Society.
[2]     This contribution to wider public debate is evidenced in a number of       further ways, including       blogposts [5], the use of the research in depositions of evidence to the       Leveson inquiry [6], and       multiple references to the CSPL's recommendations in parliament and in the       media, including in       the Guardian, Independent, Financial Times, Daily         Mail, Telegraph, and Economist, and on the       BBC and Channel 4 [7].
As Fox concluded:     The true value of the CSPL studies is that they explore issues and themes       that are often       ignored in other surveys.
Importantly, they also go beyond the surface       headlines of normal       opinion polls and provide in-depth analysis that yield rare in-depth       insights into networks of       perceptions, evaluations and experiences that usually remain `hidden' in       other studies of       public opinion.
She adds: `the national debate about the quality of our democracy in         Britain in recent years         would be all the poorer without it'.
