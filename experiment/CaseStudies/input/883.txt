     Our impact focuses on the role of habituation and organisational culture       in the development of individual good judgement which affectively       appreciates the significance of ethical reasons in professional life.
Our research has led to impactful changes on:             professional bodies themselves, transforming their approach to         ethics from a mere statement of ethical codes to a focus on         quasi-experiential case study and training design, and on the contents         of ethics manuals; and via these,        individual professional practice and good judgement.
The impact has had considerable reach because of the size of the       professional bodies and organisations involved, and significance because       of the beneficial effect on the way individuals engage with ethics       training to develop good judgement, and in turn embed ethics in       professional life, as exemplified by the impact on the National Nuclear       Laboratory and the Leveson Inquiry.
Examples include the following:     I.
In engineering, the Royal Academy of Engineering's Ingenious       programme (2007-9) funded our development of training workshops to `bring       to life' the Academy's four ethical principles.
The workshops helped       individuals to incorporate these in good judgement by creating case       studies, designed with practising engineers, that provided       quasi-experiential engagement with ethical issues to which the principles       applied.
Approaching 150 attended from major firms (Amey, Arup, Jacobs       etc.)
"I enjoyed the case study and ethical interpretation of `lying'.
I will use what I have learned."
"Indeed it will impact my working life         and the decisions I will make in my profession" (A)     The success of this quasi-experiential approach to `habituation' led to a       &#163;20,000 commission from the Institute of Engineering and Technology to       design web-based case studies that would help members to affectively       appreciate the significance of the principles of the IET's ethics code.
On       average more than 800 members a month have visited the cases since January       2010.
IET's Membership Manager commented: "We wanted to provide a         support service for our members, who may face ethical dilemmas in an         engineering context ....We are absolutely delighted with the case         studies and judging by the web stats our members also greatly appreciate         the resource."
(B)     Our approach was taken further through an invitation from the Royal       Academy of Engineering to develop its Guide to Ethics in Engineering         Practice.
Aimed at all 350,000 UK engineers, this was launched in       September 2011 at a conference attended by 80 leaders in engineering.
13,000+ hits on the web version demonstrates regular usage.
The Head of       Policy at the Academy commented: "The IDEA CETL team has produced an         extremely useful set of case studies.... Professional engineers at all         stages of their career have found them thought provoking and important,         especially in the education and training of young engineers."
(C)     These activities are also having significant impact on individual       engagement with ethics training and in turn on professional judgement.
On       reading the Guide, the Chief Engineer at the National Nuclear Laboratory       (NNL; 800+ engineers), commissioned an ethics template to be incorporated       in all NNL project plans.
As he commented: "Through collaboration with         IDEA we have produced a practical tool to assure our activities against         the Royal Academy of Engineering's statement of ethical principles.
This         will allow the NNL to make visible its commitment to ethical practice         alongside more established mechanisms to illustrate safety and quality         excellence."
D)     II.
In the financial area and beyond, the Institute of Chartered       Accountants for England and Wales (ICAEW) funded (&#163;46,146) a project on Promoting         Integrity in Organisations (2012).
The importance here of       organisational culture and leadership reflects the neo-Aristotelian       approach (adopted by Megone) to the significance of wider       communities and exemplars for the habituation of ethical values, and the       relation of such embedding of values to promoting genuine integrity.
The significance and reach of this project is confirmed by the noteworthy       attendees at its launch events in London and Leeds (World Bank, FSA, Oxfam       etc.)
and by continuing dissemination world wide (ICAEW events in Cyprus,       Singapore, Vietnam etc., and discussions in The Accountant, Chartered         Banker, Financial World).
Impact on specific individuals was in part       achieved by the engagement of individual ICAEW members in the research       process (1500 in the qualitative research, more than 3x the usual       participation rate, and 96 in the quantitative research).
(E)     The significant impact on individuals also extends to the Leveson         Inquiry on the Culture, Practice and Ethics of the Press.
Our report       was submitted as part of written evidence on the role of organisational       culture and leadership in the development of good ethical judgement in the       media.
Its impact can be seen in the use made of it in both Part I and       Part IV of Lord Leveson's final report.
(F)     The Commonwealth Secretariat also engaged with our Integrity work as       shown by the Head of Thematic Programmes commissioning seminars at the       2011 Commonwealth Caribbean Cabinet Secretaries and Heads of Public       Services Annual Consultative Meeting on the Theme Leadership for         Development.
The seminars, attended by delegates representing 14       different countries, were "very well received".
(G)     We have also engaged with the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA,       worldwide membership 23,000, 59% UK, 41% overseas) and the Chartered       Institute of Insurance (CII), using the quasi-experiential approach to       habituation to improve their CPD work in ethics.
The IFoA's professional       ethics training has been redesigned (initial contract c. &#163;80,000) through       collaboration with practising actuaries to create online ethics       case-studies that will foster affective engagement in the exercise of       ethical judgement.
(From Feb 2012 to May 2013, 1011 members enrolled.)
The       initial impact involves (required) engagement with ethics training in a       significantly revitalised form.
For CII we have worked on similar methods       to promote `habituation' and have delivered workshops on developing good       ethical judgement, (2011 to 2013, 380 members enrolled) (H)     Through charitable funding we have made our work accessible to small       businesses and sole practitioners by developing a Professional Ethics       Network (membership 350+).
This allows 40 practitioners to engage with our       experiential mode of ethics training every quarter (20+ events since 2008,       including several co-badged events with UK Inter-Professional Group).
Again we foster good judgement in part through quasi-experiential case       studies created with practitioners.
(I)     Our work on promoting good judgement and integrity in individuals has       also incorporated an audit activity (for both the Higher Education Funding       Council for England and the Higher Education Academy).
This interrogated       the extent to which effective habituation had given employees an affective       appreciation of the organisation's professional values.
As the Head of       Internal Audit at HEFCE commented: "Commissioning the Leeds IDEA team         to assess [our ethical] culture has proved invaluable.
...
In         particular, it made the significant connection between our role, both         strategically and operationally, and theoretical ethical principles.
...
The final report, which leaves the Council with much to think about, has         been well received by the Council overall."
