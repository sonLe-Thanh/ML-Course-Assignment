     Work by University of Huddersfield Business School to enhance       understanding of entrepreneurship has made a significant contribution to       the regional economy by serving as a basis for the design of initiatives       to encourage business creation and growth.
It has also informed national       policies and thinking on entrepreneurship and enterprise education.
Thompson, Kelly and Higgins' research into entrepreneurs,       entrepreneurship enablers and entrepreneurship/enterprise education has       played a key role in the continued success of the Graduate       Entrepreneurship Programme (GEP), a major scheme led by Huddersfield and       bringing together 10 HEIs from Yorkshire and the Humber, including Hull,       Leeds, Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam, York and York St John Universities.
GEP enables each of the institutions involved to offer students and       graduates looking to start in business a range of support mechanisms,       including guidance, finance and networking opportunities.
Huddersfield       received &#163;221,000 in Regional Development Agency funds for the first phase       of the project, which ran from 2006 to 2010.
External evaluation estimated       the initiative had a net GVA impact of &#163;2m-&#163;3m from 2006 to 2009, with a       projected annual net impact of &#163;2m-&#163;3m from 2010/2011 to 2012/2013       [Corroborating source 1].
GEP helped create 269 businesses and 274 jobs       during its first phase.
The second phase, which began in December 2010, is       a &#163;2.4m initiative and has received &#163;1.2 from the European Regional       Development Fund.
To date the second phase has helped more than 2,000       students explore business start-up, leading to the creation of 45 new       businesses and 65 new jobs.
The School's research also helped shape the entrepreneurial vision behind       Huddersfield's 3M Buckley Innovation Centre (3M BIC), which was officially       opened by HRH the Duke of York in 2013.
Established to facilitate       university-business partnerships, the &#163;12m 3M BIC houses a range of       start-ups and SMEs, as well as large corporations, and is also home to the       Duke of York Young Entrepreneurs Centre.
Funding has included &#163;6.4m from       the European Regional Development Fund and &#163;1.3m from Kirklees       Metropolitan Council.
Speaking during a visit in May 2013, the Duke, a       leading promoter of entrepreneurship and SMEs, told an audience of       business people and young entrepreneurs: "There is a huge correlation       between what the University of Huddersfield is achieving here and what is       trying to be achieved nationally."
[Source 2]     The research-based practice that underpins the success of GEP and 3M BIC       featured as a case study and fed into two landmark government-commissioned       reviews, the Wilson Review of Business-University Collaboration (2012)       [Source 3] and the Witty Review of Universities and Growth (2013) [Source       4].
It was also recognised through Huddersfield being named       Entrepreneurial University of the Year in the 2012 Times Higher Education       Awards, with the chairman of the judging panel remarking: "Huddersfield       uniquely brought together high-level leadership from within the       university, quality support for business and a focus on employability       skills."
[Source 5]     Action research/evaluation of business idea exploration and start-up       activity, in tandem with dissemination of findings, has helped inform       national guidance on entrepreneurship and enterprise education.
Smith's       research into the barriers to and enablers of graduate business start-ups       led to an invitation to join the writing panel for the Quality Assurance       Agency for Higher Education's Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Education:       Guidance for the Higher Education Sector [Sources 6, 7].
This document,       the first of its kind from the QAA, provides guidance and information on       the teaching of entrepreneurship and enterprise as a cross-campus       activity.
It was signalled in a 2011 White Paper, Higher Education:       Students at the Heart of the System [Source 8], and the 2012 Wilson Review       of Business-University Collaboration.
Since publication in September 2012       the guidance has been widely praised, particularly for its creation and       articulation of sector-adopted definitions, and has been presented as a       model of best practice at EU and UN entrepreneurship- related policy       development events.
Throughout the impact assessment period the School's researchers have       provided national leadership in enterprise education, business start-up,       development and growth and entrepreneurial learning.
From 2008 to 2013       Smith was a member of the Enterprise Educators UK (EEUK) board (Chair from       2011/2012), which, as the national body for entrepreneurship and       enterprise education in HE and FE, shares best practice and responds       to/informs national policy.
Thompson was a member of EEUK from 2009 to       2012 and a board member of the Institute of Small Business and       Entrepreneurship, a research-focused network of people and organisations       involved in small business and entrepreneurship, until 2011.
Thompson was       also on the Board of UK Business Incubation, an association of       organisations and professionals actively involved in enterprise,       innovation and sustainable economic growth, until 2009.
