     Conceptual impact     The fundamental recognition, by governments and NGOs, as a direct result       of Durham's research in Section 2, that mobility problems for vulnerable       populations existed at all, is a conceptual impact of considerable reach       and significance across Sub-Saharan Africa.
This step change was enabled       through sustained engagement with sub-Saharan African communities,       governments and international development agencies; the inclusion of the       International Forum for Rural Transport and Development (ITFRD) and       Country Consultative Groups on our projects (Grants 1-3); and the       translation and uptake of our research into user contexts via, amongst       other such publications, Fernando, P. and G. Porter (eds.
), (2002), Balancing         the Load: Women, Gender and Transport, London: Zed Books based on       case study material from Output 1, interim reports (Grant 1, Source 1).
Results have been (a) the drive by the World Bank and DfID to `mainstream       gender in transport policy' using our research (Source 1) as a key       resource for government officials and transport professionals and (b)       invitations to contribute to key global policy discussions, including       congresses organised by the World Bank and influential pan-African       research organisations such as The Council for the Development of Social       Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA).
Such conceptual change led to the       following instrumental impacts where NGO and policy improvements to the       social and economic well-being of vulnerable populations in rural       communities are being enacted.
Influencing Ghanaian teacher training.
In early 2013 a workshop         involving the University of Cape Coast (UCC) Institute of Education, the         Ghana Education Service (GES) Directorate and teacher training college         staff from across Ghana focused on our research showing that transport         difficulties affect pupil punctuality, children's performance in the         classroom, and safety and security on the journey to school (Outputs         1-4, Grants 1, 2 and 3).
As a result of the workshop, UCC and the GES         Directorate are now committed to curriculum interventions to reduce           harsh school punishments for pupil lateness.
These interventions           affect 24,000 trainee teachers annually and, by extension, many           thousands of school pupils in Ghana (Source 3).
Inspiring NGO action in Tanzania to address mobility         Our collaborative research with HelpAge International (HAI) on the         transport challenges faced by older people (Grant 4) prompted HAI to           develop plans to address the mobility and transport needs of older           people, including exploring the potential for new technologies to         support their needs (Grant 4, end of grant report); HAI Tanzania         is in discussion with institutional donors and private funders to roll         this out further.
The HAI Director for Tanzania commented that "...           the mobility study has given us the authority... to join the mHealth           promoters as we have been able to speak with evidence" [mHealth         (mobile health) involves medical and health initiatives supported by         mobile devices] (Source 4).
Additionally, "Aging in the Twenty-first           Century: A celebration and a challenge" a (2012) report by the         United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and HelpAge International cites         Porter's work on the mobility needs of older people in sub-Saharan         Africa (Source 5) and inadequate transport as a major barrier to         accessing health care.
Policy change in Tanzania recognising and responding to gender and           age-related issues in transport         The Tanzania Draft National Transport Policy Framework (Source         6) explicitly acknowledges, for the first time, that children and older         people's mobility needs, as well as those of women more broadly, need to         be addressed, on the basis of our research evidence in Outputs 1-4, 6         (Source 2).
Section 8.1, `Gender', notes that `Government will ensure           that national gender policies are mainstreamed in the provision of           transport infrastructure and services' and that `social           inclusion... refers to the needs of women (who) are most responsible           for looking after the family's domestic needs (in rural areas this           often involves spending a great deal of time collecting firewood and           water), for providing care and ... having and raising children'.
Case studies for training transport policy makers in DfID's African           Community Access Programme (AFCAP)         As a result of our research, DfID invited Dr Porter to advise on the         previously neglected Transport Services component of AFCAP (Source 7).
Porter's consultancy ensured a strong focus on participatory work with         users, in line with Output 5, and emphasised the need to provide         accurate data for decision makers.
The Transport Research Laboratory         (TRL), a global engineering company, won the AFCAP tender to deliver         training to tackle transport challenges.
TRL produced a Transport         Services Training Manual (Source 8) for use in a comprehensive           programme of regional workshops with transport policy makers and           practitioners across sub-Saharan Africa.
The Manual prominently         presents our research findings on mobility constraints and its effects         both as case studies and as evidential data disaggregated by age and         gender.
The Manual was first used by TRL in April 2013 at a pilot         training workshop in Tanzania, for 22 people from eight African         countries.
Two more regional programmes will occur in 2013.
The training         programme is currently being rolled out to all remaining Anglophone         African countries (Source 9).
