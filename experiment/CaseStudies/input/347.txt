     When a leading article in "The Economist" shouts "Biology's Big         Bang: What physics was to the 20th century, biology will be to the 21st         - and RNA will be a vital part of it" - see http://www.economist.com/node/9339752       - then an area of scientific discovery has already transcended the       boundaries of the laboratory and reached into a wider consciousness       (corroborating sources A-C).
But this is just one aspect of the scale of the Impact (in the broad       sense of the word) that has been generated by the discovery of RNAi.
There       have also been substantial Impacts in the form of significant economic       activities, which stem from Baulcombe's research at UEA, and whose       contribution can be encapsulated in the crucial US Patent 8,097,710 B       (inventors, Baulcombe and Hamilton), whose Claim 1 starts:     "We claim a method of silencing a gene in cells by         post-transcriptional gene silencing which method comprises introducing         into said cells a composition that contains short RNA molecules."
In fact, the most immediate economic Impact of the Baulcombe et al       work was (and is) the design, production and sale of synthetic siRNAs,       which are used as reagents in many biological Research and Development       laboratories worldwide and have undoubted importance in industrial       R&amp;D. Several multi-national (e.g.
Sigma, Qiagen, Dharmacon, Life         Technologies) and more specialised (Bioneer, IBA Gmbh, Midland,         etc.)
companies sell synthetic siRNAs that target genes in many       different organisms.
The very fact that this class of compounds has been       recognised is directly attributable to their discovery by Baulcombe et         al,.
In addition to their direct syntheses, various other       technologies to make and market siRNAs by enzymatic technology, through       RNAseIII (New England Biolabs) or by transcription (Selleck         Chemicals, Promega, Invitrogen), have been developed and are       commercially available.
Furthermore, siRNA-expressing plasmids (BioVision,       Promega, EMD Millipore, InvivoGen) or virus-based kits (Imgenex,         Life Technology, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) are widely marketed and       transfection reagents to specifically deliver siRNAs into cultured cells       have been developed by (for example) 5 PRIME, Bulldog Bio, Mirus Bio         and Lonza Cologne.
In addition to these current products, it is widely believed that gene       silencing will likely bring further economic and other benefit in the form       of (e.g.)
anti-cancer therapies in medicine and in the generation of       improved plant varieties that are (e.g.)
disease-resistant.
Although these       are future impacts and therefore outside the REF2014 timeframe, the scale       of the perceived future benefits is such as to have stimulated the       formation of several new biotech companies whose pipelines comprise       materials, techniques and know-how that depend on RNA silencing.
An       indication of the perceived values of these companies is seen by the       prices paid by "Big Pharma" companies for their acquisition.
For example,       Sirna Therapeutics was bought by Merck &amp; Co for $1.1       billion and Devgen (a pioneer in research for RNAi-based crop       protection applications) by Syngenta for $522m in 2012       (corroborating sources D-F).
Currently, there are two publicly announced licence agreements that       involve the Baulcombe siRNA patent.
One is with Alnylam         Pharmaceuticals, a leader in the development of siRNA therapeutics,       who aim to provide siRNA-based drugs against haemophilia and other blood       disorders, with some agents having reached Phase I and II clinical trials.
The other licence, to Dicerna, is used in their programme with       undruggable oncogenes, such as those involved in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
