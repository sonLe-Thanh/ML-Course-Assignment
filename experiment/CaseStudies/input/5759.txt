     [Numbers in square brackets refer to evidence in Section 5].
The impact refers to policy and practice aimed at helping lone parents       move into, and remain in, paid work.
We have achieved impact by making our       research available in accessible and timely ways.
The beneficiaries       include the policy community and the UK's two million lone-parent       families.
In relation to the REF guidance (REF 01.2012, Main Panel C) we       identify three main types of impact.
1.
`Influencing policy and practice leading to improved take-up or use           of services'.
Our evaluation of the New Deal for Lone Parents and         our cross-national research on welfare to work programmes for lone         parents provided evidence that informed government decisions to extend         employment advice and support to more groups of lone parents, to deliver         that support through Personal Advisers, to provide `better-off'         calculations, and to introduce measures (such as benefits run-ons) to         ease the transition to work.
Such measures were introduced into the New         Deal programme, following the evaluation, and hence were central to how         the New Deal operated.
Millar was a special advisor to the House of         Commons Select Committee on employment targets, resulting in a 2007         report [reference 5.1] which led to measures to strengthen job retention         in the operation of the New Deal [5.2] implemented from 2008.
Our           research thus had a direct impact on the delivery of the New Deal to a           substantial number of lone-parent families: between 2008 and 2011,           official DWP statistics [5.3] show that a total of about 440,000 lone           parents took up a place on the New Deal for Lone Parents programme.
2.
`Policy debate has been stimulated or informed by research evidence           which may have led to the confirmation of policy, change in policy           direction, implementation or withdrawal of policy'.
Our research         on lone-parent employment was used extensively by the Labour government         as confirmation of welfare-to-work policy for lone parents.
This came         about through regular presentations to DWP (for example, Millar on         employment sustainability in 2008, Harkness on lone-parent employment         and mental health in 2009).
Harkness' work is referenced in eight         government White Papers, including most recently in respect of universal         credit in 2012 [5.7].
Our cross-national research on tax credits is a specific example of         impact on policy implementation.
Millar proposed and organised a seminar         funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and held at HM Treasury in 2002         with participants from across government and NGOs.
The work was cited in         the HM Treasury paper [5.4] and influenced the design of the tax credits         that were implemented from 2003 onwards, with substantial revisions to         reporting requirements and the level of disregard in 2005/2006, these         making the scheme operate more in line with our original proposals.
Lord         Best (former Director of JRF) stated in his testimonial for our Queen's         Anniversary Prize entry (see below): this work `significantly informed         and influenced the measures ....
The system of tax credits proved a very         important part of the reduction by some 600,000 in the number of         children living in poverty...
The University of Bath can justifiably         take some credit for the raising of living standards for these         households.'
[5.5].
In each year from 2007-08 to 2011-12 official           HMRC statistics [5.6] show about 1.2 million employed lone parents           have received tax credits, making a considerable difference to their           incomes and living standards.
3.
`Influencing the work of NGOs or commercial organisations'.
We         have worked closely with a range of NGOs, including key groups such as         Child Poverty Action Group, One Parent Families, One Parent Families         Scotland, Single Parent Action Network, Gingerbread and Gingerbread NI,         Women's Budget Group, the Smith Institute, and the Resolution         Foundation.
Our research has helped NGOs to develop their responses to         government policy, to articulate policy alternatives, and to provide         advice and support on sustainable employment to lone parents.
For         example, Kate Green, MP and formerly Chief Executive of One-Parent         Families, confirms that our research on `the new deal for lone           parents, the impact of tax credits, and children's attitudes to their           parents' employment have all helped me with my campaigning and           lobbying work, enabling me to point to evidence of the impact of           government policies and to suggest areas for policy improvement'         [5.8].
Sue Cohen, Director of the Single Parent Action Network, notes a         contribution to `SPAN's Participatory One Parent Proofing (POPP)           tool-kit.
Jane Millar was a member of the Advisory Group and wrote the           Forward for this tool-kit which has now been accepted by the           Department of Work and Pensions as a model of good practice in           providing single parents with practical stepping stones into           sustainable employment' [5.9].
The deep and sustained impact of our research in informing policy debates       was recognised in 2011 by the award to Bath of the Queen's Anniversary       Prize for Further and Higher Education, awarded for `influential research       into child poverty and support for vulnerable people' [5.10].
