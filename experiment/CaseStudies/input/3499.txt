     The work of the Archaeogenetics Research Group has significantly       contributed to furthering the       understanding of human history and ancestry, benefiting not just immediate       peers and experts in       related fields but also a range of non-specialist audiences.
Having originally provided one of its main pillars, the ARG's research       continues to underpin the       growing genetic ancestry testing industry.
The companies operating within       this sphere draw on       both their published mtDNA sequences and the system of haplogroup       nomenclature and details of       the distributions of lineages of mtDNA, data analyses and interpretations       developed by the ARG       and their colleagues.
This influence reaches across firms in the UK and       the US, as well as the       large-scale National Geographic/IBM-funded Genographic Project, and has       stimulated numerous       amateur genealogists to set up websites dedicated to their own mtDNA       lineage or providing       information for fellow enthusiasts.
Dr Jim Wilson [a], who has founded       several successful ancestry       testing companies, has remarked: "Richards' research underpins significant       parts of the mtDNA       products available from all genetic ancestry testing companies, a global       market with over half a       million customers.
From his earliest studies through to his latest work on       West Asia, Africa, Europe       and Far East, his discoveries of the structure of the mtDNA tree, the       phylogeography of the       branches and advances in dating combine to reveal the ancestral female       line history of modern       humans."
Conscious that the impact of such companies might not always be positive,       Richards has also       played a key role in providing guidance for the industry.
In March 2010,       having specifically       requested his input, the Human Genetics Commission, which until May 2012       served as the UK       government's advisory body on new developments in the field, published       revised advice for the       general public, warning of genetic ancestry tests' inherent limitations.
In August 2010 this led to       HGC publishing A Common Framework of Principles for Direct-to-Consumer         Genetic Testing         Services [b], which included guidance on genetic ancestry tests.
The ARG's expertise has impacted on society and culture through extensive       media involvement,       particularly in the form of advice for TV and radio programmes.
The ARG       has also sought to       analyse and evidence the benefits of this input by surveying the new       audiences it has been able to       reach.
In 2009, Richards was consultant for the BBC Two series The         Incredible Human Journey [c], which       was screened in May and June that year and attracted an average of 2m       viewers per episode.
The       programme drew especially on work in references 1-3 for its narrative.
26       out of 120 respondents       in a survey carried out in October 2012/June 2013 (see below) remembered       seeing the show, and       more than three-quarters of these said it changed their view of human       evolution.
Series producer       Paul Bradshaw has remarked: "It has been clear from the public         response that [the programme]         stirred up wide interest in this fundamental area and helped put this         deep ancestral story into the         consciousness of the nation... Martin's input had a steadying and         confidence-building effect on our         narrative and, in turn, helped inform and enlighten our viewers."
Richards was also consultant for the first episode of BBC One's Andrew         Marr's History of the         World [d], screened in September 2012 to an audience of 3.85m.
Research on the out-of-Africa       dispersal (references 1, 6) was dramatised over the first fifteen minutes       of the programme, for       which Richards also checked and amended the voice-over script.
Marr wrote       in the Radio Times:       "When I discovered... that every person now alive who is not a sub-Saharan       African shares       ancestry from a single tribe that left Africa some 70,000 years ago...       well, that felt like a wonderful       place to begin."
19 out of 120 survey respondents saw the programme, and       almost two-thirds of       these said it changed their view of human evolution.
The series is now       used in schools as a       teaching aid.
Producer/director Guy Smith has credited Richards' "authoritative         contribution" with       "making a difficult subject accessible to a broad television audience".
Richards was also interviewed on film and consulted for Norwegian         Roots [e], a three-part       documentary series by the Norwegian Broadcasting Company (NRK), which was       shown first on       NRK1 in March 2012 to a 36% audience share (one of the most viewed       programmes in Norway       that week) and drew on work in references 2 and 3.
This led to the ARG's       involvement in a       production for Newton, NBK's children's science series, telling       the story of human migrations       through mtDNA.
Richards was also an adviser for BBC One's Meet the         Izzards [f], screened in       March 2013 and attracting an audience of 2.6m, in which comedian Eddie       Izzard used DNA to       trace his ancestry out of Africa and into Europe, and for a 10-minute       feature on the modern human       dispersal out of Africa for an April 2011 episode of BBC One's Bang         Goes the Theory, which       typically attracts more than 3m viewers.
Meet the Izzards       assistant producer Alex Gliddon has       acknowledged Richards' role as of "crucial importance to relaying         complex subjects to the wider         public".
Richards has argued the case for phylogeographic analysis       in a May 2013 Guardian Notes       and Theories blog [g], correcting some common misconceptions about how the       results are       achieved, and has also advised on the archaeogenetic aspects of works of       popular history, such as       Higham and Ryan's The Anglo-Saxon World (YUP, June 2013).
The ARG's efforts to communicate its work to a broader audience have been       further supported by       a number of talks to the general public.
These have included lectures and       discussions at the       University of Leicester (February 2008), Nottingham Science Caf&#233; (March       2008), the University of       Oxford (April 2011) and Otley Science Caf&#233; (July 2011), with an invitation       to speak at a day school       entitled "Palaeolithic Archaeology: Current Scientific Investigations" at       the Department for       Continuing Education, University of Oxford, in October 2014.
In July 2012,       and again in July 2013,       members of the ARG also gave a series of talks to A-level students from       Greenhead College,       Huddersfield, leading to enthusiastic feedback on Facebook.
In October 2012 Richards delivered another public lecture, The         Genetic Time Machine:         Archaeogenetics and Human Ancestry, to an audience of around 250 at       the University of       Huddersfield (delivered again in June 2013 at the Barnsley Campus).
Afterwards, 41 out of 120       survey respondents "completely agreed" with the statement "The lecture       told me things I didn't       know about human evolution and dispersals that changed my views of this       area of science"; 49       "agreed".
Some 73 per cent of respondents said they were stimulated to       find out more about       human origins, and almost half of those who responded said the lecture       changed their view on       whether to take a genetic ancestry test [h].
