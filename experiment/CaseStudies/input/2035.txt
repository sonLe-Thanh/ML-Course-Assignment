     Context: Amlwch is a "small town on Anglesey, which has         suffered rapid economic decline in recent years"1.
The Living           through Challenges in Low Income Neighbourhoods study examined the         salience of `place' in the daily lives of a sample of residents living         in six low income neighbourhoods in Britain in the period 2008-2010.
The         Study found, in relation to Amlwch:     "The industrial history and heritage of Amlwch has complex impacts on         residents' sense of esteem.
Several residents spoke with pride about the         role of industry in the town's development and the characteristics of         its population...However, the loss of this industrial base, and its         perceived impacts on employment and the social dynamics, was more keenly         felt in Amlwch than anywhere else.
Many participants referred to the         slender thread on which the economic fortunes of the town were seen to         depend.
"2     With a focus on creative reinterpretation through contemporary art       practice of the industrial legacy of the area, Randall has succeeded in       supporting the introduction of heritage-led initiatives celebrating the       area's unique industrial heritage; improving the quality of the       environment; engaging local communities; promoting local businesses and       encouraging tourism.
2005-2008: During her 3-year Artists Residency at Parys         Mountain Copper Mine, Amlwch, Anglesey, once the world's leading centre         of copper production, Randall developed a working relationship with         Menter Mon (Anglesey Enterprise), which included her being awarded a         Consultancy investigating the potential for public art in the town of         Amlwch in July 2009 and resulting in the development of creative         designs which were made into high quality artworks in the public realm,         including a series of visual "Amlwch Icons", detailing in fencing,         gates, and in signage at five sites, which are being used to reinforce         the special identity of Amlwch, and contributing to the economic         development and regeneration of Amlwch and Anglesey.
2011: A solo exhibition, Golden Venture at The National         Waterfront Museum in Swansea (NWMS), in 2011, the culmination of         Randall's 3-year Artists Residency in Amlwch, exhibited artworks Randall         produced in response the copper mine site.
Golden Venture         attracted 75000 visitors to the NWMS, promoting Amlwch and its         extraordinary industrial heritage within a national and international         context.
The exhibition celebrated the enormously important and often         overlooked historic and industrial links between Amlwch and Swansea.
The exhibition demonstrated how contemporary art practice can be used         to reinterpret information about materials science, unlocking the         creative and intellectual potential of copper and its role in         regeneration through heritage.
A bi-lingual exhibition catalogue, designed by a local Amlwch company,         was produced, Golden Venture [1] which described the         context and making of the work, and copies were available free to museum         visitors, providing an important legacy for the project.
2012: Randall was invited by Menter Mon (Anglesey Enterprise)         to bring Golden Venture to the new "Copper Kingdom" Centre,         Amlwch, which opened in June 2012, as its inaugural exhibition, the         first opportunity to exhibit work produced at Parys Mountain close to         the site, and to enable the local community to see and engage with the         work.
The exhibition featured 2 days of events comprising practical         workshops with the local community and a specialised Workshop/Symposium         with local creative industries where Randall supported local         craftspeople to develop objects and artefacts through to market         production, offering mentoring and professional development.
Designs for         craft products derived from the copper mine have been developed by         Randall, including copper jewellery and textile designs, prints and         souvenir objects.
Anglesey County Council Highways Department have adopted some of the         design ideas and are working with Randall to develop the "A5025         Artworks" scheme, regenerating a route through to the town and         increasing the visibility of the industrial legacy.
These public         artworks both enhance the townscape and draw attention to the unique         industrial legacy.
Consultation exercises took place with the public at         every stage of the design and 3 out of the 4 sites have provided         training and business development for metal fabrication businesses based         in North Wales and on Anglesey, enabling them to expand their range of         expertise.
A report commissioned during Consultancy for Menter Mon         "Public Art in Amlwch Report", August 2009, sent to the Welsh Assembly,         investigated and reported on the potential for public art in Amlwch and         formed the basis for commissioning contracts awarded for subsequent         public art works.
With Copper Kingdom shortlisted for the Guardian's Heritage         and Museum Awards 2013, Welsh Assembly Minister for Culture and Sport         John Griffiths said: 'I'd like to congratulate Menter Mon and the           Copper Kingdom for being the only attraction in Wales to be           shortlisted for this award.
The attraction makes clear the history of           Parys Mountain, the town and the port and is a valuable asset for the           area.'
July 2013: Randall has established links with mining heritage         sites in Cornwall with the aim of establishing networks for developing         the success of her partnership with the community of Amlwch and public         sector bodies of Amlwch and Swansea of using visual art as a catalyst         for community revitalisation through the reinterpretation of industrial         heritage.
