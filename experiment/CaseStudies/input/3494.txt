     In 2006, Scotland became the first country in the UK to introduce a ban       on smoking in public places.
Prior to this, there was credible doubt that       a ban would be effective despite research to show that more than 13,000       people in Scotland were dying each year from the effects of smoking, with       an estimated 1,000 of those deaths caused by passive smoking.
Researchers       from the University of Glasgow have presented the most robust evidence to       show that smoke-free laws have significant and wide-reaching health       benefits for smokers and non-smokers alike.
The research has been widely       cited to further strengthen the public health case for smoking bans both       nationally and internationally, supporting the argument that smoke-free       laws protect non-smokers, including unborn children, from the effects of       second-hand smoke.
Informing advocacy and policy     In 2009, the European Union (EU) cited these findings in its `Q&amp;A       briefing memo' (published on 30 June 2009), which prepared ministers for       parliamentary questions on a European Commission proposal on smoke-free       environments.a In response to the question "is there evidence       that smoke-free policies work?
", the author of the memo stated that       "better air quality has been mirrored by substantial reductions in the       incidence of heart attacks, including... a 17% drop in Scotland " citing       the Pell 2008, NEJM paper as the supporting reference.
On 12       October 2010, the EU Health Commissioner John Dalli stated that "a number       of studies indicate important health effects of smoke-free policies" when       answering a question raised in the European Parliament regarding the       Commission's proposal, before referring to another memo that also       references the Pell findings.b     In 2011, the WHO released the document `Making Cities Smoke-free' to       support compliance with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,       an international treaty signed by 174 countries.c Addressed to       mayors of cities across the world, this document drew on the experience of       many different jurisdictions and provided a practical framework for       implementing smoke-free laws in cities (effectively defining the       legislation, anticipating and countering opposition, ensuring civil       society involvement, and managing public communications).
In the section       entitled `Key Resources', the 2008 study by Pell and colleagues (2008, NEJM       in section 3) was the sole reference provided for the UK to demonstrate       the benefit of measuring indicators of worker health pre- and post-ban,       specifically `the number of emergency admissions to hospital for acute       cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks'.
Professor Pell was also       invited by the WHO to present at the 14th World Conference on       Tobacco and Health in 2009 in Mumbai, India.
The World Heart Federation,       which supports "reduction of the prevalence of risk factors associated       with cardiovascular deaths" and includes tobacco control as one of its       advocacy strands has selected Pell's research as one of four international       case studies that exemplify "the work of women who have played key roles       ensuring that women's needs are taken into account in the formation of       tobacco control policy and the provision of cessation services around the       world".d     In the USA, the University of Glasgow findings have been covered widely       by the press.
A White Paper produced in 2011 by the Health Care Foundation       for Greater Kansas City included a section entitled `Clean Indoor Air         Laws,e which cited Pell's research (2008, NEJM in       section 3), stating that "after just one year in effect, Scotland's       comprehensive clean indoor air law resulted in a 17% reduction in hospital       admissions for heart attacks and other coronary problems."
These data were       also referenced in a section of the Global Voices Status Report (2009)       that referred to the UK and Ireland as `Regional Leaders' for their       smoking legislation.f This report provides guidance for       clinicians and policy-makers on how to protect people from second-hand       smoke and was produced by the Global Smoke-free Partnership (GSP) &#8212; an       international umbrella organisation coordinated by the American Cancer       Society &#8212; which promotes effective smoke-free air policies worldwide.
The       GSP has also disseminated the research of Pell's team in a number of the       smoking-related factsheets that are available on its website.
Evidence produced by the University of Glasgow has also been cited in the       Scottish Government's evaluation of the success of the smoking ban and       continues to support its tobacco control policies.
ASH Scotland's       Information Service is funded by the British Heart Foundation and the       Scottish Government to provide reliable evidence-based information on       tobacco and its harmful effects on health, society, and the economy in       Scotland.
In ASH's `National evaluation of Scotland's smoke-free       legislation' (2013), key findings of the University of Glasgow research       (2008, NEJM and 2010, NEJM in section 3) are presented as       headline items, including the positive impacts on childhood asthma and on       heart attack admissions to hospital.g The Scottish Government's       2013 strategy on tobacco control, entitled `Creating a tobacco-free       generation: A tobacco control strategy for Scotland', cites the "clear       evidence that ... the smoking ban, has lead [sic] to a range of health       benefits including: reduced heart attack admissions to hospital; reduced       childhood asthma admissions to hospital; and fewer premature births",       referencing the 2008 and 2010 NEJM papers (section 3),       demonstrating the continued influence of Glasgow research on the       government's current smoke-free policy.h     Leading public debate     Extensive coverage in UK and international newspapers, on the radio, and       on the internet mean that the findings of Pell and her team have played an       important role in the continuing and often vociferous public debate for       and against smoking legislation.i-p As an example, the Wall         Street Journal, with a daily circulation of 2.1 million readers,       cited the team's findings in its coverage of the smoking ban debate in the       USA in 2008, stating that "a new study from Scotland provides what       public-health experts in the US say is the strongest evidence yet that       public bans on smoking being debated in several locales &#8212; improve health       by reducing exposure to secondhand smoke".i     Despite research from the Scottish Government showing that 80% of people       supported the idea of a smoking ban, there were concerns expressed about       the potentially damaging effect it would have on businesses and vocal       opposition from pro-smoking groups is ongoing.
The significance of the       Glasgow findings in supporting a smoking ban policy is evidenced by the       regularity with which they are targeted by ban opponents, e.g.
Freedom2Choose (F2C), a lobbying initiative seeking to `alleviate the       negative social and economic impacts of the ban' and to challenge       supposedly misleading claims over smoking issues, particularly in relation       to passive smoking.j Pell's research findings also feature       regularly in a blog entitled `Taking Liberties' written by Simon Clark,       the director of an anti-tobacco-legislation lobbying group called Forest       that is funded, in part, by British American Tobacco.k     On the other side of the debate, the Chief Executive of Action on Smoking       and Health (ASH) Scotland has contributed to a number of blogs in her       `Smoked out' series using the research by Pell's team to support the       argument in favour of smoking bansl.
In 2011, on the 5-year       anniversary of the Scottish smoking ban, the Scotsman newspaper       published a feature covering the wide range of views on smoke-free       legislation.
In addition to soliciting opinions from Simon Clark and       representatives from the ASH and the Scottish Licensed Trade Association,       they invited Jill Pell and Phil Hanlon to present the evidence base in       support of such laws.m In the BBC coverage of the 5th       anniversary of the ban, the legislation was described as one of the       country's "big public health success stories" &#8212; research by Pell and       colleagues (showing lower hospitalisation rates for children with asthma)       was used to support this statement.n
