     The composition and research described in section 2 led to the formation       of Hull Sinfonietta (and,       later, the Portumnus Ensemble) as a branded professional music collective       for the Humber region.
Since 2008 this collective's positive impacts on cultural life, civil       society and education have       included:            providing opportunities for 30+ commissions/premieres by         professional/emerging composers.
Outcomes have included an anthology of new songs (UYMP, 2010-11), a         published performing         translation (Faber, 2012), and a work that was subsequently performed by         Tokyo Philharmonic         for the inaugural Asian Music Festival (2010), Israel Contemporary         Players (2012) and the Hong         Kong Chinese Orchestra (2012) (5.1)       developing a programme of annual, research-informed Rehearsal         Orchestra Days for schools         in association with Excellence Hub (5.2) (over 14 schools, 240 pupils);         a Young Artists         Programme; cultural exchanges with 10 Chinese artists from overseas         (5.1)       providing occasional work for musicians from across the North of         England and for local         companies e.g.
hpss.co.uk.
Since Jan 2008 the largest single investment         to facilitate events         was &#163;47k from Hull City Council for `Music in the Gardens' in 2012.
(5.1, 5.3).
Other non UoH-         distributed funding included over &#163;19703 from PRS Foundation for Music,         CASH Music Fund,         the Vaughan Williams Charitable Trust, Hull City Council,         commercial/private donors.
Audience figures (live events) were c.2,500-3,000.
Media coverage       included Hull Daily Mail,       Yorkshire Post, Viking FM, Radio Humberside.
Lear Settings had numerous impacts.
Building on the original       rationale of the underpinning       research (see Section 2), the film's research led to (1) generating new       ways of thinking that       influence creative practice beyond the academy; (2) creating, inspiring       and supporting new forms       of (primarily) artistic and social expression beyond the academy; (3)       contributing to continuing       personal and professional development; and (4) preserving, conserving, and       interpreting cultural       heritage for audiences external to the academy.
It achieved these impacts       as a result of       dissemination through:            Animation Studio Image Production Workshops with AMBEC, Hull June         2008.
(Earlier         music/image workshops in January 2006, September 2007 had impacts in         2008 and         beyond.)
40 pupils.
(3.2, 5.4)       Film work.
5 professional animators employed, 2008-9 (3.2, 5.4, 5.5)       Recording of film soundtrack (January 2008) (17 performers employed)         (3.2, 5.4) [       Workshops (Including singing, costume-making), St Andrews Community         Primary School,         Kirkella, Jun/Jul 2009.
70 pupils.
(5.6)       Performances and screenings (including with live orchestra) at:                Middleton Hall, University of Hull March 2009.
17 performers           employed.
(3.2, 5.4, 5.7)         BBC Hull Big Screen, 27 June 2009 (3.2, 5.8, 5.6) with live elements           by St Andrews         Cubby Broccoli Cinema, National Media Museum's, 16th Bradford           Animation Festival,           12th November 2009 (3.2, 5.5, 5.8)         Albemarle Music Centre, Hull and Beverley Minster, 4-5 July 2012.
17           performers           employed.
(3.2, 3.5, 5.8)         Chinese University of Hong Kong, 12 March 2013.
(3.2, 3.6, 5.1)              Youtube downloads          In total there were 1250+ audience hits: 229 Non-academics in       participatory events, 720 general       live audiences, 301+ downloads/webhits.
N.B.
These figures exclude any       audience hits for works       subsequently produced by professionals as a result of their involvement in       Lear Settings.
Sample impacts:     a.
Increased and sustained engagement in Music and Arts subjects.
Workshops with AMBEC first       took place when the school's Music provision was developing.
Pupils in       2008 responded to the       underpinning research by delivering work as though for a commercial       animation studio.
The       project played a role in strengthening numbers obtaining related       qualifications.
The school has       records from 2009 and information on 25 of the 46 participants: 85% opted       for creative and       performing arts subjects; 92% achieved GCSE grades A-C, median average       B/C, mode C;       BTEC median Dist, mode Dist* with 6 music BTECs Dist* for all averages)       (5.9); a workshop in       Sept 2007 contributed directly to a further 8 pupils achieving their       Certificate of Personal       Effectiveness award in 2008.
(5.4, 5.9)     b.
Improvements in pupil behaviour.
`Democratic authorship' was promoted       to encourage artistic       ownership and `open-earedness'.
Observable improvements in pupil       confidence, productivity,       and behaviours resulted notably amongst pupils at risk of exclusion.
Pupils who attended the       film premiere referred to being inspired to create (musical) artworks.
Many went on to take arts       subjects.
(5.4, 5.9)     c. Changes to school teaching methods including cross curricular       learning.
In St Andrews       subsequent radical shifts towards cross-curricular learning contributed       significantly to record       literacy SATS results in 2012.
(5.6)     d. Professional skills development particularly in relation to use of       image editing and musical timing       for live performance and 2D animation using Flash technology.
William       Simpson (formerly       Docherty), Katariina Paakki, Rozi Fuller, Zane Whittingham, Lisa McKnight       &#8212; all credit their work       on the film (listed as either A Jumbly Girl or Lear Settings)       on business websites relating to their       careers, e.g.
Zoom animation, rozifuller.co.uk, katariinapaakki.co.uk and       Omni Pictures.
We can observe increased use of techniques in their post-Lear Settings       work.
For instance:            The complex narrative (meta-)structure in which projected images         interact with a soloist in         live contexts was discussed by Fuller at an open forum at BAF'09 and         would inspire her to         pursue later interactions between: a live performer and animated images         as well as audience         and animated outdoor projections.
(5.5a-c)       In 2012, Whittingham and Fuller, with Kath Shackleton, would form the         company Fettle         Animation (Lear Settings features in first showreels).
Influence         from the creative direction         and writing of the `A Jumbly Girl'section can be traced in the style of         the 2012 Olympiad         project Spooky Sport, which was shortlisted for the `Best Use of         Animation' Big Chip Award         and included in the BAF2013 Official Selection Short Shorts.
(5.5d)       Following Lear Settings, Will Simpson founded both Omni         Pictures and internet TV studio         MITSUI.TV, producing for BBC, World Wildlife Foundation and Arts Council         England.
Subsequent related music-film work included Trilogies &#8212; three         video works commissioned for         a Piano Circus live performance at Kings Place London, Feb 2011         favourably reviewed by         Bach Track.
(5.5e)          e. In an impact survey of concertgoers attending a live orchestra       screening of Lear Settings and       `implications for communities' talk (2012), 87% of those questioned       identified a music-related       impact.
Audiences commented on: aspects of the project perceived as       innovative or new;       images or presentation of images affecting experience of the music;       interesting/resonating       themes/ideas; the usefulness of the project as a model for others; changes       in their behaviours       as a direct consequence of the experience; general impressions of the       multi-stranded approach;       the intensity level of their engagement.
