     Low NOx Burners Savings of ~&#163;1Mpa     Unburned carbon in power station ash represents a loss in combustion       efficiency, but this is mitigated by electrostatic separation of       pulverised fuel ash (pfa) into ash fractions with low and high carbon.
This enables the low carbon pfa to be marketed as a cement replacement       material, while the pfa fractions with higher carbon contents provided       ashes containing sufficient carbon for them to be used as a low cost fuel.
The research programme and subsequent boiler trials showed that addition       of pfa to a coal not only produced no undesirable boiler effects, but in       fact increased the overall combustion efficiency and provided increased       amounts of a saleable slag and pfa.
The benefits from the ash refiring       programme may be summarised as providing:            an increased amount of a bottom slag for sale.
an increase in pulverised fuel ash (pfa) sales.
a reduction in payments of landfill tax with less ash to dispose of       a techno-economic assessment by an independent consultant [A] of pfa         additions to the coal determined savings of ~&#163;1 M pa for a         typical 2000 MWe pulverised coal-fired boiler.
Biomass additions Savings of ~&#163;40-60M pa     It was shown that with an appropriate choice of biomass and coal, the       viscosity of the co-fired ash that could be maintained at a level above       which slagging and fouling in a boiler could be avoided, even at 50%       replacement levels.
The findings at Imperial College London were then       followed with pilot scale trials using the RWE npower 0.5 MW combustion       test facility at Tilbury (CTF).
This allowed an increased range of boiler       conditions and flame characteristics to be monitored.
At this stage a       cautious economic assessment of biomass co-firing was made.
This showed       that substantial financial benefits could be achieved by a power       generator, including the resale value of the carbon credits, the value of       the renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) and the levy exempt       certificates (LECs), even when the added cost of biomass transportation       and storage were included.
Estimates made were based on a power station       output of 2000 MWhe operating at a load factor of 70%, and with       either a 20% or 50% thermal replacement of the coal with a biomass.
The       cost of modifications to the storage facilities, transportation and       milling of the biomass would depend on the amount of biomass to be       co-fired.
Reductions in fuel costs when biomass replaced coal (&#163;70 per       tonne for coal) and reductions in Landfill Tax for ash disposal (&#163;6.5 per       tonne) all resulting in a substantial economic benefit with            at 20% thermal replacement of coal, net income would be &#163;40 - 70Mpa         [B]       at a 50% thermal replacement, net income could rise to &#163;110Mpa         [B]          The current UK situation is close to the 20% replacement scenario       described above.
The research programme provided the power generators with       confidence to significantly increase the amount of biomass being co-fired       at UK power stations.
[C,D]     A Corporate Engineer for Fuels and Combustion, RWE npower of RWE notes       that: "The high biomass project studied the impact of high level of         biomass co-firing.
This project was one of the underpinning studies into         high biomass burn that lead to the decision to convert Tilbury biomass         to 100% biomass firing.
The reduction in CO2emissions         is massive and it has led the industry as a whole to look at unit         conversions as a viable option for old coal fired power stations."
[C]     The trials at Tilbury did indeed encourage the industry to implement the       use of the process and in July 2012 Drax Power Ltd announced that it would       transform itself into a mainly biomass-fueled energy generator, and is now       converting three of its six generating units.
The Tilbury Biomass       experiment demonstrated the viability and the experiment at Tilbury has       now ended, pending the outcome of Government decisions regarding new       energy contracts to be announced in 2014.
The situation regarding the production of biomass boilers is extremely       encouraging and business is buoyant.
The Group Leader Fuels and Chemistry       at Doosan Power Systems noted that:     "The work has been instrumental in the development of advanced boiler         and burner design methods, in the development of biomass firing and         co-firing technologies and in the development of oxyfuel firing         technologies for CO2 capture from coal-fired         power station boilers."
[E]     Doosan Power Systems has successfully secured a $170M contract for the       conversion of a 227MWe lignite fired boiler to 100% biomass at the       Atikokan Generating Station, Ontario.
[F]     Finally, the research at Imperial contributed towards the view expressed       in the UK Renewable Energy Roadmap published by DECC in 2011 [G] that       electricity produced by sustainable biomass could provide a third or more       of the required renewable power by 2020 (some 32050TWh per year).
