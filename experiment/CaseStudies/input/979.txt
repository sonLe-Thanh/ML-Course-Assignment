     Feedback and commentary indicate that Out of This World was       successful in bringing new audiences into the British Library, by       representing a view of science fiction that challenged the preconceptions       of fans and non-fans through presenting searching questions about the       origins and function of the genre.
The exhibition highlighted significant       but under-considered examples, and asked a diverse audience to reconsider       "received wisdom" on matters such as the role of women writers (e.g.
Margaret Cavendish, Mary Shelley, the Bront&#235; Sisters, Charlotte Perkins       Gilman, Margaret Atwood) in creating science fiction.
China Mi&#233;ville       (author) argued in his opening speech that, `Part of the point is to bring       those to the British Library who would not necessarily otherwise come but       to bring those who would otherwise come to the BL into the science fiction       room and to point out to people who think that they have no interest in       this field that actually they should be interested in science fiction but       they have been interested in it all along, without necessarily knowing       it.'
While the exhibition introduced the various interpretations of science       fiction to a broad `cultural' audience which tended to ignore the field or       view it through the lens of popular television programmes, it also       challenged the opinions of committed fans who might have previously found       themselves suspicious of more "literary" interpretations.
(BBC         report May 2011 Mi&#233;ville).
One science fiction fan wrote, typically,       `Really         interesting, really informative.
Made me want to go away and read more         sci fi plus 'discover' different authors'.
Another wrote: `The         first display defied my expectations confronting me with work I'm either         unfamiliar with or hadn't previously considered in the context of         science fiction'.
The scale and reach of the exhibition and associated school visits is       described below and the feedback from audiences through media and social       media is used to support the impact claimed.
Out of this World was presented in association with the Discovery       Channel, which produced a series of four TV films on science fiction       topics.
It attracted a broad audience of readers, teachers, school and       university students and academics (footfall 114,878; target attendance was       100,000), and extended far beyond the core "fan" audience.
The audience       for the talks and other events was `drawn from a wide variety of ages and       backgrounds, with a relatively even gender balance.'
(BL report).
An         associated blog attracted about 800 views per week during the       duration of the exhibition and was still attracting 200 a week in March       2012.
A programme of 27 talks and associated events attracted 5,615 (the second       highest total for any events programme yet run in association with a BL       exhibition and comfortably in excess of the target 4,500).
Events included       talks and panel discussions by writers such as China Mi&#233;ville (20 May);       Iain M Banks (6 June); David Lodge and Stephen Baxter (8 June); Audrey       Niffenegger (10 June); Michael Moorcock, Brian Aldiss (21 June) and Alan       Moore (4 July).
Other talks included Brian Appleyard, Jack Cohen, Ian       Stewart and others on "Aliens" (18 June); Richard Holmes on Mary Shelley       (22 June); Niall Ferguson on Alternative History (29 June); a discussion       on cloning (1 August) and a celebration of the work of Robert Holdstock (2       September).
The "Worlds of Wonder" discussion of the future of speculative       fiction included Rachel Armstrong, Neil Gaiman, Peter F. Hamilton and       critic Kari Sperring (4 September); and there was a discussion of the work       of J. G. Ballard (23 September).
Other events included a rehearsed reading of Karel Capek's play RUR:         Rossum's Universal Robots (6 July) and the launch of Lemistry,       a tribute volume to Polish writer Stanislaw Lem, (9 September).
Musicians       George Clinton and Nona Hendryx talked about science fiction influences on       their lavish stage shows and albums, and a night of futuristic music on 17       June saw The Radio Science Orchestra and Global Communication perform live       at the British Library.
A separate, aligned programme of school visits and educational events       resulted in 3228 attendees taking part in workshops; 79 teachers attending       CPD events, and 496 participants attending family events.
Other events       included: study days for `A' level students; a young researchers' project       working with students at risk of exclusion; workshops for local Camden       Primary and Secondary Schools as part of Pop Up (a Festival of       Stories taking place in summer 2011 in the Kings Cross area).
Out of this World attracted much national and international press,       radio and TV coverage and interest, in particular from places which might       have previously considered science fiction a minority interest, including:       The Guardian and The Observer, The Independent, The         Daily Mail online, CCTV News (China Central Television 24-hour news       service); BBC2 "Culture Show".
The Times Higher Education Supplement,       Times Literary Supplement, New Scientist, New York         Review of Science Fiction; the Huffington Post.
The           Daily Telegraph wrote that 'Seeing the history of one genre in       one room is extraordinary....Out Of This World redefines the sci-fi       genre, showing the ways in which we think about ourselves in relation to       others: aliens, humans or our future selves.
It is a means of reflecting,       prophesising and allegorising the world and the human condition.'
The exhibition's emphasis on the role of women in the genre was also       significant.
It triggered a BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour discussion,       on 25 May 2011, that asked `Is Science Fiction Still A Male-Dominated       Genre?'
Sawyer advised the producer on possible speakers.
Spin-off talks       included events at Alfreton Library, Derbyshire and Toxteth Library,       Liverpool connected with the Lemistry volume, talks at the Oxford       Literary festival (19 March, 2012) in company with the author Gwyneth       Jones, and the Frodsham Literary festival ("Weaver Words") September,       2012.
A         recent article in The Huffington Post cites the exhibition       as a key moment in garnering a significant interest by mainstream cultural       institutions in science fiction.
As a direct result of Out of this World, The Science Fiction       Foundation Collection has been invited to exhibit at the forthcoming World       Science Fiction Convention (London, August 2014) which will attract       4-5,000 people including writers, publishers, general readers and       academics.
Another significant outcome was the recognition of the exhibition by the       British Science Fiction Association, who gave it a "Specially Commended"       award for `its success in encouraging the general reader to explore and       enjoy science fiction' at the Easter SF Convention in 2012.
Out of this World has also altered the British Library's       perception and expectation of its own reach and impact.
A spokesperson for       the British Library has stated that the `SF exhibition helped convince       them that there is an appetite for less traditional displays', which had a       direct effect on their commissioning a new exhibition on comics called       `Anarchy Between the Lines'
