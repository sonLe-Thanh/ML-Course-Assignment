     A significant aspect of Sutherland's impact has been the contribution       made to providing new resources and forming new agendas for other         academics engaged in studies of Austen.
The anthology of Austen       family biographies (A Memoir of Jane Austen and Other Family         Recollections, 2002) has been adopted world-wide as a university       course book (e.g.
Colby College, the University of Delaware, Southern       Illinois University) as well as having wide take up by the general public       (Austen commands levels of public interest probably second only to       Shakespeare among Britain's classic writers).
It is regularly reprinted,       and has to date sold 4,440 copies and netted revenue of &#163;12,735, for         OUP.
Textual Lives has directly shaped a burgeoning interest       in reception studies of Austen at university level, serving as a model,       for example, in recent publications from Juliet Wells, Everybody's         Jane (2011) and Gillian Dow and Clare Hanson, eds, Uses of Jane       (2012).
Wells writes: `Kathryn Sutherland's Jane Austen's Textual         Lives [...] has had a profound impact within Austen studies,       including but not limited to reception history and the study of popular       culture ...
I take up where Sutherland leaves off' (pp.
14-15).
It is a       recommended teaching text at numerous universities, including the Open       University, St Andrews, Exeter, and the University of Texas at Austen.
It       has sold 1,280 copies and netted revenue of &#163;24,555 to date.
After       Textual Lives Sutherland was commissioned to write a series of       reviews of screen adaptations of Austen for the Times Literary         Supplement (2005-9).
More recently, Textual Lives was used       as research source for The Many Lovers of Miss Jane Austen (aired       BBC2, 23 December 2011, director Rupert Edwards, presenter Amanda       Vickery).
Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts: A Digital Edition provoked huge       academic and public interest when it went live in October 2010 (Ref.
i).
The edition offered the first chance to view Austen's fiction manuscripts       as a reunified collection since their dispersal in 1845, and the first         chance for any member of the general public to engage with them in high         quality, free, digital form.
The site has had 4,237,474 hits       (113,204 unique visitors) between its launch and the end of the auditing       period (Ref.
ii).
Between 23 October and 19 November 2010, 454 news       articles (Radio, TV, newspapers) covered the story internationally;       Sutherland was interviewed by many major British and North American papers       and broadcasters.
Her free online podcast lectures, `Jane Austen's       Manuscripts Explored', in the Oxford University BODcasts series, had       attracted 1386 downloads by the end of the audited period (Ref.
iii).
The edition provided the academic community with an important teaching       resource (images and searchable transcriptions of all Austen's fiction       manuscripts), but the project also had important technical         implications for future work in manuscript conservation and curation.
It provided a model for the use of digital media that admits public access       to materials that are too delicate and too valuable to be open to easy       view in a library or museum.
Technically, the project set new standards       for the digital encoding of working draft manuscripts (with the       establishment of an international subcommittee for TEI-XML encoding of       writers' revisions, chaired by Elena Pierazzo, Technical Researcher on the       Austen Digital Edition).
Immediate impact came with its inclusion in the       British Library's major public exhibition, `Growing Knowledge: The       Evolution of Research' (October 2010-July 2011), an interactive showcase       of innovative projects from the arts, science, and medicine, inviting the       general public to engage with the latest digital research.
It also       featured in `Oxford Impacts', an Oxford University publicity drive,       showcasing its major research.
In January 2013, Sutherland demonstrated       the web-edition to the Right Hon.
Vince Cable, Secretary of State for       Business, Innovation, and Skills as an example of innovation in the       Humanities.
The conservation element to Sutherland's work is important in       other ways, too: she worked with curators at the Bodleian Library, Oxford,       to gain funding to conserve Austen's juvenile notebook, Volume the         First, helped draw up the successful application (July 2011) to the       Heritage Memorial Fund for funds for the Bodleian Library to purchase the       manuscript of Austen's novel The Watsons, and gave a public       lecture on the manuscript in Oxford on World Book Day, 1 March 2012 (Ref.
iv).
The web-edition is regularly accessed by schools and by creative         writers.
In June 2010, for example, the British Library, with Jane       Austen's House Museum, organised a Day School for Sixth Formers, `Jane       Austen and Performance', with activities built around the web-edition       (Ref.
v).The edition was used and acknowledged as a source by the novelist       Ali Smith in Artful (2012) (p. 16 and back of book credits).
In 2008, Sutherland was invited to become Patron and subsequently       Trustee of Jane Austen's House Museum, Chawton, Hampshire.
Work       with the Museum has significantly extended the reach of the impact of her       research, with regular talks to the general public and to schools       (including judging an annual national fiction writing competition for       school children) (Ref.
vi), and educational films and apps (with the         British Library).
Her contributions to the BL's flagship literature       project, English Online (due to launch in Spring 2014) are described by       the library's Digital Programmes Manager, Anna Lobbenberg, as       `invaluable': `the site will use primary source material to aid the study       of key literary works and to help shed light on the context in which these       works were written.
Professor Kathryn Sutherland ... sits on the project's       advisory board, has written articles for the site, and has appeared in a       number of short films shot both at the Library and at Jane Austen House       Museum.
She has also delivered a lecture to A-level students as part of       our Pride and Prejudice conference.
Her expertise and generosity have       helped ensure that the literary analysis provided by the site is       accessible and enticing for young people and lifelong learners' (Ref.
1).
Sutherland is regularly called on by newspaper journalists and BBC         radio and television for expert comment on Austen, and has       disseminated her knowledge of Austen's writing and editorial reshaping       through numerous articles, podcasts, and interviews aimed at the general       reader (Ref.
8).
Since 2010 she has appeared on Swedish TV, BBC2 Austen       documentaries (The Many Lovers of Miss Jane Austen, 23 December       2011; Jane Austen: The Unseen Portrait, Martha Kearney, director       Neil Crombie) (Ref.
2).
Sutherland has provided the `voice over' for the       Chawton House travelling exhibition of `Pride and Prejudice' currently on       tour throughout Britain (Ref.
viii).
