     Research results actively disseminated by CVC academics have influenced       current anti-terrorism       and defence strategies employed by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the US       Department of       Homeland Security (DHS), the Department for Transport and private defence       company QinetiQ       [5.1-5.8].
The work on detecting IEDs in combat zones is directly informing current       training in Counter-IED       procedures and is helping to build the capability of Britain's armed       forces by tackling the main       cause of casualties in the combat theatre.
In 2009 USA Today reported that       75% of coalition       casualties in Afghanistan were caused by IEDs, up by 50% on 2007.
The       CVC's findings [5.2-5.4]       are being used to inform military personnel in combat zones and the MOD       has forwarded the       research to army commanders and private contractors in the field.
The       MOD's Counter Terrorism       Centre acknowledged the value of the research as follows by email [5.1]:     "The outputs from the studies conducted by the University of         Southampton have been presented to         a range of stakeholders, as well as informing the understanding of the         mechanisms that underpin         the visual search for targets in an operational environment.
Presentations using the findings of         these studies have been given to the following: [RESTRICTED TEXT         REMOVED]     Donnelly acted as one of the advisors to the Dstl's `Tiger' IED detection       team in 2010.
In December       that year, Dstl released a statement describing the "success" of       the Tiger team in developing new       technologies to detect IEDs in Afghanistan.
The team, comprising the MOD,       Defence Equipment       and Support (DE&amp;S), military and industry, demonstrated the "viability         of four exploitable solutions         which are being transitioned to DE&amp;S for final development and         procurement."
The statement also       said that the success of the Tiger team would inform the MOD's research       strategy.
Over recent       years (2010-2013) the number of deaths from IEDs for UK troops has       reduced.
There are multiple       reasons for this reduction, including better detection of IEDs, which has       been informed by the       research from Southampton.
Further to this successful project, the MOD is drawing on the research of       Southampton's CVC       team to train security personnel in identifying threats in public spaces       such as conference centres       and private homes [3.G3].
The results of this on-going research [5.4] will       be used to develop and       inform training for high-level security procedures at, for example, public       and VIP national and       international events.
The findings on X-ray screening of airport baggage [5.5-5.8] led the DHS       to test them in the field       on US airport baggage screeners.
The work is now informing airport       security policy.
Dr Josh       Rubinstein of the DHS' Transportation Security Laboratory [5.5] says the       CVC team "has been         instrumental in supporting the Department of Homeland Security's         research program on aviation         security.
The research has greatly enhanced our understanding of the         perceptual and cognitive         processes involved in airport security x-ray visual search."
He       continues, "your work is finally         bubbling up to affect policy."
CVC researchers have also disseminated research findings to the       international aviation security       industry, presenting results at the Fourth International Aviation Security       Technology Symposium       and the International Transport Security Human Factors Technical Advisory       Group (InterTag).
The research has informed a wider audience through publication in the       press and broadcast       media, including a film report by the Associated Press news agency for       distribution to over 500 TV       channels worldwide.
The findings on dual-target search were conveyed to       the general public at the       Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition (London, July 2011) [5.9],       attended by around 14,000       people.
Interactive displays involved visitors having their eye movements       tracked as they searched       for guns and IEDs in baggage X-rays.
Visitor questionnaires showed strong       support for the       statement, "After visiting this stand I think that psychology research         makes a valuable contribution         to life in the UK."
The BBC, The Guardian, China Radio International       and various weblogs covered       the involvement of the research in the exhibition [5.10].
Menneer was       interviewed by radio station       Radio Wave 105.
