     Sheffield's collaboration with the English Cathedrals originated in 2009       when Pyper and Crossley       began informal discussions with the 2011 Cathedral Sub-Group.
There was       enthusiastic       agreement for Sheffield to provide exhibition and educational resources       based specifically on the       distinctive departmental approach to the reception of the King James Bible       rather than simply its       seventeenth-century origins.
The Sub-Group and the King James Bible Trust       (www.kingjamesbibletrust.org)       were particularly enthusiastic because most English cathedrals       lacked the intellectual and financial resources for this landmark       anniversary [S2].
According to the       then new Director of the King James Bible Trust, the resources offered by       Sheffield, `gladden my         heart...I can say without hesitation that we would be grateful to make         extensive use of these         resources throughout the year - indeed, even before.'
[S1].
In 2010,       Pyper and Crossley, along       with Hine, wrote the exhibition and educational resources which were then       discussed with Sheffield       Cathedral [S2] and Museums Sheffield in order to make them suitable for       the National Curriculum,       adult education and museum audiences.
The Humanities Research Institute at       the University of       Sheffield provided access to their Exhibitor software package so that the       exhibition resources could       be made available as an interactive DVD.
The overtly interdisciplinary and reception-historical approaches to       Biblical Studies at Sheffield       made it possible for the exhibition and education resources to cut across       educational disciplines,       including those listed in the National Curriculum (Art, Citizenship,       English Language, English       Literature, Geography, History, Music, R.E., and Technology).
The specific       research of Pyper and       Crossley was particularly shown in the following major topics in the       resources for the educational       outreach programmes at each cathedral:            controversial texts and 'wars of translation'       the Bible and nationalism, including English and Scottish nationalism       the use of the Bible in Empire, colonization, justifications for         slavery, and even as source of         liberation       the King James Bible in the United States, and its influence on         American politics       `KJV-only-ism', Peter Ruckman and their place in American culture       the Bible in the Arts, namely its depiction and interpretation in         music, literature, sports,         visual arts, and popular culture       the ongoing use of KJV idioms       different versions of the Bible which developed and survived as the         influence of the King         James Bible was seemingly in decline          While the exhibition was promoted in North America by the Society of       Biblical Literature, one of the       most popular biblical studies blogs, and a Knoxville newspaper [S6, S7,       S8], English cathedrals       and their visitors were the main beneficiaries [e.g.
S4, S5, S9].
Telling         Tales exhibitions were       available at 30 English cathedrals and some greater churches throughout       the UK, with displays       lasting from one week to 12 months.
Organisation varied locally.
For       instance, major venues such       as Canterbury Cathedral held extended 12 month exhibitions while the       exhibition was taken on tour       around the Diocese of Llandaff (Church in Wales) throughout 2011.
Resources were made       available for free download on the departmental webpages.
On these       webpages, images of the       exhibitions at churches and cathedrals were also provided, as well as the       locations of, and       information about, the exhibitions:     http://www.shef.ac.uk/kjv/exhibition/locations     The resources and accompanying new research were presented to the       conference, Biblical         Literacy and the Curriculum: Celebrating 400 Years of the King James         Bible (University of       Sheffield, May 2011).
The conference was aimed at teachers,       educationalists and cathedral       outreach officers and there were about 100 participants.
Each participant       involved was provided       with a copy of the DVD and sessions were led by Crossley, Pyper and Hine       to discuss the ways in       which the reception of the Bible could be, or was being, used in teaching       and the curriculum.
This       included research presented by Crossley which has since been revised for       publication.
It is impossible to know the number of visitors who saw the exhibition,       or what proportion visited       cathedrals because of the exhibitions.
However, there are some general       figures about Cathedral       visitors which indicate the scope of the impact made by the resources that       Sheffield provided to an       audience otherwise unfamiliar with their contents.
In 2004, the English       Heritage and the       Association of English Cathedrals jointly launched a report on The         Economic and Social Impacts of         Cathedrals in England.
According to the report, almost 9 million       people visited England's 42       Anglican cathedrals annually (compare 6.2 million people visiting       Blackpool Pleasure Beach, 3.7       million people visiting the London Eye and 4.5 million people visiting the       British Museum in 2003),       with more than 300,000 organised educational visits annually.

Sheffield Cathedral's adult educational outreach programme was used as a       specific test case for       analysing changing perceptions [S3].
Feedback sheets were completed by all       participants and       covered questions including: `Did the course fulfil its stated aims?
';       `What did you know about the       King James Version after the course that you did not know before?
'; `Name       one other thing you       learned during the course'; and `How would you rate the exhibition on a       scale of 1-5, where 1 is       poor and 5 is excellent?'
The feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
Every       participant believed       that the course fulfilled its stated aims and every participant listed       something new they had learnt.
All evaluations of the exhibitions materials were ranked 3-5, with nothing       lower.
On things learnt       and appreciated, comments included: `Just one?
Difficult to choose';         `Its fascinating impact on         English and world history through colonial and missionary use; `the         complexity of translating         accurately...The exhibition was excellent, most informative'; `Problems         for translators...bias         caused by belief/political situations'; `The biblical origin of some         everyday expressions'; `I did not         know as much as I previously thought I did'; `it reflects a political         stance about authority...I enjoyed         all of it'; `that language in subsequent translations of the Bible         reflected the society and outlook of         those to whom the "new" translation was directed.
Fascinating!...It was         all very interesting'; `how         the Bible has influenced our culture and "idiom"; `A LOT!...the subtlety         of what appears to be very         modest changes in translation between versions of the Bible &#8212; and the         origins of the NIV!
'; `I had         not realised that so many of our common sayings come from the KJV...I         liked it all'; `that we were         not only looking backwards to the KJV but that there was an input into         the reading of the Bible         today'; `a realisation of the difficulties of translation'; and `the         scholarship, the history and the         various interpretations of the Scriptures.
I enjoyed and appreciated all         the course in equal         measure'.
