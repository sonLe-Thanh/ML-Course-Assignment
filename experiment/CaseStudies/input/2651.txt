     Framing Muslims has greatly informed the work of individuals and       organisations who actively       challenge negative perceptions of Muslims and Muslim communities in the UK       (1, below).
Specifically, the book has been used to inform the work of ENGAGE, a       not-for-profit company       founded in 2008 with the aim of challenging Islamophobia in the UK and       improving Muslim       participation in media and politics.
In November 2012, ENGAGE launched a       national touring       exhibition, Media Portrayals of Islam and Muslims, at the House of       Commons to generate       awareness and understanding of Islamophobia and its impact on the lives       and security of British       Muslims.
The findings of Framing Muslims formed part of the       exhibition and its accompanying       guide, providing in-depth analysis of what constitutes `newsworthy'       articles when selecting stories       about Muslims or Islam and how pre-determined patterns of selection       reinforce negative       stereotypes.
The exhibition was mounted in multiple locations in the UK,       including the Muslim       Council for Britain's community dinners in Birmingham and Leicester (200       attendees per event);       Social Workers Action Network conference, South Bank University (500+);       the Unite Against       Fascism Conference, London (500+); Communications Workers Union       headquarters, London       (200); Manchester Museum (2000+); and London Muslim Centre and East London       Mosque (200+).
Framing Muslims also heavily informed ENGAGE's media masterclass,       a free one-day course held       in London (2012) and Bolton (2013), which encouraged delegates to think       critically about the       negative portrayal of Muslims in the media and how this might be       challenged in the quest for a       more cohesive and inclusive society.
Shenaz Bunglawala, ENGAGE's Head of       Research, confirms       the contribution to both the masterclass and the exhibition (2, 3 and 4):     "The book's analysis of the representation of Muslims in film and         literature is used to illustrate the         stereotypes that pervade in this medium.
Framing Muslims is         uniquely relevant for its inclusion of         `soft' media approaches, that is, the prevalence of anti-Muslim         stereotypes in literature and film.
This analysis contributes to assessment on the representation of Islam         and Muslims in `hard'         media (newspapers and television) and aids in the appreciation of how         multi-platform messaging         informs the construction of Muslims and Islam in the public discourse.
Our media masterclass         presentation and Islamophobia Awareness Exhibition would not be complete         without inclusion of         the analysis contained in Framing Muslims and its significance         to challenging anti-Muslim prejudice         in public discourse".
Framing Muslims has also informed the thinking of those within the       media involved in debates and       discussions surrounding the representation of Muslims.
Samira Ahmed,       freelance journalist, writer       and broadcaster at the BBC, cites the text as having shaped her ideas on       this issue (5):     "I found Dr Yaqin's book interesting and I've recommended it or         brought ideas from it up in         meetings and discussions with producers and guests in at Radio 3, the         World Service and BBC1.
For example, we did a programme item at Night Waves on Radio 3 a         few months ago about the         concept of Muslim comedy in North America, which drew on some similar         ideas (6).
It includes an         interview with the creator of Little Mosque on the Prairie, a         programme I had specifically mentioned         to my producer, after reading about her in Framing Muslims.
My         producer read the book on my         recommendation, so it played a specific part in the preparation of ideas         and scope of the         programme.
In that sense, the impact has been notable."
Yaqin (with Peter Morey) has actively disseminated her research through       media engagement and       participation in public events.
In 2011, she appeared on the Islam       Channel's Politics and Media       show hosted by Salma Yaqoob (former leader of the Respect Party) to       discuss the book's findings       in relation the rise of the English Defence League and the lack of redress       for Islamophobia in       sections of the press (7).
She also discussed the book's ideas at City       Circle London, the Centre for       the Study of Islam in the UK at Cardiff and the Muslim Institute Winter       Gathering in Sarum College,       Salisbury (8, 9).
The book was well received by critics internationally,       receiving positive reviews in       Dawn, Pakistan's oldest English-language newspaper, the Saudi         Gazette and the Indian magazine       Frontline (10, 11, 12).
Through a series of recorded and archived events, freely available on       itunes, the "Framing       Muslims" project has been communicated to the wider public, involving       participants from       community bodies, broadcasting and the arts, including broadcasters       Sarfraz Mansoor and Samira       Ahmed; the artist Ali Zaidi; novelists such as Booker Prize shortlisted       Mohsin Hamid, award       winners Daniyal Mueenudin and Farahad Zama and Hollywood       screenwriter-turned-novelist       Kamran Pasha.
In 2010, the British Library included the website in its Web       Archive, preserving the       material for future use.
