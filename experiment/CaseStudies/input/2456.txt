     Pathways to impact       The UoE stroke group (Wardlaw) contributed to the conditional European       licensing of rt-PA by presenting data to meetings of the European       Medicines Evaluation Agency in Berlin and London.
Subsequent to this       licensing, they have designed, provided expertise to, or led, three trials       that preceded IST-3 (including Multicentre Acute Stroke Trial (MAST)-I in       1995, European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS)-3 in 2008) and       contributed to the design and image interpretation of a registry of       patients treated within the conditional licence (Safe Implementation of       Thrombolysis in Stroke: A Multicentre Multinational Monitoring Study of       Safety and Efficacy in Stroke (SITS-MOST)).
Sandercock, Wardlaw and members of the IST-3 group have presented the       findings at conferences on every continent during 2012-2013, and there has       been substantial coverage in the print and broadcast media and on the       internet (www.ist3.com).
In addition,       the 2012 Lancet articles by Sandercock and Wardlaw [3.1, 3.5] have already       been cited 153 times (Web of Science, last accessed 7th October       2013); the Lancet 2012 paper [3.1] was the most highly cited article       published in the journal that year on a neurological topic.
Impact on public policy       This research has led to the revision of stroke guidelines       internationally, with one or more of the references in section [3] cited       in UK, USA, Japanese, Korean and Polish national guidelines [5.1-5.5,       respectively].
Impact on clinical practice       Participation in the trial has had a direct impact on the development of       stroke thrombolysis services in the UK.
Seventy-five UK hospitals took       part in IST-3, and the majority had limited or no prior experience of       thrombolysis.
The trial provided training and support for these centres to       enable them to establish thrombolysis for stroke.
In the UK, the administration of thrombolysis within 3 hours is a quality       standard against which services are judged nationwide.
The National Stroke       Strategies in England and Scotland state that thrombolysis should be       administered as soon as possible after onset of stroke [5.6].
In 2012, in       England 90%, and in Wales and Northern Ireland 100% of hospitals admitting       patients with acute stroke provided a 24/7 thrombolysis service, on-site       or in collaboration with neighbouring hospitals [5.6].
This meant that       that in the first quarter of 2013, 12% of patients were thrombolysed in       the UK; in the London area, where major service re-design has occurred,       18% were thrombolysed [5.7].
In Scotland, a 2012 audit revealed that the       2009 target of at least 3% of all new patients to be treated with       thrombolysis had been exceeded; in fact approximately 8% had been treated       [5.8].
Impact on health and welfare       Professor Charles Warlow (Professor of Neurology, now Emeritus, UoE,       1987-1998) estimated that in a typical European population of 1 million       people, in 1 year, 2260 people would have a stroke and, without treatment,       by one year, 700 would have died and 1240 would be dead or dependent       [5.9].
The effect of giving alteplase to the 226 (10%) of the patients       whose stroke is ischaemic and could be treated within 3 hours with       alteplase, would be to reduce the number of patients who are either dead       or dependent by 24 [5.9].
Applied to the UK population of 62 million,       assuming that 10% of ischaemic strokes received rt-PA, 1488 (24 &#215; 62) more       people would be alive and independent.
Applying the same estimates (106       per 1000 treated avoid death or dependency) to the 4 million strokes per       year occurring in the developed world, where health services have the       resources to deliver thrombolysis [3.1], about 100,000 more people would       be alive and independent after their stroke as a result of the treatment.
Impact on the economy and commercialisation       The UoE group contributed to the successful market authorisation by the       European Medicines Authority of alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke.
In       2002, Sandercock estimated the UK annual cost to health and social       services of a dependent stroke survivor to be &#163;11,292, and that of an       independent survivor to be &#163;876.
Thus, the avoidance of post-stroke       dependency is an important contributor to reducing the burden of care on       the NHS and social services.
The National Institute for Health and Care       Excellence, using Wardlaw's 2009 Cochrane systematic review [3.3] and       updating Sandercock's previous analysis, estimated that rt-PA is       cost-effective over a 12-month period, with an incremental       cost-effectiveness ratio of &#163;14,026 per quality-adjusted life-year gained,       well below its threshold value of &#163;30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year       [5.10].
