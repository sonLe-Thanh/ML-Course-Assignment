     In view of the world leading recognition of his expertise in particle       physics, and his active and ongoing research in collider phenomenology and       the properties of the Higgs boson in particular, John Ellis has received       numerous requests for interviews from print and broadcast media and       invitations to deliver public lectures.
He is widely recognized as an       authoritative and clear interpreter of this new discovery by students, the       general public and the media in the UK and elsewhere, and he has played a       significant role in conveying to the public around the world the       excitement of the new science, of which his own research has formed an       important part.
In his public presentations Ellis regularly highlights his       latest research findings, notably those on the properties of the       recently-discovered Higgs boson, including its spin, couplings and       interpretation within theories such as supersymmetry.
Between April 2011 and July 2013, John Ellis gave 76 outreach talks to       audiences including school pupils, university students and the lay public,       in the UK as well as in 24 other countries.
He has spoken at five cultural       festivals in the UK, delivering, to another diverse and unique audience,       insights into particle physics and cosmology, highlighting the Higgs       boson.
In this period he has given 90 interviews to print and broadcast media in       the UK and 26 other countries, reaching a total worldwide audience of many       millions.
These include interviews with the following print media: Nature         (estimated readership 400,000; 9 million monthly page views), Science           magazine (estimated print and online readership 1 million), Physics           World (circulation 110,000), New Scientist (circulation         388,000), The Times (print circulation 400,000), Sunday           Times (print circulation 939,000), Guardian (print         circulation 196,000), Daily Telegraph (circulation 550,000), Le           Figaro (print circulation 321,500; online 1.2 million), Der           Spiegel (weekly circulation 1.1 million), South China Morning           Post (readership 388,000), Hindustan Times (readership 3.8         million), New York Times (print and online circulation 1.8         million; No.
1 English language newspaper website in the world with         nearly 60 million unique monthly visitors), Washington Post         (circulation 475,000; nearly 20 million online readers in the US and 7.3         million international), Wall Street Journal (circulation 2.4         million, including print and online), Los Angeles Times (1.5         million daily print circulation, 1.8 million online), Associated           Press (one of the largest news organizations in the world,         primarily supplying news for US newspapers and broadcasters; according         to AP, their news content is seen by half the world's population on any         given day).
BBC interviews include 7 television appearances (including BBC2's           Newsnight, average audience 900,000, and BBC News Channel,         average weekly audience ca.
9 million), and 6 on BBC national radio         (including BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service, average weekly listeners         of 11 million and 1.7 million, respectively).
He has also appeared on television programmes in 7 other countries         including Al Jazeera TV (broadcast to more than 220 million         households in more than 100 countries; the most watched news channel on         YouTube, receiving 2.5 million views per month) and China Central TV         (Main state TV news channel in China, available to over one billion         viewers), and also National Public Radio USA (26 million         listeners in the US and worldwide, a network of over 975 independent         stations).
One of his presentations on Youtube about the Higgs boson, published         July 2012, has been viewed over 500,000 times and prompted over 2,600         online comments and over 4,000 `likes'.
Evidence of the impact that Professor Ellis' message has had on his       audiences is provided by the frequent, sustained demand for his       views from the media, particularly from global outlets.
The public have       shown a great thirst for information on, and interpretation of, this       breakthrough story in science, and the print and broadcast media have       recognised John's ability to satisfy it.
The Science Editor for BBC       Newsnight has commented that: "John Ellis is accessible, approachable and,       above all, immensely capable of elucidating the most difficult concepts in       physics, such as the hunt for the Higgs-Boson particle, with unhesitating       clarity and engaging relevance for non- specialists.
He's always among the       first people I call when researching topics even remotely connected to his       field."
The science correspondent for National Public Radio in the USA       (and previously from the Nature news team) has stated: "John Ellis is an       exceptional science communicator ... he's been great at explaining complex       ideas simply, which has made him a very helpful voice in my work for       popular outlets."
In his position as a leading and active expert on LHC physics, and as a       result of the impact of his public engagement activities, John Ellis has       been in a position to influence government policy, not only in the UK but       worldwide, by helping politicians to understand the importance of the       science and capitalise on the public excitement surrounding it.
He was invited to speak at an event organized for the European Parliament       in November 2012, and has had individual meetings with ministers from 7       other countries.
In the UK he was invited to speak at a reception at       Parliament in September 2012, a report on which was published in Science         in Parliament (SIP).
In the publication's editorial from the       Chairman of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, John's skill at       working to galvanise worldwide interest was highlighted: "(John)       eloquently described the `legacy' of the hadron collider and we would be       missing an important opportunity if we didn't use it to help inspire the       next generation."
As noted in the main SIP article on the event, "what was clear and       gratifying to see from the MPs in attendance was the wider impact that the       LHC was having on MPs and Peers, many of whom were being drawn to science       for the first time because of it."
John has also been asked by Rt Hon       David Willetts MP, Minister for Universities and Science, to develop a       proposal for co-operation with developing countries in physics research.
