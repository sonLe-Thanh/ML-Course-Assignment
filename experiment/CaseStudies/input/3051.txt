Context            Since the inception of NCISH in 1997, reporting of suicides by mental         health patients has increased from 20% to 95% of cases.
NCISH is internationally unique in mental health care in terms of the         depth and breadth of information that we can provide to inform clinical         practice and suicide prevention policy (locally, nationally,         internationally).
Pathways to impact (see also figure 1 below)     NCISH has provided, and continues to provide, new information to health       services and the wider community on suicide in mental health patients.
Based on this information, NCISH has made specific recommendations for       preventing suicide in services in our reports, "12 points to a Safer       Service" (S1) two iterations of the national suicide prevention strategy       for England (2002 and 2012) (S2) and international policy documents (S3,       S4).
Unique to mental health services, implementation of NCISH       recommendations to clinical practice and policy has led to a reduction in       suicide rates that is ongoing and sustainable.
As of 2013, additional       delivery of NICSH impact on practice and policy is carried out via the       social enterprise Safer Care Ltd.     Reach and significance of the impact     Impact on policy nationally and internationally     A major impact of NCISH research has been to inform policy through       national policy documents and answers to parliamentary questions (S5).
Our       research underpins section 1 of the national suicide prevention strategy       for England (2012), Preventing suicide in England: A cross- government         outcomes strategy to save lives, which has reduced suicide in high       risk groups (S2).
Section 1.13 makes specific reference to NCISH       recommendations as providing key guidance for mental health services; 2       NCISH publications are also referenced in the Strategy.
Internationally,       our work has informed surveillance schemes in Ireland (e.g., the National       Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF)) and Norway (S3, S4).
Our research has       also led recently to national tools for quality improvement.
Our safer       mental health services toolkit (launched January 2013) has been downloaded       approximately 1,300 times to date (S6).
A further example of recent impact       is the requirement for NHS Trusts to demonstrate their adherence to       Inquiry recommendations &#8212; the first Quality Accounts began in 2010/11       (S7).
Impact on services            NCISH's focus on in-patient safety has been associated with a halving         in the number of in- patient suicide deaths.
We demonstrated that three         of the NCISH recommendations were significantly associated with a         reduction in suicide rates in the NHS Trusts that had implemented them,         with no significant reduction in suicide rates in Trusts that did not         implement recommendations.
Implementation of 24-hour crisis teams, dual         diagnosis policies and multi-disciplinary reviews following a patient         suicide were associated with 200-300 fewer patient deaths per year.
The         cost of each suicide death is around &#163;1.5 million (Journal of Crisis           Intervention &amp; Suicide (2007) 28:89-94).
Based on these         figures, 300 fewer suicide deaths in England and Wales represent a         potential cost saving of &#163;450 million annually.
NCISH impact continued during the assessment period (see also wider         and emerging impact).
NCISH's 2013 Annual Report (3) showed a 26% fall         in overall patient suicide rates in England (2004-2011).
We also         reported sustained improvements in in-patient safety &#8212; in-patient         suicide fell by 58% (2001-10) particularly in those who died by hanging         (likely to have been as a result of NCISH recommendation to remove         ligature points).
Service changes informed by NCISH research have         continued to be implemented, and two of the recommendations (relating to         crisis teams and dual diagnosis policies) were associated with some the         biggest falls in UK suicide between 1997-2011 &#8212; differential falls in         suicide between implementing and non-implementing services of 30% and         12% respectively (S8).
Wider and emerging impact     Safer Care Ltd. (2013) (company number 08598105) (S9) is a social       enterprise formed in response to NHS Trusts requesting our expertise to       address local aspects of patient safety and suicide prevention.
We       forecast a &#163;40,000 turnover in the first full year of operation.
Through       Safer Care Ltd., NCISH provides: expert scrutiny of individual cases and       service documentation (SUI reports, service policies) identified by       services, identify themes arising from cases, place local services in the       national context and provide a training seminar to all staff about their       local issues and the national picture.
