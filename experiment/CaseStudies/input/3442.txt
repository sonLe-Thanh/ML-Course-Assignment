       The report from the research on medical governance across selected         countries (2005/6) was peer         reviewed and rated as good.
It had a clear impact on the Chief Medical         Officer's report (Donaldson         2006).
The CMO wrote to Allsop saying, `I found your report on medical         regulation in its         international context rigorous, stimulating and useful and feel it added         to the richness of my report'.
The research report was made available on the CMO's website and, by         agreement, the University         of Lincoln website (Allsop and Jones 2006).
The research was supported         by, and has been         referred to and used by, Sir Donald Irvine, lately president of the         Picker Institute, a European-wide         agency that promotes patient-centred health care.
The research had a distinct and material impact on the CMO's report         (Department of Health 2006).
Chapter Six reported the research and its findings, as well as the         recommendations drawn from it.
On page 112, the CMO's (2006) report states: `Much of the content... is         based on Professor         Allsop's findings'.
The report itself is still available on the         Department of Health website, as well as         the re-publication in 2012.
Specific recommendations in the report that         used the research findings         were:                recommendation 11 (in dealing with poor performance the           investigatory functions of the           GMC should be separated from adjudication);         recommendation 26 (a system for regular revalidation should be           introduced to assure           doctor's competence);         recommendation 42 (the GMC should be more open and accountable).
The recommendations in the CMO's report follow from the research         findings, in terms of what was         shown to be a general trend in the governance of medicine in other         countries towards greater         accountability and transparency.
The CMO's recommendations were then put         forward in the White         Paper (Secretary of State for Health, 2007) that followed, and were         subsequently incorporated into         legislation.
Reforms to the General Medical Council took place between         2008 and 2013, namely: a         smaller appointed Council; parity between lay and professional members;         the separation of the         investigatory and adjudicative functions; greater Parliamentary         accountability; and increased         scrutiny of competence with annual relicensing and periodic revalidation         of practising doctors.
The         main reason for the impact made by this research was that it showed that         reforms to medical         regulation were taking place elsewhere.
This challenged the GMC's view         of itself as a world leader         in medical regulation.
The research findings had an impact on the views of groups within the         profession, including         following dissemination through a series of presentations and question         and answer sessions: to the         CMO's Advisory Group in September 2005; to medical leaders at the Royal         College of Physicians         September 2005; to the full General Medical Council in October 2005.
These presentations were         part of the process of informing professionals of what was happening         elsewhere, and of reaching a         consensus on reform.
In addition, as part of the dissemination process, during 2008/9 Allsop         gave presentations based         on the research at conferences in Canada, Portugal and France, and         published a number of         articles in peer-reviewed international journals with various academic         colleagues from other         countries.
From 2008 to 2013, Allsop's research continued to be useful to policy         makers and academics.
For         example, she published a further article on complaints in 2009 that         reviewed the different models         for complaint handling.
With permission, this was drawn on by a         regulator presenting a paper on         complaint handling to the International Association of Medical         Regulatory Authorities' bi-annual         conference in Ottawa (2012).
Together with Professor Robert Dingwall, in         January 2011 Allsop         was asked to discuss current research findings on complaints and medical         negligence at an         informal meeting with the Parliamentary Health Select Committee, in         order to advise the         Committee whether or not to carry out a further inquiry at that time.
In         2012, access to the initial         report was also widened, following a request to publish it by Lap         Lambert Publishing in Germany.
It         is also available as an eBook on Amazon.
There has also been an impact on health regulators and the medical         profession in other countries.
The report has been cited in other publications on regulatory reform,         and Allsop has, for example,         given advice and support to a research project in British Colombia,         Canada, and presented a paper         based on the research to Italian doctors and academics who aim to         address institutional         governance arrangements in Italy to deal with incidents of poor practice         and harm to patients         (Alghero, Sardinia 2010).
