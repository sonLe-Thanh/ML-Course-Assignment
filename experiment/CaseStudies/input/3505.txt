     The research has significantly enhanced understanding of LGBT equalities       issues1.
Crucially, it has challenged two common assumptions:       firstly, that LGBT people have won all their rights; and secondly, that       bisexual people do not have issues with which policymakers and       practitioners should be concerned.
As a result, Monro's work has had       considerable influence in a number of key areas, both nationally and       internationally, in the LGBT equalities field, particularly in terms of       her distinctive contribution concerning bisexuality.
Monro provided in       excess of 12 presentations, many of them invited, to conferences and other       events (for example, networks, international workshops and Pride       celebrations) organised primarily for community members, policymakers and       practitioners over the 2008-2013 period.
For example, in Barcelona in       October 2009 Monro gave a keynote address at Against Homophobia,       an EU conference whose delegates included representatives of the European       Commission and international human rights organisations.
This work had a direct influence on policy development and implementation       across Europe, including the use of Monro's findings in a White         Paper2.
In 2010 and 2011 the methodologies used for the       Organisational Change, Resistance and Democracy projecta were       adapted for a major policy         survey of public officials and LGBT human rights in 18 countries by       the Equality and Citizens' Rights Department of the EU Agency for       Fundamental Rights.
Monro's findings were also used in policy discussions       in several EU member states, including Italy, where a report3       cited Monro and Richardson (2010) as describing a shift in the management       of LGBT equalities from a politicised to an administrative approach.
The       report recommends that: `local authorities need to make a fundamental         transition from the political arena to the technical/ administrative         one' 3 (page 41).
Monro was invited to provide a seminar       and a workshop at the Human Sciences Research Council in Pretoria in       February 2013.
The workshop, which compared LGBT human rights concerns in       South Africa and the UK, attracted policymakers and activists.
Feedback       included statements such as, `It will make me think about the value of         multiple identities'4.
In the UK, the Organisational Change project was substantially drawn on       in The           Bisexuality Report, which was published by the Open University       in February 20125.
The report has since been downloaded more       than 20,000 times and disseminated to all central government departments.
Monro's contribution has subsequently been recognised by requests to       assist government departments.
In September 2012, following contacts made       through the bisexuality research project (see above), she was invited to       deliver a training workshop to the Executive at the Department of Work and       Pensions (DWP) who manage more than 100,000 staff.
Individuals       subsequently commented on the impact of this workshop.
For example, one       individual stated that `I think it might have already changed some         people's lives for the better.
I for one feel loads better that         consciousness of those around me has been raised' (Manager,       post-training feedback filed at University of Huddersfield).
The workshop       subsequently fuelled, in 2013, the development of nationwide DWP training       which focused on equality issues for bisexual DWP employees and customers.
Activities included Civil Service LGBT Awareness Learning,       bisexual-specific guidance in management training, and bisexuality       awareness sections in the Department of Work and Pensions LGBT History       Month and International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia,       all documented on the DWP intranet.
These interventions were directly       informed by Monro's training.
For instance, the national DWP HR Sexual       Orientation Lead stated that `following Surya's bisexuality training         last year, I developed a new "Busting some myths about bisexuality page"         on the sexual orientation section of our Diversity and Equality intranet         site' (the intranet is available to DWP employees)6.
In       October 2012 Monro also contributed to a Department of Health meeting       about public health, with the Policy Adviser to the Department's Equality       and Inclusion Team later reporting7 that she had taken note       that Monro had `stressed that Public Health England will need to         provide some guidance/expertise at a national level... [to] address         the health needs of LGBT people as minority communities'.
The findings of the Organisational Change project have also influenced       policies at regional and local levels.
For example, the documentation for       the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation         Trust's Equality Delivery System, in November 2011, called for `people         in senior management positions ... to give a clear message about the         importance of the sexualities and trans equalities agenda in relation to         employment opportunities and all areas of service provision'8.
Monro was invited to give the keynote speech at the 2009 LGBT Health       Summit, held in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and attended by 250 delegates       including policymakers, practitioners and members of the local community,       that helped lay the foundations for the research impacting on professional       training and practice.
More than 80 per cent of participants who took part       in a post- conference evaluation (on file at the University of Newcastle)       said that the research findings would affect their work.
For instance, a       housing manager stated that he would consider the needs of LGBT people       more inclusively; a NHS representative said that he would make the LGBT       population visible in policy and action plans; a local authority       representative considered that the research would contribute to the       establishment of an equality scheme for LGBT people in his organisation;       and a union representative vowed to raise LGBT issues with his county       council and employer.
The research findings have since been drawn upon in       practice guidelines, including the Social         Care Institute for Excellence's 2011 At A Glance report9,       which cited the findings in its recommendations for developing training       programmes.
LGBT Equalities: Surviving Austerity, a workshop held in November 2012       for community members, policymakers and practitioners as part of an ESRC       Festival of Social Sciences, also developed impact, as demonstrated in the       workshop evaluation.
For example, a manager in the third sector wrote: `I         am producing an LGBT strategy for my workplace, so [this] information         ... will feed into it'; An Equality Policy Officer stated that `The         findings ... will be incorporated into work done within the Welsh Local         Government Association on providing equality across the public sector';       and a member of the community and voluntary sector said: `I will be         more mindful of the wider LGBT community/sector outside of my         organisation's specific focus' (evaluation results on file at the       University of Huddersfield).
The research has generated wider public appreciation of LGBT issues       through media exposure which have included: widespread coverage in the       LGBT press and Monro's appearance on Radio 4's Woman's Hour (April       2012).
It has also directly stimulated LGBT diversity awareness work with       approximately 130 11-to-18-year-olds at two Youth Citizenship conferences       funded by the ESRC (November 2012 and November 2013) which resulted in       vulnerable young LGBT people accessing support10
