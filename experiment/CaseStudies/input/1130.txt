     The impact of Varese`s research extends across several countries.
Findings from the research have reshaped policies to combat transnational       crime, while the methods have been incorporated into the training and       practices of police forces and prosecutors in a number of different       nations.
Policy     The UK`s Cabinet Office, and Office of the Prime Minister, invited Varese       to join the Strategic Review of Serious Organized Crime, in 2009, because       his work had come to the attention of the Chairman of SOCA [Section 5:         C1].
As one of two academics on the review, he shared the insights       from his research on the factors enabling mafias to migrate across       borders, ensuring that his research contributed directly to the panel`s       recommendations [C1].
In particular, Varese`s research confirming       the localized nature of organized crime led to recognition that a national       agency devoid of links to local policing units would be less effective.
Recommendations based on Varese`s research [culminating in R2]       were implemented after the 2010 election, when the new government       announced that the Serious and Organized Crime Agency would be merged into       a newly created organization, the National Crime Agency, much more       embedded in local policing.
As a consequence of several analysts attending one of Varese`s lectures       in the United States, Public Safety Canada (equivalent to the UK`s Home       Office) commissioned a paper on Varese`s work (written by Ottawa       University Professor of Criminology R. Hastings (2006)), and then employed       Varese as a consultant in 2010 to discuss the implications of his research       for migration and the risks of organized crime.
He addressed the chief       civil servant in each ministry dealing with crime and migration [C2].
Varese`s analysis [R2] informed the government`s review of       priorities, emphasizing that crime was not caused by migration, but rather       by the sudden expansion of unregulated markets, and the development of a       demand for informal or criminal protection.
As demonstrated in Varese`s       research [R2], undocumented migrants might seek protection from       mafia-like organizations when criminalized.
Varese`s research also held particular relevancy for policymakers in       Italy.
Two prosecutors from the Anti-Mafia Parliamentary Commission,       reporting to the Parliament`s Joint Committee on the Mafia in 2011, cited       Mafias on the Move as `extremely significant' [C3].
A       Member of Parliament then quizzed the prosecutors on Varese`s explanation       for which cities are more vulnerable to penetration by the mafia.
In       addition, the book was cited in proceedings to remove one Member of       Parliament`s immunity from criminal prosecution.
The Member who initiated       the proceedings described Varese`s research on the mafia`s mechanisms of       penetration of the legal economy as `the most up-to-date and scrupulous       analysis' [C4].
Practitioners &#8212; police and prosecutors:     The widest impact on the practices of police and prosecutors has occurred       within two European institutions, Europol and Eurojust.
Europol helps police forces fight against serious international       crime and terrorism.
When Europol hosted a training symposium for 120       crime analysts from Europe and the United States (organized by the       International Association of Crime Analysts) in April 2012, they invited       Varese (based on their awareness of his research) to give a keynote       lecture on techniques for the quantitative analysis of telephone       intercepts.
Europol then invited Varese`s co-researcher, Campana, to       provide a two-day hands-on workshop at the Hague in September 2012.
He       taught 25 crime analysts how to apply network and correspondence analysis       techniques developed by Varese [R3, R4, R5] to the evidence       already collected by their police forces.
A letter from a Senior Analyst       at Europol confirms the value of Campana`s training of Europol`s strategic       analysts [C6].
In addition, Varese and Campana advised on the way       Europol collects data for its biennial Organised Crime Threat         Assessment [C6].
This advice led to a major restructuring of       Europol data collection strategy.
Relationships initiated through Europol       have now developed between the two researchers and national police forces.
One such force (which cannot be identified because its investigation is       ongoing) sent two police analysts to Oxford in May 2013 to spend two days       learning network analysis from Campana.
Eurojust helps judicial systems investigate serious cross-border       and organized crime.
After an initial meeting with Varese and Campana, the       organization`s Case Management Analyst invited Campana to the Hague in May       2012 to improve data collection on the prosecution of transnational crime.
He recommended augmenting the data to include the outcome of each case       prosecuted: whether the accused was convicted and, if convicted, the       sentence imposed.
This enabled Eurojust to evaluate whether transnational       crimes should be prosecuted in a single country or in multiple countries,       depending on the type of crime and the type of judicial system.
Eurojust       incorporated Campana`s advice into the organization`s strategic plan [C7].
Furthermore, Italian prosecutors operating in the areas studied by Varese       have stated that his research is `particularly relevant' in identifying       conditions that lead to mafia penetration [C5].
Beyond policy and practices, Varese`s research on the Russian       mafia`s migration to Western Europe informs the plot of John le Carr&#233;`s       novel, Our Kind of Traitor.
The author acknowledges him:       `heartfelt thanks ... for his creative and ever-patient counsel' [C8].
The novel sold 132,000 copies in the United Kingdom in 2011, making it the       89th bestselling book.
