     King's research has achieved impact in the field of sickle cell disease       through its contribution to the roll-out of an antenatal and newborn       screening programme, linked to designated NHS specialist treatment       services for haemoglobin disorders.
The principal beneficiaries are people       with sickle cell disease and their families whose management has moved       from the margins of the NHS to the mainstream.
Individuals with sickle       cell disease have benefited from earlier diagnosis and better treatment.
Carriers of the sickle cell trait have benefited through being enabled to       make informed reproductive choices when a pregnancy may be affected.
King's hosts the national Screening Programme Centre     Following up the research on newborn bloodspot coverage, King's was       commissioned by the Department of Health to implement a National Audit of       the Newborn Bloodspot Programme.
As a result of a 1999 workshop convened       by the National Screening Committee (NSC), at which the King's research on       bloodspot programme coverage was presented alongside the results of two       Health Technology Assessment reviews, universal newborn screening for       sickle cell disease was recommended.
In 2000, the Department of Health       committed to introduce newborn and antenatal screening for       haemoglobinopathies including sickle cell disease and thalassaemia.
The       National Programme Centre for the NHS screening programme was established       at King's College London from 2000 to 2013 through a contract between the       Department of Health and King's, which had a value of &#163;7.75 million in the       period 2008-2013.
The Programme was directed by Dr Streetly (2000- 2013),       reporting to Dr Anne Mackie as Director of Programmes, for the National       Screening Committee.
The Programme Centre transferred to Public Health       England in 2013.
The aim of the NHS Haemoglobinopathy Screening Programme       is to support people to make informed choices during pregnancy and before       conception, to improve infant health through prompt identification of       affected babies, to provide high quality and accessible care for these       conditions throughout England and promote greater understanding and       awareness of the disorders (NHS         Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme, 2013).
King's leads implementation of the National Screening Programme     With national leadership based at King's, universal newborn and antenatal       screening for sickle cell disease was introduced in England while       implementation in Scotland and Northern Ireland was also supported.
This       was achieved through setting standards (Ryan         et al.
2010); designing pathways for screening and care; education       and training; establishing communications and preparing materials for       professionals and the public; establishing data collection systems for       surveillance and monitoring; and quality assurance and evaluation.
The       main impacts of the screening programme roll-out in England are summarised       in the Table including results from the Screening         Programme Data Reports from 2008/9 to 2011/12 (NHS Sickle Cell and       Thalassaemia Screening Programme 2013).

The King's group proposed that under-ascertainment of       the condition may have allowed a downplaying of the scale of need and       contributed to infant mortality rates in urban areas as babies died       without a diagnosis or treatment (Streetly         et al., 2009).
Influenced by the results of King's SHIFT Trial (whose Trial Manager,       Dormandy, became Screening Programme Deputy Director), the national NHS       Screening Programme has set a minimum standard of requiring 50% of       prenatal diagnosis procedures to be implemented by 12 weeks and 6 days       gestation.
The Data         Report for 2011/12 (NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening       Programme, 2013) (Table AN-4) shows that 61% of all initial antenatal       screening tests in England are now performed by 12 weeks gestation.
This       has been accompanied by an increase in the number of pre-natal diagnosis       procedures being performed from 307 in 2004/5 to 418 in 2011/12, with 52%       of these now being performed within 12 weeks 6 days of gestation (Table       PND- 6).
King's provides international advice on haemoglobinopathy screening     During the assessment period, the Screening Programme has benefitted from       strong stakeholder involvement, with the Archbishop of York chairing the       Programme Steering Group.
There has been international interest in the       screening programme, which is recognised to be the best developed in       Europe, and arguably the world, providing a model for many other       countries.
Dr Streetly has given invited presentations at the Centres for       Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, Ghana, and in Europe in Rome, Lisbon,       Barcelona, Paris and Berlin.
The Programme has also hosted visits from, or       provided advice to, public health advisers to the Netherlands government,       US Centres for Disease Control, Sri Lanka and Nigeria among others.
The       Programme website is regularly accessed and materials downloaded by       interested parties from across the world.
King's research stimulates action to improve patient care and         specialist treatment services     King's research drew attention to the difficulties that patients with       sickle cell disease experience in their interactions with hospital       services.
Following on from the research, a National Confidential Enquiry       into Patient Outcomes and Death (NCEPOD,         2008) into sickle cell disease was launched.
King's contributed to       the authorship of the NCEPOD report (Professor Sebastian Lucas, Dr Allison       Streetly).
The NCEPOD findings confirmed and extended the results of the       King's research.
Of 35 sickle cell disease patients who died in hospital,       19 had pain as an admitting complaint.
In nine patients excessive doses of       opioids were judged to have been administered, contributing to the       patient's death in five cases.
The NCEPOD report made 28 specific       recommendations for the improvement of clinical treatment and service       delivery for sickle cell disease including better management of acute pain       and improved care of the long-term illness by clinicians with specialist       expertise and training.
The recommendations were circulated to Medical       Directors of all Trusts for action.
Recognising the need for action to       improve the quality of care highlighted by this report, the Department of       Health commissioned a National Haemoglobinopathies project that produced       guidance for commissioners on effectively commissioning high quality       sickle cell and thalassaemia services.
The guidance included designated       standards that Trusts must deliver to secure specialist status for       haemoglobinopathy care as well as model service specifications and a       commissioning framework.
The final NHS guideline document (NHS         East Midlands 2011) included an endorsement written by Dr Streetly       from King's in her capacity as Programme Director of the National NHS       Haemoglobinopathy Screening Programme.
The Department of Health also       prioritised this as an area for National Institute for Health and Care       Excellence (NICE) guidance leading to sickle cell crises being defined as       an emergency condition (NICE,         2012).
