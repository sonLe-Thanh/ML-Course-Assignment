     The case-study reflects one aspect of the significance of Wilford's       extended research programme (see reference 1 in Section 3) on NI       devolution throughout the REF cycle, most recently in relation to reform       of the Assembly and the Executive which is the explicit focus of this       case-study.
Re (i) in Section 2: In relation to the Assembly, Wilford proposed: the       decoupling of Assembly constituencies from Westminster constituencies, as       in Scotland and Wales; a reduction in its membership to, preferably, 80       MLAs (from 108 members); a full-scale review of the Assembly's Committees,       including their number, size, the avoidance of both multiple committee       memberships and high rates of membership turnover, and their modus         operandi; and the designation of a number of `Committee days' in the       chamber.
What linked the recommendations is Wilford's research pointing to       the need to improve the efficiency of the Committees in ways that enhance       their capacity to subject the Departments to more effective scrutiny.
The AERC's response to the recommendations singled out their influence in       the first of its reports.
Regarding the reform of the committee system, it       noted:     `In particular, the Committee would highlight the written and oral         evidence provided by Professor Wilford as being particularly useful in         considering improvements to the effectiveness of the Assembly's         Committee System'.
It continued:     Following its consideration on this area, the Committee agreed that it         would be useful to share the views with the Chairpersons Liaison Group         of all Assembly Chairpersons...including the need for a fundamental         review of the Committee System'.
The Report was subsequently debated in the Assembly on 26 June 2012,       during which former Committee Member Conall McDevitt (SDLP) stated: `I         commend his evidence in the Report to colleagues in the House' (http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/Documents/Official-Reports/Plenary/2012/20120626.pdf,       p. 145).
A particular aspect of Wilford's impact, namely the proposed holistic       review of the Assembly's committees, was also endorsed by the Assembly's       two Clerk Assistants, Damien Martin and Nuala Dunwoody.
As Martin states:     `Your evidence to the Committee on the operation of the Committee         system helped to persuade the Committee to recommend a fundamental         review of the Committee system', while Dunwoody noted, `in the         final Report the Committee linked your evidence to its recommendation         that there should be a fundamental review of the committee system.
We         are now taking this forward under the stewardship of the Chairperson's         Liaison Group'.
(Sources 1 and 2)     Dunwoody added, in respect of the proposed reduction in the number of       MLAs:     `Obviously, your [research-based] evidence in relation to numbers and         your considered analysis of the impact of boundary changes was important         in that it provided evidence that the Committee needed for its report:         however, it was your challenge as a "critical friend" that had most         impact from my perspective in that it influenced members to turn their         minds to effectiveness'.
(Source 1)     Relatedly, Martin observes:     `The [research-based] evidence that you provided significantly         informed the development of options for reducing the number of Assembly         Members and decoupling of Assembly constituencies from Westminster         constituencies' (Source 2)     while Dr Gareth McGrath, Director of Clerking and Reporting observed:     `Your evidence to the Committee informed and helped shape the         development of options for reducing the number of Assembly Members.'
(Source 3)     John Stewart, the Director of Information and Outreach at the Assembly,       echoed these testimonies:     `Your evidence helped to persuade the Committee to recommend a review         of the committee system...the way you challenged Committee Members to         consider how they manage committee business and conduct themselves         during committee proceedings was particularly helpful.
Your thoughtful         analysis of the issues and role in the evidence session as a "critical         friend" was well-received by the Committee.'
(Source 4)     McGrath endorsed this judgement:     `Your evidence..challenged the Committee to think about         recommendations which considered the effectiveness of committees.
As a         result of this, the Committee's report recommended that there should be         a fundamental review of the committee system which I am currently         overseeing in conjunction with the Chairpersons' Liaison Group.'
(Source 3)     Re (ii) in Section 2: in respect of the Executive, Wilford's research       stressed the need to redesign the devolved Departments in a more strategic       and holistic manner.
(The input on this aspect of the review is       acknowledged in the Assembly Research Paper, NIAR 592-12, 4 September       2012, p. 26).
The Executive-related aspects of the AERC's inquiry were included in a       second report (NIA 34/11-15, 20 November 2012) that identified `areas of       commonality' among the parties.
These included agreement in principle on       the restructuring and reduction in the number of Executive Departments,       including the creation of a single Department of the Economy"which Wilford       had proposed"and the need to reform OFMDFM, one of his key       recommendations.
The Committee also agreed with Wilford's recommendation       to adopt a holistic approach to Executive redesign, rather than a       piecemeal/incremental one.
In early 2013, the Committee began the second-leg of its review,       addressing the use of d'Hondt, community designation and the enabling of       an Official Opposition in the Assembly.
Wilford furnished both written and       oral research-based evidence to the Committee in January and February       2013.
The full impact of Wilford's research-based evidence to this phase       of the review is yet to be determined: for instance, the referral to the       Liaison Group (comprising Committee Chairs) of Wilford's recommendation       that an holistic review of Assembly committees be undertaken is underway       and the report is scheduled to appear in late 2013.
In the interim, Simon       Hamilton MLA (now Finance Minister) acknowledged one other aspect of the       research:     `I have found your own contributions and submissions to the Committee         immensely useful and informative.
I found the point you made in your         submissions that we should carefully consider the possible need to have         a threshold of a minimum number of MLAs below which they would be denied         a formal Opposition role, very useful.
Your evidence brought this         potential issue out into the open and has been consistently debated and         discussed by the Committee in subsequent presentations' (Source 5)     This matter will be debated in the context of a Private Members Bill due       to be tabled in the Autumn of 2013, which includes the proposal to form an       Official Opposition in the Assembly.
