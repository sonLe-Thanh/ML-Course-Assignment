     The research results were presented at the RFU National Conference in       Warwick, May 2012.
This paper allowed the RFU to not only have clear areas       for referee development but also to gain a better appreciation of expert       performance in each of the components.
Feedback from this conference,       attended by the RFU national panel referees/coaches and assessors, enabled       further development of the model by the RFU's North West Referee       Development Manager.
The model has subsequently been implemented with the cohort of `National       Panel' referee coaches (15 - 20 individuals, who each work with national       panel referees over 1 or 2 seasons).
The initial findings from the       implementation are that:            For coaches, the model provides verification of their work, in terms         of content and delivery, and provides a basis for documenting their         work.
For referees in training, the model increases their confidence through         the model's reference to its foundation in research with `elite'         referees.
For the RFU, the model is serving as the basis for a curriculum for         referee coaching.
In particular, the model emphasises the importance of         paying attention to `off-the-field' issues associated with refereeing         (e.g.
psychological issues) as being just as significant for refereeing         as `in-the-game' issues.
In addition, the research into reflective practice and how to develop       on-field skills in the classroom has been used to inform the RFU's       approach as it currently works through the challenges of training mentors       and coaches to elite level to ensure a consistent approach.
The model provides a basis for further developments in referee coaching.
Researchers will be in consultation with RFU referees in January 2014 in       order to further develop the implementation of the model and discuss       on-going research into psychological skills for referees.
