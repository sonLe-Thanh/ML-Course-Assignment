     The research has raised awareness amongst stakeholders of how governance       has changed in recent decades, what the levers of influence are and how       public participation has been affected.
This shared understanding, and       platform for discussion, has been developed by engaging stakeholders from       the beginning.
During the pilot project (2009-10), Taylor contacted 60+       stakeholder organisations, whose input was also crucial to the success of       the oral history project (2010-11).
The research has at all stages       depended on co-operation with stakeholders, in particular the institutions       concerned with river governance, including the EA and PLA, and the many       community organisations &#8212; some very long established &#8212; that have an       interest in promoting the Thames and riverside environment.
Three key organisations have benefited directly:             The Museum of London Docklands (MoLD) holds the PLA archives,         a vast collection only partially catalogued.
Taylor produced         (2011-12) administrative histories for some key organisations from the         twentieth-century collection, to assist MoLD in cataloguing.
Promoting         access to the archive, much used by family and local historians,         facilitates public engagement in the history of the Thames and its port.
Taylor and Palmer gave a presentation alongside MoLD archivist         Claire Frankland to promote MoLD's river-related collections ('Beating         Heart of London's Business' Conference, Archives and Artefacts Study         Network AASN, MoLD, 03/2013).
The oral testimony collected by Taylor         has been accepted in principle by the Museum of London.
Port of London Authority: Taylor's Thames research led to her         appointment by the PLA as historical Expert Witness in the case of Port         of London Authority v Tower Bridge Yacht and Boat Company (High Court of         Justice, Chancery Division, 2012-13).
Her expertise was crucial to the         historical aspect of this case, which focused on a claim to rights to         moorings near Tower Bridge.
The role involved assessing historical         evidence and expert reports, producing an Expert Witness Report and         Joint Witness Statement, and appearing for cross-examination.
Environment Agency: EA staff have taken a keen interest in         the research, attending events in 2010, 11/2012 and 07/2013.
Their         Principal Officer for River Basin Planning (SE Region) considered the         project conference, 'One of the best ...
I have attended'.
Taylor         has been an observer on the EA's Thames River Basin Liaison Panel since         2010, commenting in this capacity on the Thames section of the EA's         draft 'Challenges and Choices' consultation document (03/2013).
As the         EA are seeking academic input into the consultation, she created a         database of academics interested in river management and publicised the         consultation by email (07/2013).
This publicity collaboration is         ongoing.
Taylor has been invited to join a steering group for an         EA workshop for river management students to share best practice and         research insights.
The project will therefore contribute to professional         development in this field.
Providing platforms for communication     Fora for stakeholders to exchange views:             Symposium: The River Thames, Stakeholders and Environmental           Governance: Past, Present and Future (04/2010) attracted 70         participants, including those from: PLA; Thames Water; City Cruises plc;         British Waterways; RSPB; Borough of Hounslow; Thames Estuary Partnership         (TEP).
http://www.gre.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/476844/Symposium-Report_Thames-Governance-2010-pdf.pdf         Conference: Running the River: How the Past Informs the Present         (07/2013) was attended by 50 participants including 25 from stakeholder         organisations.
Report available at:         http://www2.gre.ac.uk/about/schools/gmi/research/case-studies/running-the-river-thames         A workshop (11/2011) explored the experiences of environmental         stakeholders (eg Friends of the River Crane Environment, Quaggy         Waterways Action Group)         (http://www2.gre.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/687016/GMI-Stakeholder-Workshop-Report-v6.pdf).
A workshop (11/2012) was attended by representatives of         Consumer Council for Water, EA, Greater London Authority, Borough of         Southwark and PLA         (http://www2.gre.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/824572/Workshop-2-Report.pdf).
Taylor and Palmer participated in events organised by the PLA,       TEP, Thames Water and Demos think-tank.
Interaction between stakeholders and researchers has been facilitated by       a dedicated email address (runningtheriverthames@gre.ac.uk),       used primarily to disseminate project newsletters and reports (also       publicly available online).
The Twitter account https://twitter.com/ThamesGov       had 286 followers in 07/2013.
Raising public awareness     This research meets a public demand for more information on Thames       management.
A major project output is a web-based River Thames Research       Guide to the river's changing governance (1960-2013), research sources and       stakeholders.
Available at: www.gre.ac.uk/riverthamesguide.
Following a request from Demos, Taylor provided a 'Thames       Governance Guide' to aid the preparation of their 'Making More of the       Thames' seminars (Centre for London: 2011).
A guide was also requested by       the pressure group Thamesbank (07/2013) for a meeting with Richard Benyon       MP (DEFRA).
Taylor and Palmer have spoken about their Thames research to local       history and community groups, including: Docklands History Group       (11/2012); AASN (03/2013).
Taylor presented posters on the Thames       project for a local campaign gathering, 'The Hothouse: River Thames: Jobs       &amp; Climate' (at `Made in Greenwich', 07/2012).
