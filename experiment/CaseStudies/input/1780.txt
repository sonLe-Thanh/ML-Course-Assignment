     The need for new therapy     The current treatment options for patients with sickle cell disease are       blood transfusion,       anticoagulant, antiplatelet and thrombolytic agents, and hydroxyurea.
High-risk patients,       particularly children are treated with periodic blood transfusion.
This       therapy reduces       recurrent and initial stroke by over 80%.
Unfortunately, it is associated       with a high rate of       complications &#8212; transmission of infective agents, allo-immunisation,       transfusion reactions, and       iron overload.
Anticoagulant, antiplatelet and thrombolytic agents have       been used for the       prevention of stroke in children However, the efficacy of these drugs has       not been fully       investigated in randomised controlled trials and there is concern about       their safety.
Hydroxyurea       is prescribed for patients with moderate-to-severe sickle cell disease.
The long-term cellular       based therapy was developed to help prevent vaso-occlusive crisis and its       manifestation       particularly for sickle cell patients in sub-Sahara Africa.
Current beneficiaries and health impact     128 homozygous sickle cell patients have been on the treatment since 2010       and another 300       started to receive it in June 2012.
The impact of the therapy on health       and quality of life of the       patients has been remarkable.
This is manifested in significant reductions       in frequency and       severity of vaso-occlusive (painful) episodes and haemolytic (severe       anaemia) crises, blood       transfusion rate, number of hospitalisation and absence from work/school       due to sickle cell       related illness in the 428 patients.
Moreover, there has not been any       incidence of stroke in the       patients on the therapy, although it is a common occurrence in homozygous       sickle cell patients       in the clinic particularly in children.
Impact on policy     As the result of the compelling evidence of the efficacy of the therapy       and demand for the       medication by ever-increasing number of patients in Khartoum and elsewhere       in Sudan, the       Federal Ministry of Health set up a panel of experts consisting of       researchers, clinicians,       community health professionals and members of parliament to evaluate the       evidence.
On the       20th of December 2013, the panel published evidence-based       policy report which recommends       the integration of the therapy in the management package of sickle cell       disease in the country.
The Ministry has accepted the recommendation.
Impact on business     Efamol Limited, the UK company which formulated the tailored omega 3       therapy, so far, has       supplied for the patients 500,000 capsules free of charge.
At present, the       company is       discussing with the Ministry of Health to market the therapy in the       country at cost price.
