     The HapMap project has led to three areas of impact.
Firstly, it has made       an economic impact on biotech and diagnostic companies by facilitating the       introduction of new products and services, which have led to substantial       wealth creation for these companies since 2008 (the official release of       HapMap was 20 December 2007, see hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Secondly, the       project has led to a new diagnostic test that has been widely adopted that       can guide doctors and patients when considering drug treatment for       hepatitis C virus.
Finally, the project has had an impact on society by       increasing the public interest in, and engagement with, science.
Specific       details of these impact areas are as follows.
Economic impact: facilitating biotech companies to develop new         products     Prior to the HapMap Project, genetic variants at known locations in the       genome were typically analysed, in both research and clinical labs,       through small-scale experiments.
Such technologies did not scale (in terms       of cost or throughput) to genome-wide analysis.
The HapMap Project       demonstrated that most of the common genetic variation in the genome could       be `captured' through selected use of a few hundred thousand SNPs.
Realising the major potential for such genome-wide products, a number of       companies developed technologies for enabling massively parallel       genotyping.
These included Perlegen Sciences (which was awarded the       contract to genotype the Phase 2 SNPs for the project) and Illumina Inc.       (currently a NASDAQ listed company).
Products from Illumina Inc. were       specifically designed from the HapMap project (for example, the       HumanOmniExpress chip [A], [B]) so as to maximise the power of studies       using these `SNP chips' (a chip is a collection of microscopic DNA spots       attached to a solid surface).
Their customers include genomic research       centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical       research organizations and biotechnology companies.
The Associate Director       for Scientific Research at Illumina states [B] "This letter is to         outline the utility of the HapMap project as a vital resource for         developing the products used for genome wide association studies (GWAS).
The array portion of the GWAS market is estimated around $1.25 billion         USD over the past 5 years.
The data generated by the HapMap project was         the primary resource used to develop these arrays.
[...]         Illumina's current line of GWAS array products includes the OmniExpress         which consists of over 700k of SNP content derived solely from the         HapMap.
[...] Without the data available from the HapMap project         these arrays would be significantly less powerful for detecting regions         of the genome association".
The number of individuals genotyped       using chips that trace back to the HapMap project is well over 1 million       [C].
Health impact: Providing a framework for discoveries of genetic risk         factors that have made clinical impacts     The HapMap Project did not directly analyse the genetic contribution to       human disease.
However, it provided a framework for the wealth of       discoveries about the genetic contribution to common complex disease and       pharmacological risk via the GWAS approach.
Evidence of the success and       scope of GWAS is documented at the National Human Genome Research       Institute GWAS Catalog [C] which lists 1,449 published GWA in 237       different diseases and traits.
For many diseases GWAS has led to the       discovery of multiple disease genes.
These discoveries have led to a       greater understanding of the disease etiology, and functional work that       might lead to a clinical impact is still ongoing.
As one example, the       details of a GWAS discovery that has led to a substantial clinical impact       are given below.
A certain polymorphism of the IL28B gene was found in individuals       infected with the most common type of hepatitis C virus (HCV), HCV       genotype 1, to aid in identifying those patients who are twice as likely       to eliminate the HCV virus on a sustained basis when treated with       pegylated interferon-ribavirin combination therapies [D].
This study used       the Illumina Human610-quad BeadChip that was designed using the HapMap       resource.
A test for these genetic variants is sold by LabCorp [E, F] and used by       clinicians when treating HCV and in clinical trials.
HCV is the most       common chronic blood-borne infection in the US.
The Senior Vice President       for Science and Technology at LabCorp confirms [E] "I understand that         the Oxford team were key players in the HapMap project, which underpins         downstream genome-wide association studies, and that you are interested         in a practical example of where association studies have led to clinical         impact.
[...] The IL-28B test is a significant contributor to         the testing volume we do in the area of pharmacogenetics and has been         since its launch in 2010, continuing to today.
Recent estimates indicate         that an estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million people are affected by HCV annually."
Impact on society: widening the public understanding of human genetic         variation     The last ten years has seen a major growth in the public interest and       understanding of genetic variation, both in relation to disease, but also       more generally in relation to ancestry and origins.
The publication of the       first phase of the HapMap Project was widely reported in international       non-specialist media including, in the UK, interviews with Donnelly on       Newsnight and Radio 4's Today programme [G].
The contribution of the       HapMap Project was acknowledged in the House of Lord's report into Genomic       Medicine [H] (published in 2009; Donnelly was interviewed as part of the       committee enquiries), which in turn has resulted in the founding of the       Human Genomics Strategy Group [I], which advises the government and NHS on       how genomics can be integrated into a national healthcare programme.
