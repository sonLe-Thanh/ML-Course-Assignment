     In the UK, approximately 152,000 strokes cause around 50,000 deaths       annually; furthermore, 1.1 million stroke-related deaths are recorded in       Europe each year.
The resulting economic burden attributed to stroke in       the UK alone is &#163;3.75 billion.
University of Glasgow research has driven       improvements in management of patients with hypertension, exerting marked       influence on stroke prevalence and fatality by underpinning clinical       guideline recommendations and implementation.
Clinical guidelines for hypertension and stroke     The University of Glasgow's international reputation in hypertension and       stroke research has invited involvement in clinical guideline development       at the highest level.
Professor Anna Dominiczak &#8212; Regius Professor of       Medicine in the University's Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical       Sciences &#8212; held a key role on the Scientific Council for the 2013 European       Society for Hypertension (ESH) guidelines.
Lees currently serves as       President Elect of the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and was a       co-author of the 2008 ESO guidelines.
The University of Glasgow's       contribution to landmark studies on hypertension provided a strong       evidence-base that has informed both European and UK guideline       recommendations published since 2008.
2013 ESH/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) joint guidelines for         the management of arterial hypertensiona            The PROGRESS,1 ASCOT-BPLA,4 and LIFE6         studies are included in the key underpinning evidence (Table 16) used to         develop the `Summary of recommendations on treatment strategies and           choice of drug' (Section 5.2.3), which list a series of         hypertension treatment paradigms relating to ACE inhibitors,         calcium-channel blockers and ARBs.
The influence of PROGRESS1 in defining the clinical utility         of BP reduction in preventing recurrent stroke is highlighted by its         citation as one of only two to three references underpinning the         following recommendations: "Antihypertensive treatment is recommended           in hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or TIA even when           initial SBP is in the 140-159 mmHg range" and "In hypertensive           patients with a history of stroke or TIA, a SBP goal of &lt;140 mmHg           should be considered" (Section 16.10.4).
2008 ESO guidelines for management of ischaemic stroke and transient         ischaemic attackb            The BP-lowering effects of losartan demonstrated in the LIFE6         study are cited in the key underpinning evidence base for the following         recommendation to reduce vascular risk factors and prevent first-time         stroke (primary prevention): "Blood pressure should be checked           regularly.
It is recommended that high blood pressure should be           managed with lifestyle modification and individualized pharmacological           therapy (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence) aiming at normal           levels of 120/80 mmHg."
The value of the PROGRESS1 findings in demonstrating BP         reduction to prevent recurrent stroke (secondary prevention) is cited in         the evidence base to support the following: "It is recommended that           BP be checked regularly.
BP lowering is recommended after the acute           phase, including in patients with normal BP (Class I recommendation,           Level A evidence)."
Effective management of hypertension has the greatest impact on reducing       stroke incidence.
Consequently, national guidance documents that align       with international guideline recommendations play an important role in       influencing patient care at a local level.
Guidelines developed by the UK       National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish       Intercollegiate Guidance Network (SIGN) are instrumental in driving best       practice within the NHS.
2011 NICE guideline Hypertension &#8212; the clinical management of primary         hypertension in adultsc This guideline replaces NICE CG34       (2006), in which the findings ASCOT-BPLA4 and LIFE6       were extensively cited in the evidence synthesis for recommendations on       hypertension treatment strategies and algorithms (i.e.
preferential use of       ACE inhibitors or ARBs over &#946;-blockers).
The 2011 update (CG127) cites       PROSPER,1 ASCOT-BPLA4 and LIFE in the evidence base;6       furthermore, many of the original recommendations supported by University       of Glasgow research remain in CG127, testament to the enduring impact of       this body of work.
2008 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline 108         &#8212; management of patients with stroke or TIAd     SIGN has responsibility for development of evidence-based clinical       guidelines for use within NHS Scotland.
The SIGN 108 recommendations on       the secondary prevention of stroke draw directly on the University of       Glasgow research:            "All patients with a previous stroke or TIA should be considered           for treatment with an ACE inhibitor (for example, perindopril) and           thiazide (for example, indapamide) regardless of blood pressure,           unless contraindicated."
PROGRESS1 is cited in the         underpinning evidence for this Class A advisory on the secondary         prevention of ischaemic stroke.
"Lowering blood pressure (non-acutely) following ICH using a           combination therapy of ACE inhibitor and thiazide diuretic           should be considered to prevent further vascular events."
PROGRESS1 is cited in the underpinning evidence for this         Class A advisory on the secondary prevention of haemorrhagic stroke.
Uptake of UK clinical guidance     A 2010 NICE implementation uptake report evaluated national trends       following publication of NICE CG34 (2006).e Findings confirmed       a sharp drop in the prescribing of &#946;-blockers from 14% (July-September       2005) to 3% (April-June 2009), while use of ACE inhibitors rose from 27%       to 48% in the same period.
By June 2009, 75% of all newly diagnosed       hypertensive patients aged less than 55 years were prescribed either an       ACE inhibitor or an ARB.
In Scotland, SIGN takes a proactive approach to dissemination and       implementation of its guidelines.
Named individuals within each of the 14       regional Scottish Health Boards are recruited to promote new and updated       SIGN guidelines and to draw up plans for their subsequent implementation.
In the 2 months following publication, SIGN 108 was downloaded 66,150       times.f In addition, the following national strategies and       action plans draw on the recommendations of SIGN 108: i) Better Heart         Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan (2009) and ii) Clinical         Standards for Stroke Services (2009).f     The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is an incentive scheme for GP       practices providing financial rewards for patient care across multiple       disease domains.
Where available, QOFs are based on NICE and SIGN       guidelines.
The SIGN 108 and NICE CG34 guidelines are cited in the       2011-2012 QOF guidance on stroke and hypertension, respectively.
PROGRESS1       is cited in the evidence base for QOF stroke indicator 6 (secondary       prevention); around 85% of patients in England with a previous stroke       received treatment to target BP-lowering during 2011-2012.g
