     Note: numbers in superscript refer to the evidence cited in section 5         below            Our work has been crucial in reframing understanding of normal birth         for professional, governmental and service user organisations       Our programme of work, and specifically the Trent study, was catalytic         in changing the UK definition of normal birth.
A recent EU review of the         importance of knowledge creation in childbirth activism in Europe1         has stated:       `... it was a small number of childbirth activists (Beverley Beech,           Soo Downe, and Miranda Dodwell)... who were arguably the key           architects of the normal birth agenda, feeding statistical and           conceptual knowledge into the MCWP's [the national Maternity Care           Working Party] activities, and strongly influencing the NCT's           [National Childbirth Trust] position on these....(p10)       The report goes on to demonstrate how the UK definition of normal birth         was developed, and how it was taken up in the EU Peristat on routine         data collection for maternity care, and cites: ...'       `beginning to have routine data on normal birth also helped give...           something real....something you could measure....that was really           important.'
(p12).
Soo Downe was awarded an OBE for services to midwifery in 2011, partly         in recognition of this activity.
National guidelines groups have included our research in their           reviews The current NICE Intrapartum guideline2 cites         two of our studies (refs 47, 176).
The NICE CS guideline cites two         separate studies3 Both guidelines are central to practice in         the UK, and are used internationally.
Practitioners/professionals have used our research findings in           conducting their work, nationally and internationally The UK Royal         College of Midwives Campaign for Normal birth4         was catalysed by our Trent study.
Soo Downe was the founding Chair of         the Campaign, which is focused on midwives and on the need for the         midwifery profession to refocus on salutogenic approaches to normalising         childbirth.
The Campaign has produced ten top tips to maximise positive         physiological birth that are widely used by practitioners.
These have         been translated into ten other languages so far, based on requests from         overseas practitioners.
Voluntary groups have both influenced and been influenced by         our research.
As noted above, the definition of normal birth used by our         seminal study published in 2001 was based on that proposed by AIMS, a         service user group.
Recently, we have been funded by the Stillbirth and         Neonatal Death society (SANDS) to undertake a number of studies designed         to improve care in this area.
The findings are reported on the SANDS         website5, with plans to use them to influence more positive,         relationship based intrapartum care by professionals who encounter         parents who experience stillbirth.
Our work has influenced international professional policy debate.
There are a number of international Normal Birth Campaigns (for         example, in Portugal6) that are directly based on the RCM         Campaign for Normal Birth Our theories of saltutogenesis and complexity         and of positive relationship-based care underpin the iR4B EU COST           programme7 that we lead which is designed to         bring all maternity care up to the best standards in 21 countries in         Europe, and China, South Africa, Australia and Israel.
National and international public awareness of the benefit of         positive, relational based solutions for maternity care has been         catalysed by the extensive local, national and international media         coverage8 of our ongoing study of self-hypnosis for labour         pain (SHIP trial), by media interest in Carol Kingdons work around         womens choice for caesarean section, and by a DVD designed and produced         by Downe and Byrom, funded by the RCM, available on the RCM website, and         on YouTube.
Our research and philosophical approach has influenced professional           training for national and international practitioners through a           face to face and distance learning Masters modules for practitioners,         that attracts up to 20 people each time it is run.
Most of these people         are leaders in their fields locally.
These modules are based on our         research, and that of others working in the field.
Feedback from         students regularly reports changes in personal beliefs and practices in         relation to normal childbirth as a result of attending the module9.
Our international normal birth conference series is attended         by up to 200 practitioners, policy makers, and researchers annually.
It         has been run successfully in the UK, China, and Canada, and will take         place in Brazil in 2014, when up to 1000 attendees are expected.
As for         the normal birth module, feedback consistently highlights changes in         beliefs, and intention to make practice changes among delegates10.
