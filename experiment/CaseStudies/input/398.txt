     Since the late 1980s, port reform has been a key priority of governments       around the world, with the       privatisation of port services forming the cornerstone of these reforms.
The associated increase in       mechanisation of port work and rapid introduction of advanced       communications technologies       involves significant changes in the organisation of port labour and human       resources in ports.
These changes have often been accompanied by strikes and other forms of       industrial action,       leading to disruption to shipping, delayed investments and job losses in a       commercial sector which       "is critical to the conduct of global trade"5.1.
The EC       initially planned to deal with these issues via a       binding Directive, but through his research, Turnbull "persuaded the EC         that it could not legislate         better labour relations in ports, but by fostering social dialogue ...         could achieve the same end, and         in a more lasting form"5.1.
This work, together with the       high visibility of Turnbull's research on       industrial conflict, led the ILO to commission him to craft a guidance       manual for them to use to       promote organisational change in ports, where they see "a strong need         to strengthen the         constituents' capacity to perform social dialogue"5.2.
The ILO bring together representatives of       governments, employers and workers to jointly shape policies and       programmes promoting Decent       Work and Turnbull's "research provided the basis and intellectual         underpinning for what became       [their] Practical           Guidance Manual on Social Dialogue in the Process of Structural           Adjustments and Private           Sector Participation in Ports"5.1.
First published       in 2006 in English, French and Spanish and       with accompanying training materials, these guidelines provided the       pathway to impact from 2008,       which is described below.
Embedding social dialogue in the port sector       Changing practice: Feedback from participants at a 5-day       workshop led by Turnbull to validate       the Guidance Manual, suggested that country-specific training,       held in the nation's primary port,       would be the most effective way to embed social dialogue and thus       facilitate structural reform.
Therefore, a series of country-based social dialogue programmes was       implemented.
During the       summer of 2009, 5-day training workshops were held in three countries -       Bulgaria, Romania and       Croatia, as part of a project funded by the EC.
In each country, a Port       Sector Steering Committee       was established prior to the workshop, with membership from the state,       port employers and trade       unions, and this Committee coordinated local research and assisted with       the translation of the       Guidance Manual and training materials.
Nominated participants from       each of the social partners       then attended the workshops at which Turnbull acted as facilitator.
By       approaching the participants       as "research collaborators", rather than attempting to "lecture"       them, Turnbull engaged them "in a         discussion on how their own experiences fit with his modelling ..."5.1.
In this way he was able to       "effectively communicate complex issues ... and to trigger meaningful         debates"5.3.
Each country       subsequently produced a National Plan outlining their approach to social       dialogue, with nominated       representatives presenting the plans at a follow-up workshop.
All three       National Plans "highlighted         the quality of the training materials developed for the ILO National         Tripartite Workshops" and       expressed an intention to utilise both them and the Guidance Manual       going forward5.3.
This activity       was designed specifically to promote sustainability of the research       impact.
In feedback,       participants recognised one of the main benefits of the ILO Tripartite       Workshops was "the         opportunity it provided for social partners to interact"5.4,       emphasising the importance of Turnbull's       role as facilitator at these sessions.
A similar programme, funded by the       ILO's Latin American       regional office, was held in Peru in 20115.2.
Most recently,       the Guidance Manual was translated into       Arabic in anticipation of similar training projects in the Middle East.
The validation workshop was also attended by the Senior Port Specialist       of the World Bank, who       subsequently incorporated the principles and practices of the ILO Guidance         Manual into the       Second Edition of the World Bank's Port Reform Toolkit (Module 7       on Labour Reform).
Whilst first       published in 2007, this Toolkit continues to be widely used in       developing countries to facilitate       World Bank and International Monetary Fund sponsored programmes of       structural adjustment.
Influencing training: The greatest opportunity to bring       about positive change through social       dialogue exists with `win-win' topics such as health and safety, and       training, as these are areas that       can garner positive engagement from governments, trade unions, and       employer groups alike.
But,       for many years, "the absence of a framework of reference regarding         training requirements for port         workers has been an obstacle to engaging a discussion about needs and         possible common         interests for both employers and employees"5.5.
Building       on his research report for the ETF's study       of training and qualifications systems in the port sector, Turnbull's "contribution         to the development         of the ILO Guidelines on Training in the Port Sector was of particular         importance in removing this         obstacle"5.5.
In 2010, the ILO established an       International Working Group of Experts to oversee the       development of the Guidelines on Training, with membership from:       international, regional and       national port employer associations; international shipping lines; global       port operators; national port       employers; international union federations; national port unions; the EC       (DG MOVE); and national       port training organisations and institutes.
A major objective of this       project was to convince the       industry of the propriety of competency-based training which Turnbull's       research had shown to be       particularly beneficial.
To this end, several case studies were presented       by Turnbull at the first two       meetings of the Working Group, based on primary research in Australia,       Germany, Singapore,       South Africa and the UK.
At the third meeting in January 2011, Turnbull       presented his first draft of       An           International Assessment of Training in the Ports Sector which       provided "a background and         overview of ... different models of training"5.6; the       Working Group subsequently agreed to move       forward with competency-based training guidelines.
In April 2011, Draft       Guidelines on Training in the Port Sector, were drafted by Turnbull5.1, presented       and then approved by the Working Group,       with final revisions made by a `Tripartite Meeting of Experts' (November       2011)5.2 &amp; 5.7.
Members of       the Working Group were able to "closely cooperate with Prof. Turnbull         all along the negotiation         process that brought the adoption of the guidelines, a very significant         tool for the sector"5.3.
The       Guidelines on Training in the Port Sector were officially endorsed       by the Governing Body of the       ILO in March 2012 and thereby approved by all 185 member States; they have       since been       "adopted in sea ports as diverse as Singapore and Vancouver"5.1.
As well as improving efficiency,       application of the guidelines helps to improve the skills development of       workers, enhancing their       professional status and welfare.
Changing policy: As well as promoting democratic       participation and having a direct impact on the       practices of the social partners involved in the project itself,       Turnbull's research on the use of social       dialogue for promoting decent work has been "fully taken into account         in the context of the EU         policy making process", as evidenced by the Commission's recent       Communication on ports' policy       (COM(2013)295) which "re-affirmed the extremely powerful role of social         dialogue for management         of change, modernisation and the creation of better jobs"5.5.
The Commission "has already         expressed to the social partners its commitment to support that dialogue"5.5       and launched its       `Social Dialogue Committee for Ports' in June 2013, "built on         foundations laid by Prof. Turnbull"5.1.
"Covering labour relations in over 300 ports, and embracing some 1.5         million dockworkers, the new         EC Committee testifies to the lasting impact of Prof. Turnbull's         contributions" 5.1.
Sustained change: The degree to which the research has       become embedded in the       shipping/ports industry was recently illustrated in the details of one of       the projects identified by the       EC under the FP7 Cooperation Work Programme (Transport): "...another         project will address         sectorial changes and human issues, specifically needed skills, as a         component of wider efforts to         make EU ports more competitive and resource efficient."
According to       the EC, this project "should         support the implementation of the International Labour Organisation         Guidelines for Training of         Workers in the Port Sector ..."5.8.
Social dialogue in other sectors       The model for promoting social dialogue is based on generic best practice       and has a much wider       reach beyond its initial application to structural adjustment and private       sector participation in ports.
Road transport: The Guidance Manual was adapted for       a project       funded by the EC (2008/9) and       designed to strengthen the capacity of social partners in the road       transport sector in Bulgaria and       Romania to engage in effective and constructive social dialogue at       international, national and       enterprise level5.9.
Again, a series of tripartite workshops       were held and National Plans developed       and reviewed at a cross-fertilisation workshop5.10.
These       workshops were "important in bringing the         parties together and initiating a process of dialogue that has since         continued"5.3.
In this context,       effective social dialogue can promote and safeguard employees working and       living conditions at       acceptable European standards, and achieve efficient and competitive       operations for businesses.
Public service: Turnbull also "prepared materials to         provide training on labour dispute prevention         and resolution in the public service, specifically targeting the Former         Yugoslav Republic of         Macedonia ...
This tool was used in the workshop to launch ratification         of the Labour Relations in         the Public Service Convention, No.151 (1978) which took place in ...         July 2012.
It focussed on the         issue of trust in government institutions, which in the FYROM is the         lowest ... of 30 European         countries.
This tool helped achieve ratification of the Convention in         April 2013, because it showed         the participants how collective bargaining could be used to address the         trust gaps"5.2.
