     Context: Successive UK governments have sought to address the       spatial aspects of social deprivation, with programmes consistently       applying some form of area-based approach.
This requires policymakers to       identify where the most deprived areas are found.
Research into the       identification and classification of deprived areas has played a key part       in this process, and has been used to inform resource planning and       allocation at national, regional and local scales.
Pathways to Impact: In 1995 Robson and CUPS colleagues produced a       new and vastly improved deprivation index based on 1991 census data, which       they revised in 1998.
Subsequent indices were developed at the Social       Disadvantage Research Centre at the University of Oxford (2000, 2004,       2007) and then directly by the Department of Communities and Local       Government (DCLG) from 2010.
The indices all use the basic structure       developed at CUPS; as corroborated by DCLG "The subsequent evolution         of the Indices of Deprivation has involved a number of other experts and         advisors... but key elements remain as originally devised and structured         by Professor Robson and his team... Three elements of his initial         development of the Index have continuously been part of its structure:         the use of `domains'... the range of spatial scales at which deprivation         is measured; and the calculation of a matrix of types of measure...This         structure has valuably reflected the complex nature of the distribution         of deprived areas" [1].
The index is used by central government as a       mechanism to shape strategy, determine eligibility for specific funding       streams and focus regeneration spending and resource allocation within the       most appropriate areas.
Similarly, it is used by local authorities to       identify areas that would benefit most from special initiatives or       programmes.
The index, as formulated by Robson et al, has thus       continued to inform and structure work on the patterning and distribution       of deprivation across the UK, during the period 2008-2013.
Impact on Government: The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was       most recently published by the UK Government in 2010.
As DCLG's Analysis       and Innovation Directorate confirm: "The Indices of Deprivation (IOD)         have had major influence on Government policy....
Although it can be         hard to directly quantify impact, the IOD was a vital tool in making         decisions about the allocation of some &#163;3bn of public regeneration and         renewal funds from 2001...
The IMD was instrumental in determining         eligibility for such funds as the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund.
The         Indices continue to be used by various parts of central and local         government, and in public health, to identify places for targeting         resources, to set local strategies, and to monitor progress and the         impacts of interventions.
They are also integral to analysis in a number         of policy areas to understand local needs and challenges, and to explore         and tackle inequality.
IMD remains, in 2013, a valuable tool that         Government is maintaining and investing in" [1].
Robson's later DCLG work fed into the `National Strategy for       Neighbourhood Renewal' evaluation, with DLCG confirming that his "typology         of neighbourhoods based on their functional role in the wider geographic         area.... significantly improved the understanding of officials and         Ministers about how best to target regeneration spending, and informed         the development of new programmes and strategies to help the most         deprived areas in England &#8212; notably the &#163;1.5bn Working Neighbourhoods         Fund" [1].
Concurrently, CUPS research on the functional typology of       deprived neighbourhoods was cited in the 2008 DCLG consultation       `Transforming Places, Changing Lives: A Framework for Regeneration', which       used a draft version of [B] in its claim that: "Deprived areas are not         all the same and they can play differing roles within the wider         sub-regional economy.
It is therefore important to analyse the movement         of people into or out of an area as well as looking at the area overall"       [2].
The ensuing 2009 `framework' noting the role of government to ensure       investment is "driven at the right spatial level &#8212; and as close to         communities as is practicable... and; targeted &#8212; not trying to transform         everywhere &#8212; but investing where it will have most impact" [2].
Report [A] was also heavily cited in DCLG work on `population churn',       including a report which informed planning within the five London Boroughs       involved in the Olympic Games [2].
In 2013 Robson was invited (one of       three `experts') to advise the Welsh Government on updating their       `deprivation index'.
Local Authority Impact: A number of local authorities have used       the typologies generated from CUPS research to guide area programmes and       regeneration strategies; responding to both the DCLG consultation, and       accounts within trade journals and professional literature (e.g.
Robson's       article `Understanding the Ins and Outs of Deprived Neighbourhoods'; New       Start, 5/9/2008).
Robson has been contacted directly by several local       authorities to provide advice on the use and interpretation of the CUPS       typology.
Examples include Birmingham, Oldham, Sandwell, Glasgow,       Greenwich and Manchester.
A typical example of this kind of engagement can       be seen with respect to the Royal Borough of Greenwich, who used the CUPS       typology to further understand the character of deprived areas in       Greenwich, and neighbouring boroughs.
Pointing to the national       significance and applicability of CUPS research, Greenwich's Principal       Economic Development Officer confirms that that the research assisted the       borough in three key ways: "in developing an understanding           of the roles of deprived areas in Greenwich.
So for         example we were able to make a link between isolate areas and their high         levels of `worklessness'.
As a result we designed policies and projects         to target workless people in those areas.
We were also able to see the         benefits the Borough's housing policies had in developing transit areas         and the importance that these do exist... to develop the Work           and Skills Plan.
This was a major document setting out how         and where we will address low levels of skills and employment across         Greenwich particularly in deprived areas... to explain social mobility         in Greenwich in a strategic document entitled "Joint Strategic           Needs Assessment"... a statutory document Public Health         Authorities have to produce that will inform the commissioning of         medical provision across the Borough" [3].
Greater Manchester Impact: The CUPS typology has also played an       important role at the regional level, and was a key part of the 2009       Manchester Independent Economic Review (MIER) in which Robson was part of       a team led by AMION Consulting.
MIER was a major assessment of the       overall strengths, weaknesses and economic potential of Manchester,       commissioned by Manchester's Commission for the New Economy (now New       Economy) and launched in June 2008 by Secretary of State Hazel Blears and       Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling.
It formed part of the case       to Government, whereby Manchester was declared an agglomerated       city-region, and subsequently designated the first `combined authority'       (GMCA) across the 10 metropolitan boroughs that make up Greater       Manchester.
The review contained seven reports, including one on       `Sustainable Communities', in which Robson applied his typology of       deprived areas to the case of Manchester.
This report fed directly into       the subsequent Greater Manchester Strategy developed by the Association of       Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA).
As a partner at AMION Consulting       confirms, this strategy "set out its high-level response to the         fundamental policy challenges set out in the MIER.
Amongst the strategic         priorities were to improve life chances in the most deprived areas";       also summarising the value of Robson's contribution: "The research         involved... [the] application of a neighbourhood typology to         assess the different forms that deprivation can take in different         areas... establish[ing] a new typology for categorising deprived         neighbourhoods.
The approach was a core part of the final report.
It was         used to assist the interpretation of changes in deprivation indicators         and had significant implications for policy recommendations.
In         particular it helped identify that the `isolate' category of areas...         should be a particular focus for comprehensive area-based interventions.
The typology formed a key component of the Sustainable Communities         element of the MIER.
Furthermore, the Department for Communities and         Local Government (DCLG) has also made use of the typology to inform         policy considerations [4].
New Economy, now a wholly owned       company of GMCA responsible for sub-regional economic strategy, has also       substantiated the impact of MIER, and in particular the `new typology' it       presented, based on Robson's research.
Their Director of Economic Strategy       attests that: "Professor Robson played a key role in the study,         providing the thinking behind the actual typology, as well as advising         on the emerging policy options emanating from the work...
The review was         published in 2009 referenced in the Chancellor's budget of the same         year.
The review has provided the main platform of evidence which has         underpinned subsequent strategic developments in Greater Manchester; and         given additional credibility to the GMCA and New Economy" [5].
Further Impact: Robson acted as an advisor in 2010 to an Institute         for Public Policy Research North (IPPR North) project that used his       functional typology work to classify neighbourhood areas, considering why       some deprived areas within Northern England prospered ahead of others,       even when the surrounding economy was strong [6].
His work has also been       cited by both the Academy of Social Sciences and the Royal Geographical       Society as exemplars of impact, both documents noting the impact of this       work on decision making with regard to spending decisions in deprived       areas [7].
Robson also advised the think tank `Centre for Cities' on       `integration and isolation' [8].
