Public policy and service provision related to earthquake risk         reduction (Primary Impact)     Pathway: The research undertaken by the Edinburgh group led to the       appointment of Main, as the sole UK representative to the International       Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF), which       was established following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake.
The Findings and       Recommendations of ICEF were presented to the public in September 2009 [A]       and re-affirmed current practice in earthquake forecasting for civil       protection, including long-term planning for building regulation and the       lack of accurate prediction methods sufficient to justify general       evacuation.
Recommendations centred on the implications of statistically       significant but low absolute probability (&lt;1%) forecasts due to       earthquake clustering, along with the communication of uncertainty in risk       estimation, topics for which the underpinning research in Section 2 is       directly relevant.
The direct influence of Main's research work on their       appointment to the panel and its subsequent findings can be verified by       the chair of ICEF [B], as well as Main's co-authorship of the       subsequent peer-reviewed scientific report ([5], Section 3).
The       international profile of the ICEF report has then led to multi-national       developments in public policy and the provision of operational services       for earthquake forecasting (2011 &#8212; May 2013).
The ICEF report was also       cited in the UK government Foresight programme report (2012) on `Anticipation         of Geophysical Hazards' [C].
Significance and reach:            The Italian Department of Civil Protection (DPC) took the ICEF         recommendations seriously and acted quickly.
In a letter to the ICEF in         June 2012, the head of the Italian DPC wrote "many DPC activities           are descending from your findings and recommendations" which         include: "a ten-year research programme on operational earthquake           forecasting" and "one billion Euros in seven years were           allocated by the Italian Government for seismic prevention" [D].
The practical implementation of these commitments can be verified by         independent experts in Italy [E].
The letter also confirmed that         DPC had implemented "your suggestion to convene a special advisory           structure reporting to the head of DPC...while reorganising the           Commissione Grande Rischi, appointed by the Prime Minister" [D],         which will act to separate scientific advice from operational decision         making and risk communication.
The following countries have also made changes to policy and/or         service provision based on direct citation of the ICEF report.
In 2011 a         U.S. National Research Council report on National Earthquake Resilience         called for a program of operational earthquake forecasting [F]         and in 2012 the U.S. Geologic Survey began such a program [B].
In 2012, it was confirmed that: I) the "Russian Geophysical Survey           has begun a new project on earthquake forecasting in Kamchatka" [G]         and II) the Greek national authority for the co-ordination of         anti-seismic policy would undertake actions for the implementation of         the ICEF's recommendation.
In May 2013, a Japanese government task force         re-examined hazard mitigation policy for large earthquakes along the         Nankai trough [H].
Public engagement with, and understanding of, earthquake risk science         (Secondary Impact)     Pathway: Following the L'Aquila disaster, legal proceedings were       begun against the officials involved in communicating the earthquake risks       and the subsequent trial (in which the ICEF report was cited in evidence       by the defence team) generated much media discourse.
Main contributed to       the public understanding of these complex issues by discussing them in a       range of international media and a sustained series of engagements with       various BBC radio and online programmes.
Significance and reach: Following on from a BBC Radio 4 `Material       World' programme in 2010, Main has participated in two other BBC Radio 4       programmes, `More or Less' and `Today' (Radio 4 has a UK reach of up to       10.98M in quarterly 2013 Radio Joint Audience Research figures) and a BBC       News Website (circulation ~30M) piece on the topics of L'Aquila and       scientific assessment and communication of risk [I].
