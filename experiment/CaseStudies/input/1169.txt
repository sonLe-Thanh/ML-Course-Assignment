     In 2005, Eden Farm Ltd approached DUBS (along with the Durham Engineering       Department who recommended various measures for business reengineering in       parallel research) as an Associate in the Knowledge Transfer Partnerships       (KTP) Scheme run by Durham University.
In its KTP Grant Application and       Proposal Form (Evidence 1), the company stated: "Eden Farm lacks an       understanding of current thinking, best practice and methodologies which       lead to difficulties in applying modern tools and techniques within the       operations and finance aspects of the business.
The opportunity in finance       [i.e.
directly relevant to this DUBS case study] is to undertake detailed       analyses including cost base analysis, product analysis, customer analysis       and distribution route analysis to create an advanced financial model to       underpin the strategic finance plan for the future of the organisation"       (p.2/3).
DUBS stated in the same document that it undertook to "work on       introducing [for Eden Farm] new systems for multi-layered financial       modelling and strategic financial planning through:            Understanding the cost base       Creating a coherent data set for Eden Farm to allow analysis and         tracking of the cost base relating to                supplier, product and stock keeping unit         customer performance         distribution              Developing a methodology for creating, and introducing, a         multi-layered Financial Modelling and Scenario Planning to meet the need         of this complex business.
Introducing Strategic Financial Planning techniques and developing a         Strategic Financial Plan to underpin long term investment decisions in         the company, documenting processes and training finance staff and         management to use the modelling and strategic financial planning         processes" (p.3).
DUBS also undertook to provide Eden Farm with "[r]obust financial       analysis systems and coherent data set creation along with regular       tracking and monitoring of the cost base [that] will provide            Improved management information and a basis for negotiation with         suppliers and customers.
The ability to price goods more accurately and thereby raise margins       Maximise bonus and discount payments from suppliers by optimising         minimum order levels and sales volumes       Development and implementation of the multi-layered financial model         will support Scenario Planning to underpin risk assessment in a highly         competitive market       Strategic financial planning will underpin major financial decision         making such as investments in new premises and staff development in the         medium to long term.
Key staff trained on use of the financial analysis, modelling and         strategic planning techniques (p.3)          This research-based consultancy was conducted between March 2006 and       March 2008, and used the principles set out in Reference 1 and 2.
For       example, Eden Farm implemented a system of strategic cost analysis, which,       following reference 2 is: "important as it allow[s] a greater level of       understanding of the behaviour of direct and indirect costs" (p.277) The       final KTP report (Evidence 2) produced in March 2008, allowed Eden Farm       Ltd to implement fully the recommendations.
Indeed, in evidence 2, the       company stated (on a scale of high to nil) that the significance of the       results of the KTP to the company's present and future performance were       both "high" (Evidence 2, p.6).
And in terms of the impact of the       specifically accountancy research (as opposed to the reengineering       research) on the operation of the company, Eden Farm stated that they had       changed their approach to the management of resources: "[t]he procedures       and controls implemented within the areas of stock pricing, promotions and       claims have successfully been transferred to two new members of staff.
Advanced use of Excel has been introduced into the company which has       enhanced reporting and use of data to support decision making.
Deeper       understanding of pricing structures has enabled the company to win and       retain larger accounts through offering promotions to key accounts, as       well as getting the price right first time.... the enhanced IT systems       have improved accounting processes which are now in use on a daily basis"       (Evidence 2, p.3).
Hence, from early 2008, DUBS research had an impact by       also developing and improving Eden Farm Ltd's work process and workplace       practices.
In terms of better access to financial opportunities, in the final KTP       report, Eden Farm also stated that additional pre-tax profits (i.e.
those       which have been affected by the improvements resulting from the KTP) were       expected to total &#163;500K by the end of 2008.
The company also predicted       increased profits over the next 3 years of &#163;1,500K as a direct result of       the KTP project.
Indeed, the company also stated that the "long term       strategy for Eden Farm is to increase turnover to &#163;30m by 2010.
This is       equivalent to a 20% growth year on year.
The improvements and         recommendations resulting from the KTP will allow this target to be         achieved" (p.5; our italics).
Such predictions are broadly in line       with actual results.
In information available from Companies House (see       evidence 3) the following changes are recorded:     Table 1: Eden Farm Turnover and Profits                                &#160;Date of Accounts           &#160;2011           &#160;2010           &#160;2009           &#160;2008                             &#160;Turnover (&#8216;000 GBP)           &#160;38,344           &#160;32,567           &#160;26,618           &#160;22,295                             &#160;Gross profit (&#8216;000 GBP)           &#160;6,540           &#160;5,287           &#160;4,922           &#160;4,131                          As Figure 1 shows, a significantly steeper, upwards turnover-gradient       started for Eden Farm from 2008 (i.e.
at the end of the DUBS research       project).
It also shows that this rise was not mirrored in trends       within the sector (where turnover flat-lined during the same period).
A       similar trend can be seen in Figure 2 in respect of gross profit.
Eden       Farm's results were all the more impressive given that the North East of       England was the region hardest hit by the economic downturn that started       in 2008.

This was not only in terms of growth &#8212; Eden Farm has been in the Ward       Hadaway Journal Fastest 50 Growth Companies* for three consecutive years       following the KTP ... but also through a turn around in company       profitability.
... New processes and procedures were introduced ... as a       consequence to improve our performance.
These met with considerable       success            Improved management information;       Better understanding of current thinking and best practice         methodologies ...          We are very grateful to Durham University for this platform building work       and the ongoing dialogue and support [Dixon has met the CEO annually since       2008 to provide advice on the company's finances, accounting systems and       strategy] since then."
*A league table of companies in the North East of England produced by law       firm Ward Hadaway; see evidence 4 for the announcement of the 2010 award       in The Journal, Wednesday October 13th 2010 &#8212; the third       year that Eden Farm featured.
Taken together, the data in Figures 1 and 2, along with Eden Farm's       specific predictions (in the KTP final report) and its current analysis       (in the testimonial), suggest that the DUBS research which introduced       strategic cost analysis and improved accounting and other practices was       also highly likely to have had a secondary impact from 2008 &#8212; i.e.
it also       increased Eden Farm's turnover and profits.
In both basic measures &#8212;       turnover and gross profit &#8212; not only has Eden Farm experienced an increase       in absolute terms, but also in its rank among the comparison group.
In       each case, during the REF period, Eden Farm has improved from below to       above the median &#8212; i.e.
from the bottom 50% to the top 50%.
(The detailed       data, the sources from which it was obtained and the methods used in       constructing the comparison groups are detailed in Evidence 3).
Furthermore, the student who worked with Dixon on the KTP featured in the       KTP awards for 2008 because he "has had an instrumental role in       establishing profitable avenues, and adapting to new challenges for the       company" (Evidence 5).
In summary, the impact of DUBS research has been very significant for       Eden Farm Ltd.
It led directly to the company developing and improving the       effectiveness of many of its working practices.
These improved practices       are very likely also to have had a secondary impact &#8212; a sector-beating       increase in turnover and gross profit.
Furthermore, the case study also       demonstrates the potential relevance of DUBS research for the future       development of management accounting and other financial systems in other       contexts.
Companies similar to Eden Farm &#8212; of which there are many       hundreds in the UK alone &#8212; may well be able to benefit in the same sorts       of ways, suggesting the potential reach of future projects based on       similar underpinning research is substantial.
