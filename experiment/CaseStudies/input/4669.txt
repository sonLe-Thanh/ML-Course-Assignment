     How research was exploited       The research and landslide mitigation methodology was delivered using a       systems engineering, structured development process, from concept [6] to       delivery of construction on the ground (Table 1).
The systems engineering       approach required coordination not just within the public sector, but also       between the public sector, civil society and the private sector; it       integrated efforts not just vertically within a sector, but horizontally       across sectors and geographically within a country.
Early evidence of the       uptake of the methodology is provided by the St Lucia Government Cabinet       Conclusion #618 of 12 July 2004, which formalised the role of MoSSaiC       Management Committee within Government.
As a result of MoSSaiC project       impact in the Eastern Caribbean, in September 2009 The World Bank approved       funding for Anderson and Holcombe to author a book on the methodology to       make it more widely available [a].

2 World Bank incorporates             MoSSaiC methodology in             disaster mitigation projects           World Bank funds St Lucia Second Disaster Mitigation             project 2009-2011, incorporating MoSSaiC approach to             landslide risk reduction in a further six communities [b].

Details of the beneficiaries       Since 2008, the MoSSaiC methodology has benefitted 12 communities,       totalling approximately 3000 inhabitants, across St Lucia, Dominica and St       Vincent and the Grenadines.
In 2011, it was introduced to Jamaica through       a programme of community-based projects costing US$2.37M, funded by the       World Bank and implemented by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and       Emergency Management [e].
Details of the nature of the impact and indicators       The methodology works: there have been no reported landslides in       any of the communities in which MoSSaiC interventions have been completed       [2].
The Latin America and Caribbean Regional Disaster Risk co-ordinator       at the World Bank comments: "In the aftermath of Hurricane Tomas         (October 2010), there were numerous landslides in St. Lucia due to the         extreme rainfall.
None were reported in any of the communities with         MoSSaiC interventions.
This positive proof of the powerful results...         has motivated St. Lucia to scale-up the initiative nationwide, and to         institutionalize it" [f].
In addition, it has been noted that these       communities "used to be affected by substantially weaker events in the         past" [g].
The methodology pays: it has a benefit-cost ratio of 2.7:1 [2,h].
In this study, the development and application of an integrated landslide       risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis methodology was grounded in data       acquired at this community scale &#8212; overcoming some of the methodological       issues regarding scale, data availability and process representation and       allowing the degree of landslide risk (and risk reduction) to be       quantified.
Conducting a survey of community benefits, using both revealed       preference and stated preference (contingent valuation) methods, allowed       estimation of indirect project benefits.
These indirect benefits to the       community were shown to be significant and included: lower water bills       through the harvesting of intercepted rainwater from rooftops; improved       access to and from the community due to reduced flooding and associated       debris on footpaths; and therefore fewer days of work missed and less time       spent clearing debris.
In St Lucia, these benefits were valued at       EC$12,705 annually [2].
In addition, over 80% of programme funds were       spent in the communities [c] with, for example, 25 local people employed       on the project.
The methodology is being scaled up by The World Bank: Funding was       awarded for development of the functional and technical specification of       an online interface to MoSSaiC resources.
The interface will give       structured access to the MoSSaiC book, and technical and project       management tools; allow development agencies and governments to design and       deliver landslide risk reduction projects; provide training modules for       the local teams delivering the landslide hazard reduction measures; and       include relevant calculators and tools for slope stability assessment and       drainage design.
The combination of the ePractice user mode, user types,       content and functionality are particularly novel and innovative.
It is       anticipated that the interface will become a template for other resources       in the field of Disaster Risk Management knowledge transfer both at The       World Bank and elsewhere.
The specification was completed and signed-off       in June 2012 and will be built by and hosted with World Bank funding (for       which an agreement is in place).
Creating a state-of-the-art interface for       all MoSSaiC resources, bespoke for each audience type at a site funded and       hosted by the World Bank, will enable global reach of the methodology, and       maximise impact in the period 2011-2014 beyond the current levels of       recognition [b].
In addition, the World Bank is translating the book into Spanish (in       2013) and is establishing a `community of practitioners' in Latin America       and the Caribbean to roll out the methodology within the region.
The World       Bank comments that "given this context of apparent success [in St.       Lucia], the World Bank sees the potential to encourage uptake of the         methodology more widely.
To that end the Bank is publishing           in December 2012 the book `Community-based landslide risk         reduction &#8212; managing disasters in small steps'... [and] a Spanish         translation of the book will later be published by the Bank" [f].
CHASM software recognition: CHASM software is recognised       internationally as `industry standard', with the US-based Scientific       Software Group marketing the software since 2000 [i], achieving CHASM       sales in more than 17 countries worldwide.
In 2010, CHASM was awarded the       Grand Prize at the Random Hacks of Kindness#1 software event at       Microsoft, Washington DC [b].
