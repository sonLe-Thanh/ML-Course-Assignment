     The underpinning research has informed three main pathways to impact :       the promotion of a major       public debate; informing parliamentary reform and the promotion of public       engagement; the       delivery of a major impact on parliamentary outreach both nationally and       internationally.
The Promotion of a Major Public Debate     In a period in which defending politics &#8212; and therefore politicians &#8212; is       a highly unfashionable       endeavour, the work of Hay and Flinders has promoted wider public       engagement through, for       example, the written and broadcast media: Flinders' Defending Politics       was the subject of a BBC       Television BOOKtalk programme and both Hay and Flinders have taken       their arguments to a wider       audience through invitations to literary and book festivals: Hay was       invited to the Gothenburg       literary festival while Flinders spoke at the Holland Park literary       festival with the Speaker of the       House of Commons, John Bercow, discussing why politics still matters in       the century of       'disaffected democrats' and political disillusionment.
Flinders also spoke       at literary festivals in       Edinburgh and Cheltenham.
In addition, ESRC-funded research involving Hay       informed an event in       the Houses of Parliament with the Hansard Society that presented the Audit       of Political       Engagement 9, Part 1: Media and Politics on which Hay advised.
In June       2012, Hay working with       the Hansard Society used data arising from ESRC-funded research to       underpin a submission of       evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into Press Standards that clearly       demonstrated the negative       impact of tabloid readership on attitudes towards politics among citizens.
This evidence fed into       broader campaigning by Lord Puttnam who, referring directly to the       evidence presented by Hay       with the Hansard Society to the Leveson Inquiry, commented that: `I       believe our developing       concept of a duty of care should be extended to "a care for our shared but       fragile democratic       values".
After all, the absence of a duty of care within many professions       can amount to accusations       of negligence and, that being the case, are we really comfortable with the       thought that we are       being, in effect, negligent in regard to the long term health of our own       democracies and the values       that underpin them?
For those that remain in doubt the clearest possible       case is made out in the       Hansard Society's recently published Audit of Political Engagement 9, Part       2: Media and Politics'       [S1].
Further evidence that this strand of engaged scholarship has influenced       political and public       debates came in May 2010 when the Leader of the House of Commons, Sir       George Young, cited       Flinders' research and writing in his inaugural speech and noted `In a         recent speech "A Defence         of Politics" &#8212; a title which has a famous lineage, leading back ....         through Tony Wright and         originating, of course, with Bernard Crick &#8212; the Professor of Politics         at the University of         Sheffield, Matthew Flinders, said that, "the public hankers after a more         optimistic, balanced         and informed account of politics".
I agree'.
[S2].
The reach and significance of the debate was intensified during the       Autumn of 2011 as a result of       Flinders' three-part series &#8212; In Defence of Politics &#8212; on BBC       Radio 4 that attracted a listening       audience in excess of 1.7 million [S3].
Referring to Flinders'       research and a meeting with him at       the BBC, Alistair Campbell wrote on his blog that it is: `heartening to       find an academic willing to put       his head above the parapet and swim against the tide of negativity that       flows from the building in       which we sat'.
Hay and Flinders continue to use their research as the       basis for practitioner and       public interventions.
Flinders' research and writing also formed the basis       of invited submissions of       evidence to, inter alia, the Committee on Standards in Public       Life, the Independent Parliamentary       Standards Authority [S4], the Lords Committee on the Constitution [S5] and       the Political and       Constitutional Reform Select Committee.
Contributions have been made by       Flinders to a vast       range of public events.
Highlights include a presentation `Defending       Politics' to the Royal Society of       Arts, the video of which has attracted more than 5300 Youtube views and       more than 300       participants in on-line debates (as of October 2013).
During a plenary       event at the PSA annual       conference in Belfast in April 2012 the Speaker of the House of Commons,       John Bercow, praised       Flinders' contribution to promoting public engagement and the public       understanding of politics [S6]       and, later that year, Flinders received the Communicator of the Year       award from the Political       Studies Association of the UK.
Parliamentary Reform and Public Engagement     Since publication in 2002 of his article `Shifting the Balance?
Parliament, the Executive and the       British Constitution' [winner of the Harrison Prize for Best Article in Political         Studies] Flinders has       maintained an active relationship with a range of select committees and       more recently with the       Liaison Committee (the committee made up of the chairs of all the select       committees).
In 2012       Flinders was invited to contribute to the Liaison Committee's review of       `the effectiveness,       resources and powers of select committees' and used this opportunity to       promote a specific       argument about the need for select committees to reach out more broadly       and play a more       vigorous role in promoting the public understanding and accessibility of       politics.
He was the only       witness to make such an argument and pressed his case whilst giving oral       evidence to the full       committee on 23 February 2012.
In November 2012 the Committee published       its final report [S7]       and drew from Flinders' arguments that emphasised the dual role of       committees: first, to hold the       executive to account; and, secondly, to promote public understanding of       politics.
This then formed       the basis for a new `core task' for all select committees:     `PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT &#8212; Task 10: To assist the House of Commons in better         engaging with         the public by ensuring that the work of the committee is accessible to         the public' (HC 697,         paras.
15-17).
In attesting to Flinders' impact on public engagement by select       committees, the Senior Policy       Analyst to the House of Lords Constitution Committee has stated that       Flinders' `impact is         characterised as much by its breadth as by its depth ... Flinders         contribution to the work of         parliamentary select committees extends well beyond the Constitution         Committee.
He has         made a number of invited submissions, both oral and written, to all the         key House of         Commons committees ...The fact that Prof. Flinders was invited to give         oral evidence to the         Commons Liaison Committee is particularly indicative of the high regard         with which he is         held' [S8].
Flinders also authored the guidance document for social       scientists who want to engage       with Parliament and Select Committees that now forms part of the ESRC         `Impact Toolkit' [S9] and       that has also been adopted by a range of other professional associations       (e.g.
the Campaign for       Science and Engineering).
Impacts on parliamentary outreach     The final layer of this case study extends beyond the University of       Sheffield to deliver impact on       the outreach and educational activities of parliaments in the UK and       internationally.
This impact       links back to work by Hay and Flinders' by encouraging students of       politics to directly engage both       with practitioners and with modes of parliamentary governance.
In 2012, after twelve months of negotiation and co-operation with the       Speakers of both the House       of Commons and the House of Lords, the University of Sheffield launched       the first ever       undergraduate module to be formally accredited and co-taught by the         Houses of Parliament.
Seminars are led by a combination of senior parliamentary staff and former       or retired MPs and       ministers.
Instead of a standard essay, students are required to produce a       `memorandum of       evidence' for a hypothetical select committee inquiry.
The module has been       highly successful.
For       example, eight students have received `parliamentary studies' scholarships       from the Higher       Education Academy.
In November 2012 the Speaker of the House of Commons       announced his       decision to extend this Sheffield-led initiative across the UK and, in       January 2013, fourteen other       universities were selected to offer the module for the 2013-14 academic       year.
The Sheffield-based       pilot has had a major impact on reinvigorating the study of Parliament       across the UK.
The Head of       Public Information and Outreach at the Houses of Parliament notes the       impact on parliamentary       outreach as: `the module provides a positive opportunity for         parliamentary staff to travel         across the UK to promote the study of parliament ...Parliamentary staff         are therefore         engaging with academics in new ways' [S10].
This impact is now       extending internationally with       the module being delivered by: the University of Hong Kong and the       Legislative Council of Hong       Kong; the University of Sydney and the Parliament of New South Wales; and       between Murdoch       University in Perth and the Parliament of Western Australia.
Recognition       occurred in 2013 at the       ESRC's national `Celebrating Impact' competition at which Flinders won         a prize in the category         `Impact Champion'.
To conclude, the impact of this research is a set of demonstrable         reforms, initiatives and         innovations that range from policy-specific or impacts on parliamentary         outreach to far         broader `public engagement' and `relevance-based' achievements.
Each       can be traced back       to underpinning research by Flinders and Hay.
This impact demonstrates a       contemporary       manifestation of the long-standing commitment of the Department of       Politics at the University of       Sheffield to engaged scholarship.
This distinctive research and associated       high-level and extensive       impact has effectively bridged politics as theory and politics as         practice at a number of levels.
On       the basis of the success of his earlier programme, Flinders was       commissioned in May 2013 by       BBC Radio 4 to write and present a second programme on the theme of       political literacy and       understanding focusing on the impact of political comedy and satire on       young people.
This project       &#8212; Joking Apart?
&#8212; involves interviews with leading writers,       comedians, politicians and       commentators, including in the United States, Italy, Australia and the UK,       investigating the role of       satire and comedy as a political medium.
