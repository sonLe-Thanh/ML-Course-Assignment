     A broad range of beneficiaries, some from quite disparate domains, have       engaged with the body of       research described in section 2.
In part this is a product of the       pro-active approach taken to       maximising the scope and depth of benefits generated by the unit's       research, described in REF3a,       section b; it also reflects the transformative nature of Currie's       research into narrative and character.
Consequently, mental health care and education are two key       domains to have benefited from the       research, and we also note that the research has stimulated public         debate to a significant degree.
The different beneficiaries (in all we report 6; 4.1-4.6) indicate the       far-reaching applications of the       body of research.
Context: Mental Health Benefits       Since 2008, Staff at Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital (AWCH) have       used Currie's work in       order to support an approach to the treatment of mental health issues       which mental health       practitioners believe to have beneficial outcomes for patients.
The       research has also influenced a       training programme, the purpose of which is to educate mental health       practitioners in the use of this       treatment method.
[5.1]     The approach taken to mental health issues emphasises building narratives       as the most ethically       responsible way to work with young people.
To give some context: during       the period 2008-2012       AWCH had 24,045 Outpatients and 1,812 Inpatients.
[5.1]     4.1 Benefits for Mental Health Care Patients       Research findings [3.1 &amp; 3.2] were embedded into care programmes at       AWCH, by Jureidini, where       he continues to work in the area of Psychological medicine.
This research       suggests a different       approach to treatment and patient care; the patient is encouraged to talk       to their physician (or a       confidante) about their feelings in order to challenge the dominant       narrative.
For example, a young       patient with externalizing disorders (i.e., attention-deficit       hyperactivity disorder, conduct problems)       might perceive their disruptive actions as products of their own       characters (a story with emotional       appeal and coherence), rather than seeing these actions as legitimate       responses to particular       circumstances (e.g., parental break-up).
This treatment path trades upon       the notion that certain       psychotic states are "disorders of narrative".
Where appropriate, this       "narrative" that patients `tell       themselves' can be challenged.
Currie's research has been integral to       this: "We rely on Currie's         work to support our emphasis on building more authentic narratives as         the most ethically         responsible way to work with young people" [5.1]     This approach to patient care, developed using Currie's collaborative       research with Jureidini, is       taken to have very specific benefits.
According to the former Head       of Psychological medicine at       AWCH, there is no evidence in favour of medication or specific forms of       psychotherapy as the best       means with which to engage some types of patient.
However, `"[t]hrough a       combination of `watchful       waiting' and physical and emotional rehabilitation, physicians may be         able to actively intervene         without reliance on medication or formulaic psychotherapy".
[5.1]       4.2 Training for Mental Health Care Professionals     Also since 2008, a training unit has been developed, and it serves to         help spread the         influence of Currie's research.
The unit is the Paediatric Mental       Health Training Unit (PMHTU);       the training portfolio delivered there, and developed by Jureidini, uses       findings from his       collaborative research with Currie.
As noted: `PMHTU is quickly building         a strong profile         meaning that narrative approaches developed with Currie are influencing         a wide range of         practitioners'.
[5.1]     More than 300 members of staff (including medical students, general       practitioners, allied health       professionals, teachers and counselors) have been trained (for at least 6       hours, each) in the use of       a care model that seeks to explore young people's distress with the aim of       developing a narrative       that explains their predicament.
[5.1]     Context: improving confidence and attainment for school children       Seeking to apply Currie's body of research in a different domain, in 2011       the unit used existing links       with local schools to translate the research into workshops on narrative       and character for primary       school pupils.
The workshops helped develop children's understanding         of character and story         writing, improved their confidence, and instilled in them a desire to         read.
Similar workshops       for secondary-age pupils had substantial effects upon student         attainment at the IGCSE.
4.3 Primary School Improvement       Insight into character and its role in narrative was seen as especially       valuable to children looking to       construct compelling and vivid narratives for themselves.
Workshops on       narrative were designed.
Their aim was to teach children about Currie's research findings:       specifically, about the important       role that character plays in narrative, by character adding to the       coherence of the narrative and       enriching the connections between events.
The sessions also taught       children that fictional       characters need not be like real people to do this, and that it often aids       the narrative if they are not.
Feedback from the sessions attests to their success in raising authorial       confidence.
A teacher notes       that, `[the] project has not only developed my children's understanding         of character and         story writing but, most importantly, instilled in them a love of         literature and a desire to read'.
[5.3] Children themselves reported benefits: most of those surveyed were more         confident that         they understood why interesting characters are important to stories       than they were before, and       they felt that they had learned something that would help them to         write a better story.
[5.4]     4.4 Influencing School Curricula       Teacher-training sessions delivered to teachers from 5 schools in December       2012 led to three of       the Primary schools feeling able to run the sessions&#8212;described as       `Thinking Space' sessions&#8212;in       school straight away.
Teachers from two special schools who attended also       found the workshop       valuable for further encouraging thinking skills and open ended thought.
[5.2] The training sessions       were designed to show-case to teachers how to deliver the workshops       created by the unit,       explaining how they were built around philosophical research, and looking       to articulate the value of       that research to the teachers.
4.5 Secondary School Attainment       To help pupils prepare for their English IGCSE a more advanced version of       the workshop on       narrative was designed in collaboration with a local Secondary       School&#8212;Nottingham University       Samworth Academy (NUSA)&#8212;which had substantial effects upon student         attainment at the       IGCSE in June 2013.
26 of the students attending declared themselves more         confident in their       understanding of the role of character in narrative; 25 that responded       that they had learned         something that would help them with their GCSE.
[5.4] Their teacher       said that `Results show       that pupils had made considerable achievement at this stage in their         learning.
The         intervention ... played a significant role in this success.'
By       using research to explain the       benefits of creating unrealistic characters, the University of Nottingham       staff enabled pupils to       produce imaginative coursework that showed a greater level of maturity in       their writing.'
[5.5] NUSA       have taken the decision to run the workshops on an annual basis, to       support their students, such       was the success of the programme.
[5.5] This reflects a substantive         change to their curriculum.
Context: The Influence on Public Debate       Issued by the University of Nottingham in 2011 [5.6], a press release used       Currie's research to       explain the appeal of the Harry Potter series and thereby stimulated         wider debate within the       press, and provoked considerable social media engagement with Currie's         research.
Specifically, it drew on two of Currie's claims: that character adds a       great deal to narrative, even in       the absence of real character in the world itself, and       that fictional characters need not be (indeed,       should not be) at all like real people in order to play the       role required of them in successful       narrative.
The press release builds on this insight in order to argue that       it is Potter's character that       ultimately drives the success of the franchise.
4.6: Stimulating Public Debate       The Daily Telegraph subsequently (2011) published a report on       Currie's research.
It was tweeted       47 times, linked to on Facebook 61 times and `shared' a further 108 times       [5.6].
Following on from       this, a second article in the Daily Telegraph (2012) discusses       Currie's view on the Potter series.
This second article was tweeted 65 times, linked to on Facebook 356 times       and `shared' a total of       421 times.
The latter piece is also cited in an article in the Times         Higher Education during May       2012.
[5.6]     Currie then also authored a piece (`Does Great Literature Make us       Better?')
that draws on his       research to argue for skepticism about the claim that great literature       makes us better people.
In       particular, Currie draws on his discussion of the fact that we regularly       attribute our own failures to       circumstance and the failures of others to bad character, to undermine the       claim that great literature       makes us better people.
Published in June of 2013 by The New York         Times, it attracted in excess       of 500 comments.
[5.6] Reply pieces specifically focused on Currie's       article appeared during June       2013, published in Time and the Christian Science Monitor.
[5.6] To give a flavour of their reach:       the Time Magazine article was itself tweeted more than 2500 times       and `liked' on Facebook more       than 35,000 times.
[5.6] The follow-up pieces and their very high         uptake in social media         circles demonstrate a clear contribution to public debate.
