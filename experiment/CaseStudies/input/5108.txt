     The `Conversation with Diplomacy' project, the vehicle for disseminating       Kerr's research to the       FCO, is both distinctive and innovative.
It was launched in 2010 as a       specifically targeted response       to the well publicised call by then British Foreign Secretary, David       Miliband, for the FCO to engage       with academics in `public diplomacy' in order to broaden and deepen the       scope of public discourse       on foreign policy-making, to challenge `conventional wisdom' and `shape a       debate and build       consensus' in the framing of UK foreign policy (David Miliband &#8212; FCO       Leadership Conference, 4       March 2008).
From its launch the Conversation with Diplomacy project was       established as a       collaborative project designed to have a direct impact on both policy       approaches to peacemaking       in divided societies and the approach of UK foreign policy makers to       engaging with academia.
Impact A &#8212; Engaging in high level knowledge transfer and impact         through the `Conversation         with Diplomacy' project       The project is defined by the extent of its knowledge transfer and impact       across various sectors of       the FCO from serving ambassadors to policy planners to the Middle East       diplomatic community       stationed in London, members of the media, and the business and policy       making communities.
The       impact, reach and significance of Professor Kerr's research is evident       from the collaboration,       dialogue and policy engagement that has occurred through the public and       private engagements       which took place at King's College London between November 2009 and March       2013.
Kerr also       ran a series of research and policy focused private briefings and       workshops with the FCO, eight in       total, bringing together up to twenty policy and research officers from       different FCO clusters (not       just Middle East &amp; North Africa), staff and PhD students from       MEMS/CSDS &amp; TRS.
The nature and the extent of the impact of the research was its       dissemination through these       workshops in which King's academics presented current research relevant to       the UK foreign policy-making       processes on ethnic conflict and third party intervention in Lebanon and       Syria, the EU and       the Middle East, and engaging with Islamists in Lebanon and Syria.
A private MEMS-FCO foreign policy conference in May 2012 on the       `Transitional Justice       Dilemma for Syria' &#8212; led by the British Envoy to the Syrian Opposition,       Ambassador Guy, at King's       &#8212; brought together Syrian opposition leaders, senior FCO officials,       academics and NGO leaders       from around the world.
The objective of the conference was to inform UK       foreign policy makers of       the long-term challenges they face in bringing about a peaceful democratic       transition in Syria and       preventing conflict spilling into Lebanon, and to increase awareness of       the issues and challenges       for transitional justice processes in Syria.
These policy discussions fed       directly into the UK foreign       policy making process.
Ambassador Frances Guy (5.1.3) commented on the       event: `The       collaboration was extremely successful and we received an enormous amount       of positive feedback       from both from the FCO and those attending.
As events in the region       transpired, the innovation       provided for a timely and much needed intellectual connection between       government and academia       over the Arab Spring and what can be learnt from previous successful       conflict regulation processes       spearheaded by Western governments.
With the world's attention focused on       conflicts in the       Middle East, bringing together leading experts and foreign policy       practitioners on the region at this       time proved to be a high impact development for all concerned.'
Speaking in her role as former British Ambassador to Lebanon (5.1.3), Guy       also       commented that `By helping to draw parallels between Northern Ireland and       Lebanon it is fair to       say that Michael Kerr had an influence on British foreign policy as it was       carried out both in theory       from a London perspective but also practically on the ground in Lebanon       where the British       government was able to demonstrate clearly that we had relevant ideas to       be discussed'.
Her       successor as ambassador in Beirut, Ambassador Tom Fletcher (5.1.1),       described Kerr's research       on the lessons of Northern Ireland for Lebanon as `of great value to me       and my team' and as       having `provided the cornerstone for our advocacy work on this issue here       [in Beirut]'.
Fletcher       added that Kerr's `work will remain important as we and the Lebanese       continue our discussions       about what power sharing models will work in the next phase.
I very much       hope that we can       continue our close collaboration.'
On several occasions he has also used       his blog, part of the       FCO's influential online Global Conversations web presence to draw       attention to the importance of       Kerr's research.
Notably, this included blog postings inspired by       engagements with Kerr (5.2.1).
Impact B &#8212; Providing the FCO with a public and private forum to         advance Miliband's         objectives       The `Conversation with Diplomacy' project has had a significant impact on       the way in which the       FCO engages with and thinks about engaging with academics and utilising       their research in its       policy making process.
In doing so it has brought together the worlds of       diplomacy, business and       academia to address the policy dilemmas currently facing western       governments in the Middle East.
The project was launched in November 2010 when a delegation from the         FCO's Middle         East and North Africa Department, which included its then Director and         its then Head of         Research, held a policy debate with over 200 King's students, staff and         guests.
See (5.2.2)       This was followed up in the same month by MEMS hosting a public debate         with His         Excellency Fouad Siniora (former Prime Minister of Lebanon).
An audience         of over 250         attended, including members of the international media, think tanks and         research institutes         and the diplomatic community in London including the current Lebanese         ambassador.
For         media and other reports and coverage on the impact of this event see         (5.2.3).
In 2011, the FCO on three separate occasions sent UK Ambassadors to         King's &#8212; Richard         Makepeace (Jerusalem), John Jenkins (Baghdad) and Frances Guy (Beirut) &#8212;         to speak at         `Conversation with Diplomacy' events about their four year postings,         before holding Q &amp; A         sessions with audiences of approximately 200.
As part of the same project, Professor Kerr nominated Senator George         Mitchell, former US         Special Envoy to Northern Ireland and US Special Envoy for Middle East         Peace, for an         honorary doctorate from King's, awarded in October 2011 (see 5.2.4).
In January 2012, as part of an 'Ambassador in Residence' scheme at         King's, Ambassador         Frances Guy (Lebanon) joined MEMS as Senior Visiting Research fellow for         three years.
While in MEMS she focussed her research and teaching on UK foreign         policy towards Syria         following the uprising against the Assad regime and gave a public         lecture on the Syrian         Opposition: `Does it matter if they are not united?'
(see 5.2.5).
In March 2013, Sir Nigel Sheinwald (HM Ambassador to the USA, 2007-12)         spoke on         `Obama's Second Term and the Middle East'; and HM Ambassador to Kuwait,         Frank Baker,         on his four year posting.
In the formative stages of the project, the FCO sent the UK Ambassador         to Jordan, James         Watt, and the Foreign Secretary's Special Envoy to Afghanistan and         Pakistan, Sir Sherard         Cowper-Coles to address MEMS staff and students at King's.
Via these high level exchanges, the Conversation with Diplomacy project,       underpinned and       motivated by Kerr's research, has acted as a spearhead for advancing the       FCO's objectives of       engaging in more concerted ways with academia, thereby acting also as a       clear catalyst for       change and innovation in the way the FCO is pursuing its `Diplomatic       Excellence' agenda.
But       beyond this, Kerr's research has also contributed significantly to the       change in consciousness at       the FCO envisaged by Miliband's objectives, and in so doing has also       effected a more informed       understanding of the dynamics of power-sharing and consensus-building       together with a deepened       awareness of crucial regional factors.
Angus McKee, The FCO's Head of the       Middle East and       North Africa Research Group, from 2008 to 2011, and present Head of the       Syria Programme in       Beirut (Damascus Embassy is closed) (5.1.2) confirms the importance and       reach of these impacts:       `I worked with Professor Michael Kerr on several occasions.
His expertise       on Lebanon, and his       particular focus on the pros and cons of power-sharing, was often       consulted &#8212; for example, when       briefing officials and the newly-appointed Ambassador to Beirut.
His       interventions underlined the       need for consensus-building between leaders and communities...The       "Conversation with       Diplomacy" project in collaboration with the FCO [and the]       KCL..."teach-ins" for FCO staff on       thematic issues related to the Middle East region...contributed to the       FCO's "Diplomatic       Excellence" agenda by deepening policy officers' regional knowledge, in       line with the Secretary of       State's vision of an FCO based on knowledge of history and expertise.
Prof. Kerr's collaboration       with the FCO...has contributed to the FCO's deepened knowledge of Middle       East regional issues,       and made for better-informed decisions and policy.'
