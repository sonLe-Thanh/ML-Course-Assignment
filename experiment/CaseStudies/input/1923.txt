     The Environment Agency of England and Wales (EnAg) has benefited       from SPIA's SEA work,       in particular with regards to the importance of SEA's institutionalist       function, including       accreditation and SEA's role in enabling reform and for producing       environmental information,       thus acting as an effective environmental management instrument.
This was       confirmed by Dr       Ross Marshall, Head of EnAg's National Environmental Assessment Service       (NEAS) (reference       1):     `...our relationship with Liverpool helped NEAS achieve a set target         to be one of the first UK         organisations to be accredited to IEMA's Charter Mark for EA.
To date we         remain the only public         sector team to be awarded this accolade, and in recognition the EA has         made the retention of the         Charter Mark part of its corporate scorecard in respect of customer         service.'
Furthermore, Marshall praised SPIA's impact on the usefulness of SEA in       incidence (emergency)       environmental management.
Referring to an event jointly organised with       Tokyo Tech in 2012 he       stated that:     `Liverpool's [...] lead in organising [the] seminar on the role of         Impact Assessment in Disaster         Management [...] has been the only serious attempt [so far] to         critically analyse this field of study         and to provide an opportunity to pool and publish practice between         practitioners, academics and         government staff involved in disaster management.
The event provided an         opportunity for NEAS         to re-analyse its internal services [...] and using knowledge from the         seminar to develop a new         rapid assessment SEA tool and approach to help [...] senior management         identify and filter         options for their social and environmental impact, and reputational         consequences, during an         emergency.'
SPIA's impact with regards to the evidence produced on what makes SEA       effective (again       referring to all three functions of SEA) was confirmed by Rob Verheem,       Director International of       the Dutch EIA Commission (reference 2):     `Fischer has greatly impacted SEA development globally.
Particularly         in questioning whether         'flavours of the day' actually are improvements or not have been         crucial'.
With regards to the importance of SEA's information generating function,       SPIA's SEA research       impact on an international organisation was highlighted by Marco Martuzzi,       Programme Manager,       Environment and Health Intelligence and Forecasting of the World         Health Organisation (WHO).
Referring to an improved consideration of one specific substantive element       considered in SEA,       namely health, he stated that (reference 3):     `We have benefited greatly from Fischer's invaluable contribution in         the domain of SEA.
His         findings, i.e.
that health is most of the time under-considered [or       ignored entirely], remain a key         issue for us.
His work on SEA practice substantiated this state of         affairs, and continues to be an         essential reference, several years on, to make the vital case for a more         meaningful consideration         of human health.'
Further evidence of impact has been provided by policy documents and       guidance produced by       national and international institutions, referring to SPIA's SEA research       outputs:     Scotland declared its ambitions to be a global leader in SEA at the       beginning of the new       millennium.
In a policy review on SEA effectiveness report of the Scottish         Environmental         Protection Agency (SEPA) (2011), recommendations provided by Fischer       (refs.
4, 5 and 6 from         section 3 above) were followed with regards to how SEA should be       implemented in specific       situations, here with regards to a geographical unit, i.e.
Scotland       (reference 4).
Further evidence comes from Canada, a country that started applying SEA       as one of the first in the       1980s.
It has been considered a leader in its development since then.
A       Regional SEA (RSA)       methodological guidance and good practice document          was prepared by the Government of           Alberta, Canada in 2008 (reference 5).
This made       suggestions for more systematic and effective       local SEA processes (i.e.
SEA's information generating function),       following a commitment made       under the Lower Athabasca Regional Plan (covering 30,000 km2).
SPIA research outputs were used       (ref.
3 from section 3 above) and this document resulted in various       subsequent policy documents,       including an RSEA guidance document of the Canadian Council of the         Ministers from 2009       (reference 6).
Associated recommendations are currently being implemented       in practice, as Dr       Dallas Johnson, Section Head, Assessment and Evaluation of Alberta         Environment explained       (reference 6):     `we are looking for real results &#8212; our objectives are to better         understand and manage cumulative effects         in the area (which is expected to see significant in situ oil sands         development in future) and if we do it         right, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our regulatory review         system, which right now is         heavily dependent on project-level EIA for information on cumulative         effects'.
