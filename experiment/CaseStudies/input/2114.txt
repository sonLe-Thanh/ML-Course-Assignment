     University of Glasgow research has provided critical scrutiny of the       media, identifying a particular shift in representations of disabled       people.
It has stimulated widespread public debate about the relationship       between this representation, proposed changes in the provision of state       disability support, and the rise in disability hate crime.
The 'Bad News       for Disabled People' report (2011) was widely disseminated by a range of       disability support and advocacy groups, cited by trade unions and       parliamentarians in Westminster, the House of Lords and Holyrood.
Many of       these organisations have used the report directly to support their       campaigns.
Informing political debate     This research ignited the political debate on media representations of       disabled people.
For example, on 14 November 2011, the report was directly       cited by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson in a welfare reform debate in the         House of Lords as evidence of widespread misrepresentation of       disabled people and disability benefits.
Also in November 2011, the Shadow       Minister for Disability Issues referred directly to the University of       Glasgow findings in a House         of Commons debate on disability hate crime.
The report was also       mentioned during discussion in the Work         and Pensions Select Committee (February 2012), allowing the National       Autistic Society and Disability Alliance to draw attention to `the       negative tone adopted in the media about wider disability issues'.
The       Committee Chair also used the research in the in the Committee's       questioning of DWP Ministers concerning the changing attitudes to disabled       people and the transformation of the language used to represent disabled       people and disability benefits in the media.
The research was cited in the       Work and Pensions Select Committee's report Government           support towards the extra living costs of working age disabled people       and in a Westminster Briefing prepared by The           Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology on Work Capacity           Assessment.
The Committee Chair has also drawn from the       research in the preparation of speeches and articles relating to the       change of language used to describe disabled people since the 2010 General       Election.
Informing public and media debate     The impact of this research on the wider public debate around disability       issues was significant.
The report formed the basis of three articles       published in The Guardian (October-November 2011) and a full-page       feature in The Observer (December 2011).
Media coverage has       included discussions of the stigma associated with a mental health       condition, reports on the harassment of benefit claimants and wider       representations of disability in public life.
The Editor of the Disability         News Service writes:     The research has been useful to me in my work and hugely         influential...
I have heard the report mentioned repeatedly at         conferences, by campaigners, and in parliamentary meetings.
I believe it         is the piece of research quoted more than any other when campaigners are         trying to provide evidence of the impact of negative media coverage on         disabled people and their lives.
What was most useful in the report, I         think, was that it provided quantitative evidence of the shift in how         disabled people were being written about by the media.
That subsequently         provided a powerful tool for disabled people to fight back.
In particular, University of Glasgow findings led to critical assessment       of the media construction of disabled people as fraudulent benefit       claimants.
In The Observer (December 2011), Ian Birrell refers       specifically to the research and argues that `It is grossly irresponsible       for journalists and politicians to collude in this manner to create a       climate encouraging hatred, hostility and abuse towards people for whom       life is already so difficult.
This would be true at any time, but       especially at a time of such uncertainty, when people are fearful of the       future and looking for others to blame for their misfortune.
Those with       disabilities should not be made scapegoats for other people's sins.'
This       article attracted over 450 comments.
The `Bad News for Disabled People' report was also submitted to the       Leveson Inquiry into Culture Practice and Ethics of the Press (2011-12),       and omission of any significant reference to disability in the enquiry       report only fuelled public debate further with The Guardian (May       2012) charging Lord Justice Leveson with `ignoring evidence - in this         case that some journalists, fed by unscrupulous politicians, are         whipping up a perfect storm for disabled people.'
Informing support groups, advocacy and campaigns     Finally, the research has had significant impact within the disabled       community and among non-governmental organisations that support and       campaign for disability issues.
`Bad News for Disabled People' has       provided organisations with clear research evidence to inform their       campaigns; by defining and quantifying misrepresentations in the media it       has given weight call for changes in public attitudes towards issues of       equality.
Inclusion London states:     The research `Bad News for Disabled People' has been of fundamental         importance in not only Inclusion London's work but in the work of         Disabled People's Organisations and disabled people led campaigns across         the UK.
Disabled people are very aware of the impact of media messaging         on welfare and benefits on public perceptions of disability...Negative         and hostile media portrayals need to be understood within this context         in order to understand their full significance.
Having solid research to         substantiate our arguments and to support the anecdotal evidence we have         from disabled people is absolutely invaluable.
These findings were used in campaigning by organisations including Scope,       Disabled People Against Cuts, Disability Arts in London, the Disability       Alliance and I Spartacus.
They have formed the basis of articles in Disability         Now (January 2012), and on sites such as Disability Arts Online       (December 2011).
On the 17 November 2011, the research was cited by the       National Union of Journalists in a press release `Stop         calling disabled people scroungers'.
Disability Rights UK cited the       University of Glasgow research in the development of their Disability         Hate Crime Guidance (February 2012), launched online and by press       release to a range of outlets.
The guidance discussed a rise in hostile       attitudes experienced by disabled people, questioning whether this type of       coverage is encouraged by the government in order to justify an austerity       agenda which includes disability benefit cuts.
This research, then, as well as informing public and political debate to       a significant extent, has made an influential contribution to campaigns       for social and cultural change; by providing evidence of the nature and       extent of stigmatization affecting disabled people, it has allowed those       campaigning around these issues to more effectively challenge these       misrepresentations.
