     Research in the department's Extreme Environments Laboratory (EEL) by the       EEMSRG has had profound, global and paradigm-altering significance within       the REF period.
a.
Impact on the protection, rescue and treatment of immersion         casualties.
The EEMSRG introduced the concepts of "Cold Shock";       "Circum-rescue collapse" and "Autonomic conflict"; these major advances in       the understanding of the physiological response to immersion have directly       informed the protection (equipment provided), rescue (methods) and       treatment (priorities) of immersion casualties: "Dr Tipton's         elucidation of cold water shock has transformed the physiologic         understanding of drowning."
(1).
"The work of the laboratory has         significantly influenced our thinking and understanding of the hazardous         responses to immersion and ... our policies for the search, rescue and         treatment of immersion casualties" (2).
EEMSRGs work is regularly       used in fatal accident enquiries and legal cases, ranging from child abuse       to murder, informing decisions and recommendations (3, 4).
b.
Impact on International standards, guidelines, training manuals.
The premier organisation for establishing international standards in sea       survival is the UN's International Maritime Organisation (173 member       nations).
Its "A Pocket Guide to Cold Water Survival", was "largely         based on the work of the EEL (EEMSRG)" (5).
Published in 2012, it       sold in excess of 10,000 copies in the first three months.
This       publication forms the basis of the immersion survival, protection and       search and rescue policies of member states.
EEMSRG research has informed the training programmes of numerous       international organisations including the International Lifesaving       Federation, the world authority for drowning prevention, lifesaving and       lifesaving sport.
Our work has "influenced the development of         international lifesaving programmes and standards" and "a number         of the ILS International Lifesaving Certificates have standards based on         evidence arising from the University of Portsmouth" (6).
The work of       the EEMSRG appears in many first aid and search and rescue training       manuals, including those of: the Royal National Lifeboat Institution       (RNLI), Royal Yachting Association (RYA), Mountain Rescue; Surf Lifesaving       GB and New Zealand; Moroccan SAR; Royal Netherlands SAR; US Lifesaving       Association; UK and Canadian military SAR; Yachting Australia.
"The         research work (of the EEMSRG) has produced the science to base our         current casualty care syllabus, teaching and practice upon in the fields         of immersion, submersion and hypothermia" (7, 8).
Recent research on "Autonomic Conflict" (2012, Section 3, Reference 5) is       already described in the first aid manuals and training material of Surf       Lifesaving GB and the RNLI.
Our recent publication "A proposed       decision-making guide for the search, rescue and resuscitation of       submersion (head under) victims based on expert opinion" is being used       internationally.
In the UK it has been the catalyst to move the different       SAR agencies towards using a common operational protocol: "Portsmouth         University influenced our thinking, assisted and supported the         development of National Guidance" (8, 9).
Our work appears verbatim       in the Fire &amp; Rescue Services National Operational Guidance on Water       Rescue and Flooding.
Recent research on survival time during head-out       immersion has been used by the US Coastguard to produce new search and       rescue models and strategy.
c. Impact on public awareness.
An important method for reducing       the number of annual immersion deaths involves educating the public about       the risks of cold immersion.
This form of "preventative medicine" has been       achieved through involvement with various agencies noted above; helping       them produce campaigns for lifejacket usage e.g.
"Useless unless worn"       (UK: RNLI, HMCoastguard); ""Stay on top with a lifejacket" (Maritime New       Zealand); "Wear one for openers" (Maritime Australia).
We have also been       involved in water safety campaigns (e.g.
RNLI "Respect Water" campaign       August 2013) and appeared in, and helped write the script for the RNLI       water safety video "Cold Shock" (2010), as well as taught on RNLI, RoSPA       and RYA sea survival courses.
Between 2008 and 2012 EEMSRG staff were       involved in over 100 media appearances demonstrating and discussing the       risks of immersion.
Tipton also lectures on immersion and drowning to       medical students in London, Leeds and Birmingham.
It would be nice to think that the impact outlined above has saved lives.
This is difficult to determine definitively, however it is encouraging to       hear from those that should know that this is the case: "There is little       doubt that the work the (EEMSRG) does in the field of cold water survival       continues to save lives every year (10); "Without doubt the excellent work       carried out by (EEMSRG) has contributed significantly to our goal of       saving lives at sea" (7); "The work of the EEMSRG has undoubtedly saved       the lives of immersion casualties" (8).
"This has been literally       lifesaving work.
Thank you" (2).
