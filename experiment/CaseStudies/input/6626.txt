     The impact of PR is measured both by its sustainability and the       network of associations, collaboration, readership and supplementary       projects that it has been able to develop as a result of its editorial and       publishing approach since its inception in 1996.
[1]       The following reflect some aspects of this.
Data from Taylor &amp; Francis - with an average print-run of       approximately 1000 per issue, PR is distributed and subscribed to       in over 25 countries with full institutional subscriptions sustained at &#177;       240 since 2007, and Online subscriptions (2012) in excess of 1725; our       full-article downloads on all platforms has increased from 5,800 in 2007       to 23,200 in 2012 increasing by 53% since 2011 with substantial activity       in the UK, USA, Australia, Netherlands, Canada and Turkey and growing       activity in India, Israel and South Africa.
Joint Ventures &amp; Collaborations - PR has initiated a       number of joint ventures and collaborations with artist-led organisations,       the most significant of which are:     Performance Studies International (PSi) - a creative partnership       with PSi (from 2009) as an organisation that brings together practitioners       and scholars in which PR edits one issue per volume that engages       with the theme of the PSi conference and is published at the beginning of       the following year's conference to 600+ international participants,       providing continuity and resonance for Psi and visibility and       dissemination for PR.
The partnership with the Institute for Digital Arts &amp;         Technologies (iDAT) (2001 - 2011) produced a software interface       'Liquid Reader' (in three beta-versions) enabling integration of video,       audio and text materials on a DVD platform that supplemented and extended       the possibilities of the print journal, and enabled supported commissions       for artists (see above).
[3]     Collaborations with Independent NPOs: PR has also had a       long and generative association with the independent art sector in eastern       Europe which has produced two issues: (10:2, 2005) 'On Form' as a       collaboration with two significant European artist-led contemporary       performance journals and non-profit arts organisations, Maska       (Ljubljana) and Frakcija (Zagreb); and the recent (18:3, 2013) 'On       Scenography' in collaboration Sodja Zupanc Lotker, artistic director of       the Prague Quadrennial.
[4]     Promoting research/ practice-led educational and international         networks &#8212; the wide international networks that PR journal continues       to develop through its approaches to publication and dissemination have       impacted particularly (see above) in fostering productive relationships       between artist-led organisations and researchers.
Research in performance       often sits most productively within arts practice itself &#8212; a space that       might also be exemplified in the various and increasingly extensive and       connected MA networks in Europe and their interfaces with artistic NPOs,       for example the 2011-13 Erasmus Intensive on Practicing Composition:         Making Practice.
[5]     Arts Council UK funding for Artist's Pages' - PR attracted Arts       Council funding for a series of commissions for artist's pages in the       first three volumes (9 issues) from 1996-1998, and for the first CD-rom       supplement (4:2, 1999) 'On Line' .
This was an innovative move that       supported our research into using the constraints of print as a medium for       performance.
See for example: Alastair MacLennan (1:1, 1996); Lily       Markiewicz (1:1, 1996), Bruce Gilchrist (1:2, 1996); Caroline Bergvall       (1:3, 1996), Michael Vorfeld (2:2, 1997); Brigid McLeer (3:2, 1998) and Xu       Bing (3:3, 1998).
In 2001 the journal was highly commended in the ALPSP /       Charlesworth Award for Typographical Excellence in Journal and Serial       Publishing.
Performance Writing &#8212; the impact of PR is both described through       its attention to particular innovative areas of performance, e.g.
performance         writing, where PR has provided a research context for innovation and       discussion in this emerging practice-e.g.
'Letters from Europe' (2:2,       1997), 'Openings' (5:2, 2000), 'On Editing' (7:1, 2002), 'Translations'       (7:2, 2002); 'On the Page' (9:2, 2004) which involved commissions from       artists and academics - see (9:2, 2004) Section 2 Pageworks pp.
34-91; and       our most recent issue (18:5, 2013) 'On Writing &amp; Digital Media'.
Contributors - PR has attracted 1024 individual       contributors to date including: BADco/ Jean Baudrillard/ Mieke Bal/       Charles Bernstein/ Jean-Luc Nancy/ Blast Theory/ Simon Critchley/ Steven       Connor/ Romeo Castellucci/ Alphonso Lingis/ William Forsythe/ Kirsten       Delholm/ Tim Etchells/ Ken Friedman/ Heiner Goebbels/ Goat Island/       Katherine N. Hayles/ Janez Jansa/ Dragan Klaic/ Carolee Schneeman/ Peggy       Phelan/ Peter Sellars/ Alastair MacLennan/ Wlodzimierz Staniewski/       Marianne van Kerkhoeven/ Krzysztof Wodiczko [6]     Readership &#8212; Online access to PR since 2011 has meant that       readership numbers for individual articles are often in excess of 250 and       up to 980 (see Robin Nelson, 11:4, 2006) based on statistics which combine       cumulative total PDF downloads and full-text HTML views from publication       date .
