     Medical devices are a $434 billion market worldwide, and coating systems       for use in medical devices reached a market value of ~$5.3 billion/year in       2012 (Medical Market Outlook Report, Espicom Business Intelligence, 2013).
Given the very recent date of the fundamental research that underpins the       technology, it is remarkable that it has already led to new products which       are now being marketed actively by Biointeractions Ltd. Economic impacts       of this work include the generation of new capital investment by       Biointeractions and 3 new staff positions within the company.
New capital investment by BioInteractions, resulting from this work, has       included the purchase of a Sono-Tek, ultrasonic spray stent-coating       platform and the renting of clean room facilities for the coating of       stents for human implantation, with 1000 stents having being coated at a       cost of &#163;200 per stent.
Moreover, the polymer technology developed for       coating coronary stents, as described above (Adapt&#8482;)[a],[b] has very       recently been adapted &#8212; with a partner company &#8212; for use in implantable       glucose sensors and catheters.
[c] The glucose sensors, using the Adapt&#8482;       polymer coating system under license from BioInteractions, will allow the       partner company to market an improved device with extended implantation       lifetime.
The range of clinical applications for such implantable devices       is very significant, providing a significantly larger potential market for       the commercialisation of the technology.
A partnership agreement is       expected to be in place by the end of 2013, but details are commercially       sensitive and so are confidential at present.
The licensing agreement is       expected to generate income of ~&#163;150K/year from 2016 onwards.
[d] The       projected incomes from the lubricating coating system for catheters       (Assist&#8482;)[c] developed from the Adapt&#8482; technology, are &#163;176K in 2015 and       &#163;590K in 2017.
[d]     The second-generation coating system developed through the follow-up KTP       programme requires approval for medical use in humans.
BioInteractions is       currently involved in the initial stages of clinical evaluation, and a       partnership has been agreed with IsleChem LLC that will allow production       of the materials on the scale needed for full clinical evaluation.
The       further capital investment required to bring this novel material to a       point where BioInteractions can realise their investment through a       technology licensing agreement is around &#163;100K.
[d] The company has heavily       promoted this system as a base material for the development of contact       lenses with long residence times in the eye, and the technology is also       being applied to implantable stents for long-term use: in this case,       revenue is expected to be generated within 6 years.
These developments       have led BioInteractions to increase the size of their research team by       150%.
[e]     Biointeractions Ltd have actively promoted the products and technologies       that arose from the research described here.
Since 2008, the company has       presented these new polymer technologies at 18 major international       biomedical-device trade shows (often represented by the former KTP       Associates): UK Biomaterials, Liverpool, 2008; Medical Device &amp;       Manufacturing (MD&amp;M), Minneapolis, 2008; MEDTEC Ireland, Galway, 2009;       MD&amp;M, Minneapolis, 2009; Polymeric Biomaterials, Reading, 2010; UK       Biomaterials, Glasgow, 2010; MD&amp;M West, Anaheim, 2010; MD&amp;M East,       New York, 2010; MD&amp;M, Minneapolis, 2010; Compamed (Medica),       D&#252;sseldorf, 2010; MD&amp;M West, Anaheim, 2011; MD&amp;M East, New York,       2011; Compamed (Medica), D&#252;sseldorf, 2011; US Biomaterials, Florida, 2011;       MD&amp;M West, Anaheim, 2012; MD&amp;M East, Philadelphia, 2012;       Biointerfaces, Dublin, 2012 and MD&amp;M West, Anaheim, 2013.
