     The results of the study were presented at the Internationale Tourismus       B&#246;rse (ITB) in Berlin in       2011 (a major global tourism trade fair).
Also, a chapter summarising the       results was published in       the annual ITB publication:     Font, X. and Walmsley, A.
(2012) Corporate social reporting and practices       of international hotel       groups, in: R. Conrady &amp; M. Buck (Eds) Trends and issues in global         tourism 2012.

There is, according to the lead author (Dr. Xavier Font, Leeds       Metropolitan University), `plenty of       anecdotal evidence' of the impact the study has had on the industry.
For       example, the RIU Hotel       Group has responded very positively to the findings.
This company       specialises in holiday resorts       and city hotels with more than 100 establishments in 16 countries with 3.3       million guests annually.
RIU is currently the world's 29th ranked chain, and the third largest in       Spain in terms of revenue       and number of rooms.
According to a press release dated October 23 2013:     Six RIU hotels in Playa de Palma and Calas de Mallorca in Spain, as well       as three       hotels in Mexico (Riu Emerald Bay, Riu Cancun and Riu Caribe) have       recently       received the 'Travelife Gold Award', a recognition that certifies them as       environmentally and socially responsible hotels.
Over 50% of the chain's       hotels are       now certified with a 'Travelife Gold Award', taking it one step further in       its Corporate       Social Responsibility plan.
