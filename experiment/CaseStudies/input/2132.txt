     Understanding the contribution of HEIs to regions       PURE had as its focus the impact of HE partnerships on regional       development.
It aimed to set realistic tasks and targets for HE       partnership-based regional development.
The project used a consultative       and developmental approach to help HEIs implement change.
Within each       region, a review was undertaken of university engagement through       partnerships with other regional bodies.
These reviews specifically used       the regional and university benchmarking tools developed by Charles (IMP1).
The tools are also publically available on the PASCAL website for others       to use.
Using the assessment tools &#8212; PURE and beyond       Sixteen regions were engaged in a two-year study from 1 January 2009 to 31       December 2010, with a second cohort starting in 2011 taking the total       number of participating regions to 19.
The regions accessed the       benchmarking materials in a variety of ways.
In Puglia, for example, "benchmarking         was used and universities, notably the `naturally conservative'         University of Bari, used the tool and found it valuable.
It was         experienced as almost a `road to Damascus' experience" (IMP2p3).
Further selected examples are provided as follows.
Participants from Flanders reported that the benchmarking exercise "brought         together the vast array of disparate information about third mission         activities organised within the Flemish institutions.
For the first         time, a report was made on these activities and most HEI actors involved         concluded that they were pleasantly surprised by seeing how many third         mission activities already exist....The booklet containing the good         practices was disseminated within a lot of organisations and opened new         insights on possible cooperation" (IMP3p2).
In the Gabarone region, both the university and city region participants       commented that their practice was impacted upon: "access to the PURE         benchmarking tools was a significant lever in developing engagement         activities...the significance of the tool was that it provided an         opportunity for joint adaptation and development of measures both to         recognise and evaluate engagement activities" (IMP4p2-3).
They also commented that "the list of substantive aspects of regional         development provided within the tool was a direct support to the task of         choosing areas of activity thrown up by the workshops as possibilities"       (IMP4p3).
Benchmarking was initially applied in the Melbourne region during PURE (IMP5),       and "a significant achievement was creating a streamlined means of         working and systematically using benchmarking by both universities and         region" (IMP6p3).
This took place to the extent that "Melbourne         is now an internationally recognised leader" in the use of these       techniques (IMP6p3).
In addition, "the region has used the         PURE HEI and draft region benchmarking tools to take stock, and, from a         basis of knowledge, monitor and enhance progress in region-HEI         partnership.
It will benefit both parties to repeat this" (IMP6p6).
The report also recommended that the work be sustained into the future.
A specific example of the continued use of this work is that the       benchmarking tool has now been taken up by Victoria University in       Melbourne as part of their strategic review of engagement (begun in 2013).
Having undertaken a detailed review of the options available to them, the       Senior Policy Advisor at Victoria University commented that the tool       developed at Newcastle is most appropriate for this task for the following       reasons: "it is appropriate to a number of the characteristics for         benchmarking at Victoria University; detailed information on the tool is         readily available; contact can be readily made with others who have used         the tool locally, as well as with David Charles; and it uses a         methodology which is regarded as useful for Victoria University,         particularly with the recent development of the Colleges" (IMP7).
Implementing the Third Mission of Universities in Africa (ITMUA)       This project also emerged from existing partnership activities, including       PURE (IMP8).
Both Gabarone and Lesotho (PURE participants)       developed their work through this project.
The benchmarking tools       developed for PURE were used to support the achievement of the project's       goal to investigate the role of higher education in support of regional       and sustainable development (IMP8).
Lesotho is reported to have       had sustainable development, culture and community development as its foci       for benchmarking, the use of which revealed that individuals within the       university were responsible for leading most community service activity (IMP9p2).
The Project Leader of ITMUA published an article which described the use       of the tools to create a "baseline against which to assess the nature         or extent of community service activity being undertaken" (IMP10p90).This       enabled the project to understand the current level of activity, informing       the planning of new activity as appropriate.
Specifically, using the tools       within a participating university revealed that members of staff were       interested in working in a cross-disciplinary manner.
Based on this       finding, initiatives were developed in response, including a curriculum       development proposal which was supported by colleagues from a range of       departments.
