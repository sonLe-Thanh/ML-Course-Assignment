     This research has deepened knowledge and understanding of the important       role of international       law in contributing to the peaceful management of the world's       transboundary water resources       amongst a range of stakeholders, including policy makers within       governments across the world,       and international organisations.
Engagement in global policy dialogues:     The authors have been invited to present their research at a number of       high level global policy       meetings, including at the triennial World Water Forums (Hague 2003; Kyoto       2006; Istanbul 2009;       Marseille 2012) and Stockholm World Water Weeks (over the past 15 years).
Other selected       examples include:     Wouters was invited to present her Water Security work (2009) at a number       of high level meetings,       including:     (i) a High Level Panel on Water Security organised by the Inter-Action       Council (comprising       former heads of States and co-chaired by Rt.
Hon.
Jean Chr&#233;tien, former       Prime Minister of       Canada, H.E.
Dr. Franz Vranitzky, former Chancellor of Austria and Gen.       Olusegun       Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria) (2011) (see section 5: 1);     (ii) UK Commission on National Security in the 21st Century       (co-chaired by Lord Ashdown and       Lord Robertson), commissioned an ESRC-funded policy brief on Water       Security (2009)       (see section 5: 2);     (iii) UN Water Security High Level Panel Experts Meeting (UN, New York,       2013);     (iv) World Economic Forum, Global Agenda Council on Water Security       (Dubai, 2010) (see       section 5: 4).
Rieu-Clarke was invited to present his research to:     (i) an invitation only meeting of European States to discuss how the UNWC       could be further       promoted (2013), (see section 5: 7,8); and     (ii) a High Level Panel on Global Water Governance, held at the 6th       World Water Forum (2012       Marseille), (see section 5: 7,8).
Rieu-Clarke and Loures also co-convened the first global symposium on the       legal and policy       dimensions of the UNWC, attracting more than 100 of the world's leading       thinkers and key       stakeholders on this topic (Dundee, 2012).
The event resulted in several       important publications       and significant global outreach (see section 5: 7).
Targeted training events for policy-makers:     The authors have led numerous training events around the world (Asia;       Africa; Latin America;       Europe), where they have discussed their research with policy-makers.
Details of targeted training events:            They convened more than 10 international water law         workshops/conferences/think-tank         meetings in Dundee attracting more than a 1,000 international delegates,         including an annual         workshop that has attracted scholarship funding from the Global Water         Partnership (GWP),         the world's largest international network on water (see section 5: 7);       They co-convened with WWF a series of UNWC national workshops         (Cambodia, Ethiopia,         Tanzania and Vietnam; regional workshops in East Africa (11 Nile         Countries), SE Asia (6         Mekong Countries) and West Africa (16 Countries), bringing together many         key stakeholders,         including government officials from various ministries (finance,         environment, trade, foreign         affairs, energy, etc), Ambassadors, parliamentarians, civil society         groups and academics to         discuss research findings related to the UNWC (see section 5: 7,8,9,10).
Policy-oriented training materials have supported these activities, such       as The UN Watercourses         Convention &#8212; User's Guide, and various policy briefs, e.g.
Loures,       Rieu-Clarke and Vercambre,       Everything you need to know about the watercourses convention:       http://www.unwater.org/downloads/wwf_un_watercourses_brochure_for_web_1.pdf       (see section 5:       3,5).
Influencing the entry into force of the UNWC:     The research has influenced global and national policy making with       particular impact on supporting       the entry into force of the UNWC, illustrated by the following examples:     At the regional and national level:            In Africa and Asia the workshops noted above have triggered         ratifications of the UNWC by         Guinea Bissau and Nigeria (2010), Burkina Faso (2011), Benin and Chad         (2012), and Niger         (2013).
Other States have committed to initiate the ratification         process, including all nine         countries of the Niger River Basin, Vietnam and Tanzania (see section 5:         7,9,10);       In Europe, Rieu-Clarke's research (2008) was used by WWF to support         their European         campaign, leading to ratifications by Spain (2009), Greece (2010),         France (2011), Denmark         (2012), Italy (2012), Luxembourg (2012) and the UK (2013).
More EU         States have agreed to         come on board; the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on         the Commission and         Member States to do so.
Rieu-Clarke was commissioned by the Department         of International         Development to report on how UK ratification would support their water         policy (see section 5:         8).
The fact that 16 countries have ratified the UNWC in the last five years       and a significant number of       ratifications are expected in the foreseeable future &#8212; enough to secure       the Convention's entry into       force &#8212; is testament to the impact of this research (section 5:7).
A       further endorsement of the       research is witnessed by the award of &#163;210,000 from the Norwegian Ministry       of Foreign Affairs       (2010) and a consultancy contract worth &#163;11,500 from the UK Department for       International       Development (2010) to Rieu-Clarke to continue his research and advice       related to the UNWC (see       section 5: 6).
