            Reach: The practices of the 3-4,000 full- and part-time healthcare         chaplains in the UK and         chaplaincy services and patients and staff in NHS hospitals in the UK         have been impacted by         the policies informed by Walton's research.
Significance: Walton's research has lead to the establishment of the         first competency         framework governing healthcare chaplains in the UK, their core         skillsets, training and         supervision (adopted and implemented by NHS Scotland, England and Wales,         and the UK         Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy) and directly shaping inclusion and         content of one of the four         key domains within the framework.
There are 187 NHS health care trusts in the UK, running over 2300       hospitals and other care       facilities.
Since the establishment of the National Health Service in       1948, there have been       chaplaincy services available throughout the institution, primarily based       on the assumption of a       broadly shared religious belief system.
Since the late 1990s, however, in       line with views emanating       from the World Health Organisation, the NHS has acknowledged a wider       definition of spiritual care       and the importance of its role in the `full-person' healing and care of       patients.
Today's healthcare chaplains work in an environment where they are       answerable to three different       and at times seemingly incompatible groups.
Chaplains seek to offer care,       compassion and       understanding to individuals &#8212; patients, staff and others &#8212; who       often have no religious       commitment and struggle to express their spiritual concerns.
Chaplains of       all faiths are employed       by an institution &#8212; the National Health Service &#8212; which is secular       in character.
And most chaplains       belong to a faith community to which they have strong personal       allegiances and which may feel       that the faith organisation and not the NHS has first claim on overseeing       their work.
Additionally,       healthcare chaplaincy work is stressful and frequently involves assisting       people who are       confronting traumatic situations that can be difficult to accommodate       within a traditional theological       framework.
Walton's work has focused the sector's attention on the particular       effectiveness in these complex       circumstances of narrative and poetic techniques in:            providing a capacious and flexible way of acknowledging the diverse         challenges facing         healthcare chaplains and creating meaningful links between these areas         as a guide to practice;       generating effective pastoral communication and responses in contexts         in which there is no         shared framework of belief; and       enabling chaplains to become aware of their personal and professional         responses to difficult         challenges, thus becoming more effective reflective practitioners.
The link between Walton's particular research insights and the influence       on the competency       framework for chaplains in the UK healthcare system was her earlier work       (pre-2008) at major       Chaplaincy conferences where she presented practitioners with a       methodological base for       theological reflection but also enabled them to engage in these reflective       processes through       creative writing exercises.
Examples of influential events include the       Irish Healthcare Chaplains       Conference (2003): `Narrative Methods in Theological Reflection'; the       National College of       Healthcare Chaplains Conference (2004): `Beyond Storytelling in Practical       Theology) and her       consultancy to the National College of Healthcare Chaplains beginning in       2005.
Walton's high-profile espousal of reflective practice led to the       invitation to join the working group       sponsored by NHS Education Scotland which in 2008 produced the Spiritual         and Religious CareCapabilities and Competences for Healthcare Chaplains.
This framework, which serves as the       basis for healthcare chaplains' training, professional development and       supervision, detailed core       competencies in four key domains:            knowledge and skills for professional practice;       spiritual and religious assessment and intervention;       institutional practice; and       reflective practice.
The identification of Reflective Practice as a core competency domain       drew directly on Walton's       expertise as the only academic working group member with this specialism.
Walton was one of       only two theologians on the 17-strong committee and her particular       influence is seen not only in the       emphasis upon reflective practice and theological reflection methods but       more specifically in the       recognition of the importance of creative skills and imaginative resources       as a professional       resource for Chaplains.
Reflective practice within the framework focuses       specifically on       understanding the various models of reflective practice and utilising       these to address case-related       issues and therapeutic relationships.
Reflection is seen as a key element       of a chaplain's       professional development and ability to e.g.
understand how belief systems       and practice inter-       relate; how to reconcile personal beliefs with those of others,       particularly how one's own belief       system may affect the attitudes and behaviour of people using the       chaplaincy service; and how to       build professional relationships with vulnerable people in traumatic       circumstances.
In 2009, the framework was adopted by NHS England, and the UK Board of       Healthcare Chaplaincy       (UKBHC) released a statement saying that they "recognised the vision,       experience and expertise       of NHS Education for Scotland (NES) in the preparation and publication of       a capability and       competency framework and is grateful for their permission to adopt and       reprint this document as a       framework for healthcare chaplaincy throughout the UK."
In 2010, the Welsh       Assembly adopted       the same framework: "These competences and capabilities have been adapted       from the `Spiritual       and Religious Care Capabilities and Competences for Healthcare Chaplains'       (NHS Education       Scotland, 2007).
The Welsh Assembly Government acknowledges with thanks       the support and       permission of NHS Education Scotland to use and adapt these competences       and capabilities."
Implementation of the framework on the ground continues to be supported       by Walton's       presentations and training sessions at key sectoral events.
For example,       she presented a session       on `Narrative, Trauma and Identity' at the 2009 National Conference of       Healthcare Chaplains,       introducing methods of reflection that provide a basis for chaplains to       respond to traumatic events       and begin to use these through reflective exercises.
She ran a similar       training day in Bristol in 2010       on `Narrative Methods of Theological Reflection'.
In relation to the 2009       conference, the       Chaplaincy Team Leader of the NHS Dudley Group of Hospitals and then       President of the College       of Healthcare Chaplains gave the following feedback:     What you were able to do was go beyond the (prosaic) narrative         theology to the idea of poesis.
This paradigm leap in to poetry was to me revelatory.
It hits its mark         because of the constant         encounter that I face with life shattering trauma, which often escapes         meaning.
At least the         search for meaning is never satisfied except by through the encounter of         a caring self-         possessed other through which meaning can be experienced.
When you said,         "Trauma shatters         narrative" and replaced it with poesis it opened up many dimensions....I         am able to introduce         others to narrative and poetic methods as I lead development days for         NHS staff called `Caring         Heart and Soul: A Refresher day to recover the path to the heart.'
It         introduces our chaplaincy         volunteers (as well as an increasing number of Queens Foundation and         post-ordination         trainees) to the principle of such theological reflection methods.
The NHS Scotland Manager for Education Projects in Spiritual Care created       a three-year       programme of ministerial training (pre-2008) that was `deeply influenced'       by Walton's research,       particularly `Passion and pain: conceiving theology out of infertility'       [1].
In 2013, he still finds that       many chaplains struggle to get beyond applied theology.
In teaching         theological reflection and         in supervising I often refer chaplains to your article and encourage         them to `hear' the theology         that is present in the raw human experiences they encounter daily and         then, akin to what you         did, attempt to write a first person account which could end `this is         how theology is done'.
The         results are not surprisingly variable in terms of end product but the         process provokes         transformative learning as stuck practice is interrupted with first         person insertion and the divine         presence is disclosed in hints and guesses.
The impact of Walton's focused work on reflective practice can also be       seen in the incidences of       healthcare professionals choosing to do their PhDs under her supervision       at Glasgow (5 since       2000).
