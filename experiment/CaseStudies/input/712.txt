     Theme research carried out over the last 15 years has informed and       contributed to the       development of both evidence-based practice guidelines, strategies,       education and training to       improve awareness of nutritional care of older adults and       nutritionally-vulnerable groups.
Currently, there are 1290 care homes across Scotland which are required       to provide care that       meets the National         Care Standards for Care Homes for Older People (revised 2007) and to       adhere       to standards regarding nutritional care and eating well that identify       nutritional risk and needs and       provide strategies to manage this.
The Care Inspectorate (until April       2011, the Care Commission)       adopted through the Care Home Learning Network procedures to ensure that       minimum care       standards across all care homes could be achieved.
An education and       training programme which       supported nutrition champions in care homes across Scotland was developed       by Bannerman and       colleagues and implemented in collaboration with the Scottish Commission       for the Regulation of       Care, 2009.
This provided a direct benefit to managers and staff of Care       Homes in implementing       systems to nutritionally support residents who receive more appropriate       and individualised       nutritional care.
This programme enables assessment and provision of the       appropriate food and       fluid needs for the older adult to ensure minimal nutritional risk and was       evaluated by the report       "Promoting Nutrition in Care Homes for older people".
Care homes in       Scotland continue to be       inspected for registration on key criteria identified within the programme       resource.
Our nutritional expertise in the acute (hospital) setting has provided       the basis for optimising       nutritional care of nutritionally-vulnerable groups and informed the       development of `Food         In Hospitals: National Catering and Nutrition Specification for NHS Hospitals in         Scotland' (Scottish       Government, June 2008; Davidson, Scott, &amp; Bannerman).
This document       has been developed to       support all Scottish NHS Boards in implementing the Quality Improvement       Scotland Clinical       Standards for Food, Fluid and Nutritional Care in Hospitals and to drive       up standards of food and       fluid provision experienced by patients within hospitals.
To assess       compliance, all 14 NHS health       boards throughout Scotland are inspected twice yearly by Health Facilities       Scotland and results published.
The "Food in Hospitals" specifications have also been used to inform       nutrition standards for food       and fluid provision elsewhere, including by the Welsh Assembly (`All         Wales Catering and Nutrition Standards         for Food and Fluid Provision for Hospital Inpatients', 2011) and in       New South Wales,       Australia (`NSW         Agency for Clinical Innovation.
2011.
Nutrition Standards for Adult         Inpatients in New South Wales hospitals').
Work in the area of nutritional assessment       of older adults and       associated health outcomes has been cited in the development of       evidence-based practice       guidelines for the nutritional management of malnutrition in adult       patients across the continuum of       care in Australia (Dietetic         Association of Australia 2009).
This gathered the best available       evidence       to formulate recommendations for use across Australia and across the       spectrum of health care       settings to detect malnutrition and manage it with nutritional       interventions.
Beneficiaries: NHS and other hospitals in UK and abroad, elderly people       in acute and residential       care, residential care staff and management.
