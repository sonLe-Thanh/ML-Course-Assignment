     Our research has emphasised the need for the legal professions to engage       with inequality of       opportunity as regards entry into and progression within the professions.
Our findings indicated       that this would likely only be effective, if the legal professions had       access to nuanced data that       would highlight barriers to entry and advancement, plus a granularity of       data that allowed for       sectoral comparisons and, for large legal employers, also organisational       differences.
Our       recommendation was that compulsory diversity monitoring and reporting be       introduced so as to       permit this.
Our findings also suggested that diversity monitoring and       reporting may also assist in       reducing the impact of informal work allocation and promotion processes as       firms and       organisations began to see the differential promotion rates of women and       BME lawyers within their       organisations and sought to remedy these differences.
On publication of our report the LSB held a joint press event with the       academic research team to       release our findings and gave press interviews indicating that our       findings suggested the need for a       regulatory response to the diversity problems that we had identified       (Crispin Passmore `The case       for diversity: The profession's white male legacy persists' The Guardian       13th October 2010       http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2010/oct/13/diversity-legal-services-board-research       ).
Our report       recommendation on diversity monitoring (October 2010) formed part of the       LSB 2011 consultation       on equality and diversity policy and practice:     http://www.legalservicesboard.org.uk/what_we_do/consultations/open/pdf/diversity_consultation_publish.pdf       .
Following the consultation the Legal Services Board made it compulsory       for all legal       entities in England and Wales to collect, monitor and report diversity       statistics for all staff at all       levels through issuing statutory guidance to this effect in July 2011:     http://www.legalservicesboard.org.uk/what_we_do/consultations/closed/pdf/decision_document_diversity_and_social_mobility_final.pdf       .
In-keeping with our recommendation, all firms and       chambers are now required to collect diversity and equality data on age,       gender, ethnicity,       disability, socio-economic status and sexual orientation by role and to       make it available to their       front line regulators: The Solicitors Regulation Authority, the Bar       Standards Board and CILEX       Professional Standards.
Aggregated data will be made available to the       public and the LSB       reserves the right to require the frontline regulators to remedy diversity       problems within firms and       chambers, where they persist over time.
The introduction of compulsory diversity monitoring and reporting has       sparked increased debate in       the legal professional press about the factors that contribute to a lack       of female representation in       the higher levels of the legal profession, and the attrition of BME       would-be lawyers as between       graduation and professional qualification.
Further, it has led to the       further development of a range       of diversity initiatives that seek to encourage pupils from minority and       lower socio-economic groups       to aspire to a career in the legal profession, as well as others that       develop more systematic       mentoring schemes for young lawyers, others that seek to introduce more       fair and transparent       work allocation systems within law firms: see for example: Katy Dowell       `Freshfields adds socio-       economic background to census questions' The Lawyer 28th       February 2011 page 5.
There is       ongoing coverage about the research in the legal press see for example the       Law Society Gazette       article 11th April 2012: http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/drinking-and-casual-sexism-still-institutional-top-firms-lsb-research-claims       The Legal Services Board is working in conjunction with       the frontline regulators so as to address concerns about equality and       diversity within the       professions.
Thus, our findings have the possibility of reshaping the       legal profession, as law firms,       barristers chambers and other legal entities are required to both report       on and to justify their       recruitment and retention of solicitors and barristers with reference to       diversity criteria.
Lisa       Webley (the LSB project grant holder) has subsequently been appointed to       the Equality and       Diversity Committee of the Law Society, and to the Interlaw Diversity       Forum Committee, both of       which seek to improve equality of opportunity within the solicitors'       profession.
