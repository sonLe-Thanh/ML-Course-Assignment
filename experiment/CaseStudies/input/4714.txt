     Pamela King is a noted international specialist on the English medieval       theatre, with known interest and expertise in present day confraternal       revivals and reinventions of the medieval performance arts in civic       contexts.
She is President elect of the international Medieval and       Renaissance Drama Society, and past President of the Soci&#233;t&#233;         Internationale pour l'&#233;tude du Th&#233;&#226;tre M&#233;di&#233;val, the two leading       international associations for the study of the early theatre.
Her 2006       book, The York Mystery Cycle and the Worship of the City was a       double prize-winner.
She is also the co-owner of the Medieval Players'       archive, the archives of the only touring company in the UK to have       pursued an artistic policy based on the practices of the medieval stage,       and now lodged in the Bristol Theatre Collection, and of the Norah       Lambourne archive of set and costume designs for the Festival of Britain       production of the York Plays.
As a consequence of her research profile and specialism, she has been       invited to contribute in non-academic contexts where her expertise has       demonstrably raised the level of public debate and thereby enhanced the       aesthetic quality and actual and potential success of civic festive       events, as well as the public understanding of the medieval entertainment       industry:            Having regularly given public platform lectures in Coventry as part of         the development of Coventry Mystery Plays company, a collaboration         between the Alan Higgs Charity, Coventry City Council, and Coventry         University, she has been appointed Visiting Professor at Coventry         University in the School of Art and Design with the specific brief to         collaborate in developing the Coventry Mysteries further as a civic         project [a].
Although she is also the editor of the original Coventry         Mystery Plays (The Coventry Plays, Medieval Institute         Publications.
Kalamazoo, 2000, co-edited with Clifford Davidson), the         present project that appropriates their name does not aim to reconstruct         the medieval festival, but has been re-inventing a summer festival of         street theatre empowering multi-cultural neighbourhoods in a project         directed at fostering civic identity and social cohesion.
These         connections, and further envisaged work, guarantee a range of social and         cultural benefits with economic spin-out [b].
She has been an invited speaker at the York Guilds conference at which         practitioners of the revived York Mystery Plays meet with academics to         discuss the transmission of the city's medieval dramatic heritage to         modern indigenous and tourist audiences in 2007 and 2011, informing the         artistic policies of those "guilds" as they develop subsequent         productions within their modern "tradition" of the York Festival and         Mystery Plays [c].
As a direct product of the 2011 involvement under 1, she was invited         to become academic consultant, with special advisory roles relating to         the production of a text, and to the inducting of performers into         appropriate performance styles etc., to the Gloucester Mystery Plays,         2012-13 [c].
This is an entirely new and very ambitious event that will         be repeated every three years, organised with the support of and in aid         of Gloucester and Worcester Cathedral Charities, Gloucestershire County         and City Council, and involving amongst others, Gloucestershire         Honorable Gentleman, Gloucester Chamber of Commerce, Rotary Club, Round         Table, Gloucester Lions, the Sealed Knot, the Warwick Warriors,         Gloucester Rugby Club, and Mr Rick Wakeman.
The festival patron is actor         Jeremy Irons.
The "mystery plays", which have no known medieval         originals, will be performed at Gloucester Cathedral, city streets, and         RFC stadium, at Worcester Cathedral, and Warwick Castle, and will         involve performances of a full cycle performed by cast drawn from the 87         non-professional theatre groups in Gloucestershire, a full cycle         performed by Gloucestershire secondary schools and youth drama groups,         Cathedral performances on dates in line with the church calendar, and         wagon performances in Warwick and Gloucester at which the combined         Choirs of Gloucester Cathedral and the National Youth Orchestra will         perform [d].
As a direct product of her involvement with the individual festivals         listed above, she was able to bring the producers of the York and         Gloucester festivals together with practitioners and academics working         in the field from across the world at her European Science Foundation         (ESF)-funded workshop in Budapest (9 to 11 September 2011), entitled         "Reinventions of Early-European Performing Arts and the Creative City,         Civic Regeneration and Cultural Tourism" [f, g, h].
The participant list         for the workshop [g] indicates the truly international reach of the work         on reinventing Early-European performing arts [j].
Since their return,         they have perceived the wider implications of their local knowledge and         have set up a consultancy of which King is a member, aimed at sharing         knowledge in order to assist other cities to establish medieval         festivals, maximising the quality and ambition of their productions,         while reducing their financial risks, maximising profit for chosen         charities, including different sectors of their communities, and         attracting new tourists.
At the time of writing, the service is engaged         in initial discussions with two potential client cities.
She has been involved in discussions about the entertainment industry         in the Middle Ages on local and national radio, most notably acting as         organiser of expert participants to a BBC Radio 3 Sunday Feature on         Myths and Mystery Cycles, 12 September 2010, 22.00-22.45, presented by         John Sessions, and she is regularly consulted by the BBC in relation to         similar topics [i].
