     The exhibitions curated by Fowle as part of this research were popular       successes, visited by large       numbers.
Their innovative methods, particularly the hang of the paintings,       sparked debate about       Impressionism, Scottish art, and Scottish cultural identity.
However, in       addition, Fowle's research       into collecting and dealing sparked a renewed interest in Scottish art of       this period, and       precipitated a rise in the value and price of these works on the       commercial art market.
a) Challenging assumptions: Impressionism and Scotland     Initiated in 2006, with two of its main outputs dated 2008, this research       spanned an important       period in Scotland's history.
Raising the status of Scottish       nineteenth-century art and patronage by       placing it firmly on an international stage, the work stimulated media,       critical and public discourse       on Scotland's identity in the wake of the 2007 election, which had       returned the country's first       Scottish National Party-led government.
Impressionism and Scotland was opened by Linda Fabiani MSP, then       Minister for Europe, External       Affairs and Culture, on 17th July 2008.
A review by Moira Jeffrey in         Scotland on Sunday (27th July       2008) (5.1) commented on its 'riveting...underlying social history', the       academic importance of its       `complex arguments' and its success in 'reminding audiences of the       strength and depth of the       Glasgow collections that are national assets in everything but name.'
The most original aspect of the installation of Impressionism and         Scotland was the pairing of       Scottish paintings with French nineteenth-century works.
This innovative       curatorial practice, a       visual way of communicating one of the main themes of the research, was       noticed and praised by       the viewing public, with comments in the visitors' book (5.5) including:       'Fabulous contrast /       comparison of pictures &#8212; really enlightening!'
(UK visitor)     In his five star review in The Scotsman (18th July 2008) (5.3),       Duncan Macmillan wrote 'This show       makes no wild claims for Scottish art, but it does an excellent job of       putting it in context.'
In the       polarised debate about broadening the meaning of Impressionism, which the       research initiated, his       position was that 'the map has to be redrawn.
How welcome then that Impressionism         and Scotland       is a major exhibition that does just that.'
Writing in The Telegraph, however, Richard Dorment       resisted the exhibition's thesis and hang,       questioning the right of 'loony art historians' (5.4) to reinterpret the       meanings of 'Impressionism'       and 'Scotland' (a stance which he abandoned by the time of Impressionist         Gardens at the National       Galleries of Scotland in August 2010).
In response, The Telegraph       received letters of objection       from the public and art professionals, including the Director of the Fine       Art Society in London.
Retorts were logged in the visitors' book (e.g.
'The Telegraph got it       wrong') (5.5) and Fowle       received notes of support from globally-renowned critics and experts,       including Sister Wendy       Beckett.
(5.6)     b) Exhibition uptake: economic impact in the museums sector     The Edinburgh-based Global Investment Managers, Baillie Gifford, offered       &#163;150k in sponsorship to       Impressionism and Scotland (5.10).
80,000 people visited the show in       Edinburgh (with entry       charged at &#163;8 per person; &#163;6 for concessions), spending an average of one       and a half hours       inside; an additional &#163;82k was generated in catalogue sales during the       period July-October 2008       (5.10).
Well-attended education events and workshops received excellent       feedback (5.5)     In addition, Impressionism in Scotland affected the public reception of       other exhibitions on this       subject.
The Kelvingrove Art Gallery's 2010 show - Pioneering Painters:       The Glasgow Boys 1880-1900, whose catalogue drew on many of the themes and exhibited some of the       works explored in       Impressionism in Scotland, toured to the Royal Academy of Arts in London;       and broke box office       records at the Glasgow venue, with visitor numbers of 105,000 surpassing       the previous record set       by a 1948 retrospective of Vincent Van Gogh (5.11).
c) Economic impact: studying collecting and influencing the art market     Prior to this project, few exhibitions and publications had explored the       role of private collectors in       cultivating taste and encouraging artists in new directions by exposing       them, at home, to       international trends.
By undertaking detailed research into the influence       of collectors like the       Cargills and Alex Reid, and by providing an inventory of Scottish       collectors and art dealers in the       Impressionism and Scotland catalogue, Fowle showed an interest in       the workings and influence of       the art market that was subsequently included in other exhibition       catalogues, such as Picasso and         Modern British Art (Tate Britain, 2012) (5.7).
Writing in the       Guardian, Ian Jack (5.2) called       Impressionism and Scotland 'particularly instructive' in this area,       noting that this was 'unusual for a       picture show' and that Frances Fowle's catalogue was 'excellent' for its       inclusion of sales records.
Since the publication of Van Gogh's Twin in 2010, Alex Reid has       been the subject of particular       media attention, from the Culture Show (interview with Frances Fowle       broadcast in March 2013).
The BBC's ArtWorks Scotland was the first to redress the neglect of The       Glasgow Boys by       commissioning and broadcasting a documentary on the group by Hunter Films       aired on BBC 2       Scotland in June 2010 and on BBC 4 in November 2010 (and again in January       2011).
With Fowle       as Research Advisor and interviewee, the programme highlighted the       influence of French painters       on The Glasgow Boys and was seen by over one million viewers (5.9).
In       February 2013, ArtWorks       Scotland again interviewed Fowle about the research, this time for a       Kirsty Wark-presented       documentary on The Man Who Collected the World: William Burrell,       broadcast 29th May 2013       (BBC2); 21st, 22nd, 23rd August 2013 (BBC 4).
Perhaps most significantly, around the time of Impressionism and         Scotland, there was a steep rise       in the market value of The Glasgow Boys pictures, with George Henry's Playmates       selling at       Sotheby's for &#163;400k (eight times its estimate) and William Kennedy's       auction record rising from       &#163;17k to &#163;237k.
Prices have continued to climb and, in November 2012, Sir       James Guthrie's In the         Orchard was sold at auction, jointly, to Glasgow City Council and       the National Galleries of Scotland       for &#163;637k (5.8).
