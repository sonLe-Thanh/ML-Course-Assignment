     The impact described here has occurred in the period 2008-2013, and is       based on research published in open scientific literature and widely       available.
The key chemostratigraphic data accessed by the oil companies       was generated at Oxford University.
All research was that of Jenkyns,       Hesselbo, and associated Oxford researchers.
The beneficiaries of this research have been the exploration departments       of many international energy companies, with evidence provided in       particular from BP, Shell and Petrobras, and wider use exemplified by the       service company Neftex.
The impact of this research is described in the       context of each of the companies that have provided corroborating       evidence, but similar impact extends to many other petroleum companies.
British Petroleum, Libya Exploration team.
The Libya Exploration Manager at BP (quoted below) describes using       Jenkyns' OAE model and its consequences for source-rock distribution /       prediction as a key 'metric' when deciding whether to access new acreage /       countries to explore for hydrocarbons.
This methodology enables BP to have       a higher degree of certainty that an exploration well will be successful,       thereby reducing the cost of siting wells.
"We use your work as an analogue for our area, informing the           risking of prospects that we will drill with wells in 2014 at costs           &gt;$200m each."
The BP Libyan team use Jenkyns' research on source-rock distribution to         develop models for the prediction of source-rock presence.
"A specific example would be the Libya team between 2008 and 2012           directly using your (Jenkyns') work on Tethyan source rock           distribution, particularly at the C/T boundary, in order to help build           models to predict for source-rock presence offshore Libya."
BP also train their exploration geologists in the OAE model and its         implications for hydrocarbon distribution.
Jenkyns helps with this         training by running annual field courses illustrating the OAE model and         the use of chemostratraphic tools.
Staff are taught, for example, about         Tethyan source-rock distribution and shallow-water carbonate-platform         evolution; highly relevant subjects for exploration activity.
"By leading the BP field trip to the Italian Alps you educate ~25           BP geologists per annum with respect to Tethyan source rock           distribution and shallow-water carbonate platform evolution.
The           outcrops that you guide us through are direct analogues for what we           expect to encounter in Libya."
[7]       Petrobras       The Brazilian company, Petrobras used the UoA's research on         palaeoenvironments to help reformulate their exploration strategy for         the giant offshore oilfields of the western South Atlantic.
Papers 1-4         above were used directly by Petrobras (quote from the Head of the         Chemostratigraphy Group, Petrobras):       "works were used to get reference curves and understand           palaeoenvironments of pre-salt rocks.
They also were used to           understand the oceanic anoxic events and their implications" [8]       Shell       Shell's Vice-President Emerging Technologies and Chief Scientist         Geology Projects and Technology says that Dr Jenkyns' work:       "has been a significant contributor to the company's exploration           success"       Oxford University work on OAEs has led to a fundamental change in the         way Shell views source rocks.
The work was used to develop their         exploration strategy and has been used to understand how economically         viable spots can be identified in exploration areas.
It led to the         development of the "15 focus basin strategy" formulated in 2003, which         guided Shell's exploration policy until 2010, before being replaced by         the "source rocks can be reservoirs" strategy which continues to rely on         Dr. Jenkyn's work to the present day to understand the location and         formation of source rocks.
"Dr Jenkyns' work on OAEs triggered a fundamental shift in the way           oil companies view source rocks in terms of the importance of singular           events versus uniformitarian models.
This paradigm shift led, within           Shell, to us focusing the search for hydrocarbons on particular           periods of geological time and geographies.
It was used within Shell           as part of our `15 focus basin strategy' allowing us to concentrate           resources on a particular set of target sedimentary basins rather than           spread them world-wide."
"Dr Jenkyns' recent work with colleagues highlighting, in some           cases with forensic detail, the distinctiveness of different source           rocks and unravelling their origins from stratigraphic and geochemical           clues is, we believe, fundamental to the understanding of how economic           sweetspots will be identified within these plays."

Their integrated         global geological database - the Neftex Earth Model - delivers insight         to help clients reduce geological risk in exploration and investment         activities.
It has been extensively used across the oil and gas industry         during the period 2008-2013.
Head of Innovation at Neftex         Petroleum Consultants Ltd states:       "Without research published by Oxford, the Neftex Earth model could           not have been generated...
...The impacts for Neftex are as follows:          &#8212; The painstaking work of generating high resolution, well         biostratigraphically calibrated chemostratigraphic records has been         invaluable in allowing and improving the precision of our global         correlations.
&#8212; The fact that we have a good understanding of the spatial extent of         organic-enriched facies during the Mesozoic/Cenozoic OAE's helps us to         make inferences beyond data control as to the likely occurrence of         potential source rocks for undiscovered hydrocarbons.
&#8212; High-resolution, biostratigraphically well-calibrated         chemostratigraphic records are also instrumental in allowing the driving         mechanisms behind the Neftex eustatic model to be evaluated.
&#8212; The detailed sequence stratigraphic work (carried out on the         Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene) using chronostratigraphically         well-calibrated sections has provided a fundamental basis from which to         compare additional sections to allow us to generate a global sequence         stratigraphic model."
