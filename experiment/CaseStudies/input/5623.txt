     Since the invasion of 2003, Iraq's Mandaean community, present in the       south of the country for over two thousand years, has faced violent       persecution, including incidents of forced conversion to Islam, rape and       murder.
A large majority has since fled the country; of an estimated       60-70,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s, only 5-7000 remain.
In       Iran, similar, less violent persecution has nevertheless also resulted in       mass exodus.
An Iranian law of 1985, for example, has seen Mandaeans       prohibited from fully participating in civil life for almost three       decades.
Consequently, a large number of Mandaeans from both Iraq and Iran       have settled in the West, with around 1000 living in the UK.
(7, below)     Hunter's extensive research into the history, language and culture of the       Mandaeans has equipped her with a unique understanding of the community       which has, in turn, enabled her to develop a strong rapport with its UK       members.
Hunter has provided valuable support to the community by raising       awareness of their persecution in Iraq and Iran and their little       understood religion.
This she has done in a number of contexts, including       asylum tribunals and public events.
Hunter has acted as an expert witness       in 6 court hearings of Mandaeans seeking asylum in the UK, all of which       have been successful.
In January 2008, Hunter gave evidence in support of       a young Iraqi Mandaean woman who had requested asylum in the UK on the       grounds that she would face violent persecution, even death, if forced to       return to Iraq.
Hunter wrote a comprehensive letter outlining the dangers       faced by female Mandaeans in Iraq, as well as their historical and       religious background, and acted as expert witness in court.
In the initial       court hearing, the judge approved the application based on Hunter's       evidence, although this decision was later overturned by the Home Office.
The case was referred to the High Court, where the applicant was again       granted permanent residency, with the judge citing Hunter's evidence as       having greatly informed their decision, such is also corroborated by       Trevor Wornham, solicitor for the applicant (1, below):     "Erica was the only expert witness called; she is unique in her         expertise on the Mandaeans.
She was very methodical in countering the         Home Office's arguments point by point.
Her evidence was crucial to         winning the case."
Waleed al-Murrani, the applicant's father, further substantiates       Wornham's statement (2):     "Erica Hunter's contribution was extremely helpful.
She was one of the         major factors in the success of the whole case.
The judge commented that         what she had written was convincing and true.
My daughter will soon be         eligible to apply for British citizenship."
Hunter has also represented the Mandaean community at public events with       the aim of drawing attention to their plight in Iraq and Iran.
In October       2012, Hunter presented on the Mandaean situation in Iraq and the UK's       asylum policy at the Minority Rights Group International Conference held       at the House of Lords, helping to make their case known in the UK and in       Europe.
Moreover, Hunter participates with Mandaean community members in       conferences organised by ARAM at the University of Oxford, an independent,       non-profit-making society concerned with all aspects of Syro-Mesopotamian       cultures.
She also invites their participation (presenting their current       situation) in the annual Christianity in Iraq Seminar Day, that she has       hosted since 2004 at SOAS.
Hunter's efforts to involve Mandaeans in these       events has afforded them an arena in which to share their experiences,       while also bringing to light the social and cultural aspects of the       Mandaean community to a UK audience.
Dr Layla al Roomi, spokesperson for       the Mandaean Human Rights Group (MHRG) who has presented at both       conferences, attests to the support Hunter has offered Mandaeans in the UK       since 2003, both through her research and her involvement in asylum cases       and events (4, 5):     "Her research has been well read internationally which helps to put         the Mandaeans on the map of minority groups in Iraq.
She has helped to         dispel ignorance about the Mandaeans and other gnostic religions.
She         has been pivotal in opening up to the world this ancient religion which         is rarely heard of.
She is very supportive and enjoys mixing with the         community, participating in many Mandaean social events, such as         baptisms.
We are very grateful to her for taking up our case and         listening to our problems."
Hunter's continued endeavours to raise awareness of the suffering of       Mandaeans in their homelands and her involvement in several asylum cases       constitutes an important, concrete contribution to efforts to protect the       rights of Mandaeans in Iraq, Iran and the diaspora.
As Nasir Shathur, an       Iraqi Mandaean refugee living in Wales and former member of the MHRG,       affirms (6): "There is no doubt about it that in her involvement as an       expert witness Erica Hunter has saved the lives of many refugees."
