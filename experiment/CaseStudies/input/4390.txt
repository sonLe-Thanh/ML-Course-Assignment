     Influencing the national and international policy agenda       Bovaird's original research, together with his close association with       Governance International, has       helped shape the public service policy agenda.
The Presidency of the EU       commissioned the five-       country study of public service co-production [R4], the results of which       were presented to over a       thousand public officials at the EU Fifth Quality Conference for Public       Administration (5QC)(Paris,       September 2008).
The policy conclusions of this study `informed the         development of the         Cabinet Office report Co-Production of Public Services       (2009) significantly' [source 1 below]       (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/207033/public_services_co-production.pdf).
Bovaird was also commissioned by the UK Department of       Communities and Local Government (CLG) to develop the policy implications       of his research       findings [R6].
This contributed to the evidence base for the         Government's 2008 White Paper       which set out the ways in which it intended to empower communities and       citizens [source 2].
Growing policy-maker and professional interest in co-production led       Governance International and       the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU - a leading independent think       tank on local public       services) to commission and publish a book on how co-production could       improve health and social       care outcomes.
Bovaird co-edited and contributed to the book, alongside       chapters in which civil       servants, local authority councillors and officers, and third-sector       managers documented their       experiences with co-production.
The Chief Executive of LGIU commented that       `[t]his very timely       book ...gives us a glimpse into the future ... [in] this vital area of       public policy' [source 3].
The book       was recommended by CLG as a key resource for those local       authorities introducing co-       production as part of their neighbourhood budgeting approach [source 4].
In 2012, Bovaird was invited to give oral evidence to the House of       Commons Select Committee on       Communities and Local Government on the potential of co-production for       public service       transformation [source 5], further contributing to the development of         the public service policy       agenda.
Influencing the policy and practice of local public service providers         and commissioners       Bovaird's research on co-production has led to his involvement in a number       of policy initiatives.
In       2010, the Local Authorities Research Council Initiative (LARCI), a       partnership of Research       Councils UK (RCUK) and local and central government, appointed Bovaird (a       LARCI Council       member) as the champion and sponsor of a series of papers on co-production       [source 6].
This       series was used as evidence by the Scottish Government's Commission       on the Future       Delivery of Public Services when it recommended that `public service       organisations should       increasingly develop and adopt positive approaches which build services       around people and       communities, their needs, aspirations, capacities and skills' [source 7].
Subsequently, in 2011, the Scottish Executive commissioned Bovaird and       Governance       International to design a programme to that would develop the skills of       health and social care       professionals in local authorities, community health partnerships, and       social care providers across       Scotland.
Since 2012, this development programme has been delivered twelve       times, reaching       around 300 policy-makers, senior managers and front-line professionals,       assisting them in       realising the public service improvement vision of the Scottish       Government.
The training has now       been extended to a wider range of public services, initially through a       national workshop for Police       Scotland in June 2013.
Midlothian Council, who trained 120 senior staff       through this programme,       report that Bovaird and his team `help[ed] us roll-out co-production       quickly... [It] is now a core part... of the Council and is contributing         to significant improvements in services and important         efficiency savings' [source 8].
Emerging from this work, Bovaird,       Governance International and       the Joint Improvement Team (JIT) (comprising the Scottish Executive Health       Department, NHS       Scotland, and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) produced two       guides for practitioners       [source 9].
The JIT Director comments: `We have found Professor Bovaird's       research invaluable in... delivering the Scottish Government's vision of       co-production as a reality of public service reform'       [source 10].
The `Modelling Birmingham' research forms an important part of Birmingham       City Council's project       of transforming its service delivery through co-production to meet the       challenge of increasing       community needs in an environment of declining resources.
The Council       comments that the project       `has already had a number of valuable impacts on public services ...       (including) identifying       preventative interventions (and) ... highlighting the potential for       significant savings' [source 11].
The City Council also believe it will `have wider effects on UK local       government' in the future.
The       project won the 2012 IBM Smarter Cities Award and a prize of $500,000 to       further develop the       work [source 11].
Within UK government, the idea of co-production has been connected with       current policy interest in       neighbourhood budgeting in order to give communities greater capacity to       influence those services       funded by public resources.
In 2012, Bovaird was appointed to the CLG's       Neighbourhood       Community Budgeting Analytical Advisory Board.
In January 2013, Governance       International and       Bovaird were commissioned by CLG, Birmingham City Council and the Balsall       Heath       Neighbourhood Forum to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the       Neighbourhood Community       Budgeting pilot in Balsall Heath.
The evaluation resulted in the         partners placing much greater         emphasis on bringing the community into service commissioning, design         and delivery,         particularly in community safety and local environmental improvement         services, and thus         enhancing co-production [source 7].
In light of this contribution, Bovaird was invited to present on the       `economy/diseconomy of scale'       effects of co-production at a CLG workshop and subsequently at a policy       roundtable with Danny       Alexander MP, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in April 2013.
CLG comment       that they `highly       value' Bovaird's `personal engagement with the department ... where his       expertise has helped         develop, challenge and shape policy thinking ... a notable example       being his leading       contribution on economies/diseconomies of scale' [source 12].
