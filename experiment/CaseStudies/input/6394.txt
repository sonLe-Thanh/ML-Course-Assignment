     The impacts are upon the practice and policy of arts organisations and       arts organisers in relation to producing and exhibiting new media art, and       hence include economic impact on artists and benefits to audiences.
At Eyebeam in New York, the working practices moved from being       purely a creative industries `production lab' with artist/designer       residencies, to being also concerned with curating and exhibiting the       work: CRUMB chose Eyebeam as a research partner and in 2010 they hosted       Dr. Cook's research &#8212; their first curatorial residency.
The exhibitions Interactivos       and Untethered curated by Cook there, and Curatorial         Masterclass on Open Source and Curatorial Practice fundamentally       changed the institutional understandings of the relationship between       production and exhibition (Cook 2008).
The exhibitions brought many       visitors to Eyebeam, and brought new press attention, including Rhizome       (Graham 2010, Moss 2010).
The legacy was that Eyebeam staff including a       Program Coordinator started curating substantial exhibitions there for the       first time, and established further curatorial residencies at Eyebeam from       2011 (2).
Attendance by curators and artists at the masterclass resulted       in new knowledge being put to work in their individual exhibition       practices, including those at Google's New York headquarters       organised by Chelsea Art Museum (3).
Impacts on the AV Festival (an international audiovisual biennial       based around Tyneside Cinema).
CRUMB has organized public events       at every AV Festival since 2006, and is acknowledged in the       festival's evaluation reports (ANE 2008).
In 2008 AV Festival invited       Sarah Cook with curator Kathy Rae Huffman to curate the first official AV       large-scale group exhibition Broadcast           Yourself, which deliberately built bridges between video and       newer media.
The exhibition toured to Cornerhouse Manchester and was seen       by over 9,000 people, and Art Monthly said "There is something       immediately welcome ... about an exhibition devoted to the way that       artists over the past 40 years have ... succeeded in opening TV up as a       cultural forum ..." (Usherwood 2008).
In Newcastle, the exhibition       received the most visitors of any AV exhibition, around 4,700, and was       described by audiences as of high artistic quality, "Compelling and       illuminating" and "thought provoking", and by a festival artist Atau       Tanaka as "A very well curated exhibit."
(ANE 2008, pp.
11, 12, 73).
Other key AV events for impacts on other curators and policy makers       included Professional Development Workshops Distribution           and Dissemination After New Media in 2012 and Documenting           New Media Art in 2008 with curator and archivist Caitlin Jones       (formerly of the Guggenheim Museum in New York).
The workshop sold out,       and the audience included contemporary art international curators, arts       funders and policy makers including Arts Council England and British       Council, as well as academics and artists.
Feedback forms from the event       stated that 98% of attendees felt that their future practice would be       changed by the workshop (Jones 2008).
In 2012 the Tyneside         Cinema, informed by these developments, advertised the new post of       Digital Media Projects Manager, and this post was filled by a researcher       completing his PhD concerning participatory and open source art projects       with CRUMB (AHRC Research Grant studentship).
He has since collaborated       with CRUMB as a professional, including the Surreptitious           Networks professional development day (Pixel Palace, CRUMB and       an 2013), and implemented `Pixel Palace', a new digital media programme at       Tyneside Cinema which involves many young people, "...drawing upon       knowledge gained with CRUMB ... " (1).
He was recently invited to speak at       BBC         Academy/Arts Council digital partnership 'Building Digital Capacity for         the Arts' and is passing on the knowledge at the policy-level.
Postdoctoral CRUMB post 2013 Isabella Streffen co-curated Surreptitious           Networks with Tyneside cinema, and curators at all levels have       been attracted to the region, and are impacting upon local audiences.
Like       the Digital Media Projects Manager, they aim to work with arts       organisations and in turn affect their policies: PhD Student 2011-14       Marialaura Ghidini programmed the 2012 workshop for AV festival, and Hybrid           Curatorial Models: Producing and Publishing a       professional development workshop for curators in New Delhi, exhibitions       at Grand Union in Birmingham, and also online with Or-bits.
A Senior Post-Doctoral Fellow with CRUMB 2009-10, has since become a       curator of MEWO Kunsthalle and         Strigel-Museum in Germany and has included new media art exhibitions       (4).
Curators sharing knowledge on the CRUMB discussion list have included       curators from Eyebeam, Guggenheim, and V&amp;A. CRUMB research can       therefore be seen to impact on the practice of curators, who then go on to       influence other curators, in both art and creative industries contexts.
