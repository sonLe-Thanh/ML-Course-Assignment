     A long-standing and on-going collaboration between research clinicians       (Huxley, Green &amp; Hudson)       at UoN and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) has enabled the UoN research to       deliver changes in non-       steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use for cattle.
There are five       NSAIDs licensed for use in       cattle, in the UK (carprofen, flunixin meglumine, ketoprofen, meloxicam       and tolfenamic acid).
A       surge in the use of NSAIDs, particularly Metacam&#8482;, the meloxicam brand       sold by BI, has arisen       from the research findings and the collaboration between UoN and BI.
UoN       research was used to       inform marketing policy and approach (based on the barriers to use       identified in Prof. Huxley's       research), leading to considerable gains for animal welfare and clear       commercial benefit for BI, the       industrial collaborator.
Although the research was instigated, designed       and independently       conducted in academia, much of the original research represents a true       HEI-industrial partnership,       which has further developed (for example, BI are the industrial partner on       a current BBSRC       Industrial Case Studentship on which Huxley and Green are the PIs).
BI       were instrumental in this       research from the start, providing financial and logistical support to the       UK and wider European       work.
The response of BI to the publication of the research findings was to       instigate a concerted and on-       going marketing campaign, aimed at changing the NSAID prescribing habits       of farm animal vets       and the attitude of farmers to NSAID use.
The material and evidence they       used to support this       campaign was underpinned by the research on farmer and vet attitudes to       pain and analgesic       usage and the barriers (both real and perceived) to increased NSAID usage       in cattle (Source 2).
For example, many veterinary surgeons believed that farmers were not       prepared to pay for       NSAIDs.
The research at the UoN demonstrated this not to be the case, and       many cattle farmers       stated that vets did not discuss pain control with them as often as they       would like.
This research       was pivotal in changing these attitudes and thus the use of NSAIDs (Source         2).
The increase in use of NSAIDs following the UoN research was dramatic.
Between 2008 and 2012       the total market value of NSAIDs sold in the UK for use in cattle       increased from &#163;4,704,642 to       &#163;8,927,556 (a 90% increase; Figure 1).
Over the same time period       Metacam&#8482;, the meloxicam       brand sold by BI has seen its total market value increase from &#163;1,633,295       to &#163;4,574,484 (a 180%       increase; Figure 1).
It is of note that 81% of the increase in       total NSAID growth between 2008 and       2012 was driven by sales of Metacam&#8482;, which had a greater than fifty per       cent market share in       2012.
All other brands in the market place (&gt;20) saw their combined       sales rise from &#163;3,071,347 to       &#163;4,353,072 (Source 2).
In a statement (2013), the Business Manager       &#8212; Cattle of BI stated, 'Our         partnership with Professor Huxley and his team at Nottingham University         has been central in         moving veterinary opinion and thereby validating our promotional         activities.
The proximity of this         team of researchers to the practising veterinary surgeons and the         respect with which their opinion         is universally viewed has been, I believe, pivotal in changing attitudes         to pain relief and behaviours         which have brought about this massive increase in use of NSAIDs in         general and Metacam in         particular.
Since the original collaboration between Boehringer         Ingelheim and Professor Huxley         and his collaborators to investigate attitudes of vets to the control of         pain in cattle, a universally         beneficial relationship has been created by way of increased profits for         our industry and company,         a resultant willingness to invest in on-going internal and third party         research with the indisputable         improvement in animal welfare for which we can all feel justifiably         proud" (Source 2).
The beneficiaries of this research are widespread.
Pharmaceutical       companies have benefited from       increased sales, which have led to substantial and direct animal welfare       benefits via the control of       pain and discomfort in treated cattle.
It is very difficult to accurately       quantify the exact number of       additional animals that have benefited (only volume of sales data is       available and dose volume is       dependent on animal weight).
However, if it is assumed that an animal dose       has an approximate       cost price of between &#163;2 and &#163;20 (calf to adult), in 2012 between 210,000       and 2,100,000       additional animal doses were administered compared to 2008.
Consequently       farmers, purchasers,       consumers and government have benefitted from an improvement in animal       welfare and an       assurance that every effort is being made to treat and control pain in       this key food production       species.
Alongside the marketing campaign and in some cases supported by BI, the       research clinicians       (Huxley &amp; Hudson) have made concerted efforts to raise the profile of       this research and pain       control in cattle in general (Source 3).
Since January 2008 they       have delivered eleven training       meetings to farmers and industry, three professional development meetings       to veterinary       surgeons, created an open access webinar (Source 4) and presented       the work at nine national       and international events/conferences attended by the dairy industry and/or       veterinary surgeons,       reaching an estimated audience of well over 1000 people.
Additionally they       have publicised the       work and the work has been reported directly or indirectly in a wide range       of professional journals       and industry magazines (Source 5).
Finally, based on the interest       UoN research generated in this       area, XLVets (a veterinary consortium composed of 50 commercial practices       across the UK)       developed a group-wide training programme (2008-12) to promote the uptake       and use of NSAID       amongst their farming clients (Source 6).
In a statement (2013),       the Chief Executive of XLVets       said, 'We have greatly appreciated the collaborative approach that you         have shown in providing         not just the science but also practical solutions and key opinion         leadership in the development of a         better understanding of pain and analgesia in cattle.
The impact of your         work has been         considerably enhanced by your ability to effectively communicate it to         the wider audience.
We have         specifically appreciated the practical help and support that you have         provided to us in the         development of our campaigns of activity to change mind sets to         analgesia.
The direct effect of         your work can be measured by the significant increase in usage of NSAIDs         on farm" (Source 6).
The named research clinicians and wider farm animal group at Nottingham       have a long-standing       relationship with XLVets, based on undergraduate training and knowledge       sharing allowing the       development and promotion of initiatives such as this.
In a similar       statement (2013) the President       of the British Cattle Veterinary Association (BVCA) stated, "The         reinforcement of appropriate         analgesia messages at BCVA CPD and at BCVA Congress in particular has         been prominently         delivered by the Nottingham team in partnership with BI" (Source         7).
It is clear that the underpinning research from UoN, combined with       expertise in clinical practice and       collaboration with industry, has driven forward an on-going industry wide       promotional campaign to       change veterinary prescribing habits and increase analgesic usage on farm.
This has led to a       substantial change in the use of NSAIDs in cattle and a direct improvement       in animal health and       welfare in the UK.
