     Stars `r' Us!
uses highly interactive exhibits to show how information       obtained from telescopic       observations, laboratory experiments and computer modelling is used to       infer clues about the       possible chemical origins of life.
McCoustra led the development of the       exhibition, with       contributions from UCL, the OU, Leiden Observatory and Royal Observatory       Greenwich.
Over       &#163;25,000 was initially secured from various sources to fund the exhibition       including grant [A] above.
However this initial investment was supplemented by addition funding in       2006 ([B] and [C] above to       an estimated total of &#163;10,000) and most recently in 2010 (from [D] to a       value estimated at &#163;7,500).
Operating costs for SRU activities come from sources including the British       Council, RSC, ESF and       SRU partners.
Resources created to accompany SRU include a comprehensive teacher's pack       which has been       distributed to hundreds of schools.
The team has also developed a session       for school       engagement.
Stars `r' Us!
is a key plank of Heriot-Watt University's       public engagement strategy,       during a period which has seen annual applications for undergraduate       places on Chemistry degree       programmes increase from 547 in 2004 to 734 in 2013.
There has also been a       commensurate rise       in quality of students accepted into our Chemistry courses, demonstrated       by the increase in UCAS       tariff by fifty points over the same period.
4.1 In depth engagement with adults of all socioeconomic groups       The Stars `r' Us!
team has actively sought engagement with audiences from       a wide range of       different demographics.
With this in mind, we have toured the exhibition       around shopping centres       as part of an RSC programme, and took it to the International Scout       Jamboree.
More recently the       exhibition has featured at Our Dynamic Earth (ODE) three times during the       REF period as part of       the Edinburgh International Science Festival (EISF) and once at Cheltenham       Science Festival.
A       senior UK academic astronomer states:     "Stars `r' Us!
has been a highly effective piece of work with an         enduring life and one that works for         diverse audiences of all ages and backgrounds".
EISF at Our Dynamic Earth Science Centre in 2008, 2009 and 2011       Exhibiting at ODE offers a great opportunity for scientists to engage with       families and independent       adults across the social spectrum (a quarter of ODE's visitors are from       socioeconomic group       C2DE).
For example, in 2009, this included a group of Hibernian football       fans!
The SRU team       invites experts to collaborate in the exhibition and programme.
Over the       weekend of operation in       ODE in 2011 some 1000 visits were recorded (an average of 330 per day for       the Friday to Sunday       period).
Taking this as a realistic average footfall per day at each of       our activities then a total       footfall of 11,000 can be estimated, excluding the additional auditable       earlier figures from the Royal       Society Summer Exhibitions and more recently (see below) at the Cheltenham       Science Festival.
The Public Astronomer, from the Royal Observatory Greenwich comments:     "The Stars `r' Us!
activity has been an amazingly effective piece of         public engagement and I've         enjoyed helping to present it on a number of occasions.
As an astronomer         and a professional         science communicator I've been very impressed by the excellent mix of         exhibits, pictures,         interpretation and live demos that comprise Stars `r' Us!
This variety         and flexibility has ... allowed it         to engage a huge number of people in a wide range of different venues.
One of its great strengths         has been the way in which it has been used to bring together researchers         from a variety of different         institutes and fields of expertise and it has also proved itself as an         excellent training ground for         students and young researchers, allowing them to hone their creativity         and public engagement         skills."
One former SRU helper has gone on to join the staff of the Royal       Observatory Greenwich as an       assistant to the Public Astronomer.
Cheltenham Science Festival 2013 (Area 42 - for over 14s)       Over 900 people visited Stars'r'Us!
at Cheltenham Science Festival.
The       Festival attracts a broad       social mix with approximately half of visitors coming from socio-economic       group C2DE.
SRU       visitors enjoyed in-depth interactions (6-7 minutes on average) with       researchers that led to a wide       range of new learning from specific details on complex theories such as       gravity waves to how       different colours of light relate to the composition of stars.
Visitors reported particular appreciation for being able to talk directly       to researchers and       discovering subjects that would not be covered by mainstream media.
They       felt strongly that giving       young people the opportunity to meet researchers informs and influences       their education and       career choices.
Having visited SRU, visitors also voiced clear support for       publicly-funded, curiosity       driven research (57% expressed a positive attitude; 30% had no strong       opinion; 13% expressed       support with caveats).
The Programme Director, Cheltenham Science       Festival, said:     "Cheltenham Science Festival really values the contribution that         exhibitions such as Stars `r' Us!
make to Times Area 42.
These exhibitions offer a fantastic opportunity         for visitors to discuss cutting         edge contemporary research with the scientists who are undertaking the         work and are a rare         opportunity for an in-depth exchange of information and views on         everything from fundamental         scientific principles to funding."
4.2 Engagement with schools       Stars `r' Us!
has provided information about contemporary science and       science careers to       thousands of young people.
In recent years, this has included       participation in HWU's Get SET       widening-participation days.
These popular events are an exciting and       stimulating opportunity to       inspire girls to consider study and careers in science and engineering.
McCoustra has also run Stars `r' Us!
schools' sessions with over 600       students in Scotland and       northern England.
Feedback from teachers shows that these activities have       encouraged       numerous young people, including many in remote geographical locations, to       change their       perceptions of science and has influenced their educational choices.
"[Our students] thoroughly enjoyed it and some were more motivated           to go on and study           ..[science]... at a higher level" Teacher, James Young High         School, Livingston       "They were more aware of other courses (rather than just physics or           chemistry) to study at           university and not just the same three as at school".
Teacher,         Earlston High School       "We are a small island school.
We very much benefit from programmes           where visiting           speakers can show our students a little of the opportunities that           exist on the mainland."
Teacher, Islay High School          4.3 Engagement with EU policy makers &#8212; Astrochemistry &#8212; The Cradle of         Life event       In 2011, Stars `r' Us!
was invited by the European Science Foundation       (ESF) and European       Cooperation in Science to take part in an astrochemistry event organised       for the EU Commission       and Parliament and held at the Natural History Museum in Brussels.
EU       politicians and civil       servants attended a reception to raise awareness of astrochemistry at a       trans-national level.
"Bringing Stars `r' Us!
to an audience of European Commissioners and         the general public helped to         raise the profile of astrochemistry in the EC.
I believe that activities         of this kind are an important         contributory factor to the favourable discussions regarding         astrochemistry in the development of         Horizon 2020/Framework Programme 8."
Chair of European Science       Foundation     In February 2013, The European Commission Consultation On Possible Topics       For Future       Activities For Integrating And Opening Existing National Research       Infrastructures Report cited       (page 24) European Laboratory Astrophysics as a topic with high potential       and with merit for future       Horizon 2020 actions for integrating and opening existing national       research infrastructures.
