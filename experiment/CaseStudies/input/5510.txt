     Economic and cultural impact, India.
The Ahmedabad International Arts Festival www.aiaf.in       (AIAF) was a significant outcome of the research underpinning this case       study.
In five years, the AIAF has grown from a single event in 2009 to a       multi-stranded international Festival attracting visitors from all over       the globe.
MMU's research has played a key role in the growth and       development of AIAF as underlined by its Director who states, "The         participation of artists from MIRIAD...has had a significant impact upon         the cultural life of the city.
Most important of these has been the         impact on the AIAF which was crystallised at a think tank with inputs         from John Hyatt and MMU.
AIAF values the significant contribution of MMU         each year."
AIAF's Director goes on to articulate the individual       impacts of MMU researchers involvement in specific projects [A and B].
Further international impact has been realised in India (HAT Project       exhibition, British Council, New Delhi, 2007, 600 visitors over 10 days)       and has brought the work of traditional makers to international attention       (Shamji Vishram Siju, Blackburn Museum residency 2012) thereby developing       new markets for traditional crafts makers and their products.
This       research is ongoing, aiming to provide new opportunities and continuing       employment for traditional makers.
It is our belief that such direct       action will save a number of craft practices from being lost.
The unit's collaborative approach is epitomised by Welsh, who used       traditional Indian garments as the basis for her research project Translating         Tradition [6a].
She worked with Indian tailors to develop       garments that retain long-established stitching techniques but have appeal       to a 21st- century western audience.
Prototype designs were tested in the       Made for Manchester exhibition, at the Asia Triennial         Manchester 2011.
She has extended this research in conjunction with       The Khamir Project, based in Kutch, the heartland of Gujarat textiles       practice.
This ongoing project involves growers, weavers and spinners in       the re-introduction of organic cotton as the basis of a sustainable       industry.
(This is more resilient to drought and disease, and allows       farmers to harvest the seeds, unlike its genetically engineered       equivalent).
As the Director of the Khamir Project states [C], "By         spreading the message of Kala Cotton internationally, Alison's project         has opened the space for discussion on rain-fed species and building         indigenous, local strengths into robust economies.
This is unleashing         new collaborations and cutting edge R&amp;D."     Welsh has collaborated with Indian weaver Shamji Vishram Siju on textile       and product design, with the goal of producing viable, economic and       desirable garments.
Prototype garments were exhibited in Field to         Fashion, Queen's Gallery, British Council, Delhi, November 2013.
In the Drawing the Line project, Senior research Fellow Alice Kettle       shared a residency at Arts Reverie with traditional Madhubani artist       Pushpa Kumari in July 2011.
Lacking a common language, and without a       translator, they communicated through a shared knowledge and understanding       of drawing, and collaborated on works which were shown in the exhibition Drawing         the Line, Extending the Line for the Asia Triennial, Manchester       2011, thereby introducing Kumari's work to a new and international       audience.
Similarly, the Warli Film Project (2012) continues a series of       internationally distributed short documentary films on Indian crafts made       by Johnny Magee for the HAT project.
[4] It focuses on the       practice of the `Master' Warli painter, Jivya Soma Mashe, and in       particular examines the ways that this traditional form of practice (which       documents the daily lives of the tribal Warli community) has evolved in       order to engage with contemporary audiences and markets.
Shown at The       Loft, Mumbai, November 2013.
Cultural impact in the UK     Research conducted by the unit has succeeded in bringing new audiences       into museums, through projects combining traditional and contemporary       craft practices, in collaboration with Lancashire Museums Service and the       ACE Renaissance programme [D].
Cotton Exchange (part of       the ACE Cultural Olympiad project Global Threads) explored the       shared histories and legacies of cotton manufacture between Northwest       England and Northwest India.
Five members of the unit (Dixon, Kettle,       Mitchison, Welsh, Zapp) participated in the project, creating a series of       installation works, first exhibited at Queens Street Mill, Burnley (2012),       and subsequently in Rajnagar Mill, Ahmedabad (2013).
These installations       were designed with the specific intention of engaging diverse audiences       that would not normally visit a museum.
(Over 700 visitors to Rajnagar       Mill over 4 days).
Talking about the impact that MMU researchers had on       Global Threads the Partnership Manager for Renaissance Northwest says "MIRIAD         researchers...worked together to raise the international ambitions of         the project, to develop new skills and new relationships.
This meant         that it was possible to generate significant amounts of additional         funding to make these projects happen; we estimate that nearly &#163;500,000         funding was secured in addition to its core funding...the Artists from         MIRIAD added a whole new dimension to Global Threads and Cotton Exchange         in terms of delivery, but most importantly, in terms of its legacy.
This         partnership with the MIRIAD researchers enabled Global Threads to reach         new audiences by creating new perspectives and insights on the         collections and museum offer of Queen Street Mill."
[E]     Similarly, the ongoing Asia Triennial Manchester (ATM: see case study) [6]       under the directorship of MIRIAD Research Fellow Alnoor Mitha, has brought       contemporary Art and Craft practices from South and East Asia to       significant new audiences.
(229,000 visitors, ATM 2011)     Environmental impact in India     An un-anticipated impact of the project is the attention that the       research has brought to the specific area of Ahmedabad in which the Arts       Reverie House is situated: Dal Ni Pol.
This area of acute architectural       heritage is in danger of unsympathetic redevelopment of the sort that will       pay little attention to the historic quality of the buildings.
In response       to this issue, the aim of the Pol Project [5] was to work       with the people of the Pol to develop artistic interventions drawing       attention to their threatened urban and social environment.
This       collaborative activity centred on `otlas' (doorsteps), which were       identified as a focus of social interaction, and resulted in a       documentary/participatory film, screened in the Pol (Ravetz) and       site-specific installation works, O'Neill, Dixon (1,000 visitors).
The       focus that the project has brought to the Pol has led to a more       enlightened attitude towards developments within that urban area, and lent       significant support to the work of the Centre for Heritage Management at       Ahmedabad University in the development of policies that will protect       against the demolition of significant structures and the against       construction of new buildings that are unsympathetic to the significant       heritage of the location [F].
