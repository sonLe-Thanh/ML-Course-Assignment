     Two broad spheres of impact are outlined below along with some of the       pathways (links) to these       impacts.
Impact is seen in changes in the ways key actors view       `research-use processes' and the       actions that followed from such improved understandings.
Impact has been facilitated by the way in which members of RURU have       sought to engage with       policy and practice audiences both during the research process and       following the publication of       findings.
This has involved working with many bodies (see examples below)       as they seek to       understand the implications of our research for their organisations.
RURU's impact has also been       achieved by `secondary links' as existing users apply, cite and recommend       our work to others (see       examples below).
In this way the reach of our influence, direct and       indirect, has crossed country       and sector boundaries (e.g.
criminal justice, education, health and social       care).
The ultimate over-arching 	  significance of our impact lies in more effective research       investment, redesigned knowledge 	  sharing activities, improved public policy making and enhanced       public service delivery.
The       reach and significance of this impact was recognised in 2011 by the       Campbell Collaboration when       Nutley was presented with the Robert Boruch Award for research that       informs public policy, see       http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/news_/Boruch_Award_to_Sandra_Nutley.php.
Influence on the strategies and practices of research funding           bodies       RURU's influence is evident in the strategies and activities of at least       six research funding bodies       and details of four of these are provided below: the ESRC (UK); the WT       Grant Foundation (US),       the NIHR SDO Programme (UK) and the Australian NHMRC.
In 2005 RURU was approached by the ESRC to carry out underpinning       research for an       international symposium on `Assessing the non-academic impact of social       science research'.
We       co-wrote a briefing paper for that symposium as well as a subsequent       report (Davies, Nutley &amp;       Walter 2005).
This report and subsequent research (Nutley, Walter &amp;       Davies 2007) is widely cited       in two ESRC policy documents on research impact assessment: Taking         Stock (2009 - S6) and       Branching Out (2010 - S7).
The influence of RURU's research       has also been confirmed by       testimony from ESRC's Head of Evaluation, Strategy and Analysis who       commented that `RURU's         work has underpinned the way in which we conceptualise and understand         research impact... we         are now much better able to articulate the linkages between research         findings, application,         influence and impact' (S1)     In 2008, the WT Grant Foundation (New York) drew on RURU's work when       initiating a new stream       of funding exploring the use of evidence in the United States.
RURU's       influence is evidenced in the       2008 and 2010 Calls for Proposals, which refer extensively to RURU       publications (S8).
These       formal statements are heavily influenced by direct dialogue with RURU and       the provision of       bespoke reviews drawing on RURU research.
The Vice President, WT Grant       Foundation, has       commented that RURU's research has `played a defining role' in the       Foundation's `support of the         use of research evidence in policy and practice... More than any other         body of work, [it] has         shaped our understanding of the field and promising directions for         future work' (S2).
In 2008-2009, RURU's work had a major influence on the National Institute       for Health Research       Service Delivery and Organisation (NIHR SDO) programme's decision to       invest around &#163;3.5m in       knowledge mobilisation activities, and Davies was invited to direct this       programme on secondment       (40%fte; 2008-10).
Other NIHR investments, such as the CLAHRCs       (collaborative partnerships       between universities and surrounding NHS organisations) have been directly       influenced by       RURU's work: Davies sat on the original funding panel (c. &#163;90m; 2008) and       chaired the panel for       second round funding (c. &#163;124m; 2013); he also commissioned the external       evaluations of the       original CLAHRCs through NIHR SDO (c. &#163;2m of research investment; 2009),       and committed       extensive time to supporting all nine CLAHRCs during their establishment       while on secondment to       NIHR (20%fte; 2008-2010).
Evidence of the influence of RURU's work on the       practices of the       CLAHRCs is provided by testimony from one of their directors, who reported       that `the social and         interactive model of knowledge co-production articulated in Using         Evidence and promulgated by         Davies &amp; Nutley through RURU ... provided a guiding philosophy for         much of our work ... for which         we have been commended nationally and internationally' (S3).
Influenced by the CLAHRCs, a similar combined `research, policy and       practice' initiative was       launched by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council       (NHMRC) in 2012.
Due       to the importance of RURU's work as an underpinning guide, Davies was       invited to sit on the       Expert Advisory Panel to help shape this investment (c. A$70m) in line       with the research insights       identified in Section 2.
Influence on the thinking and actions of those supporting policy           and practice development       RURU's influence has been particularly marked amongst analysts and       trainers working in       government departments, and those working in intermediary bodies tasked       with improving the use       of research in public services.
Indirectly, therefore, the underpinning       research in this case supports       improved public services through the better application of evidence.
Examples below are drawn       from Canada, the US and the UK.
RURU's work directly shaped the thinking and practices of the Research       Division of Ontario's       Ministry of Education 2008-2012, as it began to place more emphasis on       knowledge mobilisation.
`RURU's work was influential in the design and development of a new         Ontario Research and         Evaluation Strategy by the Ontario Ministry of Education.
Particularly         important... was evidence         from RURU about the need to pay attention to developing individual and         organisational capacity for         research use and to developing a strategy for the systemic use of         research' (Founding Director of       the Education Research and Evaluation Strategy Branch, Ontario Ministry of       Education - S4).
This       impact was facilitated through the provision of web-based resources and       site visits (Nutley, 2011).
In addition, RURU's work shaped the thinking and activities of Quebec's       National Institute for       Public Health (INSPQ).
In 2009, INSPQ produced a knowledge transfer guide,       which built on and       cited RURU's work (S10).
RURU's wide dissemination of research       outputs led to the initial impact,       and Nutley subsequently visited Quebec in June 2011 to work directly with       staff from INSPQ and       other colleagues interested in further developing knowledge transfer       activities in Quebec.
Further west in Canada, RURU's work influenced the development and       delivery of British       Columbia's internal training programme on evidence-informed policy (2009),       and a copy of Using         Evidence (Nutley, Walter &amp; Davies 2007) was provided by the       Province to all civil servants on this       course (250 copies in total).
The dissemination activities of RURU enabled       this impact and RURU's       influence was reinforced when Nutley took up the offer to work with       members of the Office of the       Chief Information Officer for several weeks in 2009.
More recently, in 2012, the US National Research Council of the National       Academies (`Advisers to       the Nation on Science, Engineering and Medicine') produced an       authoritative digest on `Using       Science as Evidence in Public Policy', a distillation of expert input from       a committee of sixteen US       experts meeting over a three-year period (2009-12).
The work of RURU is       cited eight times in the       document, with extensive quotes drawn from Using Evidence (Nutley,       Walter &amp; Davies 2007) [S9].
A final example is RURU's impact on the UK Alliance for Useful Evidence       and the What Works       Evidence Centres for Social Policy (www.alliance4usefulevidence.org).
RURU       has `contributed to         and shaped Alliance debates on what counts as evidence and how research         use can be improved'       (Manager, Alliance for Useful Evidence - S5).
Davies, Nutley and       Powell have been actively       engaged with the emerging activities of the Alliance during 2012 and 2013       through dialogue,       commissioned pieces of work, blogs and participation in events.
They       co-wrote an Alliance       provocation paper on What counts as good evidence?
(which can be       found at:       http://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org/assets/What-Counts-as-Good-Evidence-WEB.pdf).
This       was subsequently picked up by UK Cabinet Office advisors who sought RURU's       advice on the       operation of the What Works centres (announced by the UK Government in       March 2013).
