     Kenna and Berche's research on critical mass has been reported       many times in print and online       media and has had impact on research policy all over the world, leading       directly to policy changes.
Impacts on public policy and services       There is documented evidence of Kenna's research having an impact       on policy debate in       Parliament, EU Directorate and policy-orientated think tanks.
There is       also evidence that the       research has been used by lobbying organisations, professional       associations and the media to       inform or change policy on research quality.
Informing French research policy change: The Conseil National des       Universit&#233;s (CNU) is       France's national body whose role includes the assessment of academics and       evaluation of       research groups (similar to the UK's REF but with a broader remit).
Professor Georges Landa,       President of CNU's section 28 (Physics), states that, prior to engaging       with Kenna's research, the       CNU assessed academics solely using metrics such as the numbers and       quality of publications.
However, now it takes the size of the research group into account.
Landa       believes that, as a result       of Kenna's research, the CNU's assessment of individual       researchers is now more accurate and       fair [a].
He has also stated "I am totally convinced of the necessity to       take into account the size of       groups or labs" [a].
Through its impact on the CNU, Kenna's work       has impacted on every       university in France and, by extension, to every academic employed in       French universities.
Influencing EU policy: Dr James Gavigan was Head of the EU's Unit       for European Research       Area policy in DG Research, from 2006 to 2012.
His job was to develop       initiatives to increase the       amount, impact and overall efficiency of research carried out in the EU.
He stated to Kenna "Your       work on critical mass is certainly relevant and interesting for the       research policy debate at EU level,       as led by the European Commission in Brussels.
In that regard, in my role       as Head of the       European Research Area Policy Unit which I occupied up to the end of       August 2012, I read with       interest your work and circulated it within the Research and Innovation       Directorate General" [b].
Informing UK parliamentary debate: In 2010, Dr Jonathan Adams,       Director of Research       Evaluation at Evidence, a Thomson Reuters business (now called Research       Analytics), wrote: "We       were interested to see your article reported in the Times Higher       Education...
This is very helpful       and we would very much like to get advice on when the papers go into       publication...
I am passing       on your information to colleagues at BIS, and hope that is OK with you."
As a result Kenna (with       Berche, co-author) presented the research evidence to the House of Commons       Science &amp;       Technology Committee on Peer Review.

Research used as the basis for critical reviews of policy in the         media: Journalist Paul Jump is       the senior science and research reporter at Times Higher Education       (THE).
One of his three       articles on the implications of Kenna's work has been viewed by       over 2,000 people online in       addition to the 60,000 per week hard-copy readers.
Jump believes Kenna's       work is relevant to       policy-making on "whether research funding should be concentrated on large       research intensive       universities, as the Russell Group argue", or whether size should be taken       into account more       explicitly in the allocation of research funding [c].
Jump's articles show       there has been considered,       wider, public engagement with the research, and a policy issue has been       raised for research       funding in the UK.
Stimulation of policy debate: The Foundation for Science and       Technology provides a `neutral       platform for debate of policy issues that have a science, engineering or       technology element'.
It is       directed by a Council including heads of the Royal Society, British       Academy, Research Councils       and others.
The Foundation provides support to around 140 learned &amp;       professional societies.
Paper [1] influenced an Editorial by Sir John Enderby on "the dilemma of       science and research       funding" in the Journal of the Foundation for Science and Technology       [Vol 20, No.
6 (2011) page       4].
The research also influenced the Russell Group policy report Jewels         in the Crown: the         Importance and Characteristics of the UK's World-Class Universities,       Russell Group Papers, Issue       4, 2012, which stated `A study using research assessment exercises in the       UK and France to look       at the relationship between quality and number of researchers submitted,       found evidence of       maximum and minimum thresholds for group size in a range of subjects' [d].
Engagement with practitioners and professional services: Kenna       and Berche have been       commissioned to write articles for a number professional journals and       newsletters.
These included       Research Intelligence, the membership publication of the British       Educational Research       Association; Reflets de la Physique, the magazine of the French       Physics Society, of which 4,000       copies per issue are distributed; Mathematics Today, the       membership publication of the Institute of         Mathematics and its Applications which has a bimonthly readership of       4,500 professional       mathematicians; Significance, which is the membership magazine for       the Royal Statistical Society,       the American Statistical Association and Reports of the National Academy       of Sciences of Ukraine       in 2013.
In addition, Europhysics News published an article based       on Kenna's research (The         relationship between quality and quantity in research, Vol.41, No.5,       2010, page 15).
This bimonthly       publication is the "voice of the European Physical Society" which       has 41 national Member       Societies, representing over 120,000 members.
Europhysics News has       25,000 copies per issue       which go to relevant university departments and key players the world       over.
These and other       articles were translated into many languages including Greek, Russian,       Ukrainian and Vietnamese       and reverberated around the world through websites, blogs, online media       and discussion forums.
Influence on campaigns and debate by international lobbying groups and         NGOs: The       following give examples of use of the research to support campaigns to       protect research funding:            Sauvons l'Universite (formerly Sauvons la Recherche) is a French         association working to         defend values and research funding in the French university system, to         promote collegial work         and to campaign for reforms in the HE sector.
In 2011 they ran a         detailed report on papers [1-         3].

The Association of Swedish Higher Education (SUHF in English) is "an         organisation for         institutional co-operation" comprising 41 universities in Sweden.
The         Association "aims at         safeguarding the external interests of the institutions and at         strengthening their internal co-         operation."
In November 2011, an SUHF Experts Committee on Quality         issued a report on         "Research Quality and the Role of University Leadership".
Their         recommendations regarding         group size were influence by [2].

The Norwegian Network for Private Higher Education Institutions         advocates on issues         concerning HE and research policy to the Norwegian parliament.
Following         publication of         Kenna's OECD Higher Education Management and Policy paper         [5], in March 2012 the         Network placed a review on its website of the research and its         implications.
See         http://www.nph.no/?idnr=167         (in Norwegian).
Dr Arne J Eriksen, Secretary General of the         Norwegian Network for Private Higher Education Institutes, stated that Kenna's         research "is         important for the development of national and institutional         strategies/policies and priorities".
Kenna's research was cited in a Policy Discussion on the use of         metrics in evaluating         research, documented in the Proceedings of the International Congress of         Mathematicians,         Hyderabad 2010, Volume 1 Plenary Lectures and Ceremonies, Ed.

Panel included Doug Arnold (President of SIAM), Malcolm         MacCallum (Director         of the Heilbronn Institute and Member, Research Policy Committee, London         Mathematical         Society), Jos&#233; Antonio de Pena, (Director of the Mathematical Institute         at the National         University of Mexico and former President of UMALCA (Mathematical Union         of Latin America         and the Caribbean)) and Frank Pacard (Scientific Advisor of Mathematics         in the French         Ministry of Higher Education and Research).
Articles and interviews in media: Articles in Times Higher         Education (THE) [e], University         Business [f] , Research Professional [g] and the New         Zealand Herald appeared in 2010 following       interviews with Kenna.
THE publishes 28,000 copies per       issue, has 60,000 readers per week and       THE online registers over 650,000 users globally each month.
University         Business is read by       senior management across 165 Universities and over 350 HE and FE colleges       throughout the UK.
It has a circulation of 6,000 and a readership of 8,500.
In 2011, Research         Trends reported on [1-4]       [h].
In 2012 another interview with Kenna prompted further       articles in THE [e] and University         Business [f] following publication of [5].
In 2011 Kenna was       also interviewed for Physics World [i].
Physics World has a circulation of 35,000 and a readership of       110,000.
These articles and       interviews were translated and reproduced many times worldwide.
In 2013,       following publication of       [6] Kenna was again interviewed by Times Higher Education       [e].
Influencing a commercial organisation's evaluation of excellence:       Verisk Analytics is "a       leading source of information about risk", offering "risk-assessment       services and decision analytics       to professionals in many fields" (6,000+ employees including 500 with       advanced degrees, 200+       actuaries with $1.5billion in revenue in 2012).
At their Investor Day in       2013, Scott Stephenson,       president and Chief Executive Officer of Verisk Analytics, used Kenna's       work in a presentation on       "Operating Strategy and Innovation" showing that excellence is achievable       at modest scale [j].
Conclusion       Kenna and co-workers' research has provided much-needed rigour to       the concept of `critical mass'       in research groups.
Their work has directly led to a change in French       policy on the assessment of       its academics.
Furthermore, it has stimulated significant discussion by       policy makers and think       tanks working in the field, in the UK, EU and beyond.
