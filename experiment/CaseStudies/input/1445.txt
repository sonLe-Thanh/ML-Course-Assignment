     The main beneficiaries of Macfarlane's work have been (1) the public who       have benefited from improved cultural life, (2) the publishing and       broadcasting sectors who have benefited from the economic prosperity       associated with the sale of his books, (3) artists inspired by his       research to new forms of creative practice, and (4) students of higher       education who have either been inspired to develop new creative forms       based on Macfarlane's writings or to attend newly established courses.
The primary means by which Macfarlane's research has reached these       beneficiaries has been through his published books, which have also been       adopted onto university courses.
All three have been converted into BBC       productions, the latter two in the impact period: The Wild Places was       adapted as `The Wild Places of Essex' by the Natural History Unit for BBC2       (Feb 2010, re- screened March 2013).
An abridged version of The Old Ways       was broadcast as Book of the Week on BBC Radio 4 (July 2012), and the book       and its author featured on `Ramblings' with Clare Balding on Radio 4 (June       2013) [1].
During the impact period Macfarlane was invited to give more       than fifty public lectures at venues including schools, bookshops and       literary festivals, amounting to a total audience of c.5000 members of the       public.
Particularly notable audiences have included the Hay Literary       Festival in 2012 and 2013 (total audience numbers c.1400) and the       Edinburgh Book Festival 2012 (320).
Macfarlane's research has resulted in the enrichment of cultural life.
Sales figures at April 2013 for example stand at c.107,000 copies of his Mountains         of the Mind (2003) in the UK, US and Commonwealth to date ; c.88,000       copies of The Wild Places (2007) in the UK, US and Commonwealth to       date [2].
Although published less than a year ago, The Old Ways       has had similar success, selling c. 65,000 copies in hardback in UK, US       and Commonwealth to date [3].
It entered the Sunday Times Bestseller Chart       for non-fiction at number 3, and stayed in the top 10 for twelve weeks.
The paperback of The Old Ways was published on 30th May       2013, and has been in the Sunday Times bestseller chart for       paperback non-fiction for eight weeks at time of writing.
Between them the       books have been translated into ten languages     The significance of the research to readers is clear in their positive       responses to all three books, conveyed in the form of letters to the       author (of which he has received more than 1000) and public reader       testimonials.
For example, one reader of all three books wrote to say that       Macfarlane's writing had "opened my eyes to the surrounding landscape more       than [any other writer].
I can honestly say you have changed my outlook       and my reading habits" [4].
Another commended "the impact of the work you       put in and the ripples from it ...By work I mean all your travelling, all       your experiencing, all the cold you felt, all your wonder, all your muscle       effort, all your emotions and so on, worded in the pages you wrote, that       ripples out into others, like myself and creates awarenesses [we] didn't       know existed" [5].
The books have made popular television and radio.
In September 2009 The         Wild Places was the subject of a half-hour programme with estimated       audience 1.3 million [6].
The book was also adapted into an hour-long       film, screened on BBC 2 on 10 February 2010 with an estimated audience of       1.5 million (source, BBC).
Viewers were enthusiastic.
One commented,       "[What] a visually stunning, lyrically beautiful and unexpectedly       emotional, wonderful film" [7].
Another stated that the film was "one of       the most beautiful and thought-provoking wildlife films I have ever seen"       [8].
The impact of Macfarlane's books in the publishing industry and on the       wider culture is shown in the exceptional number of awards they have       received.
Mountains of the Mind (2003) won the       Guardian         First Book Award, the Somerset         Maugham Award, and the Sunday         Times Young Writer Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature and       the John         Llewellyn Rhys Prize.
The Wild Places (2007) won the Boardman         Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature in 2007 and the Scottish Arts       Council Non-Fiction Book Of The Year Award 2008.
In November 2008, it was       joint winner of the Grand Prize at the Banff Mountain Festival, North       America's equivalent of the Boardman Tasker Prize.
It was shortlisted for       six further prizes, including the Dolman         Best Travel Book Award, the Sunday         Times Young Writer of the Year Award, the John         Llewellyn Rhys Prize, and North America's Orion Book Award, a prize       founded "to recognize books that deepen our connection to the natural       world, present new ideas about our relationship with nature, and achieve       excellence in writing."
The Old Ways (2012) was shortlisted for       The Samuel Johnson Prize (the `non-fiction Booker'), the Duff-Cooper Prize       for Non-Fiction, the Waterstones Book of the Year Award, the Foyles Best       Book of Ideas Prize, the Dolman Prize for Travel Literature, and       longlisted for The Jan Michalski Prize for World Literature and the       Warwick Prize for Writing, In the US it was shortlisted for the Orion Book       Award.
Macfarlane's work has generated new ways of thinking that influence       creative practice beyond the academy.
His work on Orford Ness in The         Wild Places led to a joint commission by the National Trust and Arts       Council for a site-specific performance on the Ness, with jazz musician       Arnie Somogyi and visual artists Jane and Louise Wilson, `Untrue Island',       8-30 July 2012, adopted as a regional event in the Cultural Olympiad [9].
Visual artist Bethan Lloyd Worthington was inspired by The Wild Places       to drawings for a one-off selection of fine bone china tableware [10] and         The Old Ways has inspired the photographer David Quentin to mount a       commercial exhibition of photography, `Silt', with text by Macfarlane, at       4 Windmill Street Gallery [11].
Furthermore, the research has inspired       students to develop new creative forms, as for example the students at       Colchester School of Art in 2013 who put together an exhibition of `works       that respond creatively to the physical space of the Minories building and       to the students' readings of Robert MacFarlane's book Mountains of the         Mind' [12].
Students of higher education have benefited from Macfarlane's research,       as it has influenced the establishment and structuring of new Masters       courses in various kinds of `cultural environmentalism'/'writing nature'       at Bath Spa, UEA, Essex and Exeter; at Essex and Exeter his books are set       texts [13].
Numbers on the course at Bath Spa were 4 last year; 8-12 are       expected next year.
Students on the MA course at Essex are 3-6 p.a.
