     In recent years, the uptake of physics at A-level has experienced a       resurgence.
From a low of 27,368 in 2006, the number of A-level entries       climbed to 32,860 in 2011.
Figures from UCAS revealed an approximately       2,000 increase in students applying for physics courses at UK universities       between 2011 and 2012.
This 8.3% rise is at odds with an overall 8.7%       decline in university applicants across the UK.
While it is impossible to       measure the individual contribution of Vukusic's public engagement       campaigns &#8212; based wholly on 15 years of his research into natural       photonics &#8212; to this popularity upswing, his outreach activities have       formed a significant part of the UK physics community's wider successful       efforts to capture the public imagination, which in turn has extended the       reach of Vukusic's activities to Ireland and Africa.
Building on the schools tour in 2007, Vukusic initiated subsequent tours       of the Light Fantastic: The Science of Colour lectures for young       people [5.1]: between 2008 and 2013 he gave 160 presentations (the       majority in the UK) to primary and secondary schools.
The lectures set out       to elucidate the science behind light and colour to stimulate students'       curiosity beyond the classroom, and were designed to complement the       National Curriculum and its Scottish and Irish equivalents.
The lectures       featured the electromagnetic spectrum, how colour is produced when light       interacts with structures, how structural colour is produced and used in       nature, and how examples of natural structural colour are       influencing new technology and products, from cosmetics to fashion.
The impact of the 2007 tour continued throughout the REF period.
The IOP       filmed Vukusic's original lecture and distributed 5,000 free DVDs to       IOP-member schools.
In January 2012, it was uploaded to YouTube [5.2] and       has been viewed over 17,000 times so far.
The majority of viewers are from       the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and India.
The video was uploaded as a       teaching resource on the TES UK and India websites in 2012 and 2013, where       it is freely available for 2.5m registered online users in 274 countries.
Demonstrating the success of the lectures, Vukusic was awarded the       British Association of Science Lord Kelvin Prize for science lecturing in       2008.
He received repeat invitations from many schools, for example a       lecture at Rugby School in January 2013 led to a request for him to return       in June for the 25th anniversary of the IOP teachers' meeting.
Following       one lecture at The Westgate School in Slough, the Deputy Head wrote that       Vukusic's talk had "completely changed a number of students' (many of whom       had previously failed the 11+) feelings towards pursuing their studies at       university level."
[5.3].
In 2011, Vukusic, again funded by the IOP, took the lecture series to       Ireland [5.4] where he reached more than 4,500 schoolchildren and 50       teachers through 11 lectures that tied in with the school curriculum.
The       tour was organised in response to declining numbers of Irish       schoolchildren taking physics at Leaving Certificate level.
Writing in the       Irish Times in 2012, the Chair of the IOP in Ireland said that a quarter       of schools were not offering the subject at Leaving Certificate level.
In May 2012, the IOP provided `in kind' (stationery, textbooks, DVDs) and       logistical support to enable Vukusic to take his lecture series to Africa.
This contributed to the IOP's international programme, which seeks to       advance physics in the developing world for economic and social benefit.
Vukusic arranged lectures at five schools in the poorest parts of the       Ethiopian capital Addis-Adaba, reaching more than 1100 students and 15       teachers [5.5, 5.6].
The Director of the Addis-Ababa Education Bureau       said: `...surprisingly enough, social science students who took part         in your public lecture have insisted to be members of the science and         technology club to whom we have accepted their appeal [5.6]."
Vukusic took the lecture tour to Tanzania and on to Malawi, where he       visited eight rural schools over four days, reaching 1,500 pupils and 55       teachers.
This trip was part-funded by Ripple Africa, a charity that works       to improve quality of education.
The charity's programme lead said Vukusic       was "an inspiration" to the students, commenting that the lectures       complemented the Malawian science syllabus.
He asked Vukusic to return       every year [5.7].
Vukusic's lectures have also engaged adult audiences.
He exhibited his       photonics research at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in 2011 and,       since 2008, has given talks at five major science festivals, including a       Royal Society event in Tokyo in 2008 and the Dublin Science Festival in       2009.
He has given talks to 37 clubs and societies and media appearances       since 2008 include BBC Radio 2 Drivetime with Chris Evans, Material         World on BBC Radio 4 and National Geographic News.
In July 2013, Vukusic was awarded the distinguished Royal Society Kohn       Award for excellence in engaging the public with Science [5.8].
