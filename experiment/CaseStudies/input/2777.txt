     Our research has had wide ranging and significant impact in the following       areas:     (A) Shaping and influencing national and international biofuel and         land-use policies            In 2010, Page was invited to an EU-JRC consultation workshop to         discuss GHG emissions         associated with indirect land-use change (iLUC) from biofuel production.
This led to         consultancy with the International Council for Clean Transportation         which was seeking to         lobby for more stringent biofuels policies.
Page's resulting review         argued that studies of         palm oil plantation expansion in SE Asia had significantly         underestimated peatland GHG         emissions and thereby palm biofuel iLUC emissions.
The EU commissioned         several JRC         reports citing Leicester research leading to a proposal to amend the EU         Renewable Energy         Directive by requiring reporting on emissions from iLUC in EU         eligibility rules for biofuel         feedstocks.
In the USA, the Environmental Protection Agency found palm biodiesel         offered a 17%         carbon saving, based on peat emission values published by Page.
Had this         saving         exceeded 20%, palm oil would qualify as a renewable fuel for subsidy         (RFS) in the US.
As         a result, palm biodiesel is considered too carbon intensive to qualify         under RFS.
The World Bank and the UK Department for International Development in         Indonesia         commissioned an overview of the current status and policies surrounding         climate change in         Indonesia, drawing on Leicester research.
Two years later, the         Indonesian National         Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) commissioned a study assessing         the         scientific basis, economic and legal aspects of reducing peatland         emissions, also citing         Page's research.
The study recommended a moratorium on peatland         conversion.
Several         Indonesian Presidential Instructions have also been informed by Page's         research.
(B) Informing a REDD project to rehabilitate a tropical peatswamp to         avoid an environmental         disaster     Page's expertise led to her appointment, in 2008, as technical adviser to       the Master Plan for       Rehabilitation of the ex-MRP in Kalimantan.
Started in 1996, the MRP aimed       to open an extensive       peatland for rice production, but was later acknowledged to be a       socio-economic and       environmental disaster.
To address this situation, the Indonesian       Government announced its       intention to rehabilitate the MRP; Page co-authored a technical review       underpinning this Master       Plan programme, which subsequently led to a REDD demonstration project       launched within the       framework of the Indonesia-Australia Forest Carbon Partnership (IAFCP).
From 2008 onwards,       Page was consulted and appointed member of the Technical Panel for this       initiative.
In 2012/13,       Page and Tansey were further contracted by IAFCP to provide consultancy on       mapping fire       severity and modelling carbon emissions.
(C) Helping a multi-national company to change environmental practices     In 2009, Page and Hoscilo were commissioned to work on a science-based       management support       project via Deltares (Dutch hydrological consultants) for APRIL &#8212; a       multi-national pulp and paper       manufacturer in Indonesia.
As a result, APRIL now use `hydro-buffers'       between plantations and       conservation areas; raised plantation water levels, thus minimising fire       and carbon emissions;       monitor peat-derived emissions in order to understand the company's carbon       footprint.
Deltares       Science Council has selected SE Asian peatland research, to which       Leicester has contributed, as       an area where Deltares has contributed significantly to sustainability at       a globally relevant scale.
(D) Informing international programmes (UN WMO, IPCC) on climate         change     Since 2009, Tansey has used his research on fire mapping, arising from       research in Indonesia and       at the global scale, to contribute new material to high level UN World       Meteorological Organization       (WMO) Global Climate/Terrestrial Observing System (GCOS/GTOS)       publications, including: GTOS       68: Assessment of the Status of the Development of Standards for the       Terrestrial Essential Climate       Variables; GCOS-129: Progress Report on Implementation of the Global       Observing System for       Climate (GOSC) in Support of the UNFCCC 2004-2008; GCOS-138:       Implementation Plan for the       GOSC; and GCOS-107: Systematic Observation Requirements for       Satellite-Based Products for       Climate.
The current Director of the GCOS Secretariat, based in Geneva,       stated that these       documents are reported to UNFCCC Parties, WMO Member States, IOC Members,       Meteorological       and Hydrological Services.
A specific impact is the response to the GCOS       requirements for the       European Space Agency to set up a &#8364;75 million Climate Change Initiative       (CCI) programme to       generate climate-quality satellite data.
Mapping fires is one of WMO's       Essential Climate Variables       and one of the ESA Climate Change Initiative projects.
In 2007, the UN IPCC, for the first time, included analysis of peat       emissions in the Mitigation of       Climate Change policy document (IPCC AR4, Working Group III, Ch.1 p.105).
In 2011, Leicester's       research was further cited in a policy recommendation on peatlands and       REDD from Wetlands       International to SBSTA (the scientific body informing UNFCCC and working       closely with IPCC).
In       2012, Page was invited as a Lead Author and Tansey as a Contributing       Author for IPCC Wetlands       Chapter 2 specifically to develop peat oxidation and fire emission factors       for drained organic soils.
The 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for Ntional Greenhouse Gas       Inventories, now       approved and published, will impact most governments around the world.
(E) Informing campaigns by environmental pressure groups and         contributing to stakeholder debate     Environmental pressure groups Greenpeace and WWF launched campaigns to       highlight issues       raised in Page's research.
Dissemination of research findings through the       media and pressure       group campaigns has led to increased awareness and debate among       stakeholder groups on       carbon emissions from tropical peatland conversion, such as JNCC (public       body advising UK       Government on nature conservation) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm       Oil (RSPO).
