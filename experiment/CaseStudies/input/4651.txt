     Pancost and Shallcross recognised that through Bristol       ChemLabS, this research could serve as a powerful mechanism for engaging       students with chemistry as it: (i) highlights the importance of chemistry       in addressing some of the greatest societal challenges and (ii) inspires a       passion for all science through the innate interdisciplinarity of the       work.
Thus, research has driven one of the world's most ambitious school       engagement efforts, co-ordinated by Shallcross and Harrison       (School of Chemistry Director of Outreach).
ChemLabS has therefore       leveraged the quality, societal relevance and unique interdisciplinary       aspects of climate change research to inspire and motivate students to       become better engaged with their environment and pursue further education       and careers in science.
The specific research components that inform       ChemLabS' outreach are the use of state-of-the-art analytical chemistry to       make sensitive measurements of gases in the atmosphere, the application of       physical and chemical principles to the modelling of atmospheric       chemistry, the chemistry underpinning air pollution and catalytic cycles,       and the use of paleoclimatic archives to determine the sensitivity of       global temperatures to pCO2.
This research is presented       by a combination of: (i) research presentations/events by Shallcross,         Pancost and members of their research groups and (ii) the `Pollutant's         Tale', lecture demonstration which incorporates research results       from Pancost and Shallcross.
ChemLabS activity that has derived primarily from this research during       the impact period of 2008- 2013 is oulined below.
Pancost and Shallcross and members of their research         groups, working with the Director of Outreach, Harrison, have         delivered more than 1,000 presentations to over 400 schools in the UK,         reached over 250,000 students and thousands of teachers, delivered         outreach in 15 countries (including Australia, China, New Zealand,         Singapore and South Africa), and run activities ranging from lectures to         research conducted with students and resulting in co- authored papers (a).
Bristol ChemLabS has delivered over 100 public lectures, engagement         activities at many UK festivals, including the Bristol Festival of         Nature (which draws more than 20,000 attendees and for which Pancost         served as a Steering Group member), the 2008 RS Summer Science         Exhibition, numerous regional and national science festivals (eg         Cheltenham), the RS Warm Climates of the Past discussion meeting in         2011, regular presentations at international science festivals (eg         National Science Weeks in South Africa, 2008-2012; Namibia, 2011;         Jersey, 2008 and 2010; Malta 2011/12) and at international science         centres (eg Sci-Bono, Johannesburg).
Crucially, to facilitate the continued teaching of such material,       ChemLabS has conducted extensive follow-up activity, including writing       articles, contributing to textbooks and training teachers.
The team: (i)       organises the annual Festival of Contemporary Science that always features       climate change and atmospheric chemistry research and has been attended by       more than 200 school teachers, (ii) has run a Teachers' Master's Course       since 2005 that features climate change research as an example of How       Science Works, established the RCUK course for teachers on Climate Change,       a course that continued to be delivered through the UK Science Learning       Centre Network (145 times with approximately 1,200 attendees), and       regularly updates CHeMneT members (Bristol ChemLabS' teacher network),       (iii) trains overseas colleagues and postgraduates to present this work       across the world, with lecture demonstrations in South Africa to nearly       1,000 students per month at four centres and (iv) has written 15       publications directed at school teachers or students [eg Science in       Schools, Chemistry Review, Education in Chemistry, Physics Education,       School Science Review (b)].

The impact of this activity has been profound and is demonstrated by the       following:            Publications which have been widely accessed; the climate change and         atmospheric chemistry articles in Science in School alone have been         downloaded over 250,000 times.
The translation of articles into nine languages, most commonly         Spanish.
The impact on student training in the UK, which is demonstrated by         funding from industry to deliver these activities in their communities,         including: (i) EDF Energy who have funded ChemLabS to develop the         company's long-term interests in Somerset by `building up enthusiasm           for science in order to up skill the local communities in STEM           subjects' (c) supported by six atmospheric and climate         change chemistry lectures; and (ii) the AstraZeneca Science Teaching         Trust (AZSTT), which has engaged ChemLabS to deliver demonstrations on         climate change across the UK.
The impact on international student training, illustrated by the         uptake of our material by South African institutions, including: (i) the         Chemistry Department at Rhodes University, and (ii) The Sci-Bono Science         Centre, Johannesburg, which has had its demonstrators trained by         ChemLabS to deliver `A Pollutant's Tale', during Earth Science         Week in 2011 and the National Science Week in 2012.
The use of our articles by a UK examination board within Post 16         examinations 2012/13.
The recognition of ChemLabS' outreach work through many awards to Shallcross         and Harrison and the outreach team, including more than 10         national and international awards from the RS, the RSC, the Royal         Meteorological Society (both Outreach and research) and The Bank of         America (d).
In addition, the quality and range of the impact of this research is       documented by hundreds of collected testimonials from teachers and       research at Master's level (e).
Bristol ChemLabS has quantified the       impact with respect to: (i) uptake of this research in course curricula       and teaching, (ii) its effect on students' cognition, (iii) how it has       changed students' educational choices and (iv) cultural changes in       developing countries.
With respect to (i), ChemLabS' teaching has now been       incorporated into UK national exam boards' coursework.
Moreover, in one-       to two-year follow-up studies with 60 of the teachers who attended       ChemLabS' 2010 national teacher training day (the Festival of Contemporary       Science), 100% declared it either `very good' or `good' in terms of       usefulness to their teaching practice (f).
With respect to (ii),       Bristol ChemLabS has studied the impact of its engagement activity on UK       school's understanding atmospheric chemistry (g).
In terms of       (iii), via repeated visits and interactions with some schools, ChemLabS       has been able to study how its outreach activity has transformed students'       educational choices, eg the team has been visiting the Crypt       School in Gloucestershire for five years resulting in an increase from 5       to 60 students opting to study chemistry at A-Level, (h).
Finally,       in terms of (iv), papers on the use of these climate-based educational       resources in the South African context are being published (i).
Overall, the impact of outreach on students, teachers and participating       postgraduates has been the subject of 15 papers published (j),       forming the basis of three postgraduate master's level theses where       Bristol ChemLabS has demonstrated that students' understanding of the       science underpinning climate change has been improved, that teachers'       confidence in teaching these topics has been increased and that student       aspirations have been raised.
