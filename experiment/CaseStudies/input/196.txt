     ProTide technology embraced by global pharmaceutical companies in         R&amp;D programmes     Significant worldwide commercial impact has been delivered from Cardiff       research with multinational pharmaceutical companies and smaller drug       discovery firms in the USA and Europe implementing the ProTide technology       on candidate and existing therapeutics.
The technology is transforming the       prospects of antiviral and anti-cancer nucleoside agents.
These users have       invested in ProTide technology either through direct research partnerships       with Cardiff University or by independently adapting the techniques       described by the Cardiff team to their own proprietary agents.
During the       REF period eight novel ProTide entities have entered clinical trials       worldwide for a range of diseases.
Additionally, ProTide research income       from commercial partnerships since January 2008 of ca.
&#163;2.2 million has       been awarded to the Cardiff ProTide team who have supported the filing of       12 patent families and 28 collaborative Cardiff-industry-partner journal       articles.
Partnership in ProTide R&amp;D investment and wealth creation     Between 2007 and 2012 the US pharmaceutical company Inhibitex Inc.       (employing 34 full time staff) collaborated with Cardiff University to       develop the Cardiff designed ProTide, INX-189, a highly potent antiviral       against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), an infectious disease affecting       around 170 million people worldwide.
The research investment from       Inhibitex to Cardiff was &#163;789,000 (for 2008-2012 period), excluding       additional milestone payments, and supported five full time staff       researchers throughout the period of the agreement.
In 2011 successful       Phase 1b/II clinical trials demonstrated the safety and efficacy of       INX-189 in 50 HCV-infected patients.
This ProTide was one of the only two       assets of Inhibitex, the other asset, also designed in Cardiff's       laboratories, was a non-ProTide phase II anti-viral agent against the       varicella zoster virus or shingles which affects around 2 million people       worldwide.
Largely as a result of the success of INX-189, the NASDAQ       capitalisation of Inhibitex rose to approximately $878 million (December       2011) [5.1].
In Feb 2012 Inhibitex was acquired by the       multinational pharmaceutical company, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), for $2.5       billion.
This was the largest sum ever paid for a biotech with Phase IIa       data, and the largest premium (&gt;160%) on market price ever paid in the       pharma sector for a company valued over $500 million [5.2].
This strategic exit for the board and shareholders of Inhibitex was       afforded by the market confidence in ProTide technology.
Due to late phase       unexpected cardiotoxicity the clinical trials for INX-189 were suspended       in 2012.
The toxicity was recognised as a compound-specific idiosyncratic       event and confidence in the technology remains with the continued clinical       development of related ProTides (see below).
Cardiff ProTides Ltd was a spin-out company from the McGuigan laboratory       established to develop ProTides of nucleoside-based anticancer drugs.
In       2007 Cardiff ProTides Ltd was acquired by UK- based Morvus Technology Ltd.
The following year (2008) Morvus, with UK based oncology medicines company       NuCana BioMed, established research and license agreements worth &#163;250,000       of research investment (for the period 2008-2013) to Cardiff (McGuigan).
The collaboration supported four full-time staff researchers in Cardiff to       work on anti-cancer ProTide technology as part of the development       programme of NuCana BioMed.
Anti-cancer ProTides from Cardiff are the       single asset of NuCana BioMed and since 2008 four joint patents have been       filed and one candidate, NUC1031, has entered phase I/IIa monotherapy       clinical trials (October 2012) against a range of advanced and metastatic       solid tumours including ovarian, breast or endometrial cancer [5.3].
Early, highly encouraging, safety and efficacy data in patients have very       recently reported NUC1031 to induce stable progression-free disease in       6/11 patients.
Based on these data Nucana are expanding the development of       NUC1031[5.3] in collaboration with investment partners, such as       the life science venture capital firm Sofinnova (Paris)[5.4],       to include a cohort expansion study planned for Q4 2013.
Another ProTide       candidate (derived from fluorouracil) is in final preclinical candidate       selection for primary colorectal cancer with a plan to enter human       clinical trials in Q1 2014.
As an unlisted company, NuCana BioMed has no       current public valuation but with NUC1031 showing efficacy and safety in       early trials and historic studies in the oncology market indicating ca.
30% success rate in a several $100 million market for solid tumours, the       business of NuCana BioMed has been significantly enhanced by the Cardiff       discoveries [5.3].
Independent adoption of ProTide research     Independent of any partnership with Cardiff the ProTide research of       McGuigan's team has influenced global drug development, with examples of       application including:     Pharmasset (USA) using Cardiff's public domain ProTide technology to       generate its own anti-HCV nucleoside (PSI-7851) [5.5].
Its       pure isomer (PSI-7977, now GS-7977) began Phase III clinical trials for       HCV in November 2011, which confirmed the highly effective and selective       nature of this agent [5.6].
This ProTide agent is very likely to be the       first nucleoside to be approved by FDA for HCV, an infectious disease       affecting around 170M people worldwide.
The biotech company Pharmasset was       acquired by Gilead in January 2012.
A significant proportion of its $11       billion market capitalisation was assigned to the Phase III anti-HCV       ProTide PSI-7977 [5.7].
Gilead (USA) applied Cardiff's ProTide technology to acyclic       nucleoside phosphonates, which led to GS-7340, a reverse transcriptase       inhibitor in clinical trial Phase II for HIV.
An adaptation of ProTide       technology has also been applied to generate the anticancer agent GS-9219       which is also in clinical trial Phase 1b/2 and more recently licenced to       VetDC for use in animal cancers [5.8].
The underpinning role played by Cardiff research and technology behind       each of the above examples is evidenced by the extensive citation of the       Cardiff work and the structural similarity of each of the phosphoramidate       entities to INX-189 and related compounds.
The ProTide platform technology       is transforming nucleoside-based therapeutics in antivirals, with the       capacity for impact in the anti-cancer arena[5.9].
