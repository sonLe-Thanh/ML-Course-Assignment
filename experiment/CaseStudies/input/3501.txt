     In 2011 Burton was awarded an OBE for services to occupational       healthcare.
The award was       given in recognition of the significant contribution of the documented       research with respect to       promoting successful return to work for people living with back pain.
The       Chief Medical Adviser       and Director for Health and Wellbeing at the Department of Work and       Pensions has stated that our       overall programme of research has "fundamentally underpinned the         development of the health and         work agenda over the last 6 years"1.
Referring to a       crucial shift in public beliefs and growing       recognition of the need to involve all `key players', the editor of The       BackLetter which is published       in the USA summarised the impact of the research as follows2.
As editor of the BackLetter, my job for the past twenty years has been         to follow the evolution of         back pain research and the impact of the back pain and back pain-related         disability crisis on         societies around the world.
The role of Kim Burton and the Spinal         Research Unit at the University         of Huddersfield in the evolution of modern thinking about low back pain         cannot be overestimated.
In my view, this unit is one of the three or four most influential back         pain and spinal research         groups on earth&#8212;key participants and innovators in the modern "Back Pain         Revolution."
In the         traditional medical approach to low back pain, back pain was interpreted         as a signal of disease or         injury, usually attributed to the physical stresses of work.
The medical         prescription for these         injuries&#8212;rest and inactivity until the injury healed and pain abated&#8212;         proved to be disastrous,         removing millions of workers around the world from health-enhancing         employment to the sad fate         of permanent disability, at huge expense and productivity losses to         national economies.
Burton and         colleagues at the University of Huddersfield&#8212;along with key         collaborators around the world&#8212; have         helped overthrow this traditional medical approach to back pain in favor         of a much more flexible         and practical biopsychosocial model.
They have altered perceptions about         the nature and course         of back pain and its relationship with physical stresses and work.
They         have identified the most         important obstacles to recovery and return-to-work, barriers which have         strong psychological and         social underpinnings.
They have helped ordinary people, healthcare         providers, and society learn to         recognize these obstacles and move past them.
They have re-energized the         concept of         rehabilitation.
They transformed it from a second stage process that         occurs after healing is         complete into an activating intervention that occurs in the early days         after the onset of a potentially         disabling common health problem&#8212;when it is still possible to overcome         minor obstacles that might         otherwise morph into major barriers to recovery and return-to-work.
In         their various studies,         articles, and contributions to reviews and guidelines they have         communicated their knowledge         effectively at multiple levels&#8212;in language everyone can understand.
For         ordinary people and         employees around the world, The Back Book has become the world`s most         widely circulated         evidence-based educational aid on low back pain.
And there are now         mirror editions of The Back         Book approach in multiple health areas.
Burton and colleagues have         contributed to the ground-breaking         RCGP Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Acute Low Back Pain, the         Occupational         Health Guidelines for the Management of Low Back Pain at Work, the         European Guidelines on         Back Pain&#8212;including the seminal European Guidelines for Prevention in         Low Back Pain, which         Burton chaired.
And they have not restricted their research and         practical solutions to the narrow         area of back pain.
They have applied the knowledge from intensive back         pain research to many         other common health problems and the psychological, social and economic         obstacles they create.
While this is a group with strong scientific credentials they are very         definitely not ivory tower         scientists.
They are a hands-on, roll-up-the sleeves group interested in         developing practical         solutions for ordinary people grappling with illness and disability in         the complexities of real world         settings.
The importance of this research, which has highlighted the need to tackle       biopsychosocial       obstacles to achieve timely recovery from back pain, has been recognised       by the BUPA       Foundation through their annual Health at Work Awards in 2005 and 2008.The       most prominent       example of the underpinning research being directly communicated to       individuals with back pain is       The Back Book, a leading educational resource which has sold over 3       million copies since it was       published in 19963.
Originally developed from Burton's       pioneering studya of how a change in       beliefs could impact on sickness absence due to back pain, it has been       translated into more than       20 languages and continues to be used and requested by healthcare       services, workers       compensation systems and insurers in various countries.
It is endorsed       by The Association of       British Spine Surgeons for acute back pain4.
Their website       states that: "The 2017Back Book' has been         shown in a randomized controlled trial to assist in giving the right         message at an early stage.
Many         Health Centers and Hospitals will have it, if not, it can be obtained         from The Stationery Office by         post.

The key recommendation from our work, that remaining in work and       returning early to work are       generally beneficial for health, has become a pivotal message underlying       major policy initiatives.
It       was drawn on by the UK National Director for Health and Work, Dame Carol       Black, in her 2008       report Working for a Healthier Tomorrow5.
Citing       Waddell and Burtone, the report says, (page 21):       "In particular, the recent review 2017Is Work Good for Your Health       and Well-Being?
'e concluded that         work was generally good for both physical and mental health and         well-being ...
Overall, the         beneficial effects of work were shown to outweigh the risks and to be         much greater than the         harmful effects of long-term worklessness or prolonged sickness absence.
This approach was       endorsed by the UK Government and this support was confirmed6       in a 2013 update by the       Department for Work &amp; Pensions and HM Treasury.
It was endorsed in the       2009 NICE guidance       for reducing sickness absence and unemployment; and in the       Government-commissioned 2011       report Health at Work: An Independent Review of Sickness Absence7.
The wide influence of our       research on current health and work policy, and its implementation into       practice, has been       confirmed by the Chief Medical Adviser and Director for Health and       Wellbeing at the Department       for Work and Pensions: "These reviews are widely quoted across the         public and private sectors,         the academic community, internationally and by Government Ministers"1.
Because of our research expertise concerning the beliefs and attitudes of       the `key players', we       were commissioned to prepare guidance for GPs on the importance of work to       health, and on how       they should advise their patients to encourage work participation rather       than incapacity.
This       guidance was sent to all UK GPs in 2010 to coincide with the introduction       of the FitNote8 which       replaced traditional incapacity certification; and was incorporated into       the related National       Education Programme for GPs, run by the Royal College of General       Practitioners in 2010-11.
Burton and colleagues have produced a range of widely-read leaflets       guiding professionals       associated with occupational rehabilitation.
For example, their leaflet Work           &amp; Health: Changing           How We Think About Common Health Problems in Health Care in the           Workplace and in Society       "challenges how you think about health at work, and offers ideas on         what you should and should         not do &#8212; based on new scientific evidence about what is good for workers         themselves", drawing on       the underpinning original research and research syntheses outlined above.
Another leaflet,       Advising           Patients About Work: Evidence Based Approach For GPs offers       guidance to GPs about       helping patients to return to, or stay in, work.
The underpinning research       demonstrated that they       can play a critical role in this respect.
The influence of our work promoting the beneficial effects of an early       return to work can also be       seen further afield.
The Chief Medical Advisor to the Irish Department of       Social Protection has       credited our research with "profoundly influencing the policy and         operational aspects pertinent to         early intervention measures resulting in the reduction of progression of         acute common health         problems to a state of chronic disability and dependence on long term         illness benefits and job loss.
All are beneficiaries, the patient/worker (with better health outcomes),         the employer (with reduced         absenteeism and higher production) and the taxpayer (with reduced cost         of illness benefit)".8 Our       research has influenced practice in workers' compensation systems in       Australia.
The Chair of the       Australian Faculty of Occupational and Environmental Medicine Policy and       Advocacy Committee       stated that "The body of work regarding management of back pain from         the University of         Huddersfield has led to change in the way doctors and health         practitioners are educated, both in         Victoria and across Australia.
In 2011, the Australasian Faculty of         Occupational and Environmental         Medicine released a position statement 2017Realising the Health Benefits         of Work` which relied heavily         on the research of the University of Huddersfield and has led to better         management of people out         of the workforce due to health problems"9.
This strand of the underpinning research concerned with the role of       significant others in       occupational rehabilitationg for people with back pain has       already generated local, national and       international media interest, including articles in the Huddersfield           Examiner (March 2011),       Osteopathy Today (November       2011), the American Pain Academy's e-newsletter       (June 2012) and       MDLinx Orthopedics News (February 2013).
McCluskey has been       invited to present findings from       this strand of the research to pain management clinicians and occupational       health professionals       both nationally and internationally.
