     Using the world's first 3T MRI scanner we demonstrated, in papers from       1994 onwards [1,2], that it was possible to generate high resolution,       artefact-free images.
These results played a significant role in       convincing magnet and system manufacturers that the move to high field was       not only technically feasible, but could herald the new state-of-the-art       for clinical MRI systems.
The primary impact of high-field MRI on patient care has been through the       improvement in the quality of clinical diagnostic scans that high field       provides (see estimate of the number of patient examinations below), but       high field has also underpinned the new field of functional MRI (fMRI).
As       described in section 2, the work of the Nottingham group was critical in       this development through their demonstration of EPI at 3T [1], and this       technique has subsequently been implemented in all commercial high-field       scanners.
The stimulus to the new field of fMRI arose since EPI offers the       fastest mode of image acquisition, and was rapidly adopted as the       functional neuroimaging method of choice.
EPI offered a viable alternative       to `FLASH', the fastest imaging technique then (mid- 1990s) commercially       available (FLASH proved inadequate to deal with the confounding effects of       motion on the small signal changes due to brain activity that must be       detected in fMRI).
The move to 3T gathered momentum and, by the mid-2000s, sales of 3T MR       scanners by all three major manufacturers (GE, Philips and Siemens) were       beginning to grow.
At first, it was major MRI research centres who       installed 3T scanners (for example, in 1998 Oxford University's fMRIB       Laboratory were the first to follow the Nottingham example in the UK),       then clinical research facilities, and eventually larger hospitals, both       increasing capacity and replacing some of their older 1.5T systems.
The growth of high-field MRI has been sustained through the assessment       period (2008 onwards).
Figures provided by a leading industrial source [A]       provide some key indicative data:            The number of new scanner installations per annum (high- and         low-field) grew from approximately 2000 in the year 2003, to         approximately 3000 in 2010 (global figures);       The fraction of these new installations designated as high field (3T)         grew from less than 2% before 2003, to 20% in 2010;       The typical cost of a 3T MRI scanner is $2M [B]; the value of global         sales of high-field scanners in 2010 (the last year for which data are         available to us in a relevant form) was $1 billion;       In the first half of the REF assessment period (2008-2010; data were         available only for this period) approximately 1400 high-field scanners         were sold.
Extrapolating these data [A] we estimate that over 2500 high-field       scanners were installed from January 2008 - July 2013 (this is almost       certainly an underestimate since the rising trend in sales is neglected),       representing a global investment of $5 billion.
To evaluate the impact on patient care over the assessment period we       estimate the number of high-field examinations as follows: (i) the average       number of scans per scanner per year (averaged over both low- and       high-field scanners) in England is 6500 (using figures of 300 installed       scanners [C] and two million patient examinations [C]); the average number       of operational high-field scanners during the assessment period is taken       as 2250 (1000 installed prior to 2008 [A], plus half of the newly       installed scanners).
This gives a global estimate of the capacity for 80       million patient examinations using high-field MRI from January 2008 to       July 2013.
Taking into account the use of some of the high-field scanners       for research, and their application in more complex cases, we estimate       that 30 - 40 million high-field patient examinations were performed during       this period.
The role of the Nottingham research in underpinning these developments is       confirmed by leading industrialists:     `The development of a prototype 3T scanner at the Sir Peter Mansfield         Magnetic Resonance Centre in Nottingham demonstrated that the         theoretical benefits of high field could be realised in practice.'
Joint written statement from the Premium &amp; Portfolio MR Manager and       the 7T &amp; High Field MR Product Segment Marketing Manager, GE       Healthcare [D];     `The 3T scanner constructed at the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic         Resonance Centre (SPMMRC) demonstrated that ....... the high speed         imaging technique of echo-planar imaging, developed in Nottingham by Sir         Peter Mansfield, could be implemented at high field.
The combination of         high field and imaging speed was crucial in the development of         functional MRI, now the mostly widely used functional neuro-imaging         technique.'

The success of the Nottingham group also led to a change in the strategy       of magnet manufacturers such as Oxford Instruments and motivated a       decision to re-invest in the manufacture of wide-bore superconducting 3T       magnets.
Morris (Director of the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic       Resonance Centre (SPMMRC), part of the School of Physics &amp; Astronomy)       held a consultancy with Oxford Instruments during the period when the       first 3T scanner was built (early 1990s - 1998) and provided advice       regarding the technical challenges of implementing MRI at 3T and the new       market opportunities for high-field scanners.
His contact at Oxford       Instruments was a senior magnet designer who was a member of the main       Board during this period and states:     `The failure of 4T systems to 'take off' had made the Board of Oxford         Instruments nervous about investment in high field systems, but you         helped to convince us that there would be a new market for such         systems,...' ex-Board Member of Oxford Instruments now working as a       consultant [F].
In addition, fMRI, which was initially used primarily as a research tool       in basic neuroscience and clinical studies, now supports clinical and       commercial applications which impact directly on the diagnosis and       treatment of patients.
Clinically, fMRI is used in pre-surgical mapping of       the eloquent cortex, and in some institutions this has become standard       procedure [G].
It is also contributing to the diagnosis of       neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
In       addition, fMRI provides a basis for monitoring the actions of new       therapeutic agents, enabling their mechanisms of action to be identified       and/or confirmed.
It is also being taken up by companies offering       diagnostic and other services, including the elucidation of pain pathways       [H].
The same drivers that led to the development of high-field 3T MRI systems       apply a fortiori to the development of ultra-high field (7T) MRI       systems.
However, the barriers to delivering the additional improvements       were substantial, and it was unclear whether such systems were a viable       proposition, even in a purely research environment.
In 2005, we took       delivery of the first 7T MRI system to be supplied by Philips.
Our work in       developing structural and functional MRI on this system stimulated take-up       by several prestigious research institutions, as confirmed by a statement       from Philips:     `The SPMMRC was one of the first in the world to undertake human         studies at ultra-high field (7T).
It took delivery of the first 7T MRI         system to be constructed by Philips Healthcare and the pioneering work         of the SPMMRC at 7T encouraged investment in this technology and rapid         uptake by the user community.'
MRI Clinical Science Director,       Philips Healthcare [E].
It is estimated that forty 7T instruments have now been sold [I], with       further growth anticipated.
The current cost of a 7T scanner is over $10M.
