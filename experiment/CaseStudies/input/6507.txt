     Through Rilkes Room Ltd (www.dsd.me), Do Something Different (DSD) is       widely used to address       health and wellbeing issues, and to change behaviour.
We provide two       representative examples,       one community and one corporate.
Health and Wellbeing: West Norfolk     In 2009 the West Norfolk (WN) Partnership engaged Ben Fletcher and Karen       Pine to introduce       DSD into communities of around 10,000 people with alarming rates of health       and wellbeing       problems.
Along with project manager Ronel Erasmus, they DSD-trained       almost 200 local health       professionals, including community mental health workers, health visitors,       school and GP staff,       nurses, nutritionists, Stroke Prevention and Children's Centres staff.
These professionals used DSD in their work settings or ran DSD groups in       the community.
Many       reported successes where previous methods had failed, such as with       truanting teenagers or       sedentary patients (see section 5, Video Testimonials).
While adult       obesity rates increased in other       areas, Fairstead region (the target area in WN) was one of very few       showing a decrease.
Testimonials poured in as DSD transformed the community's health.
Fletcher's and Pine's team       collected data to measure the effects.
Obese people lost weight and kept       it off (average reduction       10.5 lbs), smokers quit (success rate 88%), families functioned better,       and chronically ill people       adopted healthier lifestyles (exercise frequency, for example, more than       doubled).
Life satisfaction       ratings shot up and depression rates fell significantly.
Carmel Austin, a Stroke Association DSD coach, said of one service user:         `The programme has       changed her life, and that's really brilliant'.
A Stroke Association       newsletter article, `Eastern       Angles', quotes two others as saying: `We firmly believe that DSD is only       a starting point for the       rest of our lives .
.
.
The DSD course has made me so much more aware of       the extent of things       that we can do to help prevent stroke.'
Delighted with these results, Ian Burbidge, WN's Policy/Partnerships       Manager responsible for       health and wellbeing, commented that DSD led to `people being happier,       achieving more .
.
.
to go       on to volunteer to be more active in their community, to develop a wider       network of friends.
And       we've even had people ending up in work .
.
.
it just ticks all the boxes       .
.
.
it's helping people make       the changes in their own lives that are necessary.'
West Norfolk now invests &#163;64,000 a year in DSD and, says councillor       Elizabeth Nockolds, who       holds the Health and Wellbeing portfolio: `We are seeing tangible results       .
.
.
with over 400 local       people making sustainable improvements to their lifestyles.'
As such, it       is proving cost-effective in       reducing future demand on public services.
Thousands of service users now have improved health and wellbeing thanks       to DSD.
The model is       being adopted in other communities, including one in the Heerlen Region,       Netherlands.
Commercial: PwC     DSD has proven effective for changing workplace behaviour.
In 2010       PricewaterhouseCoopers       (PwC) approached Fletcher and Pine to help their 16,000+ UK staff address       bias and diversity       issues.
The researchers designed project Open Mind, using digital       technology to deliver habit-       breaking tasks to staff, encouraging more inclusive interactions and       creating sustained behaviour       change.
A Times article reported that, six months after finishing       the programme, `83% of those who       had changed their behaviour said they felt more open-minded'.
Also offered       to the company's       clients and its overseas firms, the project won PwC's `Chairman's Prize'       in 2011 and the       prestigious Opportunity Now Inclusive Culture Award 2012.

DSD has been introduced to many       organisations,       including Ernst &amp; Young, food conglomerate Mondal&#232;z International, the       Brighton Youth Offending       Service, and Action for Happiness.
Internationally, DSD was used for       creativity in the 2012 Istanbul       Design Biennale, while Netherlands-based MedicInfo acquired the Dutch       rights and implemented it       in Heijmans N.V (construction) and CZ and VGZ, two health insurers serving       over 4 million       customers.
In 2012 Do Something Different was a European Diversity Award runner-up,       in the Outstanding       Use of Technology in the Field of Diversity category.
