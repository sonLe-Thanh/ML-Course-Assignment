     Impact and benefit to the industry and the Welsh economy from the         Faculty's Knowledge Transfer Activities.
The Knowledge Transfer activity in the area of NDT and Composites       Manufacture over the eligible period is aggregated in the following table:                                Impact                 measure           Achievement                             Enterprises assisted:           46                             Collaborative industrial projects transferring NDT/             manufacturing expertise:           32                             Jobs created:           5                             New or improved products, processes or services             launched:           12                             Investment induced:           &#163;282,482                          A Wide variety of project work was undertaken with companies ranging from     small organizations employing less than ten people to large, multi-national     operations.
Examples include:             Crown Foods &#8212; work was undertaken with the company to optimise         coating weight on the sealing ring area of can ends.
Experimental work         at the local manufacturing plant, combined with resources from the         company's R&amp;D centre enabled the determination of optimum coating         weight to reduce leaks in cans.
&#8226; Tata Steel &#8212; work was undertaken to improve the         effectiveness and reliability of iron ore transportation in the ore         stock area of the works.
This work included introducing a degree of         automation, which significantly improved plant reliability, reduced         downtime and improved associated health and safety for operators and         maintenance personnel.
The project paid for itself within twelve months.
Rikoset &#8212; testing work was undertaken to assist the company in         the development of high-performance shin-guards for sports men and         women.
These shin-guards are lighter, stronger and provide more         protection than is provided by currently available products.
They may         also be customised to meet the needs of individuals.
Team Precision Piping &#8212; this project involved ultrasonic         testing of pipe assemblies for the automotive industry, which revealed         significant deficiencies in the manufacturing process, particularly in         the brazed joints produced.
This enabled the company to make major         improvements in quality.
Silverwing Ltd &#8212; development of NDT analysis software to         improve the capability of the company's ultrasonic testing system helped         to develop new product ranges and new market opportunities overseas.
Ford Motor Company &#8212; a variety of projects was undertaken with         the company's South Wales engine plant.
These projects focussed on         aspects of process and product quality improvement, such as the         reduction of corrosion-related problems in components supplied to Indian         assembly plants.
Aeristech Ltd &#8212; accurate 3D measurement work was undertaken to         assist the company with product development.
United Aerospace Ltd &#8212; this project was funded by an EPSRC CASE         studentship and investigated the post-moulding machining of         fibre-reinforced composite materials.
A variety of NDT techniques were         employed to evaluate cut-edge quality and machining conditions.
This led         to the identification of optimum tooling selection, supported by the         development of a software application for companies to use in process         planning.
The student working on this project was successfully examined         on 1st November 2013.
TWI Ltd &#8212; Two projects have been supported by a Prince of Wales         Innovation Scholarship.
The first is focussed heavily on the use of         pulsed and lock-in infra-red thermography to identify sub-surface damage         to fibre-reinforced composites in the aerospace industry, caused by         impact.
This project has improved the capability of TWI in applying         thermography-based NDT to aerospace related composite materials.
The         second project is concerned with the development of a new real-time full         matrix capture ultrasonic system for detecting buried defects, leading         to a new commercial product.
