     This research has impacted on religious/convictional organisations in       dialogue with European       institutions at both national and supranational levels by raising       awareness and understanding of       the role of `religion' and `faith' as follows:     4.1 Religious Organisations in the European Union     The project led to Dr Leustean organising a two day international       practitioner conference at the       Aston Centre for Europe (November 2010) which examined religious       representations in the       European Union and the United States (s5.1).
It brought together       sixty-eight participants       representing both religious policy practitioners and academics from eleven       countries (Britain,       France, the US; Belgium; Germany; Ireland; Netherlands; Sweden;       Switzerland; Singapore;       Canada).
The debates of the Aston conference were circulated by       participants who favourably       commented on the importance of inter-religious dialogue in the EU.
They       included a former director       of the Quaker Council for European Affairs in Brussels who wrote a       detailed report on the Aston       Conference and circulated it to the Quaker Council for European Affairs,       Faith in Europe &#8212; the       Churches' European Relations Network and the Wyndham Place Charlemagne       Trust (s5.2 and       s5.7).
4.2 Religious/Convictional Organisations in Dialogue with European         Institutions in Brussels     The project brought together religious and convictional actors to reflect       upon their impact of       dialogue with European institutions.
The Aston conference (2010) led to       the publication of an       edited book on religious representation in the European Union which       includes a section with five       chapters written by religious practitioners working in Brussels (s3.2,       s5.5 and s5.8).
These policy       makers represent all categories of religious/convictional groups in       dialogue with European       institutions, namely the Roman Catholic Church (the Jesuit European       Office); national churches       (the Church of England Representative to the European Union);       transnational church networks (the       Church and Society Commission of the Conference of European Churches);       religions (European       Muslim Network); and communities of conviction (the European Humanist       Federation).
In September 2011 Dr Leustean gave an invited talk at the European       Commission in Brussels on       `The Representation of Religious Communities at the EU Level' to       thirty-five representatives of       religious/convictional communities from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,       Croatia, Iceland,       Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.
The event was organised       by the European       Commission's Directorate General for Enlargement and focused on the social       impact of religious       communities in the European Union.
A report on the findings of the ESRC project on religious representation       in the European Union was       circulated (October 2011) to all religious and convictional groups in       Brussels representing       `churches, religions and communities of conviction' in dialogue with       European institutions (Catholic;       Protestant; Anglican; Orthodox; Humanists; Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist       organisations) (s5.7).
The report offered the first historical overview of the origins of       religious dialogue in the EU and       was welcomed by a wide range of religious groups who wrote their view of       the findings to Dr       Leustean:     a. I found it most interesting.
It is a very clear summary on a         subject which, to my         knowledge, had not been researched before.
I was surprised to learn that         you identified         as many as 120 religious/convictional groups in dialogue with the         European         Commission.
(The Order of Malta) (s5.7)     b.
Thank you for this which I will circulate to WPCT membership for         their interest.
A major         project it was indeed and a lot of &#8212; good &#8212; work!
Congratulations on the         very         professional way you pulled it off.
(Wyndham Place Charlemagne       Trust) (s5.7)     c. Many thanks for this and I will indeed pass it on to colleagues.
(The Jesuit European       Office) (s5.7)     d. I paid particular attention to 3 and 4 in the summary because I         have some responsibility         as the lead Bishop for the Bishops' Europe Panel.
I couldn't agree more         that the photo         opportunity occasions in Brussels really do not amount to very much         other than a photo         opportunity/media box ticking.
This is not the dialogue called for by         the Lisbon Treaty.
I         have said this on two occasions and will repeat it until it is heard.
(Church of England)       (s5.7)     4.3 European Institutions     In November 2011 the Bureau of European Policy Advisors of the European       Commission which       coordinates religious dialogue in the framework of Article 17 of the       Lisbon Treaty welcomed the       findings of this research.
The advisor on religious issues to the       President of the European       Commission wrote to Dr Leustean:     a.
Many thanks for having shared the findings of your study [...] Your         study is most         valuable for our work and I will circulate it inside our House.
(s5.6)     The Archbishop of Canterbury's Representative to the EU invited Dr       Leustean to have a book       launch at the European Parliament (February 2013).
The event was hosted by       the Vice-President       of the European Parliament and brought together sixty-four EU civil       servants and religious policy       practitioners including the present Advisor on Religious Dialogue to the       President of the European       Commission (s5.6).
4.4 Public awareness     Dr Leustean wrote commissioned commentaries on the research for The         European Voice, an EU       affairs weekly newspaper (the Economist Group), February 2012 (distributed       to all participants in       the annual Fair on EU Studies in Brussels) (s5.3) and Britain         in 2012, the ESRC's annual       newsstand magazine, December 2011 (s5.4).
He was interviewed and quoted in       The New York         Times, 18 June 2013 and The International Herald Tribune, 19       June 2013 (s5.6).
