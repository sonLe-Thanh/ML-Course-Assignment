     Context: The research investigations both build on and challenge       previous conceptions of popular       performance cultures and, particularly through their dissemination into       the commercial market       place and popular media contexts, have begun to impact on public       understandings of past       performance cultures and their connection to contemporary ones.
The types       of impact involved       here are: economic, cultural life, public discourse.
Reach and       significance of the impact has been       summarised below under three main headings:     i.
Reach and Recognition of Novels:     Walking in Pimlico and The Newgate Jig have both been       enthusiastically reviewed in a range of       contexts: "a wildly inventive romp through the lowlife of 19th       Century England ... extremely hard to       put down" (The Times on Walking in Pimlico [5.1]); "Drama       both on and off stage that is blood red       in tooth and claw.... a first rate crime novel that rises high above the       normal standards of the       genre" (British Theatre Guide on The Newgate Jig [5.3]);       see also [5.2] and [5.4].
By October 2012       (most recent available figures), the novels had achieved combined English       language print sales of       7,137, generating economic benefit for a small independent publisher.
Following initial hardback       publications in 2009 and 2010 respectively, both were released as       paperbacks and in Amazon       Kindle editions (2010 and 2011).
The Newgate Jig has also been       republished in a large-print       edition (W.F.
Howes, 2011) and as an audiobook (Oakhill Publishing, 2011).
Both Featherstone's novels have also achieved international reach in       non-Anglophone contexts,       having been published in Italian translations by mainstream publisher       Newton Compton, and in       French by Univers Poche, Paris.
Walking in Pimlico became Il         Circo maledetto!
(2010: sales of       10,177 by October 2012) and Que le spectacle commence (2011: sales       4,044), while The Newgate         Jig became La giostra degli impiccati (2011: sales 4,864)       and La Gigue du Pendu (2012: sales       figures pending).
A Portuguese translation of Walking in Pimlico       is forthcoming in 2014 from       Brazilian publisher Editora Underworld.
Marketing for the Italian       translation has included       commissioning of online video commercials [5.6].
Featherstone has been interviewed about her work in print contexts [5.5],       and has been invited to       give numerous public talks about her novels and the 19th C.       popular entertainments informing       them.
These include talks for: Friends of the Pavilion, Matlock Bath       (2013); Lowdham Book       Festival's Victorian Day, Nottingham (2013); Camden Arts Centre, London:       Caf&#233; Curio series       (2013) [5.7]; Eastwood Writers' Group (2012); Lincoln Book Festival: talk       simultaneously broadcast       by Siren 107.3 FM's `Reading Room Live' (2011) [5.8]; Heanor Festival,       Derbyshire (2011);       Chorlton Book Festival, Manchester (2010); Sabine Baring-Gould       Appreciation Society (2010);       Derbyshire Literature Festival, "Meet the Author" (2010); Ilkeston Library       Readers' Group (2010).
In       2010, Featherstone also participated in book signing events at Waterstones       bookshops in Derby       and Nottingham, and at Heffers bookshop in Cambridge.
In 2011 The Newgate       Jig was a finalist in       the East Midlands Book Awards, and Featherstone was featured as "Writer of       the Month" by       Writing East Midlands in December that year.

Adaptation:     Radio: Featherstone and Bratton's The Victorian Clown       became the basis for a 3-part series       broadcast in BBC Radio 4's "Afternoon Reading" strand (28-30 December       2010).
Tony Lidington       adapted and performed the book's examination of "The Circus Memories of       James Frowde" (based       on Frowde's memoirs).
Online: Featherstone's work on The Journals of Sydney         Race gave rise to another form of       adaptation when in 2012 she was commissioned by The Space, an Arts       Council-supported online       platform for free access to the arts, to contribute 4 short essays to       James Walker's curated exhibit       "Sillitoe's Nottingham: Then and Now" (N.B.
Web pages for The Space were       closed down 31       October 2013, when funding ended, so unfortunately this material is no       longer available online).
These explored aspects of the 19th C. Nottingham Goose Fair, as discussed       in Race's diaries       (including fairground food, freak shows, fisticuffs), and connected them       with the 1950s experiences       of Arthur Seaton, anti-hero of Alan Sillitoe's Saturday Night and         Sunday Morning.
The third web       essay, "Fairs and fisticuffs", has been audio-recorded for the "Sillitoe       Trail" iPhone App, allowing       listeners to hear it while touring connected sites around Nottingham.
iii.
Consultancy     Featherstone's recognised expertise on 19th C popular       entertainments has led to her being       consulted by a range of broadcasters during the current REF period, either       during the research       stage of programme-making and/or as a featured "expert".
Examples include:     Television: In May 2012, BBC1's The One Show       (average daily audience, 5 million) featured       Featherstone in conversation with actor Larry Lamb (one of whose ancestors       was a lion tamer),       discussing the role of animal trainers in the Victorian menagerie.
Featherstone has also contributed       to several programmes for BBC4 (average daily reach, 2 million): The         World's Oldest Joke (6       March 2013) featured Featherstone discussing the gag book of music hall       performer Tom       Lawrence with Sir Michael Grade (this exchange was featured as "Moment of       the Week" in the       Radio Times [5.9]); the Timeshift series (2011) drew on       Featherstone's expertise on fairs and       circuses for All the fun of the fair (5 August) and When the         circus comes to town (11 August); the       Rude Britannia series (2010) consulted her on "Bawdy Songs and         Lewd Photographs" (15 June).
Radio: Numerous appearances on BBC Radio include: Night         Waves (Radio 3's flagship arts       programme, 5 October 2010), discussing 20th C music hall       comedian Norman Wisdom; In Search         of the Wantley Dragon (Radio 4, 5 September 2009); The Verb       (Radio 3, 8 May 2009) on       "rudeness" in music hall; Woman's Hour (Radio 4, 4 August 2008) on       music hall performer Nellie       Wallace [5.10]; Making History (Radio 4, 21 September 2009), on       Victorian "pedestrienne"       Madame Angelo (endurance walker/performer).
A drama documentary on       Victorian female sports       entertainers is currently under consideration with BBC R4 Commissioning       Editor.
Developmental: Featherstone's research and publishing has       led to various invitations to       participate in or run commissioned workshops for organisations including       Derbyshire County       Council Libraries (2013), Writing East Midlands (Arts Council funded), and       the Theatre Writing       Partnership (Nottingham Playhouse, 2009-10).
These events have encouraged       discussion of       creative writing, and promoted understanding of how organisations can best       work with authors.
In       2010 Featherstone also acted as a consultant to Norfox Young People's       Theatre (Capitol Theatre,       Manchester) on their production of The Magnificent Tale of Emily Law         and Arturo the Waterboy,       which explored popular entertainments on "the dark side of Victorian       Manchester".
