     The original Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer (IGA) is manufactured by HIDEN Isochema, a       world leader in the design and manufacture of gas and vapor sorption       instrumentation for       research, development and production applications in surface chemistry and       materials science.
The IGA instrumentation suite has achieved a leading position worldwide in       this field with a       turnover exceeding &#163;3Mpa.
Ross et al's continuing collaboration with HIDEN       Isochema has       made a major contribution to the present commercial significance of the       technique in a range       of sectors:             Context: The IGA series is now widely recognised as the most         accurate analytical tool         available for the characterisation of a range of different hydrogen         storage materials and         Ross et al have developed three IGA instruments in their lab with         different characteristics         which have been used to develop new applications.
5 Salford Ph.Ds have         also continued         their research as scientific developers at HIDEN.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)         removal, coal         research, clean energy technology and the interaction of water with         natural materials are all         examples of the application of sorption instrumentation.
Both the IGA         and IGAsorp series         are used widely in environmental vapor sorption research and in the         pharmaceutical         industry, while the IGA and IMI series offer higher pressure gas         sorption capability for         applications that require the determination of the uptake of gases such         carbon dioxide and         methane at elevated pressures (Carbon Storage and Capture).
Research on         the absorption         of deuterated toluene in carbons [7] and more recently in         reactor graphites [8] using         contrast matching establishes which pores are open to the liquid and         energy researchers         using IGA technology include those in the oil and gas industry, and         those developing         membranes for fuel cell applications.
2008-onwards: Ross et al used the IGA to measure the diffusion         of hydrogen in metals,         specifically, in palladium silver alloys foils, where knowledge of the         behaviour of hydrogen         isotopes is essential for hydrogen isotope separation in fusion         applications.
Cycling metal hydrogen systems using IGA led to the development of in         situ cycling         experiments on neutron diffractometers which has been widely adopted in         practice,         demonstrating the capacity to change the hydrogen content in situ by         changing hydrogen         pressures and temperatures.
A derivative of the IGA instrument was         installed on neutron         scattering equipment at ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratories for this         purpose.
Neutron inelastic scattering from hydrogen compounds adsorbed by         catalysts on carbon         substrates has proved a powerful way of identifying molecules on         surfaces in low         concentrations, demonstrating applications in a range of industrial         processes in         collaboration with Dr Peter Albers, of Degussa AQura [b].
This         work on the development ofcommercial catalyst systems leading to the         good carbonaceous catalyst support for fuel         cell applications was important.
Additionally, the method was deployed         in the development         of processes for regeneration of the catalyst used in the production of         hydrogen peroxide.
2005-2009: The HYTRAIN (Hydrogen storage research training         network) project had the         primary aim of training researchers in the area of hydrogen storage in         solid media with 12         researchers trained and most now employed in research and development in         the hydrogen/         renewable energy field.
2006-2010: The NESSHy (Novel efficient solid storage for         Hydrogen) EC Framework         project tackled a wide range of possible materials for hydrogen storage.
Morrison was         responsible for ab initio modelling and Ross was responsible for         characterisation.
The         project, which included the materials produced being tested by Daimler         Chrysler,         demonstrated the use of combinatorial thin film technique in the         Mg-Ni-Ti system.
The         research identified a favourable composition for hydrogen storage         applications.
2007-2010: Small Angle Neutron Scattering studies of porosity         in activated carbons for use         as hydrogen absorbers led to collaboration with Chemviron Carbon Ltd         focused on the use         of small angle neutron scattering with contrast matching and variable         adsorbate partial         pressures in the study of porosity in activated carbons: "The           project involved successful           industry-academia collaboration with partners Chemviron Carbon, and           has led to over           &#163;1.1m follow on funding to develop this and related technology."

http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/science/energy/isis-research-into-nuclear-graphite-could-keep-the-uks-lights-on14466.html         2011: Our work on hydrogen storage and the development of         demonstration equipment for         this purpose has led to a considerable amount of outreach activity to         schools.
Additionally,         funding of &#163;30,000 was awarded to work in partnership with the Museum of         Science and         Industry, local schools and Manchester Science Festival, of which the         University is a         sponsor, to engage young people, their families and carers with science         and making         research accessible to non-experts.
