     Dr Bradley's research on pilgrimage has been used by churches,       contemporary Christian       communities and heritage bodies both to stimulate pilgrimages to       significant historic and spiritual       sites and as a basis for developing new pilgrim routes.
It has had a       direct impact in increasing       visitor numbers to significant sites, changing interpretation and signage       practices, promoting new       routes and directly stimulating involvement in pilgrimage infrastructure       projects on the part of the       armed forces.
The most longstanding and consistent user of the research has been the       Iona Community, the       ecumenical Christian community based on Iona which seeks, among other       objectives, to       reinvigorate contemporary spirituality.
Directly as a result of his       research into Columba and early       Celtic Christianity, the Community invited Dr Bradley to engage with it in       rethinking its weekly       pilgrimages around the island.
Dr Bradley proposed a series of specific       changes to these, which       have been adopted, and was subsequently invited to lead nine study weeks       for the Community on       the theme of pilgrimage.
These have brought over 800 participants from 12       different countries, to       stay on Iona and led directly to invitations to advise Swedish, Norwegian       and Danish pilgrim       pastors on new ways to encourage modern pilgrimage.
The Island Centres'       Director/Programme       Co-Ordinator writes that `Your research on Columba, Irish monasticism         and Celtic pilgrimage has         had a direct and perceptible impact on the way that we present these         topics to our guests staying         on Iona.
As well as directly feeding into our programmes, such as the         one you led for 43 guests         from all over the world, from 8-14 June 2013, it has also led us to         change the content of our weekly         pilgrimages around the island &#8212; the scripts for these pilgrimages have         been changed to reflect and         incorporate the results of your research &#8212; this has enhanced the         experience of our guests and         visitors'.
She estimates that `the week in which you disseminated         your research into pilgrimage in         June 2011 directly generated a total of &#163;34,760 for the island economy'       and that, overall, the ten       pilgrim weeks devised and led by Dr Bradley have generated in excess of       &#163;250,000 for the Iona       economy [S1].
Comments and feedback gathered from those attending these       weeks shows that       they travelled from as far afield as New Zealand specifically to hear Dr       Bradley and described their       experience of Iona as being hugely enriched and enhanced, and their       perspectives changed, as a       result of attending his presentations [S6].
More recently, Dr Bradley was invited to present his research on the       development of pilgrimage on       Iona to a conference organised by Historic Scotland in April 2012 [S7].
This has led to an on-going       involvement with Historic Scotland, advising on the substantial       re-interpretation of Iona's historical       landscape.
The principal researcher for Heritage Research at Historic       Scotland writes that `Dr         Bradley's research on the re-evaluation of Iona Abbey in the late         nineteenth century, and in         particular the role of the 8th Duke of Argyll, has been         incorporated into the new permanent         exhibition and Audio Guide unveiled in May 2013 for the 1450th         anniversary of Columba's arrival on         Iona, in the rebuilding of the Abbey.
We welcome more than 50,000         ticket-buying visitors to the         abbey each year, making a valuable contribution to the economy of the         Hebrides.
Their experience         and understanding of Iona's spiritual history has been considerably         enhanced as a result of Dr         Bradley's research'.
[S2]     Dr Bradley's research has had a direct impact on the promotion, planning       and development of a       long-distance pilgrim trail between Iona and St. Andrews.
As a direct       result of the book Pilgrimage:         A Spiritual and Cultural Journey (2009), he was asked by Pax Travel,       the leading pilgrimage       tourism company in Britain, to devise and lead a pilgrimage across       Scotland from Iona to St       Andrews in August 2011.This week is estimated to have generated &#163;30,000       for the Scottish       economy; Pax's Managing Director writes `as a result of highlighting         your excellent book, which we         consider to be the standard work on this intriguing subject, we have had         many inquiries from         groups and individuals for pilgrimages, including many from the USA.
Your research has had a         great impact on our whole approach to the subject of pilgrimage,         specifically leading us to         introduced new routes'.
[S3]     Dr Bradley's research has also had a direct impact on the development of       a pilgrim route across       Fife from St Andrews to Edinburgh via Dunfermline.
He was invited to       provide presentations in       2011 to Fife Council and to the Dunfermline-Trondheim Twinning       Association.
These research-       based presentations have become the basis for route planning and for       modelling the Fife route on       the Norwegian St Olav Pilgrim Path on which Dr Bradley carried out       extensive research for his       2009 book.
Over the last ten years Dr Bradley has directly applied his research into       devising and leading       pilgrimages around St Andrews.
The minister of Holy Trinity, the Town       Kirk, testifies that `the         annual St Andrew's Day pilgrimages which you have devised and led         directly based on your         academic research on St Andrews as a place of pilgrimage have had a         direct and demonstrable         impact in enhancing the experience of both visitors and residents.
Through them, and the annual         Stations of the Cross which you have led round Holy Trinity in Holy         Week, your academic research         has changed practices in the main church in the town and enhanced its         outreach to the         community'.
[S4] In addition to these initiatives, Dr Bradley has       devised and led Good Friday       pilgrimages around St Andrews over the last three years, directly based in       his academic research,       which have brought together every single major denomination in the town       for the first time.
As a direct consequence of his books on the subject, Dr Bradley was       invited to address the       Scottish Parliament on promoting pilgrimage in February 2011.
His       presentation, attended by       MSPs, church, local authority and tourism representatives, gave a major       impetus to the campaign       to develop pilgrim routes across Scotland and has led to invitations to       work with individuals wanting       to initiate local projects.
An example are the meetings that he has had       with the minister of       Whitekirk, an ancient place of pilgrimage in East Lothian, who approached       him having read his       books to provide advice an input on her plans to promote and reinterpret       pilgrimage from Whitekirk       to Haddington.
His input has stimulated new practices such as pilgrim       walks and information       centres.
Dr Bradley is the main academic adviser for the Scottish Pilgrim       Routes Forum,       established in February 2012 following extensive consultations involving       church groups, politicians,       Scottish Natural Heritage, Visit Scotland, and walkers' organizations.
His       input into the Forum's       deliberations, based directly on his research is having a significant       impact on the practical       development of pilgrim routes across Scotland.
[S8]     On the strength of his published work on pilgrimage, Dr Bradley was       invited to give a two-day       residential presentation to Scottish army chaplains on the subject in       February 2012 at the Army       Chaplaincy centre, Amport House, Hampshire.
The Deputy Chaplain General of       the British Army       writes of the direct impact this had in leading chaplains to discuss and       develop with their       commanding officers initiatives to involve troops relocated from Germany       to Scotland in pilgrim trail       infrastructure work.
This significant and practical on-the-ground       demonstration of involvement with       the local community fits the Army's overall strategy in the current       relocation of British forces from       Germany and will roll out over the next ten years as a direct result of Dr       Bradley's research and       input.
