     The economic and cultural impacts generated by this project were complex,       multi-faceted and intertwined, and brought both real-time and longer term       benefits to the company.
In addition to the expected outcomes at the end       of the two year period (mapping the research results and making       recommendations), the project also &#8212; uniquely &#8212; generated significant       impacts during the course of the project, specifically relating to       programming form/content, modes of audience interaction, and strategic       development.
The project placed Boomerang+ in a unique position, because none of its       competitors had undertaken an audience study of this scale or rigour       (Source 5.1, p. 4; Sources 5.2 and 5.3); the insights generated by the       project gave the company a marked `edge', enabling them to ground and       justify their market position by drawing on concrete and current audience       data (Source 5.1, p. 5).
Impacts during the research process     The impact of the project on practitioners was instantly meaningful to       the company's creative outputs and played a positive role in the       development of current programmes.
Throughout the research project, the       company pro-actively responded to feedback from the target audience and       (where appropriate) made agile, innovative and immediate adjustments to       their production work.
Examples of the project's impact on creative       practice included:            Adjustments to the form and content of continuity links: The research         revealed that audience members often had strong opinions about the         presentation styles of the on-air talent and the content of continuity         links (also referred to as the `wrap-around' service that the company         provides for S4C), so the company was able to quickly respond by making         subtle changes to scripts/tone (See: Source 5.1, pp.
6-7; Source 5.2).
Adjustments to existing methods of audience interaction and the         introduction of new innovations: Boomerang+ often invited text message         participation during their continuity links and live Saturday-morning         broadcasts, but the research revealed that the target audience preferred         the more tangible sense of interaction created by phone-ins.
The         research also generated valuable feedback on competitions (especially in         relation to prizes) and indicated enthusiasm for `dual-screen' formats.
The company responded by making appropriate changes to their modes of         audience engagement (cf.
Sources 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3).
Underpinning decision-making, strategic development and new content         ideas: Boomerang+ was able to use the KTP as a means to gauge audience         response to its `tween' provision.
The research revealed that the         company's newly launched programme, Stwnsh ar y Ffordd, was         favourably received.
The first series had focused on primary schools,         because the company had predicted that the content would appeal mostly         to younger audiences.
However, the appeal was broader than anticipated,         with unexpectedly enthusiastic responses from 11- to 13-year-old         children.
So, Boomerang+ decided that the second series should involve         both primary and secondary schools, and adjusted the filming schedule         accordingly (cf.
Sources 5.1 and 5.2).
These illustrative examples indicate the importance of the KTP project       findings, in terms of scaffolding and enhancing the company's broader       understandings of their target audience, and helping to shape their       abilities to recognise and respond to the needs of their viewers within a       unique socio-cultural, minority language community.
Longer-term impact: Economic benefit &amp; influence on         practice     Whilst the short-term benefits were clear during the course of the       project, Boomerang+ also anticipated a longer-term positive impact (See:       Sources 5.1 and 5.2).
The three-year S4C contract period within which the       research was conducted, worth in the region of &#163;4.8m per annum to the       company, was due for tender in April 2013.
The company have since had that       contract extended until April 2014.
Boomerang+ estimates that 20% of any       new contract would be directly attributed to the KTP project results,       representing a significant economic contribution to the company       specifically and the Welsh economy more generally.
Further, the company       estimates that, over three years, their turnover will increase by &#163;1m as a       direct result of the KTP (Source 5.1, p. 8).
More subtly, the company regarded the KTP project as having longer-term       benefits in relation to building their Welsh-language children's content       production business, increasing sales to network broadcasters of       children's programmes (in the region of &#163;0.5m), generating &#163;40k through       syndication, and improving general operations (Source 5.1, p. 8).
`Facilitation' became a key word, in terms of developing creative ideas       into production concepts, re-directing existing creative production       practices, and improving the management, analysis and distribution of       knowledge and information relating to cultural trends.
The impact of the       KTP exceeded the company's expectations in this respect (Source 5.1, p.       13).
General benefits of the research     The future availability of contracts for the production of children's       television content may be limited, mainly as a result of the UK       government's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) which saw significant       reductions in expenditure and a new funding regime for S4C (Source 5.1, p.       6).
Since children's programming is one of the largest single S4C       contracts held by Boomerang+, and accounts for 200 jobs, it is       economically imperative that the company continues to secure work.
As a direct result of the project, Boomerang+ enjoyed the benefit of       being able to test its creative ideas in a low-risk context before       pitching to S4C and/or broadcasting live, and gauging the reception of       current programming.
As indicated in Source 5.1 (p. 10 and p. 12), the KTP       project has enhanced the company's credibility and reputation within the       creative industries sector in Wales (also see: Sources 5.2 and 5.3), by       demonstrating their commitment to producing the highest possible quality       content.
More recently, on September 25th 2013, Boom Pictures' Children's       Department hosted a Royal Television Society special event &#8212; ``Not in       front of the Children': Can Quality and Originality Survive?'
&#8212; focusing       on the future of children's television in the context of increased       competition and decreased funding.
The event included presentations from       S4C's Commissioner of Children's Content, a producer from CBeebies (BBC),       a managing director from the independent production company Ho Ho       Entertainment, and Head of Boom Plant (who was also Company Supervisor of       the KTP project).
The results of the KTP research featured prominently       throughout the event, as `evidence' of the target audience's current       characteristics and a key source of information in thinking about future       strategies for those working within children's television production.
As       such, the project is continuing to `impact' on the industry.
