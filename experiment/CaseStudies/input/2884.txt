Context     Over 70 lysosomal diseases exist with an incidence of 1/7000.
They are       progressive, multisystem diseases, usually affecting children, with       severely shortened life expectancy.
In 1993 there was one treatment for       LSDs: haematopoietic stem cell transplant.
This was only effective in       severe MPSI and had a high procedure-related mortality rate of ~45%.
Drug       treatments were slow to appear and individually had limited impact; the       first drug in 1994 for Gaucher disease was cerezyme (imiglucerase), used       for around 80 patients in the UK.
In the early 1990s, LSDs were often       diagnosed very late or misdiagnosed and palliative management was       dispersed throughout the UK.
Reach and significance of the impact     Improved clinical management of LSDs            Several multinational collaborative natural history studies in         Manchester, most of which are still ongoing, resulted in         improved/earlier LSD diagnosis and disease management (S1).
Wraith wrote NHS clinical management guidelines for 6 LSDs         which helped to reduce age of diagnosis in several LSDs including MPSI,         from an average range of 2-10 years of age (2000) to 3 months-4 years of         age (2013), depending on severity (S2).
This improvement is important as         early treatment has increased clinical benefit.
2005: Manchester was made one of eight National Specialist         Commissioned Centres in England for management and treatment of LSDs         with Wraith (now Jones) as director due to Wraith's         natural history trial background (S3-S6).
2010-11 Manchester's recognition as a worldwide centre for LSDs         resulted in Manchester and Wraith handling 15,500 diagnoses per         annum for paediatric inherited metabolic diseases from over 20         countries, of which ~30% are LSDs.
2010-11: 1983 LSD patients were managed at 8 NCG centres &#8212; 350 in         Manchester (S5).
Enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapies     Enzyme replacement therapy trials with Wraith/Jones as CI       in Manchester were conducted for the LSDs MPSI, MPSII, MPSVI, Fabry,       and Pompe disease, and the substrate reduction therapy drug miglustat for       Niemann pick C, in collaboration with Biomarin, Shire, TKT, Genzyme,       Actelion and Synageva.
2003-13: 6 drugs licensed from these trials in &gt;20 countries         including US, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Japan and Australia (S7).
2011-12: 9 licensed drugs for 7 LSDs provided in 8 English NCG centres         for 801 patients with a drug budget of &#163;124 million, 6 of which (~2/3 of         worldwide LSD drug market) were trialled in Manchester by Wraith/Jones         (S3).
2013 &gt;3000 LSD patients in &gt;20 countries worldwide benefited         from drug treatment, ~2/3 from the 6 drugs trialled by Wraith/Jones         (S7, S8).
2013 GALNS for MPSIVA trialled in Manchester (Jones) awaiting         FDA and EMA approval (S7).
Wraith and colleagues have delivered significant quality of         life improvements in patients with these 7 LSDs as a result of their         research, with improvements in cognitive function, muscular, and         skeletal function as well as significantly improved life expectancy of         on average around 10 years or more depending on disease severity.
Previous life expectancies of a few months in MPSI Hurler disease, is         now considerably extended lifespans of decades, as well as improved         cognitive and/or skeletal outcomes.
Improved haematopoietic stem cell transplantation outcomes     To improve HSCT outcomes, Fairbairn and Wraith developed       retroviral gene therapy in HSCT as a safer and more efficacious       alternative with the world's first LSD gene therapy clinical trial for       MPSIH in Manchester in 1997.
This trial allowed a more efficacious approach developed by Bigger         and colleagues using a lentiviral vector for MPSIIIA between 2007-13,         expected in clinical trial in 2015.
Wynn and colleagues developed safer HSCT for LSDs.
Prior to         1995, 1-2 patients pa were transplanted for MPSIH in Manchester.
By         2010, this rose to 7 pa and transplant expanded to other LSDs, including         Niemann Pick CII, resulting in ~10-15 patients transplanted pa (S8, S9).
Engrafted survival improved from 57% in 1994-2007 to 94% post-2007 and         a demonstration by Wynn, Bigger that HSCT is more effective than         ERT in MPSI disease, with some patients' cognitive development in the         normal range.
Wynn and colleagues wrote metabolic transplant guidelines for         The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation haematopoietic         stem cell transplant handbook 2008 which include expansion to other         lysosomal diseases (S9).
Novel biomarkers for LSDs were developed or validated in Manchester         including heparan cofactor II thrombin complex and dermatan sulphate         chondroitin sulphate ratio, both of which correlate with clinical         outcomes in treated patients with MPSI, II and VI.
Dermatan sulphate chondroitin sulphate ratio has been adopted into         standard clinical disease management in Manchester.
