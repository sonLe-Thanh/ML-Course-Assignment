     Our research on road run-off has had impacts on practitioners       through improved monitoring and risk assessment methods for managing       pollutants, and changes in guidelines for road and bridge construction,       resulting in a more efficient use of resources and economic           benefits; it has had impacts on public policy       by informing the development of legislation and standards; impacts           on the environment by developing new approaches for assessing       the risks of road runoff to aquatic habitats, resulting in a more robust       assessment and an enhanced level of protection.
The principal direct beneficiary: The Highways Agency (HA)       is responsible for England's strategic road network, which comprises 4300       miles of motorways and truck roads, carries about 4 million vehicles/day       and is valued at &#163;108bn.
Our research in collaboration with the HA and       Environment Agency (EA) on the effects of routine road runoff on receiving       waters and their ecology, was used to develop a new Environmental Impact       Assessment tool designed to prevent adverse ecological effects in the       receiving water.
The Highways Agency Water Risk Assessment Tool (HAWRAT)       uses toxicity thresholds established by our research that are consistent       with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive and are agreed       with the EA.
The HAWRAT forms part of the HA guidance published in the       Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB, HD45 Road Drainage and the       Water Environment) [S1].
The DMRB contains all current standards,       advice notes and other published documents relating to the design,       assessment and operation of the strategic road network in the UK.
It is       used by all highway practitioners, including those working on the       non-strategic road network.
Maltby's team's contribution to HD45 and the       risk assessment tool HAWRAT is evidenced by text in the manual:     "Collaborative research has been undertaken by the HA and EA to         investigate the chronic effects of sediment-bound pollutants on the         ecology of receiving waters (Gaskell et al., 2008) [S2].
This research identifies the scenarios under which contaminated sediment         in runoff would be likely to have a negative impact on receiving water         ecology.
The results have been used to develop Threshold Effects Levels         (TELs) and Probable Effects Levels (PELs) for metal and PAH         concentrations in sediment.
......This research is discussed in further         detail in Chapter 3 and forms the basis of the risk assessment procedure         discussed in Chapter 5."
[S1].
Chapter 5 in the manual       introduces and explains the use of the HAWRAT tool, and again draws on our       research [S2].
Impacts on practitioners: Commenting on the impact of our       research, the HA has stated:     "The outputs of this research have had a major impact on the policies         and practices of the HA, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable         use of resources and enhancing environmental protection.
It has also         informed policy formulation by UK government departments and the         resulting guidance has been adopted by several other countries.
"The HA guidance is issued through the Design Manual For Roads and         Bridges (DMRB) which is signed up to and used by the Devolved         Administrations (Scotland, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland).
DMRB has also         been adopted elsewhere most notably in Ireland, Australia and most parts         of the Middle East.
The Japanese have developed a hybrid version and the         Chinese have had it translated for their use.
The Portuguese, via the         National Laboratory for Civil Engineering, used the outputs from this         research to develop "Guidelines for the Integrated Management of Road         Runoff in Portugal."
[S3].
Our research has also informed the       Norwegian Public Roads Administration's research and development programme       [S4].
In the UK, "Since 2010, HD45 has been applied to approximately 5-10         major projects (&gt; &#163;10m) and 30-50 smaller improvement schemes         (&#163;0.5-5.0m).
In the future it can be expected that there will on average         be 2-3 major projects and 10-20 improvement/maintenance schemes that the         advice will routinely be applied to on an annual basis" [S3].
The DMRB guidance and HAWRAT resulting from our research has been used in       a large number of environmental impact assessments of road projects across       the UK (e.g.
in England [S5], Scotland [S6] and Northern       Ireland [S7]).
Economic impacts: "The revised guidance has led to         rationalisation of design with significant cost savings on some projects         and more sustainable use of resources on others.
It is not easy to         separate the savings from one element of a highway design as a scheme         progresses, however, as an example the updated approach to guidance was         in part attributable to a saving of c. &#163;1m on a widening scheme on the         M1" [S3].
Savings accrue from more targeted use of       interventions.
Our research contributed to an important change in the       Environment Agency's policy for dealing with road runoff, providing a       measured, risk-based approach to replace the blanket requirement for silt       traps and oil separators on all discharges from motorways and major trunk       roads.
We enabled this risk-based approach to be extended from only       considering soluble contaminants (DMRB, 2006) to now including       sediment-bound contaminants (which we showed can have a much greater       impact on the ecology of receiving waters) in the most recent guidance       (DMRB, 2009) [S1].
Impacts on public policy: Our research strengthened       cooperation between the HA and EA, with the HD45/09: Road Drainage and         the Water Environment forming part of the key commitments between       the two agencies specified in their 2009 memorandum of understanding [S8].
"The research has contributed towards a shared         understanding between the HA and EA of the environmental impacts and         risks associated with routine non-urban highway runoff and an agreed         position on how to address risks" [S3].
Through this, our       research input to HD45/09 has influenced secondary legislation in       relation to Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) and "has been         used to inform central government departments on policy formulation, in         particular development of the National SuDS Standards" [S3].
"The research was used to inform the development of secondary         legislation for Floods and Water Management Act 2010, which granted an         exemption to the HA from the SuDS Approval Board for its drainage         designs (The Sustainable Drainage (Approval and Adoption) (England)         Order 2012 (Clause 3(1)(b)(i)) [S3].
Prior to this exemption,       most of the HA's construction work would require approval under this Act,       a process that can have considerable time and cost implications.
However,       because the HA uses the HAWRAT tool to guide assessment and design of       highway drainage systems, they are exempted from the need to seek       approval.
The HA must comply with the requirements of the Act, but have       become their own approval board, saving time and money.
Impacts on the environment: "The outputs of this         research are being used to assess the risk of pollution arising from         existing highway outfalls on the HA network that are a legacy of design         practices which, whilst appropriate at the time of construction, would         not meet today's stricter environmental requirements."
"The new         guidance is a more robust approach to environmental impact assessment         ensuring identified risks are mitigated effectively through the design         process, and that resources are directed and used in the most effective         way" [S3].
Our research outputs are "being used to develop a code of practice and         set of tools that can be adopted by Local Highway Authorities to assist         them with meeting their obligations under the EU Water Framework         Directive (WFD)."
"This research has had considerable impact         beyond the HA.
It has informed the EA's Source Apportionment Tool used         in WFD planning, contributes towards DEFRA's programme of work to tackle         non-agricultural sources of diffuse pollution and will inform the second         round of River Basin Management Planning and associated Programme of         Measures" [S3].
In addition, our project partner at the EA has stated that "Given the         recently announced &#163;28bn spending on roads, having the tools to identify         where mitigation measures are needed and where they provide no benefit         will have immense value.
In the past, the Environment Agency has         demanded the provision of facilities such as oil separators at virtually         every site, which may not always provide good value for money.
In the         future programme the Highways Agency guidance will enable both the         regulators and the highways operators to invest in protection of the         environment where it is needed and effective and not elsewhere" [S9].
In conclusion, our research has played a crucial role in the development       and implementation of ecological risk assessment tools for road runoff       contaminants that have been widely used in the UK and internationally to       the benefit of the environment and greater cost-effectiveness.
