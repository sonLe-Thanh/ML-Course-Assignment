     O'Shaughnessy has contributed to a material and distinct improvement in       the profile of film       and media education in this country and internationally.
Specifically,       this impact has been       targeted at schools (through film education outreach) and the general       public (through his work       with the Institut Fran&#231;ais in London, the Maison Fran&#231;aise in Oxford and       international film       publications).
This impact has drawn directly from his research into the       films of Jean Renoir in       the context of French Cinema, with the reach and significance of his       outputs strengthening his       own ability to change perceptions of cinema and cement his impact with       specific audiences.
O'Shaughnessy worked with Film         Education from 2009 to its closure in 2013 and introduced       films to schools audiences every year supporting their mission to champion       film and present it       as a learning tool and rigorous discipline in its own right.
Film       Education reports 1.6 million       children and young people used its resources in class.
Likewise, they       highlight more than half       a million attendees of free in-cinema screening events and festivals each       year, a total of 4.4       million since the inaugural event in 1997.
O'Shaughnessy presented       Renoir's La Grande         Illusion as part of National Schools' Film Week in 2012 with       successful showings preceded by       an introduction and followed by a discussion in Bristol (Watershed,       6/11/12), Birmingham       (MAC, 7/11/12) and Nottingham (Broadway, 8/11/12).
This followed the       publication of his 2009       output, La Grande Illusion, demonstrating the subsequent reach of       this original research       supported by the UoA.
He was also commissioned to produce a study guide for the film       (http://www.ntu.ac.uk/edu/specialist_centres/network_for_languages/document_uploads/1474       55.pdf       ) that was made available to all schools in the country via the Film       Education website.
O'Shaughnessy's role in producing materials and speaking to non-specialist       audiences about       La Grande Illusion constituted an important strand of Film       Education's educational mission,       communicating the outcomes of his specialist research to a young audience.
O'Shaughnessy has engaged with other cultural organisations to broaden       their appeal and to       promote the importance of film education.
The Institut Fran&#231;ais in London       is a cultural       organisation dedicated to the promotion of French culture and language,       guided by the French       Embassy.
Specific research activity is also used to broaden the audience       (and hence reach)       of such cultural engagement organisations through special events.
These       include:            The book launch for O'Shaughnessy's La Grande Illusion was         accompanied by a public         screening of the film at the Institut Fran&#231;ais on 09/11/2009.
O'Shaughnessy and         Professor Julian Jackson introduced the film and took part in a Q&amp;A         session, allowing         O'Shaughnessy to explain his work on the politics of style and on the         broader politics of         La Grande Illusion to a non-specialist audience of 150 people.
O'Shaughnessy also gave a talk on La Grande Illusion at the         Leo Baeck Institute         (London), an important centre for the study of the history and culture         of German-         speaking Jews, on the 18/03/2009.
The talk was attended by about 30         people and         followed by a long Q&amp;A session which allowed O'Shaughnessy to engage         with a non-         academic audience committed to the exploration of representations of         Jewishness and         the public memory of anti-semitism.
O'Shaughnessy was invited to be a respondent at the Radical           Footage: Film and         Dissent         day of public debate and screenings at the Nottingham Contemporary         Gallery,         March 2012.
The audience was around forty people.
O'Shaughnessy gave the conference keynote (`Filming in the rubble:         French film and         the world of work) at the Lancashire International Film Festival and         conference,         'Working           life: now and then'; an open, public event, June 2010.
O'Shaughnessy's discovery of a previously unknown draft of the script of       La Grande Illusion       led to its publication in France accompanied by his own commentary upon       it: a process of       investigation leading to new insights effectively shared.
This is       exemplary of the contribution       which O'Shaughnessy's research has made to public debate and discussion,       demonstrated by       the `footprint' of his research outputs in general and specialist media.
He delivered a paper, to an audience of about forty, at a public         conference entitled         'France's mid-century crisis: 1930-1950' on 27/11/2010 at the Maison         Fran&#231;aise in         Oxford.
A recording is available for public access online.
A paper given on Renoir at the University of Warwick in 2011 was         recorded and is         publicly available online as a podcast.
This footprint can also be seen in O'Shaughnessy's influence on film       publications       internationally.
Discussion of O'Shaughnessy's work in Positif, a       popular French film studies       journal with a circulation of 8,000, spoke of his Jean Renoir book as 'one       that people had       taken notice of' and his La Grande Illusion book as 'remarkable,       due to both its intellectual       rigour and the penetrating nature of its commentaries'.
O'Shaughnessy's The         New Face of         Political Cinema was praised in Cineaste (a leading American       film studies journal aimed at a       non-academic audience with a circulation of 11,000) as "a powerful and       eloquent polemic for       retaining a class analysis of film."
Here, O'Shaughnessy's research can be       seen to be actively       shaping the nature of public discussions of film, driven by the reach and       significance of       outputs arising from original research.
By engaging at an impressive scale with non-specialist audiences,       O'Shaughnessy has       changed perceptions of film and media education, as shown by enthusiastic       testimonials,       whilst exercising a strong impact on public discourse, as shown by his       prominent 'footprint' in       various media.
