     Use in national guidance documents: The 2010 publication `Manual       for Streets 2, wider application of the principles' [c], which carried       ministerial endorsement, looked at the application of Link and Place       principles to busier urban streets, and made reference to Link and Place       applications.
(This publication built on the influential national guidance       document on street design: `Manual for Streets' [Department for Transport       and Communities and Local Government, 2007] which incorporated the basic       principles of Link and Place.)
Link and Place applications are also       included in the Irish Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's 2013       `Design manual for urban roads and streets', and in street design guidance       for the South Australia government, which has been used to improve street       design in SA urban areas.
Applications by local authorities and regional government: Jones'       invited presentations on Link and Place and its potential uses has       informed practitioners in the UK and abroad (including Hungary,       Switzerland, China, New Zealand, Australia and the USA) and has led to       several practical applications by consultants and local authorities.
These       include:            West Midlands Red Route team, used in a series of corridor studies         between 2009 and 2011       Belgravia and Mayfair (by the MVA Consultancy); used to assess street         function and appropriate design solutions in a study funded by the         Grosvenor Estate and Westminster City Council in 2008 [g].
Staffordshire County Council, as part of a county strategic assessment         in 2012       Galway City Council (by Taylor Young), as part of a strategic review         of street network functioning in 2010 [d].
South Australian Government, as part of a Transport and Public Health         strategy in 2012 [a].
Smart Move Adelaide, the city's 10-year transport and movement         strategy, in 2012 [b].
The Beijing Municipal Institute of City Planning and Design         incorporated the approach into draft regulations for urban road space in         2013 (due to come into force in 2014) [m], following the publication of         the main 2007 Link and Place report in Chinese in 2012 [e].
East Staffordshire Borough Council's Town Centre Public Realm         Implementation Plan for Burton-on-Trent, published in July 2012 [h], was         informed by the methodology and offered a transparent, structured way of         defining the street hierarchy and is used by the local authority to         inform their strategy and spending on street and public realm         improvements (up to &#163;1m a year).
It is also used to inform the guidance         the council gives to developers as to what they are expected to provide         in the public realm, and to what standard, as part of their proposals.
[j]          Major UK applications: The first of these, in the London Borough       of Hounslow, was as part of an &#163;650m private finance initiative (PFI) to       upgrade and maintain the borough's highway network over a 25-year period,       starting in early 2013.
The local authority needed a transparent method to       define standards for highway reconstruction and maintenance, which would       be objective and responsive to changing circumstances.
The criteria for       allocating a particular Link and Place status to each street segment is       set out in the PFI contract, so that if circumstances change over the       25-year period, then the status of the relevant street segments will be       reassessed, and the maintenance standards adjusted, if necessary.
There       was a national competition among local authorities to obtain PFI funding,       and this novel application of Link and Place was reported by the Council       as being one reason why Hounslow was successful in its bid for DfT and       Treasury funding [l].
The council confirmed that its first targets had       been met: as of 30 June 2013, 432km of streets and footways had been       rehabilitated (15.4% of the total); 7.5% of street lighting replaced with       LED and centralised control; and 8 bridges restored to meet load-carrying       requirements [l].
The second application is in relation to a new strategic assessment of       the future role of the London road network, initiated by the Mayor of       London in autumn 2012.
Jones worked on an independent Roads Task Force,       comprising stakeholders representing different transport mode and business       interests, plus NGOs and local authorities, to use a modified version of       the Link and Place approach (in the form of a family of `street types'       based around `Moving and Place' street functions), recognising that there       is a diverse range of streets which perform different functions, and that       priorities and appropriate design solutions will therefore vary across the       network.
TfL has said this allowed for a much more sophisticated approach       to analysing and planning investment than the traditional road user       hierarchy [k].
The RTF report was published in July 2013, with the `Moving       and Place' classification of streets being a core element [f].
It was       warmly welcomed by a broad range of stakeholders, including the London       boroughs [k].
TfL now requires that boroughs use this street       classification when submitting funding bids for new schemes to TfL, though       the LIP (Local Implementation Plan) process.
The director of London       Councils, which represents London's boroughs, confirms that the approach       is already being used, with a &#163;3m scheme to upgrade the street environment       in Hornchurch completed in June 2013.
In Bexleyheath, the balance between       competing needs has been recognised in the planning process.
[k]     Public engagement in street planning: Jones recognised the       potential of the broader formulation of streets as providing a basis for       carrying out more effective and consensual public engagement activities,       since it explicitly recognises the legitimate interests of all street       users groups, not simply motor vehicle drivers.
In 2007-08, the street       design toolkit he developed in the DISTILLATE project was applied in two       exercises in the West Midlands (Bloxwich and Coventry), where the public       had strongly objected to design proposals put forward by the local       councils, which were then withdrawn.
In both cases, new designs were       generated by local stakeholders that were subsequently implemented with       high levels of public and business support, and minimal objection [see       outputs 8 and 4, pp.
250-252].
In 2008 Walsall Council commissioned UCL to       provide two sets of the toolkit for their own use, in subsequent complex       street design contexts.
Provision of training to urban planners: Jones has been invited to       run various training events to explain the principles of Link and Place       and its derivations to urban planners.
In 2013 this has included sessions       for Urban Design London (with 80+ London borough representatives, TfL       staff and consultants in attendance), and as part of a training programme       for engineers and planners from the UAE, organised by PTRC &#8212; the training       arm of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.
