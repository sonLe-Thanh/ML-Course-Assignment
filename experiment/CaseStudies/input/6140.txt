     The Music for Health Research Centre has made an impact upon the local,       national and international understanding, recognition of and       implementation of music therapy as an effective treatment tool.
For       example, Wigram was a leading contributor to the first Cochrane Review for       schizophrenia (Gold et al, 2005), which led to the inclusion of music       therapy in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)       guidelines; Wigram Oldfield and Odell-Miller have demonstrated the success       of music therapy in relation to autism; and Odell-Miller is a member of       national advisory boards, influencing public knowledge, and policy-making.
Further detail about this impact is:     Assessment and treatment       Professor Wigram, Oldfield (and Sandford, Chair of the then Association       for Professional Music Therapists) jointly reviewed the music therapy       literature related to autistic spectrum disorder in order to provide       evidence of efficacy for the CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health       Service) NHS teams.
Oldfield was consulted owing to her research and       clinical experience with children with autism described in section 2       above.
As a result of this work music therapy was given `two ticks' (2009       onwards) for `Treatments and Therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorders       Currently Under Scientific Evaluation by Research Autism', which meant       that it was seen as an effective means of treatment for this client group       (5g).
Approach and service delivery       Odell-Miller, as invited advisory professor, has enabled a university       alliance to be set up between Anglia Ruskin University and Central and       Northwest London Healthcare (5c), which now has a large arts therapies       profile in NHS training, impacting on service delivery and changing       treatment approaches.
Professors Odell-Miller, Fachner (Professor of Music Health and the Brain       appointed at Anglia Ruskin University, January 2013), Wigram and Oldfield       regularly advise clinicians on research that impacts on healthcare       facilities, thus changing directions and policies of service delivery.
Examples of this are:            Oldfield's involvement in the Northern Ireland Music Therapy Centre's         Lottery Fund research with children and adolescents, which has an impact         on increasing the profile, understanding and positive outcomes of music         therapy in this field.
Fachner is reported as an expert in neuro-scientific research in the         THES and this has already had an impact on raising the profile of music         therapy and neuroscience.
Odell-Miller was research advisor to a clinical NHS trial, the first         of its kind for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which was         reported in 2012 (5i).
The work impacted on a service that has not had         music therapy before, showing music therapy to be beneficial for people         with PTSD.
Impact on the local community of increased engagement with music         therapy is demonstrated through the new state-of-the-art Jerome Booth         Music Therapy Centre, made possible through private donations from         members of the public, amounting to over &#163;1.5M.
The new centre has a         purpose-built clinic and training centre and has already enabled local         schools and health care providers wider access to music therapy, thus         changing lives of people.
The impact of the design of new assessment tools in adult mental         health is demonstrated by Nottingham Healthcare and specifically Rampton         Special Hospital adapting and trialling Odell-Miller's assessment tool         developed in Odell-Miller et al's 2006 study.
Public Policy and Treatment Efficacy       The impact from the first Cochrane Review on schizophrenia (2005) has       far-reaching effects.
Evidence for this is found within the NICE       guidelines (2009) that now recommend music therapy as a beneficial       treatment for people with schizophrenia, alongside other arts therapies,       emphasising the benefits of non-verbal treatments.
Original research       evidence came from the music therapy research studies listed in the       Cochrane Review, and systematically reviewed by Wigram and colleagues.
The       NICE Guidelines state: `The review found consistent evidence that arts         therapies are effective in reducing negative symptoms when compared to         any other control.
Further, they recommend: (8.3.8.1) `...         offering arts therapies to all people with schizophrenia, particularly         for the alleviation of negative symptoms.
(5d)     Odell-Miller has been involved in the dissemination of these and other       research results at national and international levels, through her work as       an elected member of the Professional Advisory Board for Allied Health       Professions to the Department of Health (recently to Health Education       England), and to the National Clinical Academic Careers Development Group       for Nursing, Midwives and Allied Health Professionals.
The latter group       has instigated a new clinical pathway for clinicians to begin research       early in their NHS careers through the new Clinical Academic Internship       Programme.
Here, Odell-Miller has worked to ensure that the `smaller'       professions, such as arts therapists, are included (5b) and she is now       listed in their terms of reference as a member with `special expertise'.
Odell-Miller also spoke on Radio 3's Music Matters programme about       music therapy research and new developments in 2011.
(5e)     Odell-Miller was involved in developing the competencies for the Health       Professions Council (Standards of Practice and Standards of Education and       Training), and in researching and articulating differences between artists       and arts therapies, and specifically advising on the Nuffield Review       (Nuffield 2004, 5h, which has had recent impact (Odell-Miller 2013).
More       recently she had an advisory role in researching into the current and       future workforce planning for Arts Therapies for the Centre for Workforce       Intelligence (CfWI 2012), contributing to the writing of their report, Education         commissioning risks summary for Arts Therapies Report (WRO ECRS       2012).
(5b, 5c).
Finally, writing about Odell-Miller, Oldfield and Wigram,       senior members of the profession endorse this case study in corroboration       letters (5j).The following quotation sums up the impact `these three         key pioneers of music therapy and music therapy research, assessment,         policy formation and practice have been key to the development of the         discipline of music therapy and their work has had far reaching impact         on a broad area of clinical practice benefitting both clients and         practitioners within the UK and Internationally.
