     Carbon8 Systems' (C8S) technology, Accelerated Carbonation, uses carbon       dioxide gas to treat waste materials and form artificial aggregate.
Within       two years of its foundation in 2006, C8S had won several prestigious       awards, culminating in its announcement as the national winner of the         2008 Shell Springboard competition [a].
Prize money from the latter       was used to design and build a pilot-scale plant at a former landfill       facility owned by Kent County Council.
The closed site was suffering from       degradation and associated subsidence and had limited loss in integrity of       its clay-capping layer.
The pilot plant combusted the landfill gas (mostly       methane), normally collected and sent to a flare, to produce a CO2-enriched       gas stream that was then used to carbonate a variety of wastes, including       biomass ash and ash from paper recycling, to manufacture engineering fill       to assist in the restoration of the landfill site.
Up to 20% carbon       dioxide by weight can be captured in these wastes.
Trials of the plant       over a 6-month period successfully demonstrated that an integrated waste       collection and treatment facility could be operated, supplied by the       site's own waste gas.
[b] The success of this project was such that C8S       was invited, together with other low-carbon innovation companies, to No.10       Downing Street four days before the start of critical global climate       change negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009.
At the time, Prime Minister       Gordon Brown said: "Our transition to a low carbon economy will be a key       driver of our future economic prosperity.
Carbon8 Systems...are at the       forefront of this transformation.
Their innovation and expertise       demonstrates why the UK is one of best places in the world for low carbon       business."
[c] Carbonation is now recognised as a potential option for CO2       sequestration by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the       world's foremost body advising on climate change science.
In 2009/10 the results of the TSB project were used to optimise the       landfill gas pilot plant, which was then showcased in collaboration with       Kent County Council and the Environment Agency in September 2010 to a       group of invited industrialists, including waste management problem       holders and waste management solution providers, such as Aylesford Paper,       Shell and SITA [d].
This has led to exploratory studies by C8S on other       waste forms, such as oil-drill cuttings, and on-going negotiations with       waste-to-energy and waste management companies, all of which are at a       commercially sensitive stage and cannot be detailed here.
However, it is       clear that, due to government and EU regulations on the management and       disposal of wastes, there is a great deal of interest in C8S's technology       as a means of mitigating costs and adding value to waste streams.
The success of the landfill gas project allowed C8S to leverage an       initial equity investment of &#163;120,000 from high-net-worth individuals, and       a second company, Carbon8 Aggregates (C8A), was formed in early 2010       to focus on the commercial opportunities arising from the production of       aggregates from such wastes.
This company went on to build a larger-scale       plant at Grundon Waste Management's site in Brandon, Suffolk and       successfully produced &#8212; to the manufacturer's specifications &#8212; 500 tonnes       of aggregate from MSWI APCrs for use as raw material by Lignacite, a major       UK block manufacturer.
This led, in turn, to investment in C8A in 2012         by Grundon Waste Management, with the sole purpose of commercialising         ACT for the treatment of MSWI APCrs [e] This second-round       investment, which consisted of cash, in-kind support and a bank guarantee,       allowed the construction of the first full-scale commercial plant, which       was built at the Lignacite block plant in Suffolk in January 2012.
The       plant, which employs shift teams of three plus the site manager, was       designed to process 18,000 tonnes per year, providing Lignacite with       36,000 tonnes of aggregate: processing capacity has since gradually risen       to nearly 400 tonnes per month.
C8A is currently writing a specification       for plants two and three, which are likely to be built within the next six       to nine months.
The success of the trials and the quality of the product       convinced Lignacite to invest into 50% of Carbon8 Aggregates [f].
The Environment Agency Modernising Waste Panel confirmed in 2012 that the       output from the process meets its End of Waste criteria, which specify       when a certain waste ceases to be waste and obtains a status of a product       (or a secondary raw material).
All companies dealing with waste management       are governed under these criteria.
For Carbon8 Aggregates, it means that       the treated APCRs can be used as an aggregate product, for example in       block making.
Facilities using this technology are now being developed       across the UK, generating a secondary, recycled aggregate &#8212; which is       carbon negative &#8212; to replace land- and sea-won materials.
Using the       carbonated, recycled material allows manufacturers to avoid the tax of         &#163;2.00 per tonne levied by the UK government on these natural aggregates       whilst making a meaningful contribution to the country's effective and         environmentally sound disposal of CO2 waste:       blocks produced from the fly ash of waste incinerators encapsulate 14kg of       carbon dioxide per tonne.
In May 2013, Lignacite launched its "Carbon Buster" block, made up of         more than 50% recycled material, including the C8A pellets [g].
In       the UK Carbon Buster customers, mainly construction companies, gain       credits under the environment assessment schemes of BRE Environmental       Assessment Method (BREEAM) and the Code for Sustainable Homes for using       Carbon Buster blocks, which enables them to construct homes with       attractive sustainability ratings.
In July 2013 the product won the         Best Recycled Product award at the 2013 National Recycling Awards       held at the London Hilton in Park Lane [h].
C8S has begun discussions with       a number of companies in Australia to market ACT in Australasia, where a       patent applies.
The total number of employees of both C8S and C8A         currently stands at 11 [i]     In addition to the environmental compliance benefits outlined above,       their launch of the world's first ever carbon-negative building block       brought Lignacite &#8212; as well as C8S and C8A &#8212; positive media coverage from       around the world [j].
The C8S and C8A teams' contributions to media         discourse about this development not only helped to enhance their       own and their commercial partners' standing, but also enhanced         awareness of and engagement with important environmental issues relating         to the research among an international public audience.
The research on APCr has, moreover, had further non-academic impacts         on UK policy, leading to the incorporation in 2011 of a         recycling option into Defra's guidance on the management of APCr, in       relation to the requirement for UK companies to reduce their waste streams       as much as possible to meet the EU's Waste Framework Directive [k].
This       change has moved APCr up the waste hierarchy, which sets out the various       stages to waste minimisation, from recovery of value from wastes to the       prevention of the formation of waste in the first place.
Recycling is       halfway up the hierarchy.
Also in 2012, the Environment Agency removed the       Waste Acceptance Criteria derogation allowing APCr to go to landfill from       around 2015, since they believe that there are now viable alternatives due       to the research and development carried out by Simons and C8S.
C8S can         provide Energy from Waste (EfW) plants with a true zero waste to         landfill option, which helps with planning applications.
The EfW       industry in the UK is currently worth around 6 billion GBP, which is       expected to rise to 30 billion GBP in the next 10 years.
Hence, C8A has       provided a number of letters of support for companies making new planning       applications for EfWs.
