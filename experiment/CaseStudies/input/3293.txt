     The research undertaken by the Royal Holloway teams at Castelporziano in       2008-13 has revealed &#8212; in the form of 3D visualisations readily       comprehensible to a non-specialist audience &#8212; substantial tracts of a rich       and varied archaeological landscape, which lies invisible under dense       vegetation, complementing and contextualising the more visible remains.
A       key contribution has come from the Loughborough team, in proving that the       modern vegetation is of quite recent formation, and very different from       that which characterised the ancient landscape.
These discoveries have       already had some positive impact on local attitudes to heritage       management, and are set to continue to have further beneficial effects as       the models become more complete and detailed, leading to new methods of       conserving and presenting the cultural heritage of the Laurentine Shore.
The Soprintendenza Speciale per i beni archeologici di Roma is now         more fully and much better informed than ever before of the actual         nature and extent of the archaeological resources in this part of the         Tenuta di Castelporziano, which it is their responsibility to protect         and for which the project was originally set up.
The Commissione forestale of the Tenuta di Castelporziano is also now         more fully aware of the nature of the subsoil in this part of the estate         and of the damage new plantings have done and can do in the future.
It         has been the practice in the past to renew fallen trees and plant extra         trees in the area in order to protect the forest further inland, knowing         they grow faster and higher when rooted in Roman remains.
New pine         forests were implanted on the imperial villa in the mid 2000s.
The         impact of this research has been to change the forestry plan so that         more historically appropriate and archaeology-friendly forms of tree         cover can be used.
The Tenuta di Castelporziano is open annually to a wide visiting         public of schoolchildren (primary as well as secondary) and members of         adult amateur societies, totalling c. 12 000 a year, who are admitted in         groups, accompanied by the Forest Guard who act as guides.
The tours         used to focus only on the natural environment and wild-life and are         still primarily organised with those interests in view, but the local         archaeological museum (opened in 2006) and some of the more visible and         accessible archaeological ruins are now often included.
The Royal Holloway team has been responsible for maintaining the       necessary diplomatic relations with the President's office and the local       archaeological superintendency to obtain permissions and security       clearance to enter the estate.
Progress of the research was communicated orally and reported in writing       at regular intervals to the relevant partners: the Soprintendenza       archeologica di Ostia (recently defunct, replaced by the Soprintendenza       Speciale per i beni archeologici di Roma ), the Director of the       Castelporziano estate, the office of the President's adviser on Cultural       patrimony and his representative.
Liaison has also been with the Forest       Guard and members of the forestry commission.
The entire site archive (from 1984-2010) was digitised as part of the       AHRC funded phase of research and has been available online since July       2010 (see section 3.1).
On April 23, 2009 a day conference was held in the local museum at       Castelporziano by the Royal Holloway research team, which communicated the       results of the environmental and topographical surveys and current       historical research to a wider local audience.
On June 10, 2011 the       President's Office itself organised a public conference in Rome,       celebrating 25 years of archaeological research at Castelporziano, which       show-cased the work of the British teams in particular and attracted a       large general audience as well as members of the higher echelons of the       presidential administration.
The proceedings are to be published (2014).
The event on June 10, 2011 marked a quantum shift in attitude on the part       of the estate management towards the archaeology and archaeological       research, from polite tolerance to a willingness to engage positively.
There is now a shared understanding that, at least in the seaward reaches       of the estate where the archaeological remains are so substantial and of       such historical importance, both the natural and the cultural landscape       have equal rights to study, protection and (eventually) presentation.
