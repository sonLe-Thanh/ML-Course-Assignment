     OCD and associated spin-off publications are key reference items       for the general public and fellow       professionals, and are available in specialist, university, college and       public libraries across the       world.
The level of worldwide sales and number of book translations       indicate the reach of the       impact via the underpinning research.
The 3rd (and revised 3rd       edition) of OCD has been translated       into three other languages (Georgian, Modern Greek, and Chinese), and now       in its fourth edition, it       has also been translated into Spanish, with a planned Chinese translation.
OCD3 and OCD4 have       had total sales of nearly 70,000 copies, with more than 10,000 of these       sold after 2008 (this       includes sales of over 3,000 of OCD4 in its first year       of publication).
Almost 40% of total sales come       from outside the UK (IMP1).
Given the significant cost of       purchasing these reference books, copies       purchased prior to 2008 will still be in use by individuals, educational       establishments and library       users.
Driven by the high sales response to OCD3, Oxford       University Press commissioned two spin-off       publications and Spawforth had a pivotal role in each of these.
The         Oxford Companion to Classical         Civilisation (Companion) is an anthology of the 3rd edition of OCD,       with extensive illustrations, and       has been published in both hardback (1998) and paperback (2004).
Spawforth       was co-responsible       for identifying and editing suitable entries and approving and choosing       illustrations.
Spawforth was       also co-responsible for identifying and editing suitable entries in the Who's         Who in the Classical         World (Who's Who), which was published in paperback (1998) as an       accessible reference work       focused on historical individuals from classical antiquity.
Through       changing the style of the way the       material is presented and being considerably cheaper than the OCD       editions, the aim of these       spin-off publications was to reach wider and more diverse audiences,       thereby extending the reach       of public understanding of the classical world.
The OCD spin-offs       collectively have also had sales       of over 75,000 copies.
Companion has had sales of 68,846 copies of       which around 15% were       outside the UK, and has been translated into Chinese.
Who's Who       has sold 7,049 copies and just       over 75% were sales outside the UK (IMP1).
Both editions of OCD       and its spin-off publications are       also available electronically at www.oxfordreference.com       and are accessed via schools, colleges,       universities and public libraries.
The total revenue generated from the OCD3       and OCD4 via this       medium is over &#163;50,000 (around &#163;20,000 of this is from OCD4)       (IMP1).
Though figures presented       are lifetime sales (and include sales prior to 2008), these publications       continue to have an on-going       impact and currency.
The reach of the impact is evidenced by the sheer number of libraries       these publications can be       accessed through worldwide, covering 33 countries worldwide.
OCD3       and/or OCD4 is available in       hard copy or electronically in more than 4,000 libraries, Companion       in more than 1,500 libraries,       and Who's Who in more than 600 libraries.
These libraries are       based in universities and colleges,       as well as on army bases and in museums, and include public libraries.
For       example, at least one       of these publications is available in one or more public libraries in all       50 states in America, and in       other countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the       Netherlands and Singapore       (IMP2).
OCD and/or the spin-off publications are also available in a       number of school libraries, particularly       in the United States of America, for instance in the Harvard Westlake       School in California, the       Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, and the Abraham Lincoln High School in       New York (IMP2).
OCD3 is also suggested as a resource for 6th       grade study of ancient Greece by the New York       Department of Education Office of Curriculum, Standards and Academic       Engagement (IMP3).
Where Greek, Latin or Classical Studies are taught in English at a       university level, OCD3 and/or       OCD4 are very likely to be held in the university       library, and this is also likely to be the case for one       or both of the OCD spin-offs.
For example, the Universities of       Cape Town, Sydney, Harvard and       Cambridge all hold OCD and one or both spin-off publications (IMP2).
The OCD is also listed as a       key reference on undergraduate modules on a range of topics, such as:       Theology and Religious       Studies, Archaeology, Classics and History, in the UK and beyond.
For       example, it is listed in the       module guide for `History of Ancient Greece and Rome', for the BA in       Archaeology, at the Institute       of Archaeology at the University of Warsaw.
OCD is also cited as a       reference tool on courses in       skills development, for examples, in an Open University course on creative       writing for Classics       students, and a research skills and referencing courses at the University       of Exeter.
The OCD spin-       off publications are also listed as set texts or background reading on a       number of modules, for       example, the Oxford Companion to Classical Civilisation is       recommended on an Open University       level 2 undergraduate course, `Exploring the Classical World' (IMP4).
According to Google Scholar,       OCD has been cited more than 500 times, although this is a poor       guide to citation-frequency, since       academics who consult OCD and its spin-offs do not invariably       acknowledge the fact in research       (or other) publications (IMP5).
The worldwide use of OCD and spin-off publications signifies the reach       and significance of its       impact, which rests on its authoritative scholarship and its combined       function of preserving the old       while signalling what is new in the Classics discipline.
The OCD       is the premier English language       reference tool for the ancient world and was described by the Library       Journal as "...rich, varied,         and highly reliable...this magnificent work will form the cornerstone of         any institutional or home-         based Classical studies library...an indispensable reference for         individuals and libraries alike"       (IMP6), and in the Modern Language Association (MLA) Literary       Research Guide as "Authoritative         and informative, the work is the best single-volume classical dictionary         in English and an essential         desktop reference.
It truly has, as its editors claim, `no competitor in         any language'" (IMP7).
Peter Green from the Washington Times said that OCD3 "offers         not only that breakfast for the mind         that we keep hearing about, but lunch, tea, dinner, supper and non-stop         snacks...[and] offers a         cornucopia of accurate and succinct knowledge that would be hard to         equal" (IMP8).
A recent       review of OCD4 stated that "it's the scholarship of         the OCD that justifies its continued publication..."       and that the contributors "represent the best of living classical         thought combined with the         intellectual legacy of dead contributors".
Harry Mount's review `The       Classical World Just Refuses       to Stay Dead', also acknowledges OCD's role in tracking the       developments in the classical world,       as well as recognising that its line-up of scholars, chief advisers and       editors reflect "the make-up of         modern classical scholarship".
It also states that "Classical         scholarship in this country is on the         wane...the old standards survive on remote islands like the OCD" (IMP9).
In summary, public understanding of the classical world has been informed       and enhanced by the       underpinning research though the 3rd and 4th       editions of OCD and spin-off publications, which are       available all over the world to the general public, school children and       teachers, scholars and other       professionals.
The reach and significance of the impact is evidenced by       the extent of the on-going       sales of the publications across the world, as well as their continued       availability in libraries in 33       countries worldwide thereby bringing research and expert knowledge to a       range of people globally.
