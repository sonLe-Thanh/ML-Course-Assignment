     The widespread adoption of lapatinib as a combination agent for advanced       breast cancer hinged       on the detailed analysis of sub-groups led by Cameron (3.2-3.4).
The       results of the phase III trial       with lapatinib confirmed the clinical efficacy of a small molecular       tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients       with HER2+ breast cancer for which trastuzumab was no longer effective.
Lapatinib was the first       agent to be approved for use in HER2+ breast cancer after trastuzumab.
Impact on health and welfare     There are no robust data available on the number of patients treated with       lapatinib, but it is likely to       be around 10 000 or more each year, based on the drug costs and average       duration of therapy.
For women with advanced HER2+ breast cancer, who without effective therapy       have a poor       prognosis, the use of lapatinib plus capecitabine offers an entirely oral,       effective therapy once the       disease has become resistant to trastuzumab, which is the first-line       therapy.
The treatment is not       curative &#8212; cures are rare in metastatic breast cancer &#8212; but it delivers       clear clinical benefits for       patients.
Also, because of the availability of lapatinib, a phase II study       compared radiotherapy with       capecitabine plus lapatinib, and confirmed that this combination was an       equally effective       alternative to conventional radiotherapy for treating patients with HER2+       breast cancer metastatic       to the brain [5.1].
Impact on commerce and the economy     Lapatinib generated sales for the UK-based company (GSK) of &#163;227M in       2010, &#163;231M in 2011 and       &#163;239M in 2012 [5.2].
In addition, but hard to quantify, there are economic       benefits of an effective       therapy for patients with advanced breast cancer &#8212; some are able to       continue working because       their disease is being better controlled.
Impact on public policy     The positive results of this pivotal, registration phase III trial led to       marketing authorisations in 107       countries including the USA, Europe, Australia, India, Brazil, Russia,       Turkey, South Korea and       other countries around the world [5.3].
The majority of these       authorisations have occurred after 1st       Jan 2008; for example, the European Commission granted a conditional       marketing authorisation       for lapatinib in all 27 European Union (EU) member states on June 10, 2008       [5.4].
The option of       using lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is recommended within a       number of guidelines       (e.g., European School of Oncology, German Gynecological Oncology Group       (Arbeitsgemeinschaft       Gynaekologische Oncologie, AGO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network       (NCCN) guidelines       in the USA and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines       [5.5, 5.6, 5.7]).
Although it is licensed in the UK, the regimen was not approved by either       the National Institute for       Health and Care Excellence (NICE) or the Scottish Medicines Consortium       (SMC), as it was felt to       be insufficiently cost-effective.
Denial to fund this treatment led to       intensive patient-led       campaigning, and the lapatinib-treatment-seeking patient Nikki Blunden,       whose case was       highlighted in the House of Commons (June 16, 2010), became "the face" of       the Government's       &#163;50M emergency fund to pay for new cancer drugs for those with       life-shortening cancer [5.8].
From       October 2010 until February 2011, 195 patients obtained lapatinib       treatment due to the interim       cancer drugs funding, and from April until September 2011 more than 350       patients received the       drug with support from the Cancer Drugs Fund [5.9].
Lapatinib used in this       indication is one of the       top ten drugs within the English Cancer Drugs' fund with an approval rate       of 94% (June 2011)       [5.10], reflecting strong UK clinician support for the treatment whose       efficacy was confirmed by the       phase III trial.
