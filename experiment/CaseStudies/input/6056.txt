     The CPHR has had considerable public impact.
It was nominated as one of       five Outstanding Employer Engagement Initiatives in the 2009 Times         Higher Education Awards.
In June 2011 it came to the attention of       the Financial         Times, who described it as `an innovative research centre where         academics and executives jointly set the agenda', saying it has `pioneered         a new way to interact with business'.
LUMS has had three academics,       Professors Sparrow, Cooper and West, in the `Top 15 Most Influential UK       Thinkers' as voted for by HR Magazine: all have considerable       involvement in press, conference keynote, and professional development       activity.
CPHR was also recently the focus of a Spotlight       feature by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business       (AACSB) International Research and Scholarship Centre.
Endorsements from       several of the CPHR's members can be found on the centre's website.
CPHR runs Special Interest Groups to feed research directly into Centre       member practice and has designed a series of `Executive Masterclasses',       tailored to the needs of senior HR professionals/partners and mid-senior       executives involved in organisational design, talent management, HR       strategy and employee engagement.
HR         Magazine (18th January, 2012) featured the Centre's       programme in a discussion on the challenges of ensuring that HR education       is aligned to the business context.
This section provides two examples of       organisations that have experienced positive impact on their practices as       a result of their collaboration with the CPHR: McDonald's and Shell.
Example 1: McDonald's     David Fairhurst, Chief People Officer at McDonald's Europe, approached       the CPHR to analyse their data on organisational performance.
He       identified that one of the biggest challenges facing him when he joined       the company was the portrayal of the "McJob" as a "low dignity, no future       job".
This was effecting recruitment and staff morale so in April 2006       they undertook "a campaign to change the public's perceptions of so-called       McJobs" (Fairhurst, 2008: 323).
The journey to correct this perception,       further improve employee engagement and enhance the corporate reputation       is described in `McDonald's UK: From Corporate Reputation to Trust-Based       HR', a chapter written in 2010 by Sparrow, Balain and Fairhurst.
Research       carried out by CPHR led to several recommendations for improving       performance including modifying employee survey data to capture drivers of       restaurant performance, reorganising the `McDonald's Performance       Dashboard' to reflect performance related (and not related) to employee       attitudes, and improved inclusion of demographic variables in determining       restaurant performance.
This resulted in the creation of `trust-based         HRM at McDonald's'.
Fairhurst reflects that HR departments are `awash with data but HR people       are usually not analytical'.
Engagement with academic institutions such as       with CPHR can offer `fantastic business insights' and `clues         to evolving HR strategy'.
He is a strong advocate of CPHR, and his       influence as a high-visibility director (e.g.
appointment to the UK       Commission for Employment and Skills) has resulted in many collaborative       publications with CPHR.
In 2011 won the HR         Excellence Award for Outstanding Employee Engagement Strategy.
Re-thinking the impact of older workers:     As part of the collaborative study conducted with McDonald's, the CPHR       compared the performance data of 178 company owned McDonald's restaurants       where one or more members of staff aged over 60 years of age is employed       with the performance data of 239 company owned McDonald's restaurants       where nobody over 50 years of age is employed.
The FT         article, `The kids are alright but they need help', evidenced       findings from the research on the age-mix of staff and restaurant       performance and that the presence of older members of staff encourages       better behaviour.
McDonald's confirmed in a press         release that the `levels of customer satisfaction were on average       20% higher in our restaurants that employ staff aged 60 plus'.
This       endorsement of the impact of older workers was widely reported in national       media, such as The         Financial Times, at a time when this group was being       disproportionately hit by the economic down-turn.
In 2009 McDonald's had a       national campaign celebrating their older workers and recognising the       business benefit that they provide to the organisation (McDonald's         Lifelong Learning &amp; Training).
The Campaign Director for the Employers         Forum on Age, said: `I warmly welcome the research findings... it's       vital that businesses across the UK continue to recognise the strong       business case for age diversity.'
Example 2: Shell     In June 2011, the CPHR conducted an internal study for Shell entitled `HR       Operating for Joint Ventures'.
The final report detailed four distinct       types of joint venture and seven ways of thinking about the resulting       management implications.
One of the recommendations was to designate       `specialist responsibility' for HR issues and ventures.
Shell has since       created a position of Executive Vice President for HR Strategy and       International Communications to meet this requirement, demonstrating the       internal impact of the report.
Jorrit van Togt, EVP HR Strategy, will be       providing a paper on Shell's view of the future HR agenda in the CPHR's       new journal.
The report commissioner and Senior Strategy Advisor at Shell reported       back (e-mail available upon request) that they felt elements of the report       warranted `further embedding in our thinking and deliverables' and       that the suggested HRM functions would act as a checklist for their HR       department to review the status of their joint ventures.
In particular, he       referenced the section of the report discussing trust vs. contractual       based governance and that it provided, `excellent materials which I         passed on to our Governance team and could become relevant for HR once         we agree how to structure and cost (recover) our offerings.'
Joint CIPD impact and research activities based on case examples:     A CPHR Impact Advisory Group was set up as a benchmarking mechanism to       test the validity of the Centre's research in terms of scope, efficacy and       future impact.
The CIPD as a member of the group, was introduced to the       McDonald's and Shell cases amongst other work.
Contours of Fairness:       In 2013 the CIPD commissioned a report from CPHR, in conjunction with the       Lancaster Work Foundation,       on `The Changing Contours of Fairness'.
The theme emerged out of work       linking employee attitudes to organisational performance at McDonald's and       from Professor Sparrow's involvement with the UK's Engagement for Success       movement and prior MacLeod Review, commissioned by the Department of       Business Innovation and Skills into `Enhancing         performance through employee engagement'.
In 2013 the CIPD       incorporated questions on fairness into their national Employment         Outlook survey (run by YouGov), producing a dataset of 2,000       employees, committing to also include items in their 2014 survey.
Beyond the Organization: Building on arguments made in `Leading       HR' and work with Shell on joint ventures, the CPHR realised further study       into inter-organisational HR was needed.
Building on an extensive       literature review of past studies, the first research report was produced       in July and published in August 2013 called `Beyond the Organisation:       Understanding the business issues in partnering arrangements'.
The CIPD       have confirmed that this will be publicised to the 134,000 CIPD members       and academic members via a quarterly magazine and through an article in Training         Journal.
The second part of the report, containing quotes on aspects       of the report from Shell, Nuclear Decommissioning and Sellafield, will be       published in October.
Additional research is planned with BAE to better       understand HR's role in supporting their different partnering       arrangements.
The findings have attracted over 600 distinct page views on       the CIPD's website and an article for the British Library `Management and       Business Studies Portal'.
Public engagement has included the presentation       of results at a senior HR leaders event in May, a seminar in June to over       50 lecturers delivering CIPD-accredited programmes and a forthcoming       presentation by Sparrow at the CIPD's Annual HR Conference in November to       around 100 delegates.
