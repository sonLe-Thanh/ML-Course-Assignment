     The research outlined in Section 2 has had impact through the shaping of       policies, practices and behaviours       affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services (ESS) across a wide range of       beneficiaries.
(1) Local communities: AU research has         empowered indigenous communities in the Solomon Islands         to use their forest resource more sustainably     Research outputs 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 aimed to assess the vulnerability of       indigenous forest-dwelling       communities in the Solomon Islands to environmental and social change and       to raise local awareness and       cultural understanding of issues affecting the sustainable use of the       forest.
The research was very much       impact led: a key aim of the Output 3.9 was to assess `whether, how and         to what extent a vulnerability         assessment could be conducted in a way that enabled co-learning and         action for change in study         communities' (3.9: p714).
An evaluation of the impact of our       approach concluded `The more exciting result         was the degree to which the KA and communities took ownership of the         project and of the process of         exploring social and environmental vulnerability, and the extent of the         learning and action for change that         occurred as a consequence' (3.9, p726): KA is the Kahua Association       which represents 4500 people in 40       communities of the Kahua region.
Our research has empowered KA       communities, allowing them to make       more effective and equitable cross-community decisions when, for example,       communities have been       approached by logging and mining companies.
These impacts are demonstrated       by the following quotes       from KA Council members (Output 3.9, p724).
``The programme increased confidence in (our) own knowledge.
We are         realising that we can         organise and deal with problems ourselves.
With the programme, it         sparked off a traditional inherited         ability (to do this).''
KA Council Member, July 2008     ``It was a learning process.
People think it is a good process.
It         gives opportunities for participation         and people are able to learn then we can analyse problems for         ourselves.''
KA Council Member, July         2008     A further significant outcome of our research process was that it       reminded community elders of four moral       `Kahua Principles', and a set of rules governing individual, family and       community life called `Ramata'.
The KA       is now promoting these principles within the KA communities.
(2) UK policy: AU research has directly         influenced UK biodiversity conservation policies.
Natural Environment White paper: The TEEB report (Output       3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) was central to the adoption       of Commitments 40 and 84 in Defra's Natural Environment White paper(5.1).
The Defra reports underlying       Output 3.5 was also used to support the White Paper(5.2, 5.6).
England Biodiversity Strategy: Outputs 3.5 and 3.6 provided key       evidence on the value of biodiversity to       support Defra's arguments for adopting its England Biodiversity 2020       strategy(5.2, 5.6).
Biodiversity Offsetting: Output 3.5 was used by Defra to       demonstrated that the benefits of offsetting       biodiversity were likely to outweigh costs, which in turn was crucial to       Defra attaining clearance to run its       offsetting trails in England(5.2, 5.3).
Impact assessment of Defra's regulatory stock: AU evidence       on the societal benefits of SSSIs (Output       3.6) was used by Defra to demonstrate the impacts of it's biodiversity       conservation policies(5.4), which in turn       helped to secure future funding for these policies(5.2).
Ecosystems Approach: Output 3.5 was commissioned as part of       Defra's research programme that aimed       to `explore the extent to which valuation of ecosystem services could         be integrated into existing decision-making         process'(5.5); an approach which Defra is now pushing to       mainstream across all government       departments(5.2).
Public awareness: Defra have used AU research to       communicate the benefits of biodiversity to the public,       including in a 2011 Press Release where they state that AU value evidence       has proven useful in capturing       public attention and allowing Defra to highlight the broader benefits of       investing in nature and accounting for       its values(5.2, 5.6).
(3) International policy: AU research has led to           international policy commitments for countries to           better conserve global biodiversity.
The TEEB study (Output 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) has been highly influential in       the development of international       policy commitments to conserve biodiversity.
EU's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020(5.7): TEEB forms the       basis of Remark 56 of the Strategy, in which it       urges member states to `take account of the recommendations made in the         TEEB study ... in dealing with         the complex European and national legislation aimed at protecting nature       '.
Convention of Biological Diversity: TEEB was also tabled at the       COP10 meeting of the CBD, from which       Decision X/2 `Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi         Biodiversity Targets'(5.8) explicitly       Requests the Executive Secretary to:       `17(e) Building on the results of TEEB ... [to] develop implementing         tools for the integration of economic         aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem services' and       `17(f) Through capacity-building workshops, to support countries in         making use of the findings of TEEB and         in integrating the values of biodiversity into relevant national and         local policies, programmes and planning         processes'.
To fulfil Request 17f, Christie was commissioned by UNEP to lead four       high-level capacity building       workshops on TEEB(5.10).
These workshops were attended by over       200 senior Government representatives       from over 50 countries of the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and Asia.
The outcome from these workshops       is that these countries now have enhanced capacity to meet their       commitments under the CBD Decision       X/2(5.8, 5.9, 5.10).
