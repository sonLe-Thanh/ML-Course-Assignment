     Construction industry bases procurement approaches on research     The research has led to companies taking a new approach to procurement.
Examples of this are the cases of Provelio and Balfour Beatty.
Since 2008       Provelio, a Project Management provider in Property and Construction, has       incorporated procurement decision models into their business practice,       which allow clients to "rigorously understand what their best procurement       solution would be rather than rely on traditional advice.
[Provelio's]       approach is based on Will Hughes' procurement framework that is reported       in [2]" (section 5 [a]).
Balfour Beatty has used the Reading research to       explore "such issues as... transactional costs in the supply chain and the       need to take non value adding tiers out of the supply chain" [b]     Research informs new British Standard for construction procurement     In 2006 the development of a new British Standard (BS) for construction       procurement was seen by policy makers as key to developing better       construction business practice.
The idea of a new BS was supported by the       Constructing Excellence Procurement Task Group &#8212; a panel of practitioners,       including Hughes, concerned with the development of procurement practice       guidance.
By 2008 the British Standards Institute (BSI) had established a       technical drafting committee for a new British Standard (BS) in       Construction Procurement; Hughes was an invited member of the committee       and other members were drawn from Constructing Excellence as well as the       major construction professional institutions, including the Royal       Institution of British Architects, Chartered Institute of Building and the       Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The research conducted at       Reading fed directly into the drafting of the new standards through       Hughes' involvement in the drafting committee [c].
Following a period of consultation with industry, the new BS on       construction procurement (BS 8534:2011, Construction procurement         policies, strategies and procedures &#8212; Code of practice) was       published in August 2011.
It is designed to complement a number of       important international procurement standards (in particular ISO 10845,       Parts 1 and 2) that have been adopted into British Standards and deal with       procurement processes and documentation.
Unlike other procurement guidance which concentrates on procurement       processes and selection criteria, this code is novel in the way that it       concentrates on the development of procurement policies and strategies to       frame the selection and appointment of the design/construction team.
Additionally, it sets the procurement process within the overall project       business case, and draws together and distils much of the available       construction procurement guidance into a usable and practical framework.
Construction industry and clients benefit from new Code of Practice     The Code of Practice published in 2011 is used by those responsible for       construction procurement in both the public and private sectors and       provides a benchmark of best practice that will help in the avoidance of       procurement disputes.
Construction clients, in both the public and private       sector, and all sectors within the construction industry have benefitted       from this guidance as a result of more streamlined and effective       procurement processes leading to reduced costs borne by the supply chain       and improved procurement outcomes.
The reach of this project goes beyond UK construction.
As a result of the       research, and the publication and profile of the BS 8534, Hughes has been       invited to participate in a number of influential industry and policy       bodies, including:            Member of drafting committee for the BS Publicly Available         Specification (PAS) 98: Formation of consortia, 2009-10, which covers         consortia in the IT domain       Member of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)         Construction Industry Innovation and Growth Team (Major Projects),         2009-10 [d, Pg 218].
The work has also had international impact.
The Senior General Manager       for Japan Post Holdings noted "specific examples where we have been         able to apply the lessons from this research [on] our major construction         projects are JP Tower (new Tokyo Post Office), Nagoya high-rise building         project, etc."

Reading expertise shapes conclusions of major government enquiry     Hughes' findings on the potential for bid manipulation [2] led to his       involvement as a key member of the consultant team in a major government       enquiry by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).
The OFT issued a Statement of       Objections against 112 firms in the construction sector in England in       April 2008 following one of the largest ever Competition Act       investigations, which revealed illegal anti-competitive bid rigging       activities on 199 tenders between 2000 and 2006.
Hughes' research was       cited multiple times in the OFT's Final Decision, which was published in       September 2009 [f] and affected building projects across England worth       more than &#163;200 million [g].
The Director of Europe Economics, also the       OFT's lead consultant on the enquiry, stated that Hughes "provided         valuable insights into construction industry business models and helped         shape our conclusions".
This inquiry further strengthened the case       for best practice guidance in construction procurement [h].
Additional routes to impact     Hughes and his colleagues have disseminated their research findings       through numerous channels:            Publication of results in the peer reviewed journals and in         textbooks/collective volumes [1-6].
Raising awareness in the construction sector `trade' literature (e.g.
`Survey slams huge cost of tendering', Contract Journal, 21         February 2005)       Raising public awareness more generally (e.g.
Hughes was involved in a         discussion on a BBC Radio 4 `File on Four' programme on construction, 10         and 15 July 2007)       Direct involvement in policy discussions and crafting guidance (e.g.
British Standards drafting committee)       Presentation of results as keynote for international conferences,         including the West Africa Built Environment Research Conference in         Nigeria (24-26 July 2012).
