     This research has had three distinct impacts:            Shaping the understanding and attitude of governmental and         non-governmental actors to         issues of political disaffection and re-engagement.
Informing the design of participatory projects and other mechanisms as         responses to the         issues of anti-politics by institutional actors.
Playing a pivotal role in the development of a critical resource for         designing civic participation.
Shaping understanding and attitudes     The credibility of asset transfer and community ownership and control       policies that were key       mechanisms in Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act       (2009) was       established by Smith and Stoker's research on Empowering Communities.
The       impact continues:       as a leading civil servant commented: "Southampton University's         research has had a long-term         impact on DCLG policy under Labour and Coalition governments.
Gerry         Stoker and his team have         enormous credibility. "
(Ariana Haberis, DCLG) [5.1].
The anti-politics research led by Stoker provided the basis for an       article published in the ESRC's       annual newsstand magazine Britain in 2013 which reaches a wide       audience (15k copies sold and       an average of two readers a copy).
The evidence to the Leveson Inquiry on       the role of the media       was accepted [5.2] and its impact on politics was picked up and       used by Lord Puttnam [5.3] in his       campaigning around the issues.
Stoker's British Academy publication led to       an invitation in 2013 to       develop with St George's House, Windsor Castle, a consultation with       high-level governmental and       non-governmental actors to discuss disenchantment with politics and its       implications for       democracy [5.4].
The Hansard Society used the research with Stoker       to offer a range of       workshops aimed at policy makers and practitioners in 2012/13 to raise       awareness and inform       practice.
International impact is concretely demonstrated by the decision of the       German-based pan-European       Bertelsmann Foundation to use Smith's research as the basis on which to       develop       criteria for the Reinhard Mohn Prize on innovative participatory       approaches worldwide as part of       their programme to raise awareness about citizen participation innovations       among senior German       politicians [5.5].
At the same time, the significance and reach of       the research is demonstrated by       invitations to address policy audiences concerning its finding.
For       example, in September 2012,       Stoker presented findings on the causes of political disenchantment and       how to respond under the       auspices of the Australian and New Zealand School of Government in       Auckland which led directly       to a follow-up discussion of the research based on Australian data in       Canberra in Parliament       House on 26th June 2013 attended by a range of Federal-level politicians       and civil servants as       well as journalists [5.6].
In addition Stoker on 18th September       2013 presented the findings at an       international symposium `The Second Members Building of the House of       Representatives' in       Tokyo, Japan, which was attended by leading politicians and civil       servants.
[5.7]     Informing the design of civic participation by other institutional         actors     The World Bank has taken up (and slightly adapted) the innovative       analytical framework developed       by Smith in order to compare and evaluate their own interventions, while       Smith's research on       `mini-publics' as a form of effective public consultation has led directly       to the Bank's advocacy of       their use by a number of governments.
The Bank is designing international       pilot schemes directly       based on this research [5.8].
Stoker's work on anti-politics and       engagement led to an invitation to       provide advice about the format (consisting of 33 politicians and 66       ordinary citizens selected at       random) of a constitutional convention (CC) launched in the Republic of       Ireland at a two day event       in Dublin early in November 2012.
The same work was used in 12 March 2013       in response to an       invitation from the Brazilian Government to advise on public engagement       strategies [5.9].
Playing a pivotal role in the development of a critical resource for         designing civic participation     Participedia &#8212; an international, Harvard-led knowledge e-platform       designed to provide information       about global strategies in citizen participation to practitioners,       activists and government officials &#8212; has       adopted Smith's framework as the basis on which Participedia's own data       collection is       structured, and many of the innovations he researched have served as test       cases for the project.
Subsequently, in 2009, Smith was invited to join the steering board of       Participedia which is       supported and has been used by major organisations including the Chilean       Innovation Programme,       European Institute for Public Participation, Institute for Local       Government (US), Involve (UK),       Deliberative Democracy Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation (USA) and       Open Democracy (UK).
