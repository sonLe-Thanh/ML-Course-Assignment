     SPRU research for Nesta directly influenced the policy agenda outlined by       the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills in March 2008 in       the UK government White Paper Innovation Nation [see Section 5,       C1].
From the first page of the executive summary for Innovation         Nation (2008) the new emphasis of government innovation policy is       set forth as finding and supporting `Hidden Innovation' &#8212; a term that had       become widely disseminated in Nesta policy reports by this time [C2].
The       Innovation Nation White Paper emphasises how government policy       seeks to identify innovation outside those R&amp;D-intensive sectors       traditionally associated with innovation (e.g.
manufacturing sectors such       as aerospace and pharmaceuticals), and to support hidden innovation in a       wider range of industries &#8212; including services and creative industries &#8212;       and an emphasis on supporting innovation in the public sector [C1 cites       the Innovation Gap report on p.14].
A number of initiatives, influenced by       SPRU's research, resulted from the White Paper:            The Innovation Index and its annual report (2009-present) provides a         new set of metrics for measuring and valuing innovative activities,         giving government broader measures on the productive sectors of the         economy based on investment in intangible assets rather than traditional         R&amp;D spending measures (thus capturing investment in R&amp;D         spending, advertising, market research, skills and training, design,         software development etc.).
The Public Services Innovation Laboratory (2008-present) supports new         methods for uncovering, stimulating, incubating and evaluating         innovations in public services through a broad range of initiatives,         hosted at Nesta.
The Whitehall Innovation Hub (2008-2010) was designed to create a         forum for the top 200 civil servants to develop strategies and discuss         implementation plans to transform government and open up possibilities         for public-service innovation and promote the dissemination of best         practice.
The Government Annual Innovation Report (2008-present) is a         summary of government progress in supporting the agenda set out in Innovation           Nation.
Dr Michael Harris (former Research Director of Innovation Policy at       Nesta) states that `the Innovation White Paper announces the Innovation       Index including DIUS and BERR as partners, the Public Services Innovation       Laboratory, the Whitehall Innovation Hub, and a Government Annual       Innovation Report &#8212; all of which are unlikely to have happened (and in       their actual form) without the SPRU work.
More broadly (which is to say       less directly but still in the same vein), there is the support for some       sectors that has continued in line with the much broader recognition of       innovation, for example the creative industry tax reliefs' [C3].
Harris' latter point on industry tax relief refers to HMRC tax relief on       production costs from animation and high-end TV programmes introduced in       2013, and a proposed tax relief on video games (currently delayed by EC       state aid provisions) &#8212; as distinct from tax relief on UK film production,       which predates `Hidden Innovation'.
As indication of the potential value       of these new reliefs, the more-established film tax relief is associated       with growth of the industry (70 per cent of which is now dependent on the       relief) and is said to be worth &#163;600m per year to the film industry [C4].
The policy impacts were achieved as a result of the dissemination of the       Hidden Innovation concept and the continued development of an empirical       evidence base by Nesta in the period 2006-2008.
In particular, Nesta used       the SPRU case studies illustrated in the previous section as exemplars of       hidden innovation, for example at an OECD workshop on `Hidden Innovation'       [C5].
As a direct result of SPRU's contribution to the Innovation Gap       report, Nesta also funded a series of policy reports further exploring       Hidden Innovation [C2], which identify and characterise forms of `Hidden       Innovation' (2007), recognise innovation in sectors previously overlooked       by policy e.g.
Hidden Innovation in the Creative Industries       (2008), and chart the importance of hidden user innovation by The New         Inventors (2008).
The link with the SPRU research remains strong &#8212;       for example, Nesta's (2008) policy report on `Total Innovation'       still echoes clearly the SPRU research findings (see quote from Innovation       Gap in the research section above) but goes further in demonstrating a       receptive policy community: `Traditional indictors of innovation are based       largely on a model that is increasingly irrelevant...many forms of       innovation are neglected by this traditional linear model...Recently       policy has begun to recognise this hidden innovation' [C6 Nesta (2008:       5)].
The concept of hidden innovation remains a theme driving the analysis       of this stream of Nesta reports (see Nesta's China 2013 report,       albeit October 2013 is outside the REF impact period) and Nesta staff       estimate at least &#163;2 million of policy initiatives such as the on-going Innovation         Index studies [C7] have been funded by Nesta as a result of SPRU's       work on `Hidden Innovation' [C8].
The cumulative result of the SPRU research, as well as the series of       Nesta projects that followed on the theme of Hidden Innovation, have       together achieved a substantial shift in the framing of innovation policy       in the UK, such that innovation is now understood to occur in more diverse       forms and locations, and policy can now be developed to foster this.
The       text of the Innovation Nation White Paper makes clear the link to       Nesta's work, acknowledging that `Hidden Innovation is increasingly       important to the UK economy' [C1 Innovation Nation (2008: 14)] and       the executive summary cites the themes of Nesta's reports on Hidden       Innovation in motivating the policy measures it sets out, as follows:       `Other sources of innovation include the creative application of tried and       tested technologies and the role of design in developing innovative       products and services.
Innovation is also not restricted to the private       sector &#8212; increasingly the public sector is called upon (often in       partnership with the private and third sectors) to innovate in design and       delivery of public services.
... Users are also increasingly innovating       independently or in collaboration with business or in the co-creation of       public services.
Government policy needs to recognise these new sources of       innovation and in particular develop new instruments that drive demand for       innovation as well as its supply' [C1 Innovation Nation (2008:       4-5)].
This high level of influence on policy is an achievement       acknowledged publicly by Nesta in its own presentation of its work [C9].
Dr. Michael Harris (formerly of Nesta) recently wrote `SPRU's leading       work on this agenda was highly influential on Nesta's work but also       informed significantly the (then) Department for Universities, Industry       and Skills White Paper, Innovation Nation, in evidencing and       promoting a much broader and more diverse understanding of innovation       across the private and public sectors....
This represented a strong       example of synthesising, translating and disseminating many years of       innovation research to the policy community (especially through the       concept of "hidden innovation"), such that policy-makers' understanding       around innovation has developed as a result, including government's       recognition of innovation in the public sector and within government       itself' [C2].
