     The Paths to Justice (PTJ) research transformed UK Government       thinking and public debate on access to justice and had a conspicuous       impact on the design and delivery of legal aid services.
The subsequent       adoption of the concept of "justiciable problem" and replication of the       PTJ survey by governments around the world has extended the reach of its       influence to the design of international legal aid policy and provision.
Since the publication of Paths to Justice in 1999, 14 different       jurisdictions have invested in and carried out 22 replications of Genn's       original study.
Civil and Social Justice Survey (England and Wales): The original       PTJ survey is now funded by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and       institutionalised as a continuous panel study, the Civil and Social         Justice Survey (CSJS), which replicates the original PTJ methodology       [a].
In the reporting period, the CSJS was run in 2010 and 2012, with the       most recent survey results published in 2013 [2].
Continued government       investment demonstrates the value of the findings for policy development,       even &#8212; or perhaps especially &#8212; in times of constrained public spending.
International adoption: The longevity and reach of Genn's       pioneering research is demonstrated by the worldwide adoption of the PTJ       survey approach and use of resulting data to inform legal aid policy and       services.
Between 2008 and 2013, PTJ style surveys have been commissioned       by Governments in Australia (2008 and 2012) [3], Canada (2008) [4], Hong       Kong (2008) [5], Scotland (2009), Moldova (2011), Netherlands (2009),       Taiwan (2011) [6], and Ukraine (2010).
The report of the most recent Australian survey in 2012 [3] explains         that the PTJ method was adopted because "Genn's [justiciable           problems] approach has a number of advantages over the more           traditional narrow approach...it allows more accurate estimates of the           incidence of legal problems...provides a more comprehensive assessment           of all the different pathways used for the resolution of legal           problems, and... provides a firmer basis for understanding both           `expressed' and `unmet' legal need" [3, p. 5].
The Scottish Government, explaining its intention in 2009 to undertake         regular PTJ style surveys (now part of the annual justice survey) said         of Paths to Justice Scotland [b], "This seminal piece of work           laid the foundations of how we view the prevalence of civil law           problems in Scotland and how people behave when faced with these           problems" [11, para.
1.15].
Influence on policy and practice in the UK and abroad       Fourteen years on from publication, PTJ [a] and Genn's subsequent survey       and research [b, c] have led to identifiable changes during the REF impact       period in access to justice policies and practices.
The far-reaching       national and international impact of PTJ was, in 2013, tracked and       documented in a Paths to Justice Review commissioned by the       Nuffield Foundation [1].
This Review provides evidence from policy       makers, legal aid and justice ministry officials in England and Wales,       Scotland, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.
It confirms       that PTJ style survey results have been "persuasive and influential"       and have "transformed understanding of public justice needs, of         not-for-profit service provision, and of market service provision"       in the UK and around the world [1, p. vi].
PTJ research has influenced at       least three specific policy areas:     Spending prioritisation: The identification of problem clustering       and `trigger' problems in PTJ and CSJS has directly influenced legal aid       policy in the UK and internationally [1, p. 43].
From 2008-11 the Legal       Services Commission's (LSC) strategic prioritisation policy was directly       informed by CSJS data.
"We are aware that good, early advice prevents         relatively simple civil issues from becoming more serious and we are         working towards developing a framework of joined-up services with legal         aid providers being free to shape delivery around the needs of         particular areas" [7, p. 9].
In Australia, PTJ surveys have       influenced the development of the Attorney-General's 2009 Strategic         Framework for Access to Justice [8] and the on-going development of       client centred services.
Findings have shaped the direction of reform of       publicly-funded legal services, specifically: greater targeting of those       most in need, outreach to hard-to-help groups, joining-up of legal and       non-legal services, and early intervention to prevent problem escalation       [8, containing 53 references to PTJ-style surveys].
Redesigning existing legal aid services: Responding to PTJ and       CSJS identification of problem clustering, a strategic priority of the       English Legal Services Commission (LSC) from 2006 to 2010 was establishing       Community Legal Advice Centres and Networks (CLACs and CLANs) providing an       `integrated and seamless' service that would be a model for       delivery of `combined social welfare services' (including debt,       housing, welfare benefits, employment)' [9, p. 16-18].
By 2010 five had       been established (four during 2008-9 in Hull, Leicester, Derby, and       Portsmouth) and evaluated as offering significant benefits to the       community, `specifically the benefits conferred from having a range of         advice expertise, under one roof" [10, p. 182].
In Australia, survey       findings have influenced the development of medical-legal partnership       pilots and legal aid programmes that link with health and social service       providers to provide `wrap around services' [1, p. 55].
Public legal education (PLE) initiatives: PTJ results underpinned       the development of PLE in the UK and abroad.
From 2004-7 Genn headed an       MoJ funded PLE Taskforce which led directly to the establishment in 2008       of a Ministerial PLE Strategy Group, Chaired by the Minister (then Lord       Hunt) and with Genn as a member.
This in turn led in 2010 to the creation       of Law For Life, a charity that "equips ordinary people with the       knowledge, confidence and skills that they need to deal effectively with       everyday law-related issues" [13].
Launching the charity in 2010 the       Justice Minister at the time, Lord Bach, made clear that the findings of       PTJ had influenced his decision to support PLE initiatives, saying that       the PTJ arguments were "powerful... when [Genn] wrote them back in         1999 and even more so today..." [13].
PTJ style survey results have       also inspired similar PLE projects in Canada [1, p. 56].
Impact on access to justice discourse in UK and abroad: Paths         to Justice and its tradition of surveys produced a fundamental shift       in justice policy thinking from a focus on lawyers and courts to a "client       focus" where policy is designed to meet the needs of the public.
The Chief       Research Adviser to the Canadian Federal Justice Department, responsible       for conducting the 2008 PTJ style survey in Canada, stated that "the         paradigm shift from a focus on lawyers and courts as the path to justice         to the broader range of legal problems and pathways to deal with them is         clearly influencing policy thinking" [14].
In England and Wales, the       findings were used for a decade in the 2000s to better target legal aid       expenditure and deliver effective services [7].
From 2010-13, when the       Coalition government sought to cut legal aid, PTJ research findings were       frequently used by opposition politicians and the advice sector as       important evidence for preserving legal aid funding.
For example, during       the House of Lords debate on the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of       Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO), Lord Hart (special adviser to the Lord       Chancellor in 1999) used PTJ to predict the impact of proposed legal aid       changes on citizens.
He referred specifically to problem-clustering       saying: "The spiral of decline triggered by one event leading to         another was all too obvious from the case studies I saw.
... the spiral         is well documented.
I was particularly impressed by the work of         Professor Dame Hazel Genn at UCL in her book, Paths to Justice, and she         was a great help to the Department in my day" [12].
