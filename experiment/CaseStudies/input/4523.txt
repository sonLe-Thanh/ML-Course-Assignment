     By their involvement and leadership in a range of networks our       researchers have changed debate in professional associations and education       communities.
Our research has also contributed to the development of       resources and courses by these associations and communities which they use       to advance policy, practice and professional development.
Challenging debates with alternative understandings: Impact       through debates has developed in local and international networks.
The       model of the teacher as a critical, reflective practitioner engaging in       practice-based enquiry, developed by HILLIER and colleagues in their       research, has underpinned the work of LSRN, which debates and supports the       legitimacy of research in FE practice and professionalism in the UK.
The       influence of HILLIER's research on professional debates and communities       extends to Australia through the `sister' organisation Australian       Vocational Education and Training Research Association (AVETRA), and       government-sponsored agency National Council for Vocational Education       Research (NCVER), Australia's principal provider of vocational education       training research.
HILLIER was invited to further the debate on how       research networks can foster professional development in the FE sector       through leading an international study of innovation in teaching and       learning in VET (2009) (source 5.1).
This included leading a series of       workshops for NCVER, and a keynote at the Big Skills Conference (Sydney,       2009).
Another invitation followed to give a keynote at the Training and       Further Education Development Centre of Victoria's annual conference for       practitioners in September 2012.
The Director of the Work-Based Education       Research Centre at Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia said: `[our]         six-year-long Community of Practice project has adopted many of the         aspects Hillier has consistently highlighted as key to innovation &#8212;         reflective practice, collaborative learning and research networking.
..visits to England in 2008 and 2011 have built a small international         network of VET practitioners and researchers, and information has         continued to be shared about FE, HE and VET policy, research and         practice through meetings, seminars and conferences such as the LSRN         National Research Event' (5.2).
Debates about professional knowledge in leadership have been shaped by       GOODSON'S research, which was the basis of an event he led with members of       the British Educational Leadership Management and Administration Society (BELMAS)       (February 2013).
The Critical Education Policy and Leadership       Research Interest Group (CEPAL) has acknowledged its reliance on GOODSON's       methodological work in a funding proposal to BELMAS for a collective       research project on how leaders both resist and comply with policy, and       the narrative biographical resources they draw on in order to make their       decisions about action (5.3).
GOODSON's research on professional knowledge was central to the Cyprus       Educational Research Association (CERA) inaugural Congress (December       2012).
This brought together teachers, teacher educators, researchers and       Education Ministry delegates from North Cyprus, Canada, Australia,       Algeria, Iran and Turkey to debate education policy and practice.
GOODSON       gave the inaugural keynote and participated in the discussions about using       the theories of refraction and narrative life history methodologies to       articulate a distinctive educational identity in North Cyprus.
These       debates helped the governing body of CERA to realise that the Association       could be the neutral ground to bring researchers from diverse backgrounds       together in overcoming barriers in education (5.4).
LOVELESS' work contributed to debates about alternative understandings of       teacher knowledge, creativity and pedagogy with digital tools.
Creative       Partnerships (CP), the Arts Council of England's flagship creative       learning programme (2002-2011), commissioned LOVELESS to produce a       provocation paper within an expert seminar, and a publication for teacher,       teacher educator and policy audiences (2008).
On the basis of this paper       the EC Joint Research Centre Institute of Prospective Technical Studies       invited LOVELESS to contribute to an expert seminar and to produce a paper       to inform the debates leading to the preparation of the Centre's 2009       report `Innovation and creativity in education and training in the EU         member states: fostering creative learning and supporting innovative         teaching'.
This report provided an overview of the theoretical       foundations to the programme of work of the European Year of Creativity       2009 to raise awareness of creativity and innovation, including       stimulating education and research (5.5).
DOMBEY's research has been mediated through debates about the teaching of       reading in professional associations and government agencies, informing       the debates, advisory role and lobbying of the UK Literacy Association       (UKLA) using the publication Teaching reading: what the evidence says       to support the UKLA President's `Respond and Lobby NOW!'
campaign (Feb       2011) (5.6).
Developing resources and courses for professional development: In       the UK, the UKLA and National Association for the Teaching of English       (NATE) worked with the TDA, using DOMBEY's research to inform resource       material for the online Teacher Training Curriculum Resource Network and       Induction Pack for English.
It was developed for the induction of teacher       educators and also used by student teachers and teachers from 2002 to       2010.
In 2009-2010 the English site had 112,691 visits, with 569,792 pages       viewed.
In 2010, the UKLA and NATE asserted that this material was high       quality and `has had much to contribute to work at masters level in         the teaching of English in general including the Masters in Teaching and         Learning.
In addition to its use by university tutors, it has also been         heavily drawn on by trainees and practising teachers' (5.7).
Other       UKLA publications drawing on DOMBEY's work include The handbook of         primary English in initial teacher education (5.8).
LOVELESS' research has informed pedagogic design in the training of       educators through the activities of the UK Association of Information       Technology in Teacher Education (ITTE), which has 48 institutional members       who represent teacher educators.
ITTE also works with sister associations       such as the Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education       (SITE) (US) and the Japanese Society for Education Technology (JSET).
The       Chair of ITTE 2008 - 10 (and Outgoing Chair 2011-12) testifies that: `the         network, which ITTE is plugged into and manages at a national level,         liaises directly with government agencies, policy makers and also         teacher practitioners based in schools.
[LOVELESS'] research has         influenced elements of course design in initial teacher education and         CPD, both in content and pedagogical approach to subject knowledge, ICT         capability and creativity.
Two specific examples of this would be the MA         in `Creative and Critical Practice in Educational Settings', at Keele         University from 2010, and the MA in `Education Practice' at De Montfort         University from 2009' (5.9).
LOVELESS' CP provocation       paper has become a resource for professional development and, in 2008, was       translated into Japanese by JSET in a text for teachers and teacher       educators (5.10).
In the HE sector, WISKER's research has informed material to support       postgraduate education.
The HEA Escalate Wellbeing Project led to the       development of a practical toolkit in 2011 for postgraduate supervisors       (5.11).
WISKER's research on conceptual thresholds has been used in the       establishment and development of a range of programmes and resources for       supervisors (2009-13).
The South Africa-Netherlands Trust (SANTRUST)       developed 14 HE postgraduate supervision courses based on her research.
The SANTRUST Academic Programme Manager testifies that: `Conceptual         thresholds have been reported as being one of these concepts that they         [supervisors] have found useful and liberating in understanding the         stages that both they and candidates have encountered in their scholarly         journey together' (5.12).
The research also informed the       design of postgraduate supervision workshops in Gothenburg, Sweden (5.13).
