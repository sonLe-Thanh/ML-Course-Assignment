     The research had impact, by influencing and changing policy and       professional practice, in three main areas:     (i) The organisation of community safety practices and the         coordination of the `extended policing family' across the UK: The       research influenced professional practices via: The establishment of       `Plural Policing' units in police forces to coordinate and harness the       diverse efforts of the `extended policing family'; the promotion and       emergence of formal partnerships between the police and non-police       providers of neighbourhood security; and greater recognition of the       contribution of PCSOs to delivering public reassurance, crime prevention       and problem-solving [A] [B] [C].
The report of the study       commissioned by West Yorkshire Police Authority directly influenced the       long-term deployment of PCSOs in West Yorkshire and (by 2009) over 300       copies hafsd been sold to all 43 police forces in England and Wales.
The       findings enabled police managers to protect PCSOs from budget cuts       (notably since the Comprehensive Spending Review 2010) and keep the PCSO       role focused on public reassurance, crime prevention and core community       safety activities.
The Chair of the National Community Safety Network has       testified: "This work has been immensely useful in informing the       development of community safety in England and Wales and in particular       supporting local work to integrate partners into an extended policing       family... [it] has helped some forces to secure the continuation of PCSOs       and has shaped a number of localised partnerships where co-ordinated       tasking of private security providers and local authority enforcement       officers has resulted in improved quality of life for communities" [D].
Recently, insights from the research have informed the conclusions of the       Independent Commission on the Future of Policing (Chaired by Lord Stevens,       2012-13 [A]).
(ii) The use of police dispersal powers designed to tackle anti-social         behaviour and promote community safety: The research significantly       improved the quality of the evidence-base on dispersal orders, resulting       directly in changes to the policies and practices of police forces and       community safety partnerships around the UK.
According to the then Chief       Executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA): "the       research directly informed the NPIA's guidance and policy development.
Policy and operational practice was directly affected by the research       through links between the researchers and the NPIA team" [E].
In       some areas, it led to long-term partnership planning and problem-solving       initiatives being triggered alongside the introduction of dispersal       powers.
Programme Managers at the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust (JRHT)       verified that the research had practice-based impact: "Directly affecting       JRHT's behaviour as a social landlord through them taking an approach       based on philosophy (rather than uniformed patrols) when confronted with       behaviour seen as problematic" [F].
(iii) National policy and public debate concerning the nature and         availability of specific anti- social behaviour powers: The research       highlighted considerable public uncertainty over the role of PCSOs and       also the powers available to them, findings that generated much media       coverage (i.e.
The Daily Mail and Economist) and political       concern about the uneven powers, training and uniforms of PCSOs.
Sir Ian       Blair, the architect of PCSOs, confirmed: "evaluation has proved they       [PCSOs] are successful... as the `eyes and ears' of the service...
But       this is not totally true of other studies, such as that carried out last       year by Adam Crawford and Stuart Lister at the University of Leeds.
The       study, research for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that there was       public confusion over the roles of [P]CSOs and what could be expected of       them when it comes to tackling crime" (Interview, Police Federation         Magazine, p.13).
Consequently, in 2008 the NPIA undertook a           wide-ranging review of the role which led the Government to           standardise a menu of powers for PCSOs.
Subsequently, work has been           on-going to standardise supervision, training and uniforms.
The           ex-NPIA Chief Executive wrote in testimony: "The research was very           significant in Ministerial policy development and led directly to the           NPIA's work to develop a standard set of powers, supervision, training           and uniform for PCSOs" [E].
The research influenced responses to the Coalition Government's           consultation and review of anti- social behaviour powers and informed           the publication of the subsequent White Paper (2012).
It was heavily           cited in the submission by the Independent Commission on Youth Crime           and Anti- Social Behaviour to the Government's consultation [G]             [H].
The Secretary to the Independent Commission acknowledged:           "the influence of Crawford and Lister's research on the Government's           proposed reform of dispersal powers is clear.
Their research has also,           as evidenced by its contribution to the Commission's work, played an           important part in critical public debate" [H].
Specifically,           the White Paper accepted the findings regarding the anomaly of           `presence' as a ground for dispersal and proposed that: "The new power           would also be dependent on actual behaviour, rather than an           individual's presence in a particular area".
This is reflected in the           draft Anti-Social Behaviour Bill published in December 2012 [I].
The Metropolitan Police Anti-social Behaviour Coordinator for Camden           and adviser to the government on the current legislation, stated: "For           me the most important factor to note when faced with academic           findings/research is whether it changes or influences one's own           views/beliefs; in relation to Adam and Stuart's work the answer is           yes" [J].
