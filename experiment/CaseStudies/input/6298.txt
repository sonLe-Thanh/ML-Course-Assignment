     The Significance of this Research     The persuasive evidence provided by the body of work emanating from the       St George's group led       to recommendations from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition       (SACN) to reduce salt       intake.
This resulted in a reduction in salt intake in the UK from a value       of 9.5 gm/day in 2003 to       8.6 gm/day in 2008 [A].
This was calculated to have reduced deaths from       cardiovascular disease       by 6000 over this period at a cost of &#163;15 million for the advertising       campaign.
The calculated       saving to the UK economy was &#163;15 billion.
NICE Guidelines     The Department of Health subsequently asked NICE to provide public health       guidance on the       prevention of cardiovascular disease in the UK, and in 2011 NICE produced       its report entitled       "Guidance on the prevention of cardiovascular disease at the population         level" [B].
This wide-ranging       report considered multiple factors including dietary fats, physical       activity, food marketing       and labelling, but its primary recommendations related to salt intake and       specifically cited He and       MacGregor's work.
Specifically this report recommended:            Accelerate the reduction in salt intake among the population.
Aim for         a maximum intake of         6 g per day per adult by 2015 and 3 g by 2025.
Ensure children's salt intake does not exceed age-appropriate         guidelines (these guidelines         should be based on up-to-date assessments of the available scientific         evidence).
Promote the benefits of a reduction in the population's salt intake to         the European Union         (EU).
Introduce national legislation if necessary.
Ensure national policy on salt in England is not weakened by less         effective action in other         parts of the EU.
Ensure food producers and caterers continue to reduce the salt content         of commonly         consumed foods (including bread, meat products, cheese, soups and         breakfast cereals).
This can be achieved by progressively changing recipes, products and         manufacturing and         production methods.
Establish the principle that children under 11 should consume         substantially less salt than         adults.
(This is based on advice from the Scientific Advisory Committee         on Nutrition.)
Support the Food Standards Agency so that it can continue to promote &#8212;         and take the lead         on &#8212; the development of EU-wide salt targets for processed foods.
Establish an independent system for monitoring national salt levels in         commonly consumed         foods.
Ensure low-salt products are sold more cheaply than their higher salt         equivalents.
Clearly label products which are naturally high in salt and cannot         meaningfully be         reformulated.
Use the Food Standards Agency-approved traffic light         system.
The labels         should also state that these products should only be consumed         occasionally.
Discourage the use of potassium and other substitutes to replace salt.
The aim of avoiding         potassium substitution is twofold: to help consumers' readjust their         perception of 'saltiness'         and to avoid additives which may have other effects on health.
Promote best practice in relation to the reduction of salt         consumption, as exemplified in         these recommendations, to the wider EU.
Furthermore, the NICE clinical guidelines on management of hypertension       published in 2011       recommend dietary salt reduction in the management of hypertension.
Underpinning these recommendations was the calculation that a reduction       in mean salt intake of       3 g per day for adults (to achieve a target of 6 g daily) would lead to       around 14-20,000 fewer       deaths from CVD annually.
Using conservative assumptions, this equates to       a gain of 130,000       quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a saving in healthcare costs       around &#163;350 million.
A       reduction of 6 g per day would lead to twice the gain: some 260,000 QALYs       and an annual saving       of &#163;700 million.
The Reach of this Research     This work has impacted the commercial food retail world as evidenced, for       example, by statements       on Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and Tesco websites that recommend low       salt intake and have       labeled their products accordingly [C,D,E].
The global influence of this work has been extensive.
In 2010 the WHO       convened a meeting on       "Strategies to monitor and evaluate population sodium consumption and       sources of sodium in the       diet" which considered a number of technical issues and strategies to       reduce salt consumption       worldwide [F].
Their report, entitled "Sodium intake for adults and       children" cites several items of       Macgregor's work [G].
The World Health Assembly passed a comprehensive       programme to reduce       non-communicable diseases, and one of the targets was for a worldwide salt       reduction of 30% by       2025 with an eventual target of 5g/day for adults.
Progress towards these       aims has been achieved       in many nations, notably in Latin America.
