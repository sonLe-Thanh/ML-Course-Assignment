     The research has led to the use of effective assessment methods for       thousands of offenders in several jurisdictions, to new approaches to the       measurement and assessment of supervision skills, and to comprehensive       evaluation of service outcomes within Jersey itself.
Research on LSI-R in England and Wales and Jersey was disseminated widely       to practitioners through conferences and training events both before and       since the start of 2008.
Professor Raynor gave related presentations to       eight conferences, including British (1999 and 2004), American (1999) and       European (2008) Societies of Criminology and conferences organised by the       Scottish Office (1997), the Home Office (2002, 2003) and the Jurats       (judges) of Jersey (2001), plus lectures in Cambridge (2009), Sheffield       (2003), Neuchatel (2008) and Barcelona (2009).
Training events were       organised throughout Britain and in other countries by the Cognitive       Centre Foundation (CCF), a training consultancy based in South Wales which       distributes LSI-R on behalf of the copyright owners, Multi-Health Systems       of Toronto.
(Neither Swansea University nor any members of its staff       receive any financial benefit from the distribution of LSI-R, in order to       preserve the independence and integrity of ongoing research.)
Professor       Raynor has spoken at some CCF training events.
Advice was also given to Ministers and officials in the course of       Professor Raynor's membership of Government criminal justice Accreditation       Panels in England and Wales (1999-2009, and 2012 onwards) and Scotland       (2003-5), and of Scotland's National Advisory Body on Offender Management       (2005-9).
England and Wales accepted the broad principles of risk/need       assessment but preferred to develop their own method for offender       assessment, known as the Offender Assessment System - OASys.
Typically, organisations interested in the development of risk/need       assessment became aware of the LSI-R research through publications       (including in practitioner journals), conferences or discussions in       advisory bodies and obtained further information from Swansea, together       with advice on practical implementation from Jersey where implementation       was most highly developed.
If as a result they decided to use LSI-R or its       derivatives, they would then enter into a training arrangement with CCF.
Reports from Scotland, Ireland and the CCF make it clear that the research       findings were a critical factor in deciding to use this particular       approach to assessment: for example, the Chief Executive of the Scottish       Risk Management Authority (see section 5) states that `the work of         Peter Raynor has been used in all the LSI-R training in Scotland from         the late 1990s to the present time', `this research has had a         very practical impact, and also influence on policy', and `this         set of studies has great impact in the UK where such systematic and         sustained effort is rare'.
An Assistant Principal Probation Officer       of the Irish Probation Service states that `without the availability         of this research we would have been floundering in the dark' and `no         other development since 1975 has been as significant in terms of impact         and outcomes'.
The Director of the CCF writes `the Raynor studies were instrumental         in providing evidence of [the LSI-R's] validity in a UK context         and paved the way for continued applicability in many UK areas'.
Impacts since 2008 are in some cases continuations of earlier impacts: in       Scotland training was completed in 2011 covering about 1,200 social       workers, and in the Republic of Ireland implementation began in 2006 and       was completed during 2008, with about 23,000 offenders assessed since July       2008.
The LSI-R has also been adopted in Malta in 2010 following advice       from Ireland.
According to the CCF, the National Board for Forensic       Medicine in Sweden has sought and received training in LSI-R in 2009 as a       direct result of assessing the Swansea research, staff of the Ministry of       Justice in Denmark received training in 2013, and other countries       including Portugal may do so.
Correspondence from the Director of CCF       indicates that the economic impact on the work of the CCF itself has also       been substantial, with a large part of their work being LSI-related from       1996 to the present, resulting also in royalty payments to the copyright       holders in Canada.
Dissemination of the supervision skills study has also been through       publications and conferences, and particularly through the annual       conferences of CREDOS.
This was founded in 2007, following discussions at       the European Society of Criminology in T&#252;bingen in 2006 where a paper by       Professor Raynor on research in Jersey led to meetings between researchers       interested in direct research on individual supervision practice.
CREDOS       now brings together researchers and practitioners from ten countries and       has produced the recent book Offender Supervision.
Other practical       impacts of the skills study to date include a presentation by the Chief       Probation Officer of the Jersey Probation and After Care Service at the       2010 conference of CREDOS in Melbourne, training workshops by Dr Ugwudike       at the Scottish Risk Management Authority conference in March 2011, and       consequent enquiries about use of the Jersey Supervision Skills Checklist       developed in the study.
Following presentations of material from the study       in Professor Raynor's 2011 Bill McWilliams Memorial Lecture at the       Cambridge Institute of Criminology and at two invited Ministry of Justice       (MoJ) Offender Management Seminars in 2011 and 2013, all attended by       officials, managers and practitioners, eight Probation Trusts in England       and Wales have also approached Jersey about possible use of the skills       checklist in staff development.
In addition the Jersey study is one of the       influences on the SEED project (Skills for Effective Engagement and       Development) being implemented since 2010 by the MoJ in eight Probation       Trusts, and a short report on the study was published by the MoJ as Offender         Engagement Research Bulletin 9 in 2011.
Professor Raynor is a member       of the Academic Reference Group for the Offender Engagement Programme       (which includes SEED) and provided detailed advice to the SEED manager.
The impact of this advice is evident, for example, in the use made in SEED       of direct observation of interviews, structured feedback and research       findings from Jersey.
Within Jersey itself, information from the Chief Probation Officer       indicates that the LSI-R based research has enabled his Service to become       one of very few public services in Jersey able to demonstrate ongoing       evaluation of the impact of their work.
The research has been `key to         internal monitoring and planning processes' and has been used to `influence         policy-makers and the allocation of resources'.
The Minister       responsible for the Crown Dependencies wrote to the Chief Probation       Officer on 22/7/10 to commend the research on LSI-R and to report that he       was sending it on to officials in the Ministry of Justice: `I should         like to congratulate you and your colleagues at the Jersey Probation and         After-Care Service .
.
.
and also Dr Miles, Professor Raynor and Ms         Coster (research assistant in Jersey) on producing an         interesting, encouraging and significant report.'
In addition,       material produced in the skills study is being applied to staff       development in a carefully monitored exercise which will help to inform       developments elsewhere, and the Chief Probation Officer reports that       information from the study has been provided to `10 other probation         organisations in the British Isles, Australia and the USA'.
