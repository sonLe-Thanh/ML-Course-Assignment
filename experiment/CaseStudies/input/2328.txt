     This case study relates to research that has delivered an economic impact       through the continued success of a University spin-out, Biox Systems Ltd.       Biox was created in 2000 as a special purpose vehicle to bring to market a       novel, more versatile and reliable TEWL measurement instrument, Aquaflux.
With close and continued input from the Group's research, Biox has, since       2008, continued to invest and develop in what has been independently       described as the "gold standard" device for TEWL measurement [1].
The Biox Aquaflux instrument is being deployed globally by world leading       research and commercial organisations in the health, cosmetics and       consumer goods sectors, for example, Unilever, Proctor and Gamble,       Gillette, Colgate-Palmolive, Boots, Pierre Fabre Dermocosmestique       (France), International Speciality Products (USA), the Universities of       California, Heidelberg and Manchester, and the National Physical       Laboratory [2].
Based upon the research findings and, specifically, the promise shown by       the novel condenser based close-chamber measuring technology, Professor       Imhof and LSBU agreed to commercialise the technology through a spin out       company.
Biox Systems Ltd was incorporated in 2000.
Since 2008, the Company has [3]:            Generated sales of 148 Aquaflux instruments producing revenues of         &#163;1.37million and net profits of &#163;190k;       Exported into 15 countries accounting for 82% of revenues;       Established a sales and support agency network overseas e.g.
USA, and         China;       Reinvested (&#163;200k) in new product development;       Created 3 new full time technical level jobs;       Delivered consultancy and training to over 50 organisations on the         science and performance benefits of AquaFlux;       Provided 4 graduate internship opportunities each year to students         from the UK, France and Spain.
Independent consultants have solicited feedback from users of Aquaflux       [1].
This has affirmed the instrument's market leading position and       performance capabilities.
Testimonial evidence includes:            A senior technologist at Proctor and Gamble stated that they have 12         Aquaflux instruments and have found AquaFlux to be the best instrument         on the market in terms of accuracy and repeatability.
P&amp;G have         employed AquaFlux to support the testing and development of household         brands in areas such as baby care, laundry and beauty products.
He         further commented that because AquaFlux is built on good scientific         principles, it is the standard reference machine used in P&amp;G and in         European multi-centre trials.
A second independent consultant with over 20 years skin-related         research experience and a visiting professor at the School of Pharmacy,         UCL, commented that AquaFlux represents the "gold standard" for TEWL.
He         went on to state that there are requirements from the Advertising         Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK for manufacturers to provide         evidence to support product claims via Clearcast.
AquaFlux provides such         companies with confidence about the robustness of their claims.
A project leader at LTS Lohmann stated that the AquaFlux instrument is         used in research and development.
It is used to measure the quality of         animal and human skin prior to Vitro permeation studies to test         transdermal formulations.
The AquaFlux is less sensitive to         environmental conditions compared to competitor systems and thus speeds         up trials and reduces costs.
Further testimonials showing the versatility of the Aquaflux device       include [2]:             "In our Institute we are using the Aquaflux in an unusual           application to evaluate the water behaviour of fabrics and textile           components" - R&amp;D Projects Manager, IFTH, France.
"We are exploring with this equipment the quantification and early           detection of malfunctioning sudomotor neurons in patients suffering           e.g.
diabetic neuropathy, CRPS, small fibre neuropathy... which may           contribute to a new diagnostic clinical tool" - Senior researcher         in the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine,         University of Heidelberg          Use of AquaFlux has been instrumental in a number of important       discoveries.
In a recent example (2012), a senior researcher at St John's       Institute of Dermatology, Kings College, London, commented that the       AquaFlux was selected for a special study as a result of its world-leading       reputation.
The study involved 1,302 participants and investigated the       prevention of food allergies in young people in collaboration with the       Food Standards Agency and MRC EAT (Enquiring About Tolerance).
The       researcher found that AquaFlux was a highly accurate instrument to       identify levels of water loss in skin as an indicator of food allergies       [4].
The researcher also stated that AquaFlux was instrumental in their       "fundamental finding" that skin barrier properties of 3-month old infants       are similar to those of adults [1].
This finding will benefit the       understanding and potential treatment of skin allergies in infants.
