     Welsh legislation       In July 2009, Williams, on behalf of the Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group,       sent an outline legislative       proposal to Welsh Ministers when they were planning what became the Rights       of Children and       Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011.
The proposal was based on the research       insights at 2(iv)       above.
The Welsh Ministers accepted the proposal but encountered       resistance from their officials       to a pervasive duty.
In September 2009 Williams was commissioned to work       with officials.
Initially       this helped restore Ministers' original intentions: `... by early         December it appeared that the         politicians had prevailed, and a proposal emerged from officials which         reflected the aspirations of         sponsoring Ministers, Cabinet and the First Minister'.
(C1 below, p.       28)     In December 2009 there was a change in Ministerial portfolios following       the First Minister's       retirement.
New Ministers were persuaded to restrict the proposed duty to       `relevant functions'       which Ministers themselves would specify on advice from civil servants.
Williams continued to       advocate the unrestricted application necessary to support the integrated,       whole government       approach required by the UNCRC.
Advocacy for the latter approach was then       conducted outside       as well as within the government: `That [the restricted duty] did not         ultimately form the basis of the         Measure was the result of resolute and informed opposition by the NGO         community, the ad hoc         group of lawyers ... the scrutiny carried out by the Legislation         Committee, the Children and Young         People Committee and the Constitutional Affairs Committee'.
(C1       below, p. 28)     In March 2010 pre-legislative public consultation began.
Williams and       Hoffman supplied the NGO       community with advice derived from the research insights to help inform       responses.
In April 2010       an `experts meeting' was convened in the UoA, attended by Welsh academics       and practitioners,       statutory bodies, AMs, UNICEF representatives and UK children's rights       experts.
Written views       were also solicited from international experts.
This helped achieve an       overwhelming majority of       responses in favour of an unrestricted duty, and influenced a key       political actor, the then       chairperson of the National Assembly's Children and Young People       Committee, National Assembly       for Wales, who attended the meeting and as a result formed the view that       the Committee should       take the unusual step of undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny (C1 below p.       31, and see contacts list).
In June 2010, the Ministers responded to the pre-legislative consultation       and a revised draft       Measure was introduced, containing a duty which applied to all functions       but only when the       exercise could be characterised as `strategic'.
Williams and Hoffman       viewed this restriction as       equally problematic as the earlier one.
Williams and other Monitoring       Group members gave       evidence to the National Assembly's Children and Young People Committee       and legislative       scrutiny committee (LC5).
Williams was invited to return to LC5 with       further evidence.
Williams and       Hoffman convened a second `experts' meeting' at which the restrictive and       pervasive approaches       were tested with particular reference to child poverty.
This reinforced       the benefit of the pervasive       approach and had persuasive impact on two key Assembly Members (the Chair       of Children and       Young People Committee and a Minister / member of LC 5, see contacts       list), and informed       Williams' written evidence to LC5 (C8 below).
In September 2010, Williams and Hoffman led an `ad hoc' lawyers' group       giving oral evidence to       LC5.
The Swansea evidence `made direct and fundamental differences to         the Measure which was         adopted by the National Assembly.
The quality of that evidence, and its         foundation in empirical and         comparative research, assisted our scrutiny as legislators and helped         change the mind of         government in important respects.
...
Without their intervention, I am         sure that the Rights of the         Child Measure would have been considerably weaker'.
(C2 below)     In November 2010, in light of the LC5's report on its scrutiny of the       draft Measure, the responsible       Welsh Minister conceded the case for a pervasive duty.
In January 2011 the       Minister tabled the       necessary amendments and the Measure as so amended was passed, receiving       royal approval on       16 March.
The insights from research had thus influenced the outcomes of       the legislative scrutiny       process and helped realise the original political aspiration for a       pervasive duty: `.... the         effectiveness of the NGO community was heightened by the legal and         policy expertise of the ad         hoc group of lawyers and seminars hosted by Swansea University School of         Law.
A cold-light-of-         day analysis will, in my opinion, indicate the central importance of         that community in ensuring that         the Government remained true to its original intentions' (Rt.
Hon.
Rhodri Morgan, Speech to 5th       World Congress, San Juan, Argentina, October 2012).
`It was very much         thanks to Jane's tireless         advocacy work that the original idea of the CRC underpinning all the         work of the Welsh         Government has been taken forward.
Her evidence to the Legislation         Committee in September         2010 played a crucial role in those efforts.'

International impact       On-going impact includes promotion of legislative change and programmatic       reform on children's       rights at the autonomous regional level, through research collaboration       between Hoffman and       Barcelona University.
The World Congress on the Rights of Children and       Adolescents featured the       Welsh model of incorporation in its 5th biennial congress in Argentina in       October 2012, with a       plenary address by Rt.
Hon.
Rhodri Morgan.
Hoffman has been invited to       serve on the scientific       committee for the next Congress in Mexico, 2014.
UNICEF has promoted       consideration of the       Welsh model internationally: `Wales was the first country in the UK to         adopt a legislative instrument         of incorporation but the Measure is also unique in the world and has         attracted a lot of interest.
A         number of governments and UNICEF offices have been following         developments in Wales and         using it for their advances in implementing the CRC.
For instance,         UNICEF Canada organised an         international conference on the Child Rights Impact Assessment in May         2013 and the Welsh model         and experience was on the agenda and was discussed in detail and with         great interest' (Domestic       Policy and Research Officer, UNICEF UK, C9 below).
In September 2011 a       Scottish Government       consultation proposed to follow the `due regard' model (C10 below, at       para.
60).
On-going impact in Wales       The `Taking the Rights Steps' conference in June 2012 was part-funded by       the Welsh Government       to contribute to implementation of the Measure.
The Wales Observatory on       Human Rights of       Children and Young People, based in the UoA, was launched at `Taking the       Rights Steps' and in       its first year has undertaken training and consultancy on implementation       of the Measure for the       National Assembly for Wales and the Children's Commissioner for Wales.
It       is working with local       NGOs and children's projects as well as developing international research       links.
The Observatory       has also responded to Welsh Government consultations, with respect to the       due regard duty, and       has supported a group of children and young people in contributing to its       response to the UK Bill of       Rights Commission's second consultation (Wales Observatory responses, C6       below).
`The         Observatory continues to play a vital role in making sure that the         Measure is implemented....The         work of Jane Williams and Simon Hoffman is crucial in securing that the         hard-won political victory         over the Measure is reflected in policy and practice' (Domestic       Policy and Research Officer,       UNICEF UK, C9 below)     Beneficiaries include law-makers, policy advisers and children in Wales       who will benefit from       Welsh Ministers' compliance with the due regard duty.
Continuation of the       UoA's contribution will       be ensured through participatory action research led by Wales Observatory.
Since the Measure       came into force over 50 child rights impact assessments (CRIA) have been       conducted in the       preparation of new policy / policy review to ensure compliance with the       due regard duty, and a       number of consultations have been carried out with children to inform       policy development as an       aspect of CRIA.
