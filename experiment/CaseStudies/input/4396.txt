     1 &#8212; Improving the management of self-medication for educational           and wider purposes       The findings of the research into Braille height on pharmaceutical       packages formed a British standard (which then became a European       Standard) (see source 1 below).
The Standard specifies requirements and       provides guidance for the application of braille to the labelling of       medicinal products.
The Standard includes a specification about braille       height which refers directly to this research.
It was approved and       recommended at a meeting in Berlin (Sep. 2012) between CEN (European       Committee for Standardization) and the International Organisation on       Standards to accept the European Standard as an International Standard       (source 2).
After a 5-month international voting period between November 2011 and       April 2012, the proposed CEN-ISO standard (ISO/DIS 17351) was unanimously       approved by 28 voting countries.
A statement released by the Royal       National Institute of the Blind said `it significantly increases the         reach and impact of the European standard which we were instrumental in         setting, which has already improved braille on medicine           products in Europe.
As an international standard we will         now be helping to improve braille on medicine packaging           worldwide' (source 3).
According to the European Blind       Union "There are estimated to be over 30 million blind and partially         sighted persons in geographical Europe" (http://www.euroblind.org/resources/information/nr/215).
Of these, around 10% are braille readers (thus around 3 million visually       impaired Europeans benefit from this legislation).
A survey of adult       braille readers in the UK `found that the implementation of the         European Directive and European Standard for braille on pharmaceutical         packaging ... has had a positive impact for consumers,         with significant numbers reporting that since the introduction of the         standard (1) the quality of the braille had improved and (2) the braille         was on more products' (source 4).
The specific requirements of       braille readers in reading labels on packaging has been cited by         international bodies for visual impairment, such as EBU: The Voice       of Blind and Partially Sighted People in Europe (source 5).
The standard       is documented in evidence on guidelines by government agencies such as the       Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (source 6) and the European       Medicines Agency.
2 &#8212; Visual Impairment, Educational Achievement and Employment       The UK Vision Strategy (source 7) is the first cross sector strategy for       visually impaired people and references in the document directly attribute       the Network 1000 research undertaken by VICTAR.
Dr. Graeme Douglas, the       lead researcher on the project, was also a member of the Strategy working       team on `Empowerment and the Inclusive Society'.
His direct participation       in the process enabled him to contribute the knowledge gained from the       research as well as the wider research- based expertise built up by VICTAR       and thus to help shape the strategy.
The practice guidelines of       all agencies involved with visually impaired children and adults are       informed by this work, as the UK Vision Strategy is being implemented       through a strong alliance of statutory, health and social care bodies,       voluntary organisations, eye health professionals and individuals.
Specifically in relation to education, the beneficiaries include visually       impaired young people: "It is estimated that there are around 25,000         children and young people in Britain from birth to 16 with a visual         impairment of sufficient severity to require specialist education         service support."
(www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/education/research/pages/facts_and_figures.aspx).
The implications of the strategy for these 25,000 visually impaired       children in Britain can be seen by looking at the UK Vision Strategy       implementation plan for England (2009-2014), which is supported by       government.
The findings generated by Douglas and colleagues demonstrated       employment outcomes for visually impaired people are very poor (33%) and       an estimated 40% `not in education, employment or training' under the age       of 30 years.
Nevertheless, high educational attainment and engagement was       found to have a very high positive impact on employment outcomes.
These       findings helped emphasise the importance of education within the         Strategy and as such, education and employment are central to       Strategy Outcome 3 (inclusion, participation and independence for people       with sight loss).
Recommendations and priorities include: education and       vocational training should be accessible to people of all ages with sight       loss: a clear and smooth transition pathway from children's and young       people's services to adult services should be established or maintained;       people with sight loss should have equal access to job opportunities and       the present negative attitudes should be tackled (sources 7 and 8).
3 - Improving educational opportunity for visually impaired           students in low-income countries       Lynch et al's research demonstrated that by taking part in the research,       the teachers began to develop reflective skills in relation to their own       practice.
Follow-up studies revealed a significant impact had been made on       their practices.
The research found that, as a result of these acquired       skills, a majority of pupils in the programme were given confirmed       diagnoses of their visual impairment and consequently received a service       enabling them to participate and learn effectively.
In addition, prior to       this research, there was no recognition or understanding of the support       required by itinerant teachers in East Africa who work with visually       impaired children.
In recognition of the contribution of this study and       other VICTAR research, VICTAR is cited by Sightsavers as one of the       research partners with whom it produces the best results (http://www.sightsavers.org/in_depth/research/research_partners/default.html)       .
The study has also influenced international agencies, with UNESCO       featuring it in its report `Reaching the Marginalised' (2010) (source 9).
More directly, in July 2013 there were over 4,000 children with visual       impairment in East Africa enrolled in education programmes designed to       support them.
Large numbers of these will have benefitted from the         change in practices recommended to their teachers as a consequence       of the research.
Sightsavers have also used the research findings to       produce an education and advocacy pack outlining ways in which high       quality education for visually impaired children can be delivered in their       local context, in ways which are scalable, adaptable and cost effective       (source 10).
