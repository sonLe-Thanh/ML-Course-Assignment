     The research has attracted repeated investment from pet food       manufacturers to work with the       group to improve their diets for cats with CKD, as well as being used by       veterinary pharmaceutical       and diagnostics companies to inform product development.
Waltham Centre       for Pet Nutrition and       Royal Canin jointly provided funding grants to support staff and       diagnostic work to run clinics.
In       addition, the companies have provided in-kind contributions of clinical       renal diets used within the       charity clinic of the PDSA and the Beaumont Sainsbury Animal Hospital, to       provide high quality       treatment for owners who otherwise could not afford to treat their cats.
Over the impact period       more than 1,000 cats and their owners will have benefited from this       provision of free diagnosis and       treatment, and have taken part in ongoing research [a].
This research has informed the development, refinement and improvement of       dietary therapy for       cats with CKD.
In 2009 Royal Canin launched a reformulated Renal Special       Diet; [text removed for publication] [b]       The group's research has stimulated the launch of two feed additives for       the restriction of       phosphate in the diet in cats.
Bayer marketed Renalzin (lanthanum       carbonate) in Europe in 2008       [c].
Bayer commissioned consultancy from Professor Elliott to assist in       dissemination of the       findings and implications for treatment, leading to a three-page feature       article in the Veterinary       Times[d].
A chitosan-based product named Epakitin in the US and Ipakitine in Europe       was launched by       V&#233;toquinol prior to the REF impact period, its final formulation guided by       Elliott's proposals; [text       removed for publication [e].
V&#233;toquinol has published four booklets /       guidance notes on CKD and       phosphataemia, all of which reference Elliott's research [f].
The group's research has underpinned the development of new diagnostic       products.
The       proteinuria findings stimulated Idexx Laboratories Ltd to develop a test       kit for measuring urine       protein to creatinine ratio for its VetTest&#174; Chemistry Analyser, used by       30,000 veterinary       practitioners worldwide [g].
The test kit was launched in 2005 in the UK       and US following the       presentation of RVC group data at conferences in 2003, enabling the first       in-practice fully       quantitative measure of urinary protein loss, and providing results which       are both more specific and       sensitive than the standard dipstick dye test.
Since 2008 test kits have       also been available for       Idexx's Catalyst Dx chemistry analyser.

Additional quantitative       testing is still undertaken on samples sent by practitioners to diagnostic       laboratories.
RVC's research provided a rationale for anti-proteinuric therapies for       feline CKD, contributing to the       rise in UK sales of Fortekor (Benazepril), Novartis's ACE inhibitor, for       renal use[text removed for       publication].
In February 2013, Boehringer-Ingelheim received marketing       authorisation for Europe,       for use in cats of Semintra (Telmisartan), an angiotensin receptor blocker       for the management of       proteinuria in cats with CKD [j].
The application to EMA directly       references the RVC group's work       [text removed for publication] [k].
[text removed for publication]     Data from the group's studies have informed currently accepted       recommendations for the       management of proteinuria and hyperphosphataemia in CKD [l,m].The       International Renal Interest       Society, which works to educate practitioners worldwide, has used the       group's research to inform       its diagnostic algorithms and treatment recommendations which are       regularly updated.
These were       published by Elliott with A.D.J.
Watson on behalf of the group in 2009, in       Kirk's Current Veterinary         Therapy XIV; an update has been invited for the next edition [n].
This is the standard text for       setting the standard of diagnosis and care for veterinary patients.
[text       removed for publication] [o].
This paradigm shift in clinical practice, based on the research, is       underscored in the widely-       translated BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Nephrology and Urology       (2nd ed, 2007), edited by       Elliott and Grauer (Kansas State University).
3,000 copies of the BSAVA         Manual sold worldwide       2007-2011, [text removed for publication].
It has been translated into       Polish and Japanese, with       Portuguese (for Brazil) and Russian editions under contract [p].
Other       standard textbooks on feline       clinical nutrition and nephrology of small animals, such as the       Encyclopaedia of Feline Clinical       Nutrition, also cover this work [q].
Elliott's chapter from the       Encyclopaedia was first published on-       line by the International Veterinary Information Service (IVIS) in July       2009 and in the first 8 months       was accessed in English 5562 times and in French, 497 [r].
Elliott has been recognized as a Key Opinion Leader in this field through       British and European       veterinary association awards, and has contributed to the dissemination of       the new best practice       through international CPD activities since 2008, including invited       presentations to veterinary       professional conferences in the UK, USA, Italy, Sweden, France, Belgium,       Germany and Thailand.
