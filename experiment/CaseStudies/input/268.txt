             Impact on patients: An increasing number of         patients are waiting for a kidney transplant, and         those with HLA antibodies are waiting disproportionately longer and have         more health problems.
Our research on AIT has enabled the transplantation of more than 100 of         these immunologically         (most patients have multiple HLA antibodies) and physiologically complex         (patients may have         cardiovascular insufficiency and rigidity) cases since 2008 in Coventry         alone.
Their complexity is         illustrated by an average time of renal failure of 14 years before we         transplanted them; 71% had         prior transplants, and 35% first developed renal failure as children.
The majority of these would         probably not have received a transplant without the use of the new tools         and techniques resulting         from our research7, c, d, e. Shared knowledge from our         research has resulted in the transplantation of         over 350 other similarly complex patients across the UK since 2008c,d,           and f. The Associate Medical         Director for Organ Donation at NHSBT has stated in supporting evidence,         `The impact of their         research has allowed greater access to transplantation for this group of         patients who have hitherto         been disadvantaged and the lessons learnt have been extrapolated into         other areas of solid organ         transplantation so leading to better outcomes in terms of quality and         length of life...'c.
Impact on the community: A long wait for transplantation         is not only a burden for the patient,         but also impacts on relationships, family and work, resulting in         emotional, social and financial         sufferingg.
The benefits of successful transplantation of our         patients are illustrated by media         features (over 20 TV, radio, and national media features, see source f         for example).
Impact on health care professionals: The value of the         research for the day-to-day clinical         practice of the NHS is shown by the significant changes in clinical         protocol, which we1-4, and         others, have made since the 2003 protocol.
This includes marked         reductions in the intensity of         immunosuppression in patients who do not develop rejection and this may         account for the UHCW         mortality rate being half that reported from the USA7, h. The         research work, with the involvement of         Higgins as chair of the guideline panel and Briggs, has led to the         publication of national clinical         guidelines for AIT by the British Transplantation Societyi.
These are the first such guidelines in the         world and are important for the provision of standardised, high-quality         care.
UK Commissioners         expect transplant units to follow these guidelinesc.
As a         result of our clinical research, UoW,         NHSBT together with UHCW, have helped other transplantation units         implement our AIT transplant         protocol and business model for obtaining funding through the NHS,         including DFPP and         cryofiltrationi.
Specialist NHS Renal Centres that have         benefited directly from our research in this         way include Guy's, St Georges, Oxford, Cambridge, Cardiff, Bristol,         Leeds, Manchester, Dublin         and Portsmouthd.
Two international clinical workshops in AIT         at Warwick for the dissemination of         knowledge to the patient benefit in 2008 (80 participants) and 2012         (100 participants) j, together         with presentations at international meetingsh, and citations         in the top clinical journali further         illustrate the international impact of our work.
Our research has been         instrumental in the generation         of a national Registry for AIT in 2008 as a research and audit tool.
This Registry was proposed and         initiated by Higgins, who presented the data nationally and         internationally.
Other units such as         Bristol and Cambridge have used Registry data provided by Higgins when         assessing and         developing their clinical programmes.
Impact on NHS: The financial impact of our programme         locally has been highlighted by the         Chief Executive of the University Hospital Coventry, who stated `the         UHCW has received over &#163;6         million income for these transplants, and savings to the NHS from these         transplants exceeds &#163;5         million over and above the extra costs of the programme' e.         In addition, this cost benefit goes up by         around &#163;1 million a year as grafts continue to function and patients do         not need dialysisk.
The         impact is also reflected in the support from the National Director for         Kidney Care at the UK         Department of Health who stated that, `This research has enabled not         only the transplant unit at         UHCW to be extremely productive, but has facilitated the development of         Antibody Incompatible         Transplantation nationally.
The unit led the first NHS commissioned         service for these transplants;         national guidelines produced by the British Transplantation Society, and         proposed the National         Registry of cases that is run by NHS Blood and Transplant 'd.
Commercial impact and new innovation: The hardware for         these techniques is provided         through L.IN.C.
Medical Systems Ltd, whose Managing Director has stated         that `...DFPP has         become established as the treatment of choice for such patients in many         transplant centres.
[Professor Higgins] was also the first physician to perform         cryofiltration DFPP outside of North         America and Japan... L.IN.C.
Medical Systems is an independent UK         company and is now one of         the key suppliers of extra-corporeal therapies providing innovative         technologies that bring cost         effective solutions to the NHS...'a.
Despite the advantages         of DFPP and cryofiltration over other         therapies, they remain non-selective.
In a formal collaboration with         Pure Transplant Solutions and         Pure Protein LLC, Oklahoma City, we have successfully tested a         pre-clinical device to selectively         remove antibodies against HLA on the donor kidney.
The Director of Pure         Protein has stated in         supporting evidence, `This is a well-developed collaboration between our         biotechnology         company... and the University of Warwick and University Hospital         Coventry... with their academic         and clinical credentials in AIT.
Much progress has been made and ...         discussions with investors         have started to take this device into clinical patient testing' b.         Additionally, we are collaborating on         the development of a novel assay to measure HLA antibody potency, with a         first use preproduction         product and data presented at the 2013 American Society of         Histocompatibility meeting.
