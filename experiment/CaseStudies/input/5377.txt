     1) Company Development     As a direct result of research carried out at Imperial College, a company       with twelve years' operational history has been established in Central       London, generating more than &#163;3.4M over the 2008-2013 REF period (&gt;       &#163;1.2M equity, &gt; &#163;1.5M contract and &gt; &#163;660K grant funding) in inward       investment for the UK.
MV has provided &gt; 50 person years of employment       for its own, primarily PhD-level, UK graduates and it has also supported       training activities, paying MBA fees for one of its Principal Scientists,       a CASE studentship at Imperial College, and a contribution to EPSRC KTS       project costs for two postdoctoral researchers seconded from Imperial       College and a Principal Scientist seconded to Imperial College.
This       represents a direct economic impact through investment funding for new       activities, jobs created and protected, and turnover associated with new       and improved services.
MV has additionally been an important component in developing momentum       for the creation of a UK Plastic Electronics industry [A], being one of       two Plastic Electronics companies based in Central London.
In 2008 MV was       starting to be recognized as a "successful multi-million pound         enterprise" [B], being the focus of an article in The Engineer [C]       and a September 2008 visit by Phil Willis MP, then Chair of the House of       Commons Innovation, Universities and Skills (IUSS) Committee, as part of       the Committee's Engineering Inquiry [D, B].
In August 2008, joint       development partner Acrongenomics (an investment and commercialization       company listed on the USA Nasdaq) took a &#163;1.1M equity position in MV [E].
Commenting on the deal Platon Tzouvalis, President of Acrongenomics, said,       "This is a great day for our company.
This agreement with Molecular         Vision is a major milestone for Acrongenomics, since it marks our         substantial sharing in everything that this technology has to         offer...This will allow Acrongenomics and Molecular Vision to focus on         the goals of developing the technology and bringing great products to         the market, thus increasing our shareholder value and substantially         contributing to the betterment of the healthcare system in general"       [E].
In February 2009, Peter Woodford, a diagnostics industry veteran of 35       years standing, including 15 years with Roche Diagnostics, joined the       company as Chairman saying "I am excited by the clear potential of         Molecular Vision's technology platform" [F].
In September 2009 MV       raised an additional &#163;2m from Imperial Innovations and other investors       including Acrongenomics to further the commercial development of the       BioLED technology platform [G].
A significant contract with "a global         cosmetic company" was also announced in 2009 [G].
In 2010 MV       launched the development of its CardioPlex fluorescence based triple test       for cardiac markers myoglobin, CK-MB and troponin-I, concluding a       successful demonstration in 2011.
In 2011, Imperial Innovations invested a       further &#163;750k and MV announced the appointment of Chris Hand as CEO [H].
In 2012, Abingdon Health Group (AHG) led a &#163;3M investment round in which       it acquired a 50.1% stake in MV.
As part of the same deal, Imperial       Innovations invested in AHG, widening its portfolio of healthcare sector       investments [I].
Recently, agreements have been put in place with a       leading European pharmaceutical company and a large multi-national       chemical company to co-develop point-of-care diagnostic tests in the UK       [J].
2) Health Care Benefits     MV has pioneered a novel microanalysis technology that offers a step       change opportunity for point- of-care in-vitro diagnostics.
In particular,       MV's BioLED platform provides a simple-to-use, portable, low-cost, rapid,       quantitative diagnostic tool.
It allows efficient, accurate, multi-analyte       measurement in a generic format that can utilize absorption, turbidity,       fluorescence, phosphorescence and chemiluminescence detection schemes with       existing assays on blood, saliva and urine samples and at the cost of a       few dollars, i.e.
some 1000-times lower than the typical bench-top readers       with which it competes in terms of sensitivity and accuracy.
The       availability of such devices as routine tools in general practice would       directly address key objectives of health providers in the UK, Europe and       the US, notably: (i) reduced treatment time; (ii) improved quality of       treatment; (iii) reduced inequality of treatment by extending facilities       available to remote surgeries; and (iv) improved ongoing care via       home-based preventative and post-treatment monitoring of at-risk patients       [K].
The BioLED platform has the potential to become a de facto       standard for medical testing and the significance of this disruptive       technology was recognized by AHG in March 2012 when they acquired a       majority shareholding in MV.
Abingdon founder Dr Chris Hand commented "This         is an important step towards our strategy of creating a fully         functional, specialist diagnostics business.
Early detection is critical         for improved treatment outcomes and there is a significant need for         simple, faster and more accurate point of care tests.
Working with some         of the world's leading experts we are developing disruptive technologies         and are well placed to take a share of the US$11.2bn global         immunodiagnostics market" [I].
In a later comment for Wired       Magazine, in which MV technology featured as "One of the Big Ideas for       2012", he added "If you can test someone in an ambulance on their way         to hospital, or in A&amp;E, that's a big benefit.
It's all about getting         care to the patient more quickly and efficiently" [L].
In a letter       Dr Hand states "I believe that the Molecular Vision technology offers         us a current and future competitive advantage in the diagnostics sector.
It allows us to expand current markets, and with similarities to our         previous activities at Cozart, allows us to create new, currently         untapped markets for the benefits of the user, the patient and the         healthcare system" [J].
In addition to the medical diagnostics market, the BioLED technology is       also suited to environmental testing including water quality ($4Bn       market), homeland security/biodefence including pathogen detection ($8Bn       market), veterinary testing including bovine TB ($2Bn market) and       substances of abuse testing ($2Bn market) [M].
