     The underpinning research described here has resulted in three types of       impact, relating to changes in government policy, product development         for SMEs and informed public debate.
Clear relationships are       demonstrated between the underpinning research and impact at a range of       scales, from engagement with and influence on UK Government and       co-creating new sustainable related products for the collaborating SMEs,       to influences on the knowledge and modes and public debates.
Impact from this research commenced prior to the current REF assessment       period in 2005 (6), but the most significant impacts (cited here)       have arisen since 2008.
In particular, major contributions to two       key reports by the Social Marketing Practice (2 and 3) formed the       basis for Defra's 2008 Framework for Environmental Behaviours, in which       the segmentation research developed at Exeter was used as evidence for the       development of Defra's social marketing approach to behavioural change (5).
The Framework for Environmental Behaviours is the key strategic document       that governs UK behaviour change policy for the environment, and research       by Barr, Gilg and Shaw formed a significant part of the evidence       base for shifting away from `information-deficit' models of behavioural       change towards more socially-sophisticated frameworks for behavioural       shifts (4).
This research has thus been instrumental in shaping         and influencing policy made by government, and the continuity of       impact resulting from this contribution has been confirmed through the       cited written correspondence from Defra.
Specifically, this       identifies the main impacts of the research being the adoption of a       segmentation-based approach to understanding behavioural change and the       communication of behavioural change theories to policy makers within       Defra, as noted by a Senior Social Researcher `the case study on           Social Marketing and Behavioural Change [undertaken] at the University           of Exeter has been very significant in shaping pro-environmental           behaviour policy and strategy within Defra.'
(4).
The research has also been used to promote innovation in social marketing       business practices through developing an innovative community of practice       (consisting of major social marketing businesses, including, Strategic         Social Marketing, &gt;Hyder Consulting, CAG Consultants and Uscreates       (1)) to discuss the use of new social media and ICT for the       development of behavioural change products.
Working with one of these       businesses (Uscreates) and key stakeholders from the UK travel industry       (including Virgin Trains, Snowcarbon, Loco2, Seat 61, Travel         Foundation and Green Traveller), Barr, Shaw and Gilg       co-designed a new mobile application to promote and inform       consumers about the availability of low-carbon travel options (8 and 9),       with the aim of discouraging and reducing the number of short-haul flights       taken within the EU.
In so doing, this innovation has demonstrated the       influence of the research in the development of a new product, an       impact that has been corroborated by written correspondence from Uscreates       (9).
This App was developed in conjunction with Loco2,       an online travel agent, under the name `TrainAway'.
The co-creation       of this also impacted on their development as indicated by their       co-founder; `working with Exeter meant that Loco2 has started           developing apps sooner than would occurred otherwise and bringing an           academic approach to the challenges being tackled by Loco2 has been           enormously helpful' (10).
These activities have been       supported by funding from the ESRC's Business Voucher Scheme made       available via the ESRC Capacity Cluster in Sport, Leisure and Tourism and       an ESRC Follow-On grant for Barr and Shaw (2011-12).
This       co-creative work with Uscreates, as their leading research       associate explains, `resulted in both a broadening of our knowledge           about our client base and has provided an appropriate platform to           establish a viable behaviour change network for the future'.
Finally, research funded by Defra and the British Academy       has been cited in many popular media outlets within the UK and       internationally, including, The Telegraph, The Age (Australian newspaper)       and Phys.org, a popular US science website.
Additionally, three articles       in very significant media outlets (2008-2010) have stimulated public         debate through challenging modes of thought (7 a,b,c).
This       is demonstrated through online debate resulting from articles in The         Guardian (7b) (`Green idealists fail to make grade, say study'       &#8212; 132 comments).
