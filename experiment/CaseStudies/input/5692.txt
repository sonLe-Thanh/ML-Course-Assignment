     Genetic tests introduced into clinical practice.
Our       research discoveries have been translated into diagnostic tests for       patients which are in routine use in the NHS.
For example, in the year       ending 2011, our NHS Genetics laboratory performed diagnostic tests for       genetic deafness disorders in over 1,100 UK patients, and we provided both       molecular and clinical input to reports.
Nationally, in the same year,       1,803 tests for GJB2 were carried out, according to an audit by the       Clinical Molecular Genetics Society (CMGS) [a].
In 2012, a further       gene dossier was approved by the UKGTN (UK Genetic Testing Network) for       POU3F4 (X-linked deafness) [b].
We also obtained funding to       establish massive parallel sequencing to underpin diagnosis in       non-syndromic hearing loss and Usher syndrome, increasing the number of       genes screened by almost tenfold.
We expect this to improve the diagnostic       yield by almost 100%, based on preliminary results and the work of others.
The benefit to patients of this work is to clarify the inheritance and       allow personalised genetic counselling.
Establishment of genetic deafness clinics.
We established       the first dedicated genetic deafness clinic in the UK and the only       multidisciplinary dual sensory impairment clinic [c].
We see over       300 patients per year in these clinics for diagnosis and genetic       counselling.
One patient group we have worked with explained the impacts       of this clinic on patients with Usher Syndrome as follows:     "By attending the clinic, and sometimes engaging in the genetic         research programmes, people with Usher have been seen by us to benefit         by:            Gaining full and reliable knowledge about Usher, and more           especially which type of Usher they have...
Gaining an understanding of the genetics of the condition.
Some           individuals have wrongly apportioned `blame' for their condition since           they did not understand the genetics involved.
Others use the           information to work with family and siblings who may also have Usher.
Most importantly the support allows people to make an informed           decision about having their own families in future, or about having           further children following a diagnosis in an existing child.
Allowing planning for the future when understanding the Usher type           and its possible prognosis.
Decisions need to be made on support,           communication, mobility and access to information.
Learning about or taking part in the research into Usher allows           individuals to think about the future and may result in positive           feelings for the future.
Mental health impact &#8212; people have indicated to us that they are           relieved to learn more about their condition, to accept Usher and to           move forward with a firm diagnosis and understanding.
Assisting families in their understanding of the condition, what           the implications are and that they are not to `blame'" [d].
Prenatal diagnosis.
Human Fertilisation and Embryology       Authority (HFEA) licences for Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis have been       granted for two deafness conditions as a result of genes identified by our       research [e].
This test is now in use in a number of centres as a       result, allowing genetic counselling to take place.
Best Practice Guidelines.
Our research has contributed to,       and has been quoted by best practice clinical guidelines issued by the       British Association of Audiovestibular Physicians (BAAP) [f].
Bitner-Glindzicz was a member of the working groups for three sets of       guidelines: firstly, on Aetiological investigation into severe to         profound permanent hearing loss in children, published in 2009,       citing our work on Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome; secondly on Aetiological Investigations         into bilateral mild to moderate permanent hearing loss in children,       published in 2009, citing our work recommending blood tests for Connexin       26 mutations; thirdly on Medical Evaluation of children with permanent         unilateral hearing loss.
Our work is also cited in the BAAP's best       practice guidelines on Investigating infants with congenital hearing         loss identified through the newborn hearing screening.
In 2013,       Bitner-Glindzicz contributed to the European Molecular Genetics Quality       Network (EMQN) Best Practice guidelines for diagnostic testing of         mutations causing non-syndromic hearing impairment at the DFNB1 locus       [g].
Government Policy We advised the Department of Health Bill       Team on amendments to Clause 14(4) of the Human Fertilization and       Embryology Bill regarding embryo selection, particularly as it applied to       deafness and the culturally Deaf community.
Consequently the clause was       re-worded to take account of the views of the Deaf Community [h].
We contributed to NIHR National Horizon Scanning Centre document on       `Genetic tests for screening pre-lingual hearing loss in newborns' for the       National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the       subject of potential advances in genetic technologies and their impact on       screening newborns for deafness [i].
We were also invited to       present our work to the All-Party Parliamentary Group in July 2012 at the       House of Commons on the subject of Consent for Consent.
Media and Public Engagement Our work on causes and       prevalence of deafness among Bangladeshi children in East London was       featured on BBC local radio.
Our research findings on       antibiotic-associated deafness were featured in the Independent, the Daily       Telegraph and on the BBC website, raising public awareness of this       potentially-preventable cause of hearing loss [j].
We have engaged       the public and parent groups in this research and two patient groups are       represented on the Steering Committee of one of our current programmes of       research.
Throughout our programme of research we have been involved in       public debate with the culturally Deaf community regarding ethical issues;       we have successfully engaged hard-to-reach groups in our research through       Information Days and disseminated the subsequent findings through       electronic media with the help of support groups such as deafblind charity       Sense, who report that they "highly value the impact we believe         Professor Bitner-Glindzicz's work has had on the Usher population in the         UK and would very keenly wish this to continue" [d].
