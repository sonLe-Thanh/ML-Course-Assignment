     This research has challenged conventional policy wisdom on service       recovery interventions and       has subsequently informed public services improvement.
The research has       had wide reach within       the context of national and local government in Wales: on Welsh Government       policy; on       stakeholders in all subsequent interventions (councillors, officers,       managers and staff); and       correspondingly on the communities and citizens who benefit from (often       dramatically) improved       service performance.
The research is significant because it has helped to       inform changes in the       Welsh Government's policy and practice on service recovery interventions       (sources 1, 2 and 3).
The Welsh Government has officially acknowledged the benefits of the       University of Bath research       (source 4).
The details of these benefits are as follows:     The conclusions in the research report directly influenced those       Ministers and officials tasked with       drafting a framework for the Welsh Government, the Welsh Local Government       Association, the       Wales Audit Office, Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales and the       Education Inspectorate       regarding local government support `to secure improvement in the delivery       of services for the       benefit of the community and citizens'.
The impact of the Bath research is       evident from: (1) the text       of the framework for improvement (paragraphs 6-8, p.2) that provides       explicit definitions of support       and intervention, after the research had stressed the need for greater       terminological clarity       (`currently our use of language in this area is confusing and problematic'       &#8212; source 2, p.59) and (2)       the elements in the framework for improvement that came directly from the       Bath research       conclusions.
Examples of these include:            The Bath research concluded that there should be no assumption of a         ladder of intervention: the         most serious concerns may require the lightest regulatory touch.
Correspondingly, the Welsh         Government's policy statement (source 2, p.59) details that `there is no         real evidence to support the         idea of a ladder of support and intervention, i.e.
that more serious         problems merit deeper and         longer lasting intervention'.
Similarly, principle 2 of the revised         intervention policy framework         (source 3, p.3 paragraphs 16-18) concludes that there should be `no         automatic ladder/ratchet of         Intervention'.
The Bath research concluded that all modes of support and intervention         would benefit from the         greater clarity offered by a quasi-contract with questions of when and         how to exit these         arrangements integral to all planning.
Correspondingly, the Welsh         Government's policy statement         (source 2, p.59) details that `the duration of the intervention should         be as short as possible &#8212; with a         clear strategy for exit'.
Similarly, principle 4 of the revised         intervention policy framework (source 3,         p.5 paragraphs 29-31) proposes that support and/or intervention should         be structured into         programmes of activity and be established with clear start and exit         mechanisms.
The Bath research concluded that increased transparency of all-party         feedback would increase the         legitimacy of any intervention and would help to formalize subsequent         lessons learned.
Correspondingly, principle 5 of the revised intervention policy         framework (source 3, p.6 paragraphs         32-24) states, `a formal case review and evaluation should be undertaken         by an external party at         the end of each intervention'.
The work was well received by key policy stakeholders (source 4) who       praised both the rigour and       practical relevance the team brought to sensitive interactions.
For       example: `The Bath Research as       the Minister has come to call it ... has had a profound effect on the way       we think about support and       intervention' and `this has been a really excellent experience and has       strengthened my feeling that       real time research and policy making can go hand in hand' (Director of       Local Government       Research Unit, source 4).
Following the influence of the Bath research on Welsh Government policy,       subsequent central-local       government interventions show evidence of changed practice in line with       the research       findings.
For example, in August 2009, the Minister for Social Justice and       Local Government used       his powers to order an intervention with the Isle of Anglesey County       Council.
This followed an       independent evaluation of council performance by the Wales Audit Office       (WAO), in line with the       Bath research recommendation that a robust and transparent comprehensive       performance       evaluation would increase the legitimacy of any intervention.
The WAO had       judged Anglesey's       corporate performance to be very poor (`weak', `corrosive', `wasteful')       and concluded that there       was no meaningful local improvement capability (`poorly placed ... to       secure continuous       improvement'); a set of circumstances that the Bath research categorized       as requiring a direct       intervention.
The Minister established an independent Isle of Anglesey       Recovery Board to oversee       the implementations of the recommendations in the WAO Report.
Similarly,       in line with the       recommendation to formalize lessons learned, all subsequent interventions       have been subject to       formal evaluation by third parties.
For example, BMG research commissioned       by the Welsh       Government to evaluate the Denbighshire Education Intervention makes       explicit reference to these       findings from the Bath research in their report (source 5, p.42).
The       University of Bath has also       been commissioned to evaluate interventions (December 2009 and March 2011)       in Swansea       Children's Social Services (source 6) in line with these recommendations.
Finally, Welsh Government experience and policy regarding interventions,       directly informed by the       Bath research findings, continue to shape and influence broader policy       debates regarding       performance assessment and intervention in a number of UK wide policy       discussions (source 7).
