     A joint and equal partnership between UoB, University of Bath and Bayero       University Kano, the DelPHE project began in 2010 and ends in 2013.
It was       designed to engage with policy makers and representatives of NGOs, and       bring them into dialogue with local community members.
Additional benefits       were the facilitation of capacity building, a reduction in gender       inequality in the context of the project, and stimulation of curriculum       development and programme review in Bayero University Kano (see source 2       below).
Influencing policy by bridging the divide     The project has made forestry officials and environmental NGOs aware of       the need for a long-term perspective on fuelwood and attention to the       priorities of local fuelwood users and sellers.
An initial workshop (November 2010) brought together academics, policy         makers, representatives from government and non-governmental         organisations, and the media from across Northern Nigeria.
It           provided a `neutral' space for competing local and extra-local           interests to communicate directly, and during a display of         improved fuel-efficient stoves organised by the NGO Developmental         Association for Renewable Energies (DARE).
A second workshop to discuss the future of energy use in dryland         Nigeria (November 2012) brought firewood sellers into the         discussion.
Project findings were discussed with them in Hausa as well         as English (source 3).
This workshop devoted `open' sessions to the activities of CBOs, NGOs         and interested members of the public (with special emphasis on female           participants, given a local context in which traditional gender         roles limit female participation in such fora), to complement the         participation of representatives from relevant government agencies and         academic institutions.
NGOs have been influenced by the research: a representative         from DARE (see above) affirmed that the design of, and justification         for, their own project had benefited greatly from insights derived from         Cline-Cole's previous research; and that DelPHE project activities have         impacted directly on DARE's current activities: `For example, many             people have become sensitized, through the debates           organized by the DelPHE project, to the hazards of uncontrolled           felling of trees for fuel wood and have been contacting us to procure           the efficient Fuel Wood Stoves we are promoting.'.

The impact of the project is attested by the Director of Forestry, Kano,       in a long interview with UK partners RC-C and R.Maconachie (RM), in which       he stated that his participation in the project convinced him of the need       to put firewood issues on government policy agenda (source 5):     `...in the light of the findings of this research, the         Kano State Forestry Directorate will be taking the lead in ensuring, via         the good offices of the Kano State Governor, that the issue makes it on         to the agenda of the Governors Forum by emphasising the regional &#8212; and         even wider national &#8212; scale of fuelwood-related issues and the need for         collaborative and coordinated solutions to be considered for addressing         the "firewood problem"...
The DelPHE project does help to bridge the gap         between Kano State forestry professionals and officials, academic         researchers, woodfuel sellers and ordinary consumers.
`     Enhancing public understanding            The project website (source 6) is designed to publicise the           debates arising from the project research.
It currently carries a         video (also on DASA website) introducing the project, alongside material         on project activities, and will go on to present further project         findings in future.
The Kano partners were interviewed by local and international media         (Radio Deutsche Welle, BBC Hausa Service) about the project and its         activities following its formal launch in 2010.
The Kano partner         participated in a radio talk show in Hausa in 2012 on environmental         awareness aimed at young people, demonstrating the project's value in         highlighting the role of tree planting in environmental management         (source 7).
This is to be followed up by another radio talk show in         Hausa, organised by the Kano partners, in which popular questions and         concerns relating to the project topic will be discussed.
Influencing teaching programmes and equality            The project has impacted on capacity building, skills training and         widening participation in the partner HEI.
Building on previous         collaboration which led to the creation of a new MSc in land development         at Bayero University in the 1980s, it has set up capacity building           and skills training programmes for young researchers based on         collaborative participation in practical project activities, starting in         2010.
It thus ensures further, sustained impact on local livelihoods and         resource management in future, particularly as a gender-balanced,         field-work trained, community conscious cohort of young researchers         progresses through the ranks.
This capacity building element has been         integrated into existing undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in         the Department of Geography from 2011, helping reorientate teaching         towards a community-focused and experience-rich approach.
This is         reflected in a new natural resource focus in a completely revamped MSc         programme launched in 2012.
The project has paid particular attention to building capacity among women           students, with the result that the project team and activities         include female academic staff and undergraduate and postgraduate         students.
Statistical evidence of female participation rates is         available, and questionnaires distributed to a sample of female         researchers and subjects indicate high field participation rates for         women, as researchers, research assistants, students and subjects.
Brief         recorded testimonies from women participants in 2013 indicate that the         project has been important to them (source 8).
This impact on teaching programmes and equality has been sufficiently         positive for Bayero University Kano to seek to prolong input from RC-C         and RM by offering them funded visiting research fellowships beyond the         lifespan of the project (source 9).
