     As part of the research and development of FLIM technology, the Imperial       group has worked closely with several industrial partners, including       Kentech Instruments Ltd, AstraZeneca, GE Healthcare, GSK and PerkinElmer.
This resulted in several papers being co-authored with industry [1-4]       which raised the profile of time-gated FLIM and helped to establish a       market for this technology.
This was particularly important in helping to       create a new market for Kentech Instruments' GOI and high repetition rate       gated optical imaging intensifiers (HRI) products, as well as stimulating       the development of further products.
In addition to collaborative work with industry, key routes to impact       have been to seek funding to demonstrate specific applications, e.g.
BBSRC       for cell imaging, EPSRC for medical imaging and a DTI/TSB Technology Award       (2006-2010) for drug discovery with Kentech Instruments Ltd, AstraZeneca,       GSK and GE Healthcare, who are looking to include FLIM in their       activities.
The Imperial group's research underpins the adoption of the technology in       FLIM systems and since 2005 has led to a sharp increase in Kentech's GOI       sales.
Kentech, manufacturers of specialised and custom built electronics       and imaging equipment, state that since 2005 sales of FLIM systems based       on GOI technology "have reached around &#163;5M, (with ~&#163;2.5M having been         sold since 01/01/2008), with typical individual sales having a value of         ~&#163;100k" [A].
Kentech attribute the increased sales "to the         interest generated by [Imperial's] research and note that customers have         frequently asked for the technology `developed by the Imperial College         Group'."
[A].
The Imperial group's demonstration of the use of ultrafast supercontinuum       sources for FLIM and their subsequent development of new instrumentation,       particularly for FRET readouts of cellular signalling processes, "helped         stimulate significant world-wide demand for...supercontinuum products"       [B] and led to an increase in sales of ultrafast fibre laser-pumped       supercontinuum sources by Fianium Ltd, who had recently pioneered this       technology and launched the first commercial product.
Fianium Ltd, a fiber       laser company focused on the manufacture and development of ultrafast,       high power laser systems, estimate that "approximately half of more         than 600 supercontinuum devices that [Fianium] have delivered to date         are being used for fluorescence lifetime measurements and that this         follows directly from [Imperial's] pioneering research" [B].
The "devices         are currently priced between &#163;12,000 and &#163;80,000" and therefore         "this number of sales [approx.
&#163;3-25M in value] represents a significant         impact on the commercial development of [the] market" [B].
Fianium       further commented that Imperial's "application of their ultraviolet         ultrashort pulse sources .... to clinical imaging has stimulated         interest in FLIM for medical diagnosis" and that they "have sold         further systems to customers interested in following [Imperial's] work         in this area" [B].
Fianium currently market `fluorescence lifetime       measurements' as an application for three supercontinuum lasers series       (the Whitelase SC series, Whitelase UV and Whitelase Micro) and two       supercontinuum filter systems (SC-AOTF and SuperChrome) in their product       line [C, D].
The Imperial group undertook, and continues to run, a number of       collaborative research projects with industry exploiting FLIM including       [1, 2, 3, 4].
Information from these research projects, in particular with       Kentech and Fianium, has fed back into better device designs and       development of more compelling products.
Kentech testify that they have "benefitted         from working with [the Imperial] research group through [Imperial's]         feedback and suggestions, which have helped...to improve our products         and broaden the applications and markets into which our products are         sold.
[The]...impressive system integration talent build up in [the         Imperial] group has guided [Kentech] in the continuing development of         our control systems, further improving product performance" [A].
In addition to the translation of the technology into industrial       application that is detailed above, the FLIM research programme at       Imperial has resulted in knowledge transfer via delivery of skilled       technical staff into industry.
Four postdoctoral research staff and PhD       students within the group developed technical expertise enabling them to       acquire positions with companies including Intel (ultrafast silicon based       photonics), GEC Marconi and then Narragansett Imaging (business aspects of       imaging technology), Evotec and Genentech (technology development in drug       discovery), Powerlase Ltd and the technology development company The       Technology Partnership (TTP).
GE Healthcare, AstraZeneca, GSK and Kentech Instruments Ltd joined       Imperial in a DTI (TSB) Technology award (01/01/2006-31/10/2010) to       develop and evaluate a prototype FLIM multiwell plate reader.

It is too early to judge societal/health impact       but FLIM instruments based on GOI technology are currently being used for       biomedical research across the world (for instance [E, F]).
Kentech       confirm the biomedical use of time-gated FLIM in a letter &#8212; the Imperial       group's "work demonstrating the biological and medical applications of         time-gated FLIM &#8212; particularly [the] demonstration of rapid FLIM for         real-time endoscopy and live cell imaging &#8212; created significantly         increased demand in [Kentech's] HRI products across our international         market and we frequently had customers wanting to purchase HRI         technology so that they could do similar work."
