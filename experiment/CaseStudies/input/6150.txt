     a) SPENDINSIGHT     SpendInsight has had far-reaching and substantial impact on both society       and the economy.
The societal impact:            SpendInsight was used [1] to produce the data for a National Audit         Office (NAO) report [2] highlighting gross inefficiencies in NHS         procurement.
The NAO report was discussed by parliamentary committee [3], which         recommended changes in Government health policy.
SpendInsight technology was subsequently used to develop GreenInsight         &#8212; a system to measure an organisations carbon footprint, reveal which         suppliers and goods contribute most to this footprint, and to help         create an organisation's carbon reduction plan [4].
The economic impact:            SpendInsight has produced significant savings for a number of health         Trusts.
SpendInsight is listed on the Government's Procurement Service, a         service aiming to increase financial efficiency across the whole UK         Public Sector [7].
SpendInsight technology has been licenced by VISA inc. and Tungsten         Corporation resulting in an immediate 500% increase in the value of @UK         [10].
SpendInsight technology has been licensed to Tungsten Corporation         significantly contributing to their recent over-subscribed launch on AIM         of &#163;233million.
Following the project, @UK hired the three KTP associates as permanent         employees.
The 2011 investigation into the procurement of consumables by the NHS by       the National Audit Office revealed huge inefficiencies in NHS trusts'       procurement [2].
The task of a carrying out quantitative analysis of data       for this was undertaken by @UK PLC using SpendInsight [1].
The findings       were published in a 33-page NAO report in February 2011 [2] which       identified that:     "If hospital trusts were to amalgamate small, ad-hoc orders into         larger, less frequent ones, rationalise and standardise product choices         and strike committed volume deals across multiple trusts, they could         make overall savings of at least &#163;500 million, around         10 per cent of the total NHS consumables expenditure of &#163;4.6 billion."
This report was discussed by the House of Commons Committee of Public       Accounts in May 2011 [3] which concluded that the Department of Health       should require all NHS purchasers and suppliers to make use of a standard,       comprehensive product bar-coding system so that price comparisons can       easily be made and savings opportunities identified; purchasers must       ensure that product bar-coding is in place by April 2014.
The NAO report featured strongly in BBC news [8] and subsequently led to       an investigation into health procurement by the BBC radio programme File         On 4 [9], an investigation which focused on the political impact       of the report and concluded that &#8212; in contrast to Conservative party       manifesto policy (decentralising budget-holding and commissioning       responsibilities to GPs) &#8212; money could be saved "if only trusts could         get their act together".
SpendInsight has so far been used to perform spend analysis for 382       different organisations.
Although the data are normally confidential, a       number have publicly reported savings: these include the Basingstoke and       North Hampshire NHS Foundation Trust (&#163;300,000) [5] and the Royal       Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust (&#163;100,000) [6].
SpendInsight is listed on the Government's `Procurement Service'; an       agency of the Cabinet Office supporting procurement across the Public       Sector, aiming to increase operational and financial efficiency.
Thus       SpendInsight is available on a `national framework contract', making it       possible for Public Sector organisations to use the service very easily       [7].
The market capitalisation of @UK PLC increased substantially after it       announced that, together with Visa Inc., it was rolling out its CloudBuy       platform across Asia Pacific using SpendInsight technology to create `the       region's first business-to-business integrated e-marketplace solution'.
Another recent development of SpendInsight technology has seen Tungsten       Corporation sign a five-year license for the SpendInsight software; the       unique ability of this technology to analyse client spend data at the       `line item level' is central to their corporate vision.
On October 16th       2013 Tungsten floated on AIM, the largest floatation on AIM since 2008,       closing substantially over offer at &#163;233million [10].
b) GREENINSIGHT     In September 2011 the NHS announced that it would work with @UK PLC on a       project using @UK PLC.
's core SpendInsight technology, to develop       GreenInsight &#8212; a system to measure NHS carbon footprint, reveal which NHS       suppliers and goods contribute most to this footprint, and to create a NHS       carbon reduction plan.
GreenInsight's significance has been recognised among leading       organisations promoting sustainability.
Its official launch (on 7th       October 2010) was attended by Richard Benyon, Minister for the Natural       Environment and Fisheries, and included a presentation from a member of       Prince Charles's Accounting for Sustainability project..
When the       GreenInsight data-format, Green-XML, was subsequently launched on 15th       November 2011 there was a video message from the HRH Prince of Wales, an       introduction from the RSA's Chief Executive, and a presentation from the       CEO of the worldwide benchmark emissions reporting programme, the Carbon       Disclosure Project [10].
