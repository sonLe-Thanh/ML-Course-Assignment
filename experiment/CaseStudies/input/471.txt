     Research from the Unit has helped to "...create, within the space of just       a few years, an entirely new product in sports nutrition, one supported by       objective evidence and material that can be used for educational purposes"       as confirmed by the Operations Manager for QNT UK Ltd (letter sent 2nd       November 2012).
The Units research provides evidence that the impact of beta-alanine to       sporting/exercise performance ranges between 2 and 30%, depending upon the       individual, the event and the situation.
Consequently, beta-alanine       supplementation is now internationally recognised as a significant new       player in relation to the athlete's nutritional toolkit.
According to the       Physiology Lead, Canadian Sport Centre-Pacific it provides a healthy and       legal enhancement of athletic performance.
As such, further impact has       been enabled through influencing the awareness, practice and performance       of elite athletes worldwide, through the engagement of elite athletes and       key practitioners within our research.
For example, the Physiology Lead,       Canadian Sport Centre-Pacific (Source 2) goes on to state (in a letter       supplied 1st March 2013) that SHAPEs research has, "...substantially         progressed our understanding of the efficacy behind beta-alanine.....of         the nearly 300 athletes at the 2012 London [Olympics], I would estimate         that about 100 athletes have used beta-alanine at some point in         the preparations".
Similar evidence is provided by the former Head       of Performance Nutrition at the English Institute of Sport (Source 3) who       states (letter supplied 18th June 2013) that "The research         produced and published by this group of researchers was incorporated         into the training programme and strategies used by GB athletes in the         lead up to and during the most recent 2010 Commonwealth and 2012 Olympic         and Paralympic Games....."     The specific use of SHAPE research on beta-alanine to support UK based       athletes was explained by the current Head of Performance Nutrition at the       English Institute of Sport (Source 4), letter supplied to SHAPE, 27th       June 2013) who confirmed that the outcomes of the research from Ref 2 have       been used to support the use of beta-alanine in Rugby, Hockey and with the       England Cricket Team.
Similarly, the outcomes from Ref 6 have been used to       support the use of beta-alanine across a range of sports including GB       short track speed skating, canoe slalom and GB swimming and Ref 1 has       supported the use of beta-alanine in combination with sodium bicarbonate       with GB short track speed skating and synchronised swimming.
In addition to the use by Canadian and GB athletes, there is also       evidence of impact delivered in Australia and New Zealand.
Evidence for       this is supplied by the Head of Sports Nutrition at the Australian       Institute of Sport (Source 5) who confirms (letter dated 2nd       June 2013) that, "We have benefitted from the publications and         presentations that have been produced, as well as the generous insights         we have gained via direct communication with Dr Sale...Based on Dr         Sale's research, and work of our own, we have implemented protocols of         use of 03b2-alanine by AIS athletes.
We are also aware of its use by         many other sports programs that value evidence-based supplement uses."
Similarly, the Lead Performance Nutritionist, High Performance Sport New       Zealand (Source 3) states (letter dated 18th June 2013) that       our research has "....led to the development of effective nutritional         interventions to assist and support sports performance....beta alanine         supplementation is presently being used to support athletes in New         Zealand High Performance Sport system in training, and/or competition in         sports such as Athletics, Cycling, Rowing, Triathlon, Hockey, Rugby, and         selected winter sports at the elite level...."     The Units research has also led to significant impact in Rugby where the       Rugby Football Union of Wales (confirmed by a letter from the WRU National       Squad Nutritionist dated 30th October 2012) and the England       Woman's 7s team (confirmed by a letter from the Lead Performance       Nutritionist with the English Institute of Sport, 2nd May 2013)       have used it to develop beta-alanine strategies during key training       phases.
It has also informed the content of a pre-game formula used by       some premiership football clubs (confirmed by the Director of Pro Athlete       Supplementation Ltd in a letter dated 30th October 2012).
To       further develop impact, we disseminate findings directly to the athletes       and practitioners ahead of the outputs of our research findings, which can       often incur significant delay in publication time, as highlighted above.
For example, this has helped nutritionists and athletes to develop their       strategies, for the women's Rugby 7s World Cup in June 2013 and       preparation for the 15s World cup in 2014 (confirmed by a letter from the       Lead Performance Nutritionist with the English Institute of Sport, 2nd       May 2013).
It is evident through our research and that of our collaborators (some       informed by our work) that beta-alanine is a nutrient previously       overlooked.
The persistence of our research group has helped to establish       it as a worldwide sports nutrition product.
To confirm this, the United       States imported around 350,000 kg of beta-alanine annually in 2008, which       has dramatically increased to around 800,000 kg in 2010, 2012 and 2013 and       the global production of beta-alanine for use as a dietary supplement has       increased dramatically from 2008 (figures supplied by Natural Alternatives       International, San Marcos, California, US; July 2013).
One of the additional ways our research has helped to develop the use of       beta-alanine as a new dietary product is its use in marketing and       promotional material by those commercial companies selling the products.
As the Operations Manager for QNT UK Ltd states (letter dated 2nd       November 2012) "A good example of the synergy between academia and         industry.....has been the research carried out by Nottingham Trent         University on beta-alanine, and also the publication of leading review         articles on this topic by this group."
Further support for our role       in this comes from the Global Head of Performance Nutrition Research and       Development at Nestle (Source 1) who reports (letter dated 11th       July 2013), "Nestle currently markets beta-alanine products globally         under two different sub-brands, PowerBar and Musashi...In fact,         information from Craig's studies have been incorporated into some of our         communication materials used with sports nutrition practitioners."
Similarly, the Director of Pro Athlete Supplementation Ltd confirms that       (letter dated 30th October 2012) "Pro Athlete         Supplementation developed a pre-game formula that contains Beta Alanine         and has been widely used by premiership football clubs and international         rugby teams.
Helping to market this is a study from Nottingham Trent         University to be published by the International Journal of Sports         Nutrition later this year, which demonstrates its effectiveness in a         test designed to replicate football specific exercise capacity."
To summarise, the research undertaken within the Unit in relation to       beta-alanine supplementation has had very significant impact and reach and       provides an excellent example of the potential for synergy between       academia, industry and the end user.
As the Head of Sports Nutrition at       the Australian Institute of Sport confirms "...the research on         03b2-alanine supplementation performed by Dr Sale can be said to have         far-reaching international significance and impact."
