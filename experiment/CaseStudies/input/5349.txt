     Impacts include: health and welfare, public policy and services,       practitioners and services, commerce     Main beneficiaries include: practitioners, patients, British and American       Thoracic Societies, medical device industry     On the basis of research initiated at Imperial measurement of exhaled NO       has now become routine in clinical practice and is commonly used for the       diagnosis and management of asthma [1] and in clinical trials to assess       the effects of novel anti-inflammatory treatments in asthma [2].
International guidelines for the clinical use of exhaled NO by the       American Thoracic Society in 2011 recommend the use of exhaled NO as part       of clinical practice in asthma [3].
These guidelines specify that exhaled       NO be used to diagnose eosinophilic airway inflammation; to determine the       likelihood of responsiveness to corticosteroids in patients with chronic       respiratory symptoms due to airway inflammation; to diagnose asthma and to       monitor airway inflammation in asthma patients [3; page 603].
The 2012       British Thoracic Society guidelines on management of asthma also include       the use of exhaled NO as a non-invasive measure of eosinophil count in       children and corticosteroid response [4].
Clinical trials have demonstrated that measurement of exhaled NO to       monitor asthma control leads to reduction in exacerbations [5], although       this has not been confirmed in unselected patients [6].
Exhaled NO has       also been used to monitor and improve adherence with corticosteroid       therapy in patients with refractory asthma [7].
In the light of our research several analysers for measuring exhaled NO       were developed and marketed.
Professor Barnes was an advisor to one of the       companies called Aerocrine (Stockholm, Sweden) [7], which became the       market leader in this field with annual sales of &#163;15m/year.
As a key       advisor to Aerocrine Professor Barnes was closely involved in the       development of a hand-held NO analyser that is much easier to use in       clinical practice (NIOX-MINO).
This portable exhaled NO device was       approved by the FDA in 2008 and has sold over 6 million tests since then       [8].
Following our demonstration that nasal NO is very low in patients with       primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) [9], nasal NO is now recommended in the       2012 European guidelines for the screening for PCD [9].
