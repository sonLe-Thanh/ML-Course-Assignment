     As a result of the research outlined above, Sparke was invited to consult       on three major exhibitions       at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) in the period 2008 to 2012.
She drew upon this research       to contribute to the knowledge of staff in the Research Department of the       V&amp;A, and also       contributed essays to exhibition catalogues.
Researchers within MIRC went       on to deliver a public       symposium at the V&amp;A based upon the underpinning research.
In this       way, the research at       Kingston University led to the cultural enrichment of three areas of       V&amp;A activity: curation,       publication and education.
Curation     Sparke promoted a broader engagement with modern design and the modern       interior than had       informed earlier design V&amp;A exhibitions, which had largely centred on       histories of period and       style.
She contributed to the intellectual framing and content of the       three exhibitions.
The Cult of Beauty: The Aesthetic Movement 1860-1900 in         collaboration with the Fine Arts         Museums of San Francisco.
At the V&amp;A, London (2 April 2011 to 17         July 2011); the Mus&#233;e         D'Orsay, Paris as Beauty, Morals and Voluptuousness in the England           of Oscar Wilde (13         September 2011 to 15 January 2012); the de Young Museum, San Francisco         as The Cult           of Beauty: The Victorian Avant-Garde, 1860-1900 (18 February to 17         June 2012).
Exhibition attendance at the V&amp;A: 136,000.
Sparke's main contribution was to ensuring that the curatorial approach       included domestic       advice literature for amateur home decorators, emphasising its role in the       process of taste-making       and the shaping of late nineteenth century gendered identities.
Postmodernism: Style and Subversion, 1970-1990.
At the V&amp;A,         London (24 September         2011 to 15 January 2012); MART, the Museum of Modern and Contemporary         Art of Trento         and Rovereto, Trentino, Italy (25 February 2012 to 3 June 2012); the         Landesmuseum         Z&#252;rich (6 July 2012 to 28 October 2012).
Exhibition attendance at the         V&amp;A: 110,000.
Sparke's contribution is reflected in the curatorial approach to the work       of Ettore Sottsass       and his consumer-focused approach to the cultural meaning of design.
As a       result of       Sparke's engagement, the exhibition presented Sottsass as a key postmodern       designer.
British Design 1948-2012: Innovation in the Modern Age.
At the         V&amp;A, London (31 March         2012 to 12 August 2012); and touring dates (Shanghai Art Museum, Autumn         2012).
Exhibition attendance at the V&amp;A: 136,107     The exhibition was structured around the themes of: Tradition and       Modernity, Subversion,       Innovation and Creativity.
Sparke was responsible for the curatorial       emphasis on the role of       interior decoration and design, and the taste-making role of life-style       retailing.
This influence       was most notable in the section on Tradition and Modernity, which       prioritised the material       culture of the home and the role played by designers such as Terence       Conran in shaping       consumer lifestyles through the creation of innovative retail       environments.

Catalogue print run; 5,000 hardback, 8,000 paperback.
Sparke's essay introduced a section of the catalogue containing five       essays structured       around the V&amp;A's collections and organisational structure: wallpaper,       textiles, furniture,       ceramics, metalwork.
The essay linked to a section of the exhibition that       represented       domestic advice literature and provided a broad cultural framework within       which to consider       the material and object-based examinations that followed.

Catalogue print run: 11,000.
Sparke's essay in the above catalogue explored the clear hierarchies of       taste that allowed       `home-makers to aspire towards the style of the social group immediately       above them'; and       the socio-cultural consequences of expanded consumption and the       democratisation of       lifestyles constituted through the activities of progressive retailers       such as Terence Conran.
Education:     Spaces and Places: British Design 1948-2012 (11-12 May 2012) at       the Sackler Centre,       V&amp;A, London, the V&amp;A's centre for public learning, as part of the       British Design Season at       the V&amp;A.
Symposium attendance: 127.
Working with the Research and Education Departments, members of the MIRC       developed       and delivered a public symposium that extended the exhibition's reach.
The       structure and       content of the symposium were informed by the Centre's intellectual       framing and approach       to the study of the modern interior in both public and private contexts,       most recently       reflected in the introductory essays in Fisher et al.
(eds) 2011.
The V&amp;A Head of Research wrote of this event:     "The academic community at the university has proved invaluable in       developing a       discursive context around our exhibition programme, notably in the case of       the recent       exhibition British Design 1948-2012.
In addition to playing a key role in       the formation of       ideas at the project's early stage, Kingston's researchers helped to       convene a major       public conference on the topic which will result in a peer-reviewed       monograph.
This is       just one example of the way that our museum/university partnership       traverses the       realms of the scholarly and the populist, with great benefits to both       partners and to the       public."
