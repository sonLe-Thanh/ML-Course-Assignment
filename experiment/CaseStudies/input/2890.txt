Research outputs from the BSRBR study have refined the way anti-TNF       therapies are prescribed       in RA with a goal of maximising patient benefit and minimising patient       risk.
Pathways to impact have included:            Membership of UoM key researchers on national and international         rheumatoid arthritis         guideline working parties;       Submission of data to National Institute for Health and Clinical         Excellence (NICE) to support         technology appraisal;       Collaboration with national arthritis charities including Arthritis         Research UK and the National         Rheumatoid Arthritis Society.
Reach and significance of the impact            NICE guidance is the most important factor in determining which new         therapies can be         prescribed to patients in the UK.
If guidance does not exist for a new         technology or if guidance         does not allow a technology, funding is likely to be denied.
This study         has contributed to one         recent NICE technology appraisal (TA) and several previous appraisals         now superseded.
(a) Impact: Improved treatment outcomes for patients         By demonstrating the benefits of combining anti-TNF treatments with         continued background MTX         (unless contra-indicated) the study has contributed directly to NICE         TA195 (published 2010 and         still in effect in 2013).
The previous guidelines did not specify that         MTX treatment should be         continued (TA36).
However, we demonstrated that, year on year from         2001-8, the proportion of         patients continuing MTX with anti-TNF increased in the UK, with         subsequent improvements in         treatment responses (S1,S2).
(b) Impact: Improved access to controlled treatments for UK patients         By demonstrating the benefits of switching between anti-TNF agents when         a first has been         ineffective, the study contributed to NICE TA195.
This new guidance         allows sequential anti-TNF         use if rituximab is contraindicated &#8212; an approach that was not         previously allowed under NICE         guidance (TA36) (S1).
Output from the BSRBR has also contributed to new national         guidelines outlining eligibility         criteria for anti-TNF.
The study indicated that the drugs should no         longer be reserved for patients         with high disease activity, but should instead be used in all patients         with ongoing disease activity         resistant to standard treatments (S3).
This has improved choice and         access for patients within this         subgroup.
Our research into the risk of intracellular infections such as         listeria and salmonella has led to         new information being incorporated into Arthritis Research UK Drug         Information Leaflets (provided         to every patient in the UK considering anti-TNF therapies).
It has also         prompted the FDA to update         product labelling.
Specifically, the new information warns of the risk         of consuming undercooked or         unpasteurised foods, similar to the advice provided to pregnant women.
Our research has shown         that updating the Arthritis Research UK Drug Information Leaflets in         2006 led to a 73% decrease in         new cases of intracellular infection in RA patients exposed to anti-TNF         in the UK from 2007-12 (S4,         S5).
This leaflet remains in print today.
Our publications on outcomes among women exposed to anti-TNF         therapy during pregnancy         have contributed to a significant change in product labelling.
It is now         indicated that women can         continue anti-TNF therapies into pregnancy if clearly needed, as opposed         to previous labelling that         treatment should be discontinued in the months leading up to conception         (which often resulted in a         disease flare).
This is a major change within rheumatology, as other         non-biologic DMARDs are         contra-indicated in pregnancy, many with the risk of teratogenicity.
Our         research offers a safer         option for disease control in the months leading up to conception.
Our research data are contributing to the training of new doctors,         as well as to the maintenance         of certification among established physicians, with data featuring in         `Up-to-Date', an evidence-based         online guide for physicians on current best practice.
In particular, we         are the only group to         have published a differential risk of tuberculosis across anti-TNF         therapies, which may direct         choice of treatment in high-risk cases (S6).
Finally, the BSRBR is proving to be an invaluable resource for         patients and physicians across         the UK and internationally, for pharmaceutical companies who manufacture         the drugs and for         international drug regulators (e.g.
MHRA, FDA, EMA) (S7-S9).
With data         on over 20,000 patients         and &gt;80000 adverse events, it has become a vital and accessible         resource for up-to-date and         unpublished safety information.
Physicians can access information         directly from the investigators,         and pharmaceutical companies and regulators are provided with detailed         serious adverse event         information and publications to ensure effective risk management of         these new therapies.
The Director of Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines at the MHRA       states: `The greatest       regulatory impact of the BSRBR has been in helping to define the clinical       safety profile of biological       agents in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly over the       long term.
The unique scale of       the register provides the opportunity to study the risks of rare serious       safety concerns with unusual       precision.'
(S7)     The Chief Executive of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society       underlines the significance of the       BSRBR research for those living with RA: `This information has supported       our campaign for       widening access to anti-TNF therapies, especially in patients who do not       respond to their first       biologic.
The study has also been an invaluable source of information       about the safety of these       treatments.'
(S9)     The manufacturers of newer agents continue to approach UoM for       information on how to join this       important study, thereby ensuring the long-term observation of patients       starting new therapies for       arthritis.
