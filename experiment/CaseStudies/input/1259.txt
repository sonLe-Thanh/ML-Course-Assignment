     Shoemaker and Hitchcock actively promoted public engagement with the Old       Bailey Online through their work with the media, participation in TV and       radio programmes, and frequent public lectures.
In addition, in 2006 they       published a mass-market compilation of stories from the Proceedings,       Tales from the Hanging Court (Arnold, 2006).
The site has had substantial reach.
To date, it has received over five       million visits, 3 million of which occurred during the REF census period.
According to Google Analytics from 20 Oct 2010 to 31 July 2013 the site       had 1.4 million unique visitors.
In that period visitors came from 218       countries, with the top ten being the UK, US, Australia, Canada, New       Zealand, Germany, Ireland, France, India and Spain.
Visits average four       minutes and 41 seconds and users consulted an average of 6.68 pages, which       suggest that once single page visits are discounted (58%), a substantial       minority of users spend a considerable amount of time on the site; 33.5%       of users are returning visitors.
In addition to academic researchers, the primary beneficiaries of the       site are family and local historians, university students, and those       interested in the law.
A JISC funded `Impact Analysis' survey carried out       in the autumn of 2010 revealed that the most frequent uses of the site       were, in addition to academic research (39%), family history (36%),       university teaching (28%), and reading for personal learning/leisure (28%)       (users could tick more than one box) [S6].
The 7,156 registered users of       the Old Bailey/London Lives websites include members of 67       family history societies and a broad range of public bodies, public       history societies, schools, the media and government departments [S7].
Family historians have used the website to obtain a better understanding       of their ancestors' lives and living conditions.
As the magazine Discover         My Past England reported in October 2011, the site, in combination       with London Lives, `offers exciting and unprecedented         opportunities for family historians to really enrich their ancestors'         histories'.
This is confirmed by anecdotal evidence.
One user       reported that the Old Bailey account of the trial of her husband's great       great grandmother `gave us a greater picture of who she was.
Life for         her must have been hard...' Another Australian reported that       research on the website prompted a research trip to the UK to find out       more.
While some descendants have had to come to terms with evidence of       their ancestors' criminality, the story was happier for `Simon, from       London'.
In May 2008 he told the BBC that `using the Old Bailey site on         Monday was life-changing for my mother-in-law.
She asked me to look up         her grandfather who her grandmother had evicted for bigamy....
The         records show he was found not guilty.
It is a story I've heard for many         years and it is great to have a confirmed ending.'
Having discovered something about their ancestors, many users of the       website have been prompted to develop their historical curiosity and       contextualise their ancestors' lives by conducting further research into       the history of criminal justice and other topics, taking advantage of the       site's historical background pages and its structured search facilities.
One reported that he found the site `absolutely fascinating, not only         for the information I found about our forebears... but also for the         patterns one can see using the search facility', particularly       patterns of punishment for pickpockets.
In compiling a family history for       his children and grandchildren he decided to broaden the story of his six       convict ancestors by writing a chapter on the phenomenon of transportation       to Australia [S1].
Another, whose great-great-grandfather participated in       John Otley's 1817-18 convict-based expeditions into the Australian       outback, used the website for his published book on the expedition and       effusively acknowledged it as one of his most important sources [S8]In a       letter to the HRI, one user reported that she `found that the         excellent search engine offered the ability to use the material in many         different ways which have nothing to do with the justice system... they         have made a significant contribution to a study I am making of         wheelwrights and coachbuilders in London from around 1780 to 1820'       [S2].
The website has inspired highly successful TV and radio programmes,       thereby reaching an even wider number and range of beneficiaries and       enriching audiences' understandings of the evolution of the criminal trial       and social practices.
According to its creator (Tony Marchant), the site       `inspired' the Royal Television Society Award-winning BBC1 TV series       `Garrow's Law', which ran three series between 2009 and 2011.
Marchant has       acknowledged that the programmes `could not have been written' without the       Old Bailey website [S3].
The major theme of the series, the impact of the       advent of lawyers on the development of the criminal trial, is covered in       Shoemaker's historical background page on `Trial Procedures'.
Historical       notes for each episode posted on the BBC website heavily referenced the       Old Bailey Online.
The first two seasons of Garrow's Law attracted over 20       million viewers, with a satisfaction level for the first series of 80/100.
Positive reviews the programme received suggest that the programme       prompted viewer reflection on its themes; as John Crace wrote in the Guardian       on 14/11/11, `it made me think'.
The website featured even more prominently in the BBC Radio 4 show       `Voices from the Old Bailey', which ran two series of four episodes each       in 2010 and 2011.
Shoemaker participated in planning the programme and the       selection of trials included and was one of the speakers in two       programmes, where he discussed, on the basis of his research, highway       robbery and the case of the murderess Sarah Malcolm.
Each programme       reached almost two million listeners.
It was the fourth most popular       programme on Radio 4 in 2010; in 2011 during the time it was live it was       the third most popular series on the iPlayer.
It was positively reviewed       and achieved high levels of appreciation (88/100 for one episode) [S4].
Its impact on listeners can also be seen in the fact that each programme       caused a spike in website usage as listeners followed up the cases       discussed.
The site is widely used in university teaching.
Educational domains       account for 17.7% of the first 1000 most accessed internet links to the       site.
As of August 2013, registered users (registration is voluntary) come       from 284 universities from twenty-three countries.
Students have deepened       their knowledge of British social history and have refined their skills in       primary source analysis and the practice of historical research.
The       `Impact Analysis Report' noted that students had benefitted from the       opportunity not only to learn about historical content, but also to       develop core skills, and many use it as the principal primary source for       their dissertations.
Students in focus groups reported that the site `had         been their first real opportunity to engage with a substantial set of         primary sources that had not been pre-selected by a teacher.
This was         something they found exciting and stimulating because it allowed them to         find and interpret material for themselves' [S6].
An Associate       Professor of Theatre and Costume Studies at Dalhousie University reports       that she set her group of 19 students a material culture project using the       website and the `things they came up with and the links they made are         fantastic... every student became completely engaged in the project, and         totally involved in the research' [S5].
The site has also had an impact on the public attitudes towards       contemporary legal practice.
The original purpose of the Proceedings,       as highlighted in Shoemaker's research, of making judicial proceedings       publicly available in order to enhance public confidence in the law, has       been noted by some commentators.
On 29 April 2008 the Guardian ran       an editorial `In praise of... the Old Bailey', noted that `at         oldbaileyonline.org the [court's] records are accessible, free and fully         searchable... in stark contrast' to the proceedings of the modern       criminal courts, where access is severely restricted.
In September 2008       Jack Straw, then Home Secretary, acknowledging the importance of `lifting       the veil which sometimes keeps justice from view', announced the abolition       of the fees which newspapers had to pay for court lists, and said he would       `open up the justice system through the power of the internet, with         online court records'; a BBC reporter suggested the decision to       abolish fees was inspired by the Old Bailey Online [S10].
In 2010, an Old       Bailey judge invited Shoemaker to speak to barristers, clerks and judges       about the online Proceedings, to further his goal of improving the       modern Old Bailey's presence online and increasing public understanding of       the court's activities.
Hitchcock and Shoemaker were awarded the 2010 Longman/History Today       Trustees Award for a `person, persons or organisation that has made a       major contribution to history over the past year or years' for the `ground       breaking' Old Bailey and London Lives projects and their `unparalleled       impact on the way that history can be researched, taught in universities       and enjoyed by the general public'       [http://www.historytoday.com/paul-lay/longman-history-today-awards-2010].
The website featured in the report, `The Impact of AHRC Research 2011/12',       which quoted David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science as       saying it `provide[s] a valuable resource', not only to academics and       researchers, but also as `source material for creative industries' [S9].
