     The purpose of the research was to inform the debate on the localisation       of food supply and specifically to challenge the notion that localisation       would reduce the environmental burden of food supply.
It had previously       been believed that large-scale food networks were creating market failure       in the form of negative environmental externalities.
Defra was considering       making market or policy interventions to correct the perceived market       failure represented by the food miles debate that would positively promote       local food production.
Before it did this, it required evidence to ensure       this was indeed the right course of action.
The research undertaken within       the UoA clearly demonstrated that the greater "food miles" attributed to       nationally- or internationally-sourced products in comparison to local       food products did not correlate with negative environmental externalities.
Impact on formation of public policy     The impact of this research was the formulation of evidence-based public       policy, aligned to delivering appropriate benefits from any intervention       in local food supply chains.
The research eschewed misconceptions about       "food miles", demonstrating that suspected market failure in large-scale       food networks did not necessarily exist, and that policy intervention to       promote more localised food supply was thus not required.
The influence of       the research can be evidenced in the development of Defra's Food 2030       strategy, the UK's first food strategy in 50 years.
The Economic Advisor       at Defra, recognises Northumbria's role in establishing the position taken       in the strategy not to promote local food systems as solution to the       challenge of reducing the environmental cost of food: "Whilst previous         work had been done by Defra to challenge some of these claims, the         Northumbria project was the first to look directly at the logistics of         domestic local supply chains and highlight the fallacies of the food         miles argument in a domestic context...Based on empirical research and         the expertise of economists, food industry and logistics experts, it         sent a clear message to Defra that the economic and environmental case         for Government intervention in this area was very weak.
The Brown         Government's "Food 2030 Strategy" published in January 2010 did not seek         to promote local food systems as a solution to the more fundamental         challenges of carbon emissions, waste, resource efficiency, poor diet         and food chain resilience.
Indeed the Strategy highlighted the flaws in         the food miles argument (pp.
47), drawing upon this and other research"       (Source 1).
Contribution to the development of international carbon labelling         policy     Our work informed the development of international carbon labelling       policy and recommended mandatory policy interventions, whereby switching       from softer voluntary policies to a system which encourages uptake through       mandatory measures amongst food supply chain actors is necessary to ensure       a widespread and simultaneous uptake.
This has led to a common position       where producers' claims of carbon consumption is commonplace, irrespective       of price or channel, giving the customer more opportunities to       differentiate meaningful carbon footprints within the same product       categories.
This work was selected by a European Commission Policy Unit       and added to their case study bank at Case Study 10 within "Science for       Environmental Policy" (Source 5).
Impact on practitioners and professional services     We expunged the food miles myth so that sensible operational choices       could be made; the research reveals the joint positive relationship       between economic and environmental efficiency: lean is green.
Indeed,       these arguments could be taken further to suggest that environmental       efficiency could be achieved wherever economies of scale are available in       food production, processing, manufacture, preparation, consumption and       disposal (Sources 2 and 7).
In accepting that the food miles debate is based on over-simplification,       we acknowledge that there will always be a local food agenda, and that its       benefits may extend beyond economic or financial advantage to the       producer, into areas such as skills, employment and reconnection with       farming by the general public.
Nevertheless, we also identify that       intermediary organisations/businesses hold a key role for a more resource       efficient collection and distribution transport system, for the onwards       sale of local foods to reach a broader customer base, while allowing the       smaller producer to manage with only one point of contact for sale,       invoicing and shorter cash-to-cash cycles for their products.
It is also noted that the research has migrated in to other areas of       Defra research that acknowledges and reaffirms our findings.
Research       project FO0430: Evidence to define the sustainability of a healthy         diet.
This study also confirmed that evidence to support the role of       farmers' markets towards the sustainability of a healthy diet is "weak"       (Source 3).
