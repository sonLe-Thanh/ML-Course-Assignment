     The two specific areas of underpinning research by King's College London       (KCL) outlined above have enabled clinicians and researchers to gain a       greater understanding of patients' illness and treatment perceptions and       their effects on a wide range of illness-related behaviours and health       outcomes.
This, in turn, has resulted in the development of psychological       interventions, which have been found to be effective not only in modifying       dysfunctional illness beliefs and improving recovery, quality of life and       mood, but also in improving treatment adherence by changing negative       illness and treatment beliefs.
Commercial Application     The success of the work described above has been recognised by Atlantis       Healthcare, a leading worldwide commercial provider of patient adherence       and support programmes with offices in Europe, Australasia and the United       States (1).
Atlantis Healthcare works closely with a number of leading       pharmaceutical companies and with public health organisations to provide       effective interventions for patients to manage their illness and       treatment.
They employ a large team of health psychologists worldwide and       involve Prof Weinman in a consultancy role and as Head of the European       Health Psychology team (2, 3).
Much of Atlantis Healthcare's approach is       based on the underpinning research and the assessments and interventions       described above.
Their interventions are tailored to elicit and, if       necessary, modify patients' illness and treatment beliefs, both of which       are routinely assessed using the measures developed at KCL.
Atlantis Healthcare has delivered over 80 programmes across 51 disease       states including: Alzheimer's disease, asthma, breast cancer, diabetes,       erectile dysfunction, glaucoma, gout, growth hormone deficiency,       haemophilia, hearing loss, hepatitis C, incontinence, lung cancer,       osteoporosis, pain, rheumatoid arthritis and wet AMD, among others, as       well as programmes to support health screenings and blood donor       management.
The evidence base on their website lists a large number of       published studies by KCL and collaborators (including Weinman 1996, Cooper       1999, Horne 1999, and Freeman 2012), which have shown not only that       patients' illness beliefs, as measured by the IPQ, consistently predict an       important range of clinical and psychosocial outcomes of illness but also       that interventions based on these findings have successfully improved many       of these outcomes (3).
In a letter of professional support, the Managing Director of Atlantic       Healthcare UK, says that:     "as an acknowledged global market leader in the provision of patient         adherence support programmes, our distinctiveness and acclaimed success         is highly dependent on the fact that our approach is very much based on         the rigorous and proven approaches, which have been pioneered by         Professor Weinman and his colleagues at Kings College London over the         past 15 years."
He discusses how they are currently running 12 programmes for patients       with a wide range of long term health problems, saying that:     "the core clinical basis of these programmes and communications         approach are based on Prof Weinman's highly influential research on         assessing and modifying patients' beliefs about illness and treatment."
Atlantis Healthcare's Managing Director also details how their `One       Heart' programme, funded by Astra Zeneca and running in three countries,       is based on:     "the findings from (KCL) research on evaluating and improving illness         beliefs in patients following myocardial infarction."
Here he cites Cooper 1999 and 2007 along with a number of collaborative       studies with Auckland Medical School (4).
In Addition, the Managing Director says that KCL's:     "research on the role of illness perception in the outcome of major         inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (citing Graves       2009) and psoriasis (citing O'Leary 2004), has enabled us to         develop global patient adherence support programmes in collaboration         with AbbVie and Leo Laboratories, which are being offered to patients in         many countries around the world" (4).
Atlantis Healthcare's Rheumatology Care Patient Workbook for AbbVie,       which included KCL work, won a 2013 Communique Award for Writing       Excellence with judges commenting that "We selected this as a winner         because it successfully combined the behavioural factors, which         underpinned the programme, with clear and engaging writing that would be         very appealing to patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
It is genuinely         savvy, making very good use of psychology and behaviour change theory"       (5).
Similarly, in another letter of support the CEO of Atlantis Healthcare       says that:     "we quickly recognised that the research by Professor Weinman and his         colleagues at King's College London could provide the basis for the         development of our own global programmes."
She cites Weinman 1996 and Horne 1999 as being particularly influential       and goes on to say that: "of particular value for our programmes is         that Professor Weinman's approaches allow us to assess each patient's         beliefs and motivation in an individualised way, and then to offer         tailored interventions based on this understanding."
The CEO of Atlantis Healthcare also corroborated that:     "the really impressive results obtained by Professor Weinman and         colleagues in developing successful interventions for patients across a         wide range of serious health problems, including end stage renal disease         and cardiac disease (citing Cooper 2007) have provided us with         the evidence base and the confidence to build our own programmes, which         we now offer to close to a million patients in 15 countries.
In this         way, his research is achieving considerable impact in the lives of many         patients around the world" (6).
Illness Perception Questionnaire Website     The questionnaires developed by KCL and colleagues have been translated       into over 20 languages and modified for a number of different diseases.
For instance, the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) has been       translated into French, Italian, Norwegian, Romanian, Samoan, Tongan and       Sri Lankan and adapted for specific use in those with diabetes, chronic       fatigue syndrome, hypertension and HIV.
Working with colleagues at the       Auckland Medical School, New Zealand, there is now a revised IPQ (IPQ-R)       and a brief version.
All these versions are available on an open access       website, which has attracted over 100,000 hits from researchers from all       around the world.
The website includes the key papers, describing the       development and application of the different versions of the IPQ,       including Weinman 1996 (7).
Findings from KCL studies have provided the basis for effective new       interventions for patients and carers.
For example, following from Horne       and Weinman's 2002 study identifying the key beliefs underlying patients'       levels of adherence to preventer medication in patients with asthma, an       innovative text messaging intervention was developed with colleagues at       the Auckland Medical School to change patients' illness and treatment       beliefs.
The intervention has been evaluated in a recently published       randomised controlled trial involving 216 patients aged between 16 and 45.
Two texts were sent daily for 6 weeks, one text daily for another 6 weeks,       then three texts per week for a further 6 weeks.
The type of texts sent       was determined by the participant's baseline scores on a modified version       of the IPQ and the level of medication belief ratings.
Results showed that       text messaging was not only successful in bringing about changes in       patients' beliefs but that this resulted in a significant uplift in       reported treatment adherence, maintained 6 months after the intervention       had stopped (8).
