Context       Suicide is amongst the top 20 leading causes of death globally for all       ages.
Every year, nearly one million people die from suicide.
Innovative       approaches have been sought to reduce suicide rates and the provision of       training for health and social care professionals and frontline workers       has been a key component of national suicide prevention strategies.
In       designing STORM, our group at UoM built on extensive experience in the       development and delivery of skills training in mental health and primary       care settings.
Pathways to impact       Following publication in peer-reviewed journals and recommendation of       STORM training in national guidance in 2004 (`The training has been         shown to improve risk management skills in a range of staff from health         care and other agencies', p. 33) (S1), requests were received from       health and social care organisations for dissemination of the training       reported in research publications.
Initially training was supported by       pump-priming funding from NHS North-West to employ one of the original       trainers.
With further public endorsement (`Training in the assessment         and management of suicide risk can be delivered to 90% of targeted         mental health professionals.
The training package can improve confidence         and attitudes and is well accepted', p.37) (S2), dissemination       became self- funding through a network of `consultant facilitators'.
The       STORM team also worked with UMIP to create the relevant IP, (background       IP, copyright, Registered Trade Mark).
As a result of these steps to       impact, STORM training is now recommended by UK Government agencies and       the Royal College of Psychiatrists (S3-S5).
Reach and significance of the impact     Scope of the STORM project            STORM uses a cascade model in which training is provided within a         licensed organisation by staff trained as STORM facilitators who are         supported and supervised by 15 specially-trained and experienced         `consultant' trainers.
STORM became an independent social enterprise in 2012 and currently         employs two full-time staff.
The STORM team has continued to research the impact and dissemination         of STORM training, through re-investment of profit (now in excess of &#163;1         million).
STORM has also developed and evaluated training models and materials         for different settings, including criminal justice and younger persons'         services.
UK and international reach            160 licence agreements have been now been completed with health and         social care organisations.
Through the cascade model, an estimated 230,000           frontline workers have been trained by the 580 STORM Facilitators         across the UK, Channel Islands, Republic of Ireland, Malta and         Australia.
This figure represents a conservative estimate and is based         on the average number of frontline staff employed by STORM's main         customers (NHS Trusts) and the number of STORM licence agreements and         contracts in place.
If each trained person has mitigated risk of suicide         in only 2 people, this will have resulted in an impact on 460,000           people at risk of suicide and over 2.5 million people within their           social networks.
STORM is included in Scotland's Choose Life initiative to         train 50% of frontline staff in suicide prevention nationally.
Training on a non-profit basis has been provided internationally,         including training general practitioners in Northern Russia in         collaboration with the government of Norway, and mental health workers         in Pakistan (S6), where STORM training has been effective in         de-stigmatising suicidal behaviour and developing confidence in         exploring hopelessness and suicidal risk.
A 2013 collaboration with the University of Melbourne has researched         the impact of STORM gatekeeper training in secondary schools across         Australia as part of the Headspace suicide prevention and postvention         initiative.
Headspace is Australia's National Youth Mental Health         Foundation and Headspace School Support has a specific brief to support         Australian secondary schools around suicide prevention and postvention         (support for impact of suicide on the bereaved).
The STORM collaboration         played a central role in its rollout.
This unique collaboration led to a         number of outcomes, including the development, implementation and         evaluation of specifically-designed and evidence-based training         programme.
This programme will be delivered to school staff throughout         Australia to assist in their management and support of students at risk         (S7).
STORM CIC forecasts a profit of &#163;1m over the next 5 years which will         be reinvested in the community by funding further research, development         and dissemination.
Significance of STORM            STORM was a Level 2 UnLtd `Dare to be Different' winner in 2010.
STORM         also won a HEFCE and UnLtd HE Social Entrepreneurship Champions of         Change Recognition Award for its `Outstanding Social Impact' in 2011.
STORM training: enables frontline health and social care staff to         acquire the talking skills needed to communicate with people who are at         risk of harming themselves; it promotes a more positive approach to         suicide prevention; and, it provides participants with the skills to         assess and mitigate risk.
Organisations report positive and specific benefits on attitudes,         skills and confidence in relation to suicide prevention.
The Ballyfermot         Advance Project in Dublin reports that: `Fear of working with someone           who may be suicidal has been replaced with a sense of security because           there is now a clear process through which people can work' (S8).
Plymouth Community Healthcare comments that: `STORM has had a           positive impact in the organisation in relation to our practitioners'           approach to suicide ideation, individuals who have survived an attempt           and also post completed suicide for both families, providing better           understanding of suicide and effects, confidence in managing           situations that are very difficult.
The skills learnt have been           transferred to other areas of practice where communication is an           essential skill' (S9).
Some organizations have made training mandatory for staff.
The impact of STORM training reaches beyond its intended goal as a         training programme.
The key task and skills have been incorporated         formally into treatment pathways, record keeping and the development of         local risk assessment tools (S8-S10).
