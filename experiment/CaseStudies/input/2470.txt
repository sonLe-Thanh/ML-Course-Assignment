     The UoE research indicating that fish can feel pain stimulated public       debate about sport angling and fishing for food, and contributed to       changes in animal welfare policies affecting research animals and farmed       fish.
Impact on society, culture and creativity: public debate     The research was widely reported at the time of publication in 2003 (e.g.
BBC:       http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm.
Braithwaite subsequently (2010) published a book based on this research: `Do           Fish Feel Pain?'
[a], to positive reviews by both the       scientific and lay press.
`An accessible and compelling account...her book will make an         important contribution to the debate.'
- Anne Magurran, Times       Literary Supplement     It is available in hardback and e-book format.
Over 2,500 copies have       been sold worldwide during the REF impact census period.
The publication of Braithwaite's book gave rise to press attention and       debate world-wide.
Peter Singer, Professor of Bioethics at Princeton       University, wrote the article `If fish could scream' which was       published by public debate forum Project Syndicate [b].
This was       reproduced globally in news media including the Guardian newspaper (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-         green/2010/sep/14/fish-forgotten-victims) and translated into at       least nine languages including Chinese and Russian.
Numerous other       articles appeared in local and national press including an article       published on the `care2make a difference' website in Jan 2013 [c] which       had 1,777,951 unique visitors, 1828 of whom shared it on Facebook and it       attracted 699 comments.
Other media interest included articles in       international media and publications such as Daily India (e.g.
http://www.dailyindia.com/show/412730.php),       the online arm of the Philadelphia Enquirer in the USA (http://articles.philly.com/2011-11-07/news/30369892_1_fish-species-brains),       and a feature on Discovery news which was widely reproduced elsewhere [d].
Animal rights and welfare organisations have widely quoted the research       to support their campaigns.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals       (PETA) is the largest animal rights organisation in the world, with more       than 3 million members and supporters.
They quote the UoE research and       Braithwaite's book in their campaigns aimed at the general public and to       lobby angling communities world-wide on the ethics of fishing [e].
For       example they flew an aeroplane banner entitled `Fish feel pain - hooks       hurt' over the Milwaukee Brew City Salmon Tournament in 2010, campaigned       in Virginia in 2011, in Seattle (one of the biggest fishing cities in the       USA) in 2011 and in Pensacola in 2012.
Fishcount is a UK-based website       which aims to increase understanding of fish sentience, raise awareness       and promote solutions to the suffering of fishes in commercial fishing and       also aims to increase awareness of the welfare issues in fish farming.
They refer to the UoE research and Braithwaite's book, throughout their       website and publications [f].
Impact on public policy debate, changes to guidelines, and animal         welfare     (i) Animals used in scientific procedures     A 2006 review by the UK Government Animal Procedures Committee (APC) of       Schedule 1 of the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 noted that       there was a need for further consideration of techniques for the humane       killing of fish, arising from new understanding on fish pain and welfare [http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0708/hc00/0041/0041.pdf].
The Housing and Husbandry subcommittee was tasked by APC to provide a       supplementary report on the humane killing of fish.
Braithwaite and       Sneddon contributed expert advice based on their research papers [1,2,3]       that helped inform the APC Supplementary Review of Schedule 1 of the         `Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986: Appropriate methods of humane         killing for fish' published in June 2009 [g, h].
This report also       references paper [4].
Advice from this supplementary Review was submitted to the Home Secretary       and contributed to guidance for the revised Schedule 1.
It is the       understanding of the Review Chair that these recommendations were also       submitted onward to the European Commission.
The European Directive       2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes was       adopted on 22 September 2010 and was transposed to UK legislation, and       included directives for humane killing of fish.
The revised Schedule 1 of       the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 came into effect on 1st       January 2013.
(ii) Farmed fish     In 2008 the EU commissioned the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to       deliver a Scientific Opinion on welfare aspects of farmed fish [i].
This       Scientific Opinion was developed by EFSA's Animal Health and Welfare       (AHAW) panel and was adopted by EFSA on 29 January 2009.
The report       extensively referenced the two 2003 papers [1, 2] in the discussion of       fish pain (Section 5) and concluded that `the balance of the evidence       indicates that some fish species have the capacity to experience pain' and       that `responses of fish, of some species and under certain situations,       suggest that they are able to experience fear'.
Aquaculture is the fastest growing form of farming with large facilities       producing an estimated 6,400-110,000 million fish per year globally.
Atlantic salmon is the most commonly farmed species in the UK, with       approximately 70 companies producing over 140,000 tonnes of farmed salmon       each year (RSPCA figures).
90% of this occurs in Scotland and it is       Scotland's largest export.
The UK RSPCA published Welfare Standards for       farmed Atlantic salmon in October 2012 (http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232731074670&amp;         mode=prd).
These state that `scientific evidence from behavioural,       physiological and anatomical studies shows that it is highly likely that       fish feel pain.
It is essential that staff managing farmed fish are aware       of the importance of welfare as an integral part of production'.
Over 60%       of Scottish farmed salmon producers have `Freedom Food' (the RSPCA's farm       assurance and food labelling scheme) accreditation and this is increasing.
One Scottish salmon farm manager quoted by the Freedom Food documentation       confirms the importance of the understanding that fish feel pain to this       approach to farming:     "Some people don't associate fish with pain and stress.
But they feel         both, just like other sentient beings and it's really important to me         and all who work for me, that we rear them to high welfare standards."
[j]     In December 2012, over 100 million salmon were farmed in accordance with       the RSPCA's Freedom Food welfare guidelines.
This improvement in fish       welfare originated in the 2003 UoE publication which contained the first       widely-reported demonstration that fish feel pain.
