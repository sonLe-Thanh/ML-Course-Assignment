     The main impact of the case trajectories research since 2008 has been on       the Criminal       Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007, most of which came into       effect in 2008, and the       Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, implemented in       2010 and 2011.
The influence       of the research is best described chronologically.
The evaluation of the fiscal fine as means of diverting cases from the       criminal courts to shorten       `case trajectories' and reduce court workloads showed that this system       worked well (pub 1).
This       study was drawn on extensively when the fiscal fine system was expanded in       1996 by increasing it       from &#163;25 to a maximum of &#163;100 by legislation in 1996.
The Summary         Justice Review Committee,       of which Duff was a member, returned to this topic in 2002-2004,and as       result of Duff's earlier       comparative research on prosecutor fines (pub 4), visited the       Netherlands (paras 1.13, 11.20) to       see how the more ambitious Dutch "transaction" worked.
The Committee       recommended a further       increase in the maximum fiscal fine (to &#163;500) and suggested that, as in       the Netherlands, courts       should be made aware of previous fiscal fines offered to the accused.
It       also recommended that       the system should be changed from one of "opt in" to "opt out" (ie the       fiscal fine is deemed to have       been accepted unless the recipient expressly refuses it), mainly because       of the findings in the       Aberdeen research (pub 1) that a significant proportion of court       workloads involved unanswered       offers of fiscal fines where the recipient had no intention of disputing       guilt (paras 7.
37-38 and       footnote 29).
On March 10th 2008, the Criminal       Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007, s 50       (amending s 302 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995) implemented       these changes.
According to the Crown Office figures, the number of cases disposed of by       fiscal fine immediately       increased from 18,922 in 2007-8 to 36,903 in 2008-9 and reached 41,196 by       2011-12.
The       number of cases going to court dropped from 127,418 in 2007-8 to 118,867       in 2008-9 and to       101,606 by 2011-12, Thus, the reforms to the prosecutor fine in 2008, in       which the work carried out       at Aberdeen was influential, have had a major impact on the trajectories       of criminal cases.
Aberdeen scholars' research on adjournments and pre-trial hearings       confirmed the need to secure       early disclosure of evidence by the prosecution to the defence as means of       shortening "case       trajectories" (pubs 2,3).
The Privy Council's "revolutionary"       decision in Holland and Sinclair (see       above) meant that there was an urgent need to create a new       disclosure regime in Scotland which       would be compliant with the ECHR.
The Government saw this as an       opportunity also to encourage       prompt disclosure, both to encourage early guilty pleas and reduce       pre-trial adjournments as a       result of late disclosure by the prosecution.
A new statutory regime was       set out in 2009 in the       Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill.
As a result of Duff's       publications on disclosure and       criminal justice, he was appointed as adviser to the Scottish Parliament's       Justice Committee at       Stage 1 of the Bill.
The task involved the analysis of written evidence       submitted to the Committee,       advising MSPs what questions to ask of witnesses who gave oral evidence       before the Committee       and attending such sessions to advise the MSPs.
The Justice Committee's       Stage 1 Report on the       Bill was published on 12th November 2009 (Scottish       Parliament Paper 334).
Ultimately, Part 6 of       the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 implemented       the new disclosure scheme       which is now in force and has led to changes in prosecution practice (see       COPFS Disclosure       Manual 9th edition, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service,       June 2011).
As a result of Duff's research and publications, he was asked to join a       research team to evaluate       the new statutory disclosure regime's effect on "case trajectories".
The       project was led by the       Scottish Centre for Social Research and won the competitive tender to       secure the Scottish       Government funding.
The report was published in 2012 (Bradshaw,       Sharp, Duff, Tata, Barry,       Munro &amp; McCrone &#8212; only Duff is at Aberdeen) Evaluation of the         Reforms to Legal Aid and         Disclosure, 2012: Scottish Government Social Research: ISBN       978-1-78045-897-7) (&#163;119,473       funding).
It found that, as a result of increased disclosure, there was an       increase in the proportion       of accused pleading guilty at an early stage.
There was some evidence that       the extent, quality and       speed of disclosure varied across different police forces and prosecution       offices.
Delays in the       disclosure of CCTV evidence, forensic reports and full witness statements       were commonplace.
These findings will inevitably result in further adjustments by the police       and Crown Office to       increase the efficiency of the new regime.
Duff's published research on disclosure in both practitioner (SLT &#8212; see       above) and academic       journals (pub 6) also led to him being invited to conduct various       training sessions for sheriffs and       High Court judges, around 20 attending each session, on the new provisions       at the request of the       Judicial Studies Committee, which is responsible for judicial training in       Scotland (6th Oct 2009, 24th       Nov 2009, 1st Feb 2010, and 31st May       2010).
He has also given training to various groups of       lawyers on the 2010 Act as part of their regular CPD training.
