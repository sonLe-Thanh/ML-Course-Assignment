     Local, national and global LGBTIQ Social Justice impact derives from our       UoA's research; it manifests itself in the creation of the Queering         Paradigms (QP) network and its subsequent impact through       conferences, publications and activism.
The establishment of the network is underpinned by the research insights       and arguments of (ref.
i-iii) in relation to Anglican theological LGBT       inclusiveness and, more generally by Scherer's research (ref.
iv-vi),       demonstrating the possibility for LGBT Human Rights advancements within       religious contexts.
The QP network is an on-going research and activism       project that started in 2008 in response to debates over Civil Partnership       ceremonies at the University's licensed wedding venue.
The crucial aspect       of the QP network is its commitment to linking queer insights to specific       political struggles (A, B).
The QP network through Scherer's activism at CCCU has contributed to       progressive LGBTIQ related policies and practices which has inspired more       progressive policies at other HEIs in the UK and US (C).
Global impact has been achieved through the organisation of three further       international QP conferences, all mentored and co-organised by Scherer       (Brisbane 2010; New York 2011; and Rio de Janeiro 2012; and one regionally       affiliated event in Quito 2012).
The QP network has demonstrated a       sustained and ongoing engagement with a group of scholars and activists       that has led to a significant increase in participation in the QP       conferences, from 30 participants at the first QP conference held in       Canterbury in 2008 to 500 registered participants in Rio de Janeiro in       2012.
The QP conferences are explicitly open to the general public and in       particular welcome the presence of local activists and artists, and       organisers actively engage with media (interviews, social media such       Facebook and Twitter).
Importantly, the network is committed to including       perspectives from outside the `Global North'.
QP research outputs present challenging and innovative developments of queering       from across a variety of academic disciplines and political spheres and       move from Queer Theory to Applied Queer Studies (ref.
vi), As one reviewer       puts it, QP is "... not only saying, but doing language, in order to give       queers around the globe voices of their own."
(D).
An example of       the impact of QP in changing awareness, underpinned by (ref.
vi), is       demonstrated by the direct challenge to complacent homonormativities &#8212;       LGBT assimilationist tendencies.
In Germany, Scherer published a       provocative QP essay on Queer in the mainstream Gay magazine M&#228;nner       (issue January 2012).
It received within 3 days 73 comments from gay men,       many of them assimilationists and hostile to the queer project (E);       the ensuing discussions clearly evidence awareness change and challenge to       established patterns of thought (F).
The main beneficiaries of Scherer's QP activities are global and local       LGBTIQ communities.
Since the beginning of the impact period Scherer has       been invited worldwide to give over 30 public lectures in different forums       on gender and sexuality.
The QP project has led to changes in societal awareness and contributed       to policy debates.
It has also had an impact on policy making by informing       and influencing policy debate on the nature of sexual discrimination.
For       example, the former Australian High Court Judge Michael Kirby, an       influential public voice on social justice, noted in his keynote address       at the second QP conference in Brisbane, Australia, the importance of       policy changes to ensure full equality of citizenship.
He pointed out that       despite abolishing laws from Australia's colonial past, it still had some       way to go, stressing that `Legislation that does not allow gay marriage is       unacceptable'.
The comments were reported in the Australian national and       local media, including the Brisbane Times and ABC (Brisbane) and The       Australian and The Age (national).
(A) Scherer consciously chose       to develop the QP conference series on different continents so that       participants can be exposed to and impact on new contexts and cultural       conditions.
Importantly, every conference is organized by local academics       and activists, leading to a sense of local ownership without an imposed       agenda.
The strong support for and presence of activists (B; C; H),       artists and politicians from High Court Judges (Australia; A),       African and South American LGBT leaders and artists (USA, Brazil B, I),       and government ministers (Quito) further exemplifies QPs impact on       societal and policy debates.
For example, in 2011, QP3 empowered       African activists (including funding) in their work (G); the       associated 2012 Quito colloquium was opened by both Scherer and the       Ecuadorian Health Minister Carina Vance Mafla; after attending QP4,       Argentinean Anarcho-queer activist Pao Lin organized a QP empowering       workshop in August 2012 for the local activists in Buenos Aires (H);       Scherer's key note at QP4 inspired young Brazilian LGBT activists to fight       against homo-and transphobia at universities in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.
She writes (translated from the Portuguese): [At QPIV,] I met B[] and         we had a conversation, from which I left with a different worldview.
A         conversation of hope that I regard as a "politico-philosophical         "salvation, because I could finally see the horizon from my own life         experience .
B[] spoke about the challenges of gender transition , said         how important it was for us to stand on issues that are dear to many         people and how important it was to participate in conferences that allow         these issues to be discussed and addressed from the perspective not only         of academia but of different social fields.
[...]In that conversation I         had with B[] I was able to see [..] a way though education and activism!
Three months after QPIV I [..] organized a major meeting at my         university to discuss the problems and potential of trans identities ,         the name of the event was "For the UFRJ for everyone: LGBT identities in         HE."
From there I went to [..] social activism for many trans people!
We         formed a sort of collective that seeks to combat homophobia ,         transphobia and lesbophobia in various spaces of UFRJ.
I used the         knowledge acquired in the QP to organize various round tables and         debates on the subject of transsexuality.
I was invited to give lectures         to raise awareness [.].
I started to feel like a human being, a true         citizen of otherness whose displacement is very powerful!
(I).
An example of a major impact on religious attitudes can be seen       in Scherer's challenge to Newari Buddhist leaders in the Kathmandu valley       (Nepal) on their restrictive perspectives on sexualities in a public       address January 2013 underpinned by (ref.
iv-vi), which provoked a       thoughtful debate and awareness change as evidenced by its coverage in the       national Nepali newspaper and by Nepali NGOs (Mitini and Green Tara Trust       Nepal) testimonies about Scherer's QP activities in January and June in       Kathmandu 2013.
The LBT women NGO Mitini writes: "Thank you so much         for making the time on your second visit to Nepal this year in June for         intense talks and plannings with and in support of Mitini.
Your Lecture         at Patan Archeological museum on Buddhism and Sexuality, 2 January 2013,         has created a wonderful opportunity of dialogue and openness to discuss,         and change awareness and behaviour in Buddhist communities (in         particular the strongly represented Newari Buddhist community) towards         gender equality and acceptance of LGBT Buddhists.
The senior reform         priest Naresh Bajracharya has in June already promised to you and us to         give LGBT persons his spiritual support, protection and guidance.
We         understand that your activities are linked to the broader Queering         Paradigms project and we feel very excited about this; hopefully we can         hold a Queering conference in Nepal in the future and build on that to         create more social justice change.
Your triangle talks-Queering         Paradigms, Green Tara Trust and Mitini has initiated our collaborative         shelter project for the well-being of LBT women for which we are now         started to collect funds.
Thank you so much for all your hard work for         the queer community in Nepal!"
Hence, the tangible change of       religious attitudes manifests in the fact one of the most senior Newari       priest has in June 2012 given his pastoral protection to LGBTIQ Newaris       and that to equality focused local NGOs have started formal social justice       cooperations (J).
