     The quality and focus of the underpinning research at Newcastle has led       to Wildman taking a prominent role in three commissioned projects with       direct implications for government policy.
The &#163;95.6 billion NHS budget is       split into four areas, namely acute care, health inequalities, prescribing       and mental health services.
It is distributed to bodies that provide       health services across the country.
Deriving the formulae for the       allocation of these resources is highly significant in terms of reducing       inequalities.
In England, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation       (ACRA) provides independent advice to the Department of Health on how       central resources should be allocated.
The Economic Advisor, Resource       Allocation Team, Department of Health and NHS England commented as       follows: "Professor Wildman was a member of the research teams who         undertook three studies funded by the Department of Health developing         formulae for determining NHS funding allocations between local areas         based on the relative need for health services...All three research         projects were extremely useful" (IMP1).
Wildman's role in       the impact of each of the three projects is now looked at in detail.
Health Inequalities Resource Allocation Formula       In 2010, ACRA commissioned research from a consortium of leading health       economists to help the Department of Health deliver its strategic       priorities of ensuring equal opportunity of access to health care and       contributing to a reduction in health inequalities.
According to the Chair       of ACRA, Wildman made a "distinctive and substantial" contribution       to the work of the consortium (IMP2).
This research was published       in the form of a report to the Department of Health (IMP3) which       informed policy debate and associated practice.
The research contained in       the report was subject to a process of refereeing undertaken by a       Technical Advisory Group (TAG) comprising leading academic and       policy-focussed economists.
A series of four adjustments were proposed to the health inequalities       formula: 1) An adjustment to equalise use for people with equal needs; 2)       An adjustment to achieve funding capacity for appropriately unequal use       for people with unequal needs; 3) An adjustment for differences in input       quantities across population groups; and 4) An adjustment based on the       relationship between funding and health outcomes (IMP3p148).
These       adjustments thus proposed a fairer distribution of resources, taking into       account the needs and supply variables, and based on better population       data.
The Economic Advisor, Resource Allocation Team, Department of Health       and NHS England commented: "[This] project was welcomed by ACRA and is         being used to consider longer term work by ACRA on how the formulae         address health inequalities" (IMP1).
Resource Allocation for Mental Health and Prescribing (RAMP)       Building on the health inequalities resource allocation formula, a further       project was commissioned (Grant 4).
The TAG and ACRA accepted the       recommendations of the project team regarding both the resource allocation       model for mental health services and the formula for prescribing (IMP4).
Wildman and his colleague developed the prescribing formula, established       the methods, organised the data and conducted the data analysis.
Wildman       developed a suitable model for use "that contains plausible needs and         supply variables... is robust to a variety of tests and has good         explanatory power" (IMP4p30).
The Economic Advisor, Resource       Allocation Team, Department of Health and NHS England commented: "[This         project] was fully endorsed by ACRA and used for calculating part of the         Primary Care funding allocations for 2011-12" (IMP1).
The recommendations contained in the report were communicated by ACRA to       the Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley, in September 2010: "ACRA         recommends a new approach to the mental health component of the weighted         capitation formula.
The approach is a major step forward in how funding         is allocated for mental health services" (IMP5p5).
This       letter recommended changes to the resource allocation formula in, among       other things, health inequalities.
The Secretary of State replied in October, accepting the report's       recommendations: "I am pleased to inform you that I accept all of         ACRA's recent recommendations" were put into practice in two       Department of Health guidance documents (IMP7p24, IMP8p6) which       included the statement that "the 2011/12 toolkit introduces new         methodologies for the Prescribing and Mental Health parts of the         toolkit.
This is based upon the results of the Resource Allocation for         Mental Health and Prescribing (RAMP) project, which was developed as         part of the methodology for PCT allocations" (IMP8p6).
The       changes introduced in 2011/12 continue to provide the basis for resource       allocation in these areas (IMP2).
Thus, as the Chair of ACRA       confirmed, "The work of Professor Wildman has had a significant and         far-reaching effect on the allocation of resources in the NHS in the         areas of mental health services and prescribing" (IMP2).
Person-based Resource Allocation Model for Mental Health (PRAM)       The third project involved the development a new method of resource       allocation based on individual level data &#8212; PRAM (Person-based Resource       Allocation Model for Mental Health) (Grant 5).
The need for a new formula       followed the continuing development of Practice Based Commissioning, where       "larger volumes of services are expected to be commissioned by         organisations that serve larger populations, older populations, and         populations with worse health and more socioeconomic deprivation",       thus requiring more up to date equations for the basis of calculations (IMP9p4).
The recommendations were reported to ACRA in 2012 (IMP9), and they       in turn recommended to the Minister that the model be used (IMP2).
The Economic Advisor, Resource Allocation Team, Department of Health and       NHS England commented as follows: "The third research project was also         fully endorsed by ACRA and used to calculate components of the options         for Clinical Commissioning Group (CCGs &#8212; the successors to PCTs) funding         allocations ... [The] research and formula are the starting point of NHS         England's fundamental review of allocations" (IMP1).
The       Chair of ACRA confirmed the continuing impact of Wildman's work: "In         response to important social and demographic changes, PRAM has developed         a new model on the basis of individual level data ... Wildman is         currently playing a key role in the development of a new method of         resource allocation in mental health services" (IMP2).
