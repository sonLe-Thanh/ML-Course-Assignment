     Context     By the late 1990s, concerns were growing about the global scale of the       obesity epidemic and high-profile health organisations sought to develop       public-health strategies to tackle the problem.
The University of Glasgow       waist circumference Action Levels published 1995 were rapidly adopted by       the World Health Organisation (WHO) in its influential Technical Report       `Obesity: Preventing and Managing the Global Epidemic' released in 2000.a       Although the report did not include any citations to published research,       the WHO explicitly defined a waist circumference above 94 cm and 102 cm in       men, and above 80 cm and 88 cm for women, as corresponding to an increased       risk and a substantially increased risk, respectively, of obesity-related       illness within white populations.
A statement from the Chairman of the WHO       committee confirms that University of Glasgow research (Lean et al.
1995a1) formed the evidence base for these cut-offs.b       Citation by the WHO gave the Glasgow Action Levels a global profile and       stimulated public-health impacts across the world.
The WHO report is cited       by many of the campaigns that quote the University of Glasgow waist       circumference Action Levels.
Indeed, since the exact values (94 cm in men       or 80 cm and 102 cm in men or 88 cm in women) stated by the waist       circumference Action Levels are entirely unique to the University of       Glasgow human nutrition research evidence-base, any publication or       guideline which cites these values can be considered an impact of this       research.
Incorporation in health promotion and disease risk screening           campaigns     The simplicity of measuring waist circumference and the ease of       interpretation of the Action Levels by the general public confer a       strategic advantage over previous BMI-focused messages and lend themselves       to inclusion in public-health initiatives.
Since 2008, there has been a       flood of prominent public-health programmes targeting obesity and       obesity-related health risks.
The waist circumference Action Levels       defined by the University of Glasgow have become the benchmarks in a broad       range of these campaigns internationally.c,d      For example, the charity Diabetes UK uses the University of Glasgow       Action Levels in their online materials to alert the public to the need       for weight loss to limit the risk of developing diabetes.
Similarly, the       British Heart Foundation advocate the Glasgow Action Levels as a way to       determine if weight loss is required in order to `raise awareness of         shape as well as weight being important in relation to risk of coronary         heart disease'.
To complement this, as part of their Heart Matters       campaign, the society offers a tape measure based on the `Waist Watcher'       in their welcome pack.
The Waist Watcher tape is also available to buy       from online retail giant Amazon.
Further UK campaigns that cite the       University of Glasgow Action Levels to promote weight loss and raise       awareness of the central obesity-related disease risks include the NHS       Choices `Why is my waist size important?'
initiative, the British       Dietetic Association `Weight Wise' campaign and the Public Health       Agency, Northern Ireland information leaflet `Is your waistline         creeping up on you?'.
Internationally, the University of Glasgow       Action Levels have been prolifically cited in health-promotion campaigns       from 2008 onwards, including `Healthy Weight &#8212; it's not a diet, it's a         lifestyle' (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA.
),       `Healthy Waist' (Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada), `Measure         your waist' (National Heart Foundation of Australia), `Measure         Up' (Australian Government) and `Health@Work' (Hong Kong       Government).
Informing clinical guidelines and policies     The impact of the University of Glasgow Action Levels within clinical and       public-health medicine has been substantial.
They are cited in numerous       national and international clinical guidelinese on obesity and       cardiovascular risk that recommend the use of the Action Levels for waist       circumference, in combination with BMI, for the diagnosis of obesity and       stratification of disease risk:            The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence         (NICE) guideline CG43 on prevention, identification, assessment and         management of overweight and obesity in adults and children (originally         published in 2006, reviewed in 2011 with all recommendations upheld)       The Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN)         guideline 115 on management of obesity (2010)       The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council         guideline on management of overweight and obesity in adults, adolescents         and children in Australia (2013)       The New Zealand Ministry of Health clinical guideline for         weight management in New Zealand adults (2009) as part of the clinical         weight management algorithm to raise patient awareness of         obesity-related disease risk       The joint European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis           Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemias         (2011) included the Action Levels to categorise heightened         obesity-related cardiovascular risk and signal the need for blood         cholesterol testing       The International Atherosclerosis Society position paper on         global recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia (2013)       The World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) global guideline         on obesity (2011).
The WGO is an umbrella organisation of over 100         national professional gastrointestinal societies.
Their 2011 guideline         recommends a management scheme to stratify eligibility for surgery and         initial treatment options according to the Action Levels defined by the         University of Glasgow, in combination with BMI.
Within this scheme,         individuals with a waist circumference above 94 cm (men) and 80 cm         (women) (Action Level 1) are recommended to receive diet and exercise         advice; above 102 cm (men) and 88 cm (women) (Action Level 2)         individuals should be considered for additional behavioural support and         weight-loss drugs.
Patients should only be considered for surgery once         they have exceeded the upper Action Levels for waist circumference, with         a BMI greater than 35 and failed diet and lifestyle interventions.
In addition, the University of Glasgow Action Levels have been highly       influential in government-commissioned population-based studies and are       routinely used to analyse the National Health Surveys (Scottish Health       Survey and Health Survey for England; most recently published in 2011).f
