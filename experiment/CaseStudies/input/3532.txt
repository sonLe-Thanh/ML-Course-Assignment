     Professor Tseloni's research has informed national and international       crime prevention agencies in in terms of both their understanding of the       nature and causes of the crime drop and victimisation inequalities, and       how they have approached tackling these issues.
For example, in relation         to the measurement of crime and the acquisition and dissemination of         crime statistics she has advised social researchers responsible for       the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey on questionnaire design, hard to       reach populations and the use of sampling (Scottish Government Social       Research on the 2008-09 Scottish Crime and Justice Survey questionnaire       (2007-2010).
She has also worked with the Home Office in relation to both       training staff on the use of hierarchical modelling of crime data, and her       research has also informed approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of       the Crime Survey in England and Wales (formerly the British Crime Survey)       in terms of comparing actual and predicted crime rates for broad crime       categories (2001 - Kershaw, C. and Tseloni, A.
(2001) British Crime         Survey Developments.
Paper presented at a joint meeting of the       Official Statistics and Social statistics Section of the Royal Statistical       Society, the British Society of Criminology and the Home Office Research       Development and Statistics Directorate.).
In her capacity as Chair (2013       to date; Vice-Chair: 2010-2013) of the Crime and Justice Statistics       Network she has worked on various consultations with regards to official       crime data, including the consultation that paved the way for the transfer       of the British Crime Survey from the Home Office to the ONS (UK Statistics       Authority, Re `Cross-national comparison of UK crime statistics', Overcoming         barriers to trust in crime statistics: England and Wales, UKSA       Monitoring Report 5: 63).
Her research has also informed internal practices within police         forces.
For example, her work with Humberside police reassured the       force that their crime rates were not higher and in cases lower than for       the rest of England and Wales, and the public had similar levels of       satisfaction with Humberside police and similar reporting rates as the       rest of England and Wales.
This enabled the force to identify that the       relatively higher level of crime in their locality was in part down to the       quality of their crime recording systems (1997).
Professor Tseloni's work       provided a different form of reassurance to the Metropolitan Police Force       in relation to the policing of ethnic minor minority communities.
Her       research concluded that external disproportionality was actually by ethnic       minority citizens with complaints against ethnic minority officers (but       not necessarily the same group) in areas with high ethnic minority       populations.
Furthermore problems with internal practices were identified       in relation to dealing with ethnic minority police officers and staff       problems formally while there was a tendency to do so informally for White       officers (2006).
In terms of informing crime reduction strategies and addressing the         problem of victimisation inequalities, Professor Tseloni has since       2012 been a Board Member on the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership.
In       this capacity she has advised on crime rates and patterns in       Nottinghamshire, and informed local crime reduction initiatives concerning       `problem families'; and tackling the link between crime and alcohol       through the sensible alcohol consumption project in Nottingham.
Her work       with the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership has also resulted in the       development of student profiles that have informed the introduction of       adverts promoting crime awareness in student areas of the city, and       landlord accreditation schemes in relation to aspects of burglary security       within their properties.
As a current member of Nottingham Crime and Drugs       Partnership Burglary Task and Finish Group member her research has       informed the prioritising of vulnerable population groups and       interventions in relation to the effectiveness of security measures and       the reduction of burglary.
This latter research impact has also informed       national advice and guidance on incorporating crime safety in housing and       urban design through the funding and dissemination of research findings by       the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (2009-2010).
As well as influencing approaches to the measurement of crime and       tackling victimisation inequalities within the United Kingdom, Professor       Tseloni's research has achieved an international reach in terms of       informing the activities of crime reduction agencies.
