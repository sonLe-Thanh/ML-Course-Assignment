     The publication of the intensely personal testimonies of Guilarte and       Beneyto, together with other       forms of public engagement (including use of the film documentary), has added         to public         understanding of the Francoist period, but it has been particularly       effective in helping Franco's       victims share common experiences, and to discuss them with other       social groups and members       of younger generations, and has helped to promote dialogue about       new ways of responding to       the past.
This comes at a crucial moment, as first-hand testimony is       becoming ever scarcer just       when the recovery of the past appears more urgent than ever.
The fact that       each of the women       came from parts of Spain where fierce debates about centralism and       regional autonomy continue       unabated has added a further (often controversial) dimension to the       reception of their testimonies.
Thanks to the use of various platforms, the results of the research have       reached new (non-academic)       audiences at public events in Spain, Mexico and the UK; through viewings       of a film       documentary; and through an accompanying blog.
The strength of public interest in recent work on exile and the Civil War       is evident from the range of       institutions sponsoring the events at which Jato has sought to encourage         engagement with these       testimonies, and by the fact that the publication of Cuentos para d&#237;as         de lluvia was sponsored by       the Instituci&#243;n Alfonso El Magn&#225;nimo, funded by the Government of       Valencia, while the publication       of Un barco cargado de... was funded by Tolosa Council.
The making       of essential contacts began       with an official Homage to Guilarte in November 2011 (where Jato was       invited to speak by Ana       Mar&#237;a Ruiz &#8212; Guilarte's daughter) sponsored by the Mayor and Deputy for       Culture of Tolosa and       attended by local residents who contributed valuable testimonies of their       own.
The event resulted       in engagement with sections of the community interested in memorialisation       as a current social       and political process.
The second stage of public engagement involved fostering         reconciliatory dialogue with the         past through presentation of the `lost' memories in diverse fora.
Jato organised public discussions       of Un barco cargado de... and reading group activities on Cuentos         para d&#237;as de lluvia both in Spain       and the UK.
In order to make the research and Guilarte's memories more       accessible to wider and       diverse audiences, Jato produced an accompanying film documentary [see       source 1 below].
Like       Guilarte's boat with its cargo of memories, the book and the film called       at various locations in Spain       and the UK, delivering her testimony and collecting new memories from the       participating public.
The accompanying blog acted to further engage the public with the       research, as well as providing a       forum for discussion, feedback and reflection upon the impact of these       activities on their perception       of the past [2].
In the period to July 2013, the blog had received almost       3000 hits since its creation       a year before [3].
The blog traced the journey of the boat/book as it set off from the       Cultural Centre in Montorn&#233;s       (Catalonia, 28/06/2012) before travelling on to a variety of national       museums and local community       centres.
These included:            the Centro de Mayores Miguel de Cervantes, London (17/10/2012)       the Cultural Centre and the EPA (School of Adult Education) in Tolosa         in the Basque Country         (24/10/2012)       the Centre of the Anarchist Syndicate, San Sebastian (22/12/2012)       the Museum of History of Catalu&#241;a (Barcelona) (07/02/2013)       the Museum of Exile (La Junquera, Catalu&#241;a) (09/02/2013)       the Arts and Sciences Festival, University of Birmingham (18/03/2013)       the Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra (04/04/2013)       the Centro de Personas Adultas de Santander (09/04/2013)          Audiences were strictly non-academic members of the public, with a total       of over 300 people       attending.
Feedback from audiences indicated that Jato's events and the       documentary screening       aided the recovery of memory, facilitated dialogue about and changed         opinions of exile [4].
The material was also incorporated into other public events where memory       work was an urgent       contemporary concern.
Thus, for example, the film was shown throughout the       `Semana cultural       republicana' in Tolosa (8-14 April 2013).
Jato's public talks at the       Museum of History of Catalunya       and the Museum of Exile were part of the cultural programme organised by       the `Memorial       Dem&#242;cratic de la Generalitat de Catalunya' a public institution `aiming to       recover, celebrate and       promote democratic memory between 1931 and 1980', including the       encouragement of inter-generational       dialogue.
The value of both testimonies for promoting trans-national       dialogue is demonstrated in two       ways.
Firstly by the inclusion of the Guilarte documentary in the       commemorative events held in       Mexico to celebrate the 82nd Anniversary of the Proclamation of       the Spanish Second Republic,       hosted by the Ateneo Espa&#241;ol de M&#233;xico.
Secondly, through a series of       reading events based       upon a translation of one of the stories from Beneyto's collection, "Una       historia que es Historia".
Organised by Jato, the story was used in the activities of four groups,       mainly of older readers, at       local libraries in Birmingham in Summer 2013 (Weoley Castle Library,       Erdington Library, Quinton       Library, Brasshouse Language Centre) leading participants to reflect         on women's wartime         experiences (including their own) [5].
Feedback from the groups (a       total of around 360       participants), also indicated improved understanding about the Spanish         Civil war and in         particular the challenges faced by women [5].
