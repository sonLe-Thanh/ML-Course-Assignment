     The original research carried out in the preparation for, and throughout       the making of MDL was instrumental in the success of the film as an       informative, powerful and persuasive narrative piece, and led directly to       the significant impact the film has had since it was premiered at the       Atlantic Film Festival, Canada on the 24th Sept 2009 (A3).
MDL has raised awareness of the issues involved among potential         victims through the widespread adoption of the film and related       cross-platform media by various frontline agencies.
These agencies have       been reached through the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre       (http://www.ukhtc.org/), which extensively piloted the film in schools       across Sheffield in October 2009; the National Working Group for Sexually       Exploited Young People (S1); and the Family Planning Association (S6)       which improved social welfare and take up of services by promoting the       material nationally in schools.
The PSHE Association promotes the `Love or       Lies' Educational Resource Pack, which includes a DVD of MDL, the film's       official music video Set Me Free and the associated animation Me         Jenny and Kate for use by teachers with Secondary Key Stage 3 and 4       schoolchildren across the UK.
The film is also promoted directly to       beneficiaries through the MDL website (Ref 2), which encourages direct       participation from young people and is directly linked through to a       variety of social media fora including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and       Flickr.
My Dangerous Loverboy engages vulnerable and marginalized       young women, many of them in denial, making them more self-aware and       visible to the public and governing agencies in order to bring about       changes in attitude and policy.
"Significantly young people themselves         who are the victims of sexual exploitation do not believe they are being         exploited and consider their relationship to be one of 'love'.
However,         when I have showed the film to the young people I have worked with their         response is.
'That's me isn't it?'''
Key Official, National Working       Group For Sexually Exploited Young People.
(S1)     The film has also been instrumental in raising awareness and changing         the attitudes of workers forming part of those frontline agencies       towards the victims of sex trafficking through its promotion and inclusion       in training materials, by for example, Doncaster Safeguarding Children's       Board, the Lothian and Borders Child Protection Office and the UN Global       Trust Fund for Victims of Human Trafficking (S5) The practitioners and       professional services benefiting from the film include the United Kingdom       Human Trafficking Centre, which screens the film to social workers,       police, teachers and youth workers; the Home Office, which uses the film       as a training resource for police, schoolteachers and practitioners; the       Serious Organised Crime Agency (now National Crime Agency) (S3), which       reported in 2010 on its launch of My Dangerous Loverboy and its       adoption by various agencies, including the Child Exploitation and Online       Protection Centre (CEOP).
"The UK Human Trafficking Centre and its         partners, which commissioned the film, hope that in addition to         encouraging early intervention, it will give victims confidence to come         forward and help bring their abusers to justice" (Head of Legal       Services, UKHTC).
The National Working Group for Sexually Exploited Young       People said: "The My Dangerous Loverboy film and Love or Lies training         pack are by far the most effective means of getting the message across         to professionals and non-professionals" (S1).
Other beneficiaries       include the Office of Criminal Justice Reform, the Association of Chief       Police Officers, The Family Planning Association, which reach       schoolteachers and public health professionals (S6) and The Serious       Organized Crimes Task Force in Scotland, which improved standards of       training by showing the film to every new recruit as well as Senior       Officers; "I have had people say they really want to do more to help         victims of human trafficking once they have seen the film.
I can see in         people's faces the reaction to the shocking reality of what is         happening...and there is always a stunned silence at the end."
(Head       Lead for Human Trafficking, The Serious Organized Crimes Task Force in       Scotland).
Further afield, the work is promoted by The United Nations Global       Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT) (S7) and COMBAT, an EU       funded anti-trafficking project including Bulgaria, Lithuania and the UK       (S8).
It was also screened by the Head of Legal Services, UKHTC to       European government representatives in Brussels as part of an       International Conference on Human Trafficking in 2009.
My Dangerous Loverboy has informed and shaped public and         political debate about the sex trafficking of young people and       improved public understanding of social issues.
A report on the BBC News       website (S9), and reportage in national newspapers including The Times       (S10) indicates the My Dangerous Loverboy film research has had an impact       in raising public debate on the issue of sexual exploitation and       trafficking of young people in the UK.
One of the original UKHTC       commissioners of the film is currently an advisor to the UN Global Trust       Fund for Victims of Human Trafficking and has used My Dangerous         Loverboy as part of an international awareness raising campaign       (S5).
Moreover, a key human rights lawyer used My Dangerous Loverboy       to raise awareness with the panel of an inquiry into human trafficking in       Scotland by The Equality and Human Rights Commission "I thought it was         a very engaging and challenging film...the perfect tool for raising         awareness of the ways people can be drawn into abusive relationships."
(S2).
The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking       cites the film and the project's innovative use of online, global media.
"Targeting         a teenage audience where tweets, blogs and posts are the communication         medium, the My Dangerous Loverboy campaign (Ref 2) uses a         cross-platform approach to raise awareness about the internal         trafficking of teenage girls into the sex trade.
The campaign intends to         create content that will engage and challenge teenagers wherever they         are consuming media."
(S7)     The film is regularly cited on numerous online blogs (see below) and has       its own online presence on Facebook, YouTube (where it had been watched       44,768 times between January 2010 and June 2013), Twitter and Flickr.
The       'Love or Lies' Educational Resource pack is estimated to have reached 25,       832 young people, and used to train 860 Practitioners (figures from Eyes       Open Social Impact Report 2013).
