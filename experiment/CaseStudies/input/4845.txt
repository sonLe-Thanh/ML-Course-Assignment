     A BBSRC/EPSRC/MRC-funded "discipline hop" enabled Professor Norman Kirkby       from the University of Surrey's Chemical &amp; Process Engineering       Department to spend a year at the Oncology Centre in the Addenbrooke's       Hospital, Cambridge.
As a direct result of this opportunity a suite of       multi-scale mathematical models have been generated which go from the       cellular level right though to national policy and decision-making level       [1].
One resulting paper has been a highly cited publication [2 above].
A       consultant neuro-oncologist from the Addenbrookes is now seconded to       Chemical &amp; Process Engineering at Surrey for one day a fortnight; this       arrangement is unique in the UK and critical to ensuring that the research       has a full reach `from bench to bedside'.
One of these models, MALTHUS (Monte Carlo Application for Local       Treatment and Healthcare Usage Simulation) commissioned by the National       Cancer Action Team (NCAT) is available as a download so that clinicians       and commissioners can plan current and future radiotherapy demand for       their network or region.
As of March 2013, MALTHUS had over 100 users;       however it is now incorporated in the "standard PC build" for a number of       NHS trusts and so the exact number of users is unknown.
The first use of       MALTHUS to justify purchase of new equipment was made by Ipswich using the       beta release version.
MALTHUS was originally developed for England but has been extended to       Wales and recently the program has been made available to research groups       in Scotland, Australia and Canada.
The European Society for Radiotherapy       and Oncology is considering MALTHUS for incorporation into their Health       Economics in Radiation Oncology Project [2].
One unique feature of this program is that we have achieved a national       consensus on best RT practice.
MALTHUS is also being used by clinicians       because it contains a repository of this evidence base.
The decision trees       in MALTHUS are now also used to assess clinical performance in RT       departments     The government has recently announced volcanic changes to the way NHS       commissioning will operate; it has never been more important to have       robust and reliable tools to predict demand for services.
The long-term       benefit of MALTHUS is that it represents a nationally-agreed, systematic       way of deciding how many fractions of radiotherapy are likely to be       required in any given location and thereby will remove the `postcode       lottery'.
The impact of Surrey's research is well illustrated by stake holder       feedback, a selection is included below;     In his letter to the Cancer Network Directors, January 2012 [3], the       National Cancer Director, said (our underline):     "... the new Malthus modelling tool for radiotherapy demand.
This           tool uses evidence-based radiotherapy decision trees based on UK           clinical practice and local cancer incidence data.
From this it           calculates radiotherapy demand requirements and can model forward to           take account of changes in cancer incidence as the population ages.
This is likely to produce a more realistic model for radiotherapy             demand than the NRAG model and I have no doubt will be a focus of             your radiotherapy plans into the future..." Later in the       letter he added: "I would encourage you and your colleagues to             use this model regularly and update the version           in use."
And, "I would therefore encourage commissioners to use the           Malthus tool for radiotherapy planning...
These results should be used           to inform strong commissioning discussions with providers."
In the Department of Health report; Radiotherapy in England 2012" [4] : 	"To support accurate workforce planning the outputs from Malthus are being           used to feed the development of a workforce planning tool for the           physics and radiography workforce (the Workforce Integrated Planning           Tool, WIPT).
This will help identify the overall requirements for           national training numbers for the physics and radiographic           professional groups taking account of emerging changes to local skill           mix as a result of new techniques and technologies"     For lung cancer (~1300 avoidable deaths per annum if survival in England       is matched to the best in Europe [5]) the DoH [4] in 2012 added     "Lung cancer fractionation is much more diverse because the intent           of treatment may be palliative or radical.
A significant proportion of           patients receive short palliative regimens, all of which are supported           by clincial trial evidence in different settings.
Radical treatment is           dominated by 20 fraction regimens which have a poor evidence base.
Few           patients receive treatment in 30 or more fractions which would be           standard in most of Europe and North America for many indications.
This should be addressed in the commissioning process through use of           the evidence based decision trees in the Malthus model."
An overview of radiotherapy services from the NHS National Cancer Action       team [6], guidance on the management of radiotherapy capacity from the       Royal College of Radiologists [7] and the NHS standard contract for       radiotherapy [8] each demonstrate that Malthus is now embedded as a       standard and important tool for the planning and management of       radiotherapy services throughout the UK.
The Malthus web site is publicly accessible and provides further       illustrations of the impact achieved [9]
