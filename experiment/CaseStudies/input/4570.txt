     Use of research findings by professional bodies to inform best           practice       The research findings have been used by Think Global (The       Development Education Association), a key mediator between government       policy and practice in the UK to inform their work.
Think Global       commissioned an article for a practitioner audience       (http://bit.ly/1cdh4YS), drawing on the findings and proposing a new way       of developing pupils' understandings of cultural similarity and difference       based on a relational logic.
This was circulated by Think Global       to its network og BNGOs, Development Education Centres, Trade unions etc.
Martin presented these ideas to the advisory group of Think Global       in October 2012, followed by a webinar on December 4th 2012.
Reading and discussing this article `has been included as a         recommendation within the School Action Plan, for schools taking part in         the Global Learning Programme where we consider them to have `embedded'         policies on diversity and cultural difference'1.
Think         Global's submission to the national consultation on the proposed new       National Curriculum (http://bit.ly/16XKtHV) noted the importance of       teaching `the need for mutual respect and understanding' and       critiqued the Brito-centric emphasis of the curriculum, arguing instead       that teaching should be `fostering a greater understanding of Britain's         relationships with the rest of the world and the contribution of ideas,         knowledge and people from beyond Britain1'.
Martin was       subsequently appointed as a trustee to Think Global in July 20131.
Tide, a teachers' network promoting young people's global learning       through engaging with global perspectives (http://www.tidec.org/)       has been a key stakeholder2 in the study from the outset and       has used the research findings to inform its own materials and activities.
The research is reported on their website (http://bit.ly/19HmMxM)       and has informed their development of ethical practices in North-South       study visits.
For example, they have written online guidance for leaders       of study visits (http://bit.ly/1hN06kH),       informed by the research and in which the phrase `differently         knowledgeable other' (introduced by Martin &amp; Griffiths, 2012) is       used: "Being supportive is one thing, but we have also had a crucial         role to play in moving learning on, and that means offering a challenge         as a "differently knowledgeable other."
For example, where an         issue has come up, where there has been conflict in the group [for         example, around child sponsorship or charitable giving], then we have         had to think hard about how best to intervene".
Tide's       Director has noted that Martin's research `challenged our thinking         about commonality, difference and global learning, and influenced the         way we explore these ideas, particularly with primary teachers' and       `has significantly influenced2' their approach to       facilitating DFID `Global School Partnerships' courses and subsequent       `Connecting Classrooms' courses.
Tide has recently secured a major       European Community grant with University of Potsdam, Germany, and Federaci&#243;n       Espa&#241;ola de Religiosos de la Ense&#241;anza &#8212; Centros Cat&#243;licos, Spain: "Young         people on the global stage; their education and influence".
Martin's       research was `significant in shaping our successful bid' which `will         draw heavily on thinking around intercultural and transformative         learning'.
In addition, Martin has begun collaboration with three other       organisations on developing approaches to leading study visits based on       ethical, relational pedagogies.
Lifeworlds Learning (a Community       Interest Company) and DEC South Yorks (a development education       centre) both run yearly study visits for teachers to locations in the       Global South.
Along with Tide and the Geographical         Association, they worked with Martin between November 2012-January       2013 to develop ideas for working together to enhance practices in ethical       study visits; plans for putting ideas into action are ongoing.
Intercultural         Youth Exchange UK is a GAP year organisation that invited Martin to       present findings of research at their AGM October 2012, attended by 50       people.
In Europe, Martin was invited, on behalf of the European Commission       Department of Culture and Education, to be a member of a `diverse group         of leading scholars / experts from around the world' to take part in       consultation process developing common ground and strategic thinking about       `intercultural competences' and related applied fields.
This forms part of       the European Union Delphi consultation, the outcomes of which will inform       future policy.
Currently, Martin is working as consultant to a CBeebies programme3       for 3-6 year olds that is in formation, and is using the research findings       to influence young children's perceptions of cultural diversity.
She is       advising on how to avoid conveying unintended messages that reinforce       stereotypes (environmental, cultural, social) through the series and       merchandise.
Stimulating practitioner debate       An interim conference (2011), and four end-of-project conferences (http://bit.ly/168yaT5)       were held in 2012 in Exeter; Birmingham; Banjul, Gambia; and Gandhigram,       India, bringing together academics and practitioners to consider the       implications of the research findings.
These were attended by 300       stakeholders, representing interests from e.g.
government departments for       education and curriculum development, the British Council, Development       Education Centres, Teacher Unions, NGOs such as the Red Cross and Oxfam.
The conferences involved presentations from northern and southern       researchers, and workshops led by those [e.g.
the Project Manager of Tide,       members of the National Environment Agency EfSD sub-committee, TORP       Project leader Tamil Nadu] involved in the project.
They engaged       practitioners in interpreting the research findings from their own       perspectives through a focus on the intercultural relations;       transformative learning; living with difference; and mutual partnerships.
The view that global partnerships are in danger of being a form of       neo-colonial activity was reported in the Times Educational Supplement       5/3/10 (http://bit.ly/bEcauq)),       stimulating considerable debate online and in the letters page the       following week eg (http://bit.ly/GM18lp).
Martin's research was cited in a further article in TES March 12th       ( http://bit.ly/19vpLva), using it to       question the charitable and patronising practice of a Welsh school towards       its African counterpart.
Martin also contributed to a blog on the       Development Education website (http://bit.ly/1bnJoXr),       challenging government policy proposals on development education in the       light of understandings gained through her research.
The NAHT published a       summary of the research in an issue, Global Learners, Global Schools,       of their Education Leadership series (http://bit.ly/H7ohhV).
Martin also gave a keynote address for the practitioner network, Teacher         Education for Equity and Sustainability (TEESNET) at their annual       conference in July 2013 (http://bit.ly/1ftMkXd).
The address explored conceptual ideas around knowledge, power and       legitimation in global learning and partnerships, and the conference was       attended by 70 delegates from schools, development education centres and       NGOs.
Evaluations from delegates included: "Very thought provoking &#8212;         need to read more, think more &amp; talk more about her ideas.
Will         definitely go to website; Fran really made me question, again, my         thinking on intercultural awareness.
Made me think about the millennium         goals with new eyes; This was so clear, it addressed power and discourse         and our accountability as people of privilege in a way that challenged         but drew us in.
Presentations in this area can be over intellectual and         alienate; this was not, It was grounded and human".
Close involvement with the Geographical Association (GA), including       Martin's role as President from September 2011 to August 2012 has also       stimulated practitioner debate and engagement with the research.
Martin's       Presidential Address at the Annual Conference in 2012 (http://bit.ly/lz84En),       engaged the 470 delegates with `Geographies of Difference', and was       subsequently published5 in Geography, a journal for       lecturers, teachers and students of geography.
Examples of delegate       feedback indicating impact on professional thinking and practice include       one delegate who felt 'inspired to go forth and try new things!'
and another who `felt reinvigorated to go back to my school and shake         everything up!'
Five articles for practitioners6, written       by members of the research team including the non-academic partners, have       been published in Primary Geography, subscribed to by over 1800       teachers and teacher educators.
Developing resources to enhance professional practice       Drawing directly on the research findings and based on relational       epistemology, an online learning resource (http://www.gpml.org.uk/),       Frameworks for Intercultural Learning (FICL) has been developed in       collaboration with Canterbury Christ Church University (GPML research       participants).
The resource aims to stimulate debate about issues that lie       at the core of global intercultural learning and was launched during a       presentation at the GA conference in April 2013.
Subsequently, three       secondary schools agreed to trial the materials with their students, and a       link to the resource has been placed on the Department for International       Development funded global learning site for schools, Global Dimension       website (http://bit.ly/19vyPQQ).
Analytics for the website show: 4,179 visits in the first 5 months.
Top       hits by country: USA 1,716; UK 763; China 221; Australia 81; Canada 26.
Spikes in visits within the UK, Australia and Canada can be related to       Impact and dissemination activity by Martin in these three locations.
Martin was invited by one of the trial schools, British School of       Brussels, to give talks to parents (30+), senior students (200), Y10-11       students (100+), senior staff (25) and primary staff (10) on 19-20       September.
The school has developed a scheme of work for their senior       students modules on Ways of Knowing and Global Learning, based entirely on       the FICL resource.
The Head of Geography and lead tutor for International       Baccalaureate5 has noted that how they will deal with       similarity and difference through the module has changed as a result of       Martin's input, and that they are now reviewing their global citizenship       practices through their partnership with schools in Northern Ghana.
This       has in turn led to an invitation to be a keynote speaker at the       International Baccalaureate conference in Italy, October 2014.
Martin has also acted as a consultant to the British Council6:       she advised on the development of an online CPD resource for teachers, `Education         for Global Citizenship' (http://bit.ly/10tLkwj),       commenting on original ideas and reviewing materials pre-publication.
The       site is designed for use by teachers in all countries participating in the       Connecting Classrooms initiative.
Two of her publications are used in the       CPD activities: one to stimulate thinking about neo-colonialism, and other       to stimulate debate about what it means to be a global citizen.
