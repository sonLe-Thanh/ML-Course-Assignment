     Our impact strategy, which started in 2009, has involved repeated       engagement with policy debates to highlight ways of increasing the UK tax       take by &#163;1bn through encouraging enterprise, and removing &#163;1bn of       ineffective public policy.
As a result, we have contributed towards       preventing, reducing and reforming a number of poorly performing policy       interventions (such as regional venture-capital funds), and replacing them       with better-designed alternatives.
The strategy builds on ESRC-funded       research on research-impact (repeatedly evaluated as `internationally       outstanding') and involves extensive collaboration with other academic       groups (e.g.
`From Funding Gaps to Thin Markets: UK Government support for       early-stage venture capital', NESTA-BVCA, 2009), and persistent       engagement with `bridgers and brokers' in the UK policy community.
We have       co-authored reports and academic papers, co-organised seminars with the       Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, provided fast-turn-around       research support for Select Committees, spoken at party conferences, had       direct discussion with Ministers, made submissions to inquiries, given       verbal evidence before Select Committees and provided direct support (e.g.
Prof. Nightingale was an expert advisor to the House of Lords Science and       Technology Select Committee).
From these activities, we can claim to have had a major influence in       three key areas:             Post-crisis banking reform, where our submission to the Vickers         inquiry [C1] co-authored with Will Hutton (The Observer, the Work         Foundation), was cited in sections on support for SMEs [C1], which fed         into subsequent banking reforms (such as increased capital         requirements), new funding mechanisms (such as the new business bank,         announced in September 2012) and policies to support the securitisation         of SME loan portfolios.
Our submission highlighted the value to SMEs of         ring-fencing commercial banking if it changed business models in the         sector, and how a range of simple policy interventions was providing         financial support to SMEs at a time when the commercial banking sector         was not delivering.
Our suggestions on a publicly-supported business         bank which would focus on areas underserved by traditional banks are         currently being implemented, with &#163;300m of funding recently announced.
The beneficiaries of this change will be SMEs seeking debt-funding,         policy-makers and the public, who will benefit from more choice in the         market.
SME equity provision, where our research has been repeatedly         drawn on to inform policy on hybrid-equity schemes (co-funded by the         government) [C2, C3].
Currently over half of EU VC funding comes from         such schemes.
Our work has highlighted the need for scale in funds,         contracts that balance the distribution of risks and rewards, and the         relatively long periods of time needed for an external system of         professional services to emerge.
We disseminated this research through a         public policy report [C4] for NESTA and the British Venture Capital         Association, which we led in combination with academics from seven other         UK universities.
The work was presented to the Access to Finance group         at BIS and, on 14 October 2009 at a speech at the BVCA Private Equity         Summit, a Treasury spokesperson highlighted `We have taken on board the         policy suggestions in the BVCA and NESTA joint report, From Funding           Gaps to Thin Markets' www.betterregulation.com/doc/2/8681514.
Research results were discussed directly with the Minister in 2013.
This         research has also informed EU policy through the European Research Area         Board http://ec.europa.eu/research/erab/pdf/erab-recommendations-on-venture-capital_en.pdf         based on our 8S model of VC support.
As a result of our work there is         now increased recognition that hybrid funds need to be larger,         professional, aligned with commercial imperatives, and not regional to         be commercially viable.
We have also helped to change BIS evaluations to         include indirect as well as direct measures such as future increases in         taxation [C4].
Beneficiaries include innovative SMEs seeking funding,         the UK VC sector, and the UK economy [C6].
The conceptual framework used by policy-makers to develop support           for innovative SMEs.
A decade ago, innovation was understood         within market failure frameworks, based on an R&amp;D, linear model         where entrepreneurial firms commercialised university research.
Strong         political constituencies supported this framing and benefited from the         market distortions that policy generated.
Our research fed into policy         debates through bespoke policy briefs to the House of Lords Science and         Technology Select Committee (Coad) and to Number 10 and BIS         (Nightingale).
One of these was highlighted by Vince Cable's special         adviser as `one of the best emails I have ever read' and was widely         distributed in Whitehall and the London policy community (private email         available on request).
As a result, the civil service is more realistic         now about the potential of new technology based firms [C2] and has moved         away from thinking that the only constraints they need to consider are         financial (i.e.
the shift in emphasis from the first to the second BIGT         reports and C2 C3, and C4; C5 on policy debate).
