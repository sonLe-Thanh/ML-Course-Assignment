     Improving government communications with service users     The reputation of the Department of Typography's research in public       information design led to direct approaches by UK Government departments       for assistance with communication to improve their services.
&#8226; 2010-11 Supporting equality in prisons: Race Equality Advisory           Group (REAG), part of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS)     Two projects were commissioned from Simplification Centre by REAG to       improve equality and transparency in treatment of prisoners.
(Both       projects were collaborations with professional design consultancy, Text       Matters, who implemented our research-based methods.)
1) Translation of a paper-based documentation process to an online,       interactive tool kit (the NOMS Equality Impact Assessment Tool, NEAT) that       facilitates incident recording, management and tracking for Britain's       90,000 prisoners.
Our problem-solving approach to forms design ensured       usability of the interface and transparency of the reports produced by the       tool.
NEAT was listed as a `Key Achievement' in the NOMS Equalities         Annual Report for 2009-10 and was implemented nationally via NOMS         Ensuring Equality Instruction, 14 April 2011.
2) Stemming from the success of NEAT, the research team worked with NOMS       REAG to create a shared checklist, ReCoDe (Request, Context, Decision),       for prisoners and officers to follow when prisoners make requests.
The       checklist describes a sequence for dialogue to promote equitable handling       of requests across all prisoners.
Pictorial communication tools       (influenced by our research expertise in Isotype) were prepared to explain       the process for both officers and prisoners.
ReCoDE was first implemented       at Aylesbury and Cookham Wood prisons, with a positive response.
The       Governor of Cookham Wood attributed a significant drop in the use of force       in her prison to the checklist and HM Inspector of Prisons (2011)       identified it as an example of good practice.
ReCoDe was subsequently       taken up by Elmley Prison.
The tool was evaluated independently by London       School of Economics' Mannheim Centre for Criminology, who reported very       positive outcomes where the tool had been implemented enthusiastically by       prison management.
&#8226; 2012-13 Changing people's approach to job search: Cabinet Office           Behavioural Insights Team (BIT)     BIT, which was piloting behavioural interventions to increase the       effectiveness of job seekers' search for work, asked for guidance to       develop a shared record form, or 'commitment pack', for job seekers and       their Jobcentre Plus advisors.
CIDR designed a structured documentation       pack which supported job seeking by clarifying for the job seeker and       advisor the tasks that the job seeker had made a commitment to carrying       out during the interval between appointments, and when or how he or she       was going to do them.
CIDR introduced user scenarios to help explain the       process to the job seeker and used design to make the pack look attractive       and less institutional than other, typical Jobcentre documentation.
The       pack was piloted at 12 Jobcentres in Essex (covering 20,000 job seekers)       from February 2013.
The success of the pack during the REF period led to       the decision to extend the use of a commitment pack nationally (announced       by the Minister for Employment in August 2013).
&#8226; 2012-13 Research-based guidelines for Government digital           communications     &#8212; Stemming from our successful input to the job seeker's pack, CIDR was       asked by BIT to prepare research-evidenced `Top Tips for Letter Writing'       for the Cabinet Office.
Described by the client as `very helpful', the       project led to a commission for a research rationale for Government       Digital Service (GDS) content guidelines (see below).
&#8212; CIDR prepared a research-based rationale and critique for GDS' existing       content guidelines that are applied to all Government online documents and       can be accessed by any web user.
This input led to revisions in the       guidelines.
At GDS' request, the team prepared a blog post for them on the       use of research to inform practice        (http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/06/11/empowering-everyday-         readers/).
The post was viewed over 900 times from publication (11       June) to 31 July.
&#8226; 2010-13 CPD training in information design for HMRC     HMRC asked the Simplification Centre to develop a training course in       information design for non-designers, to raise awareness and equip       participants with skills to commission design effectively.
The course       (ongoing) has attracted 21 students from HMRC and additional participants       from insurance companies AXA and Aegon.
Gavin Jefferies, Head of Customer       Information at HMRC, commented that participants `found it helpful in       providing a framework to identify design improvements and also the       theoretical/ research-based evidence to defend their recommendations'.
Communicating the principles and practice of public information design     Alongside direct collaboration with government departments, the       Department of Typography &amp; Graphic Communication has used its funded       research projects as a foundation for the following exhibitions explaining       the significance and methods of `design for everyday reading' to civil       society.
&#8226; 2010 St Bride Library (London): `Designing Information for           Everyday Life'     Based on `Designing information before designers' and attracting,       particularly, a professional audience (following a positive review in Eye         Magazine), visitors' written comments included `The designing       exhibit brought the Victorians to life in ways I have never experienced       before...' and `An eye-opener and inspiration for modern information       designers grappling with these problems...in a digital environment'.
&#8226;2010-11 Victoria and Albert Museum (London) `Isotype:           international picture language'     Based on the project `Isotype revisited', the Austrian Cultural Forum       London collaborated on the private view of this collection, which was       attended by the Austrian Ambassador (Isotype was initially developed in       Vienna in the 1920s) .
The exhibition was previewed in Eye Magazine       and reported in the Independent, International Herald Tribune       and New York Times and in interviews with Austrian radio station,       ORF (May 2011).
Exhibition footfall (based on uptake of the exhibition       prospectus) was a minimum of 4,000.
The website for `Isotype revisited' 	  (http://isotyperevisited.org/)       receives an average of 5,000 visits per month.
