     The background to impact began when the Rapporteur of the ILC enlisted       Boyle's expertise on codifying elements of international environmental       law.
The ILC's work is generally regarded as highly authoritative by       governments and international courts, and is used by lawyers and       governments to influence judicial decisions.
The second edition of Boyle's       monograph was cited extensively in its Report of 58th session (2006) (GAOR       A/61/10, pp.113ff).
Critically, the ILC rethought its original findings.
Its final codifications (2001 and 2006) fully reflected the paradigm       advocated by Boyle's research.
As a result of Boyle's research being taken up by legal institutions his       work has had an impact on law and practice during the REF2014 period       because his analytical framework has been successfully channelled into the       international court arena and, in turn, adopted as the paradigm for the       evolving subject of international environmental law.
The International Court of Justice's (ICJ) judgment in Pulp Mills         (2010) is the first decision of any international court to address the         core concepts of international environmental law.
It deals with the         regulation of trans-boundary pollution and environmental impacts.
Boyle         was counsel for Uruguay and based his written pleadings and oral         arguments mainly on material drawn from Chapter 3 of the (then         forthcoming) 3rd edition of his book &#8212; embodying the above research         findings.
The ICJ judgment for Uruguay closely mirrors the analysis in         that chapter.
Moreover, the work is cited expressly in the separate         opinion of Judge (Trindade): `...while a great part of that writing         continues, somewhat hesitantly, to refer to sustainable development as a         "concept", there are also those who seem today to display their         preparedness and open-mindedness to admit that it has turned out to be a         general principle of International Environmental Law'.
[referencing         Boyle and Birnie] (5.3)       The Advisory Opinion on the Responsibilities of States with respect to         Activities in the Deep Seabed Area (International Tribunal on the Law of         the Sea (ITLOS) 2011) (5.4), builds on the judgment given in the Pulp           Mills Case (5.2), and again confirms the analysis advanced by         Boyle in Chapter 3 of the 2009 edition of International Law and the           Environment.
The key findings of each court that support both the general       international law nature and preventative/precautionary themes of Boyle's       analysis are:     i.
The ICJ confirms explicitly in Pulp Mills that in       international law governments must regulate and control trans-boundary       pollution to the highest applicable international standards (para 187).
See also ITLOS (para 111).
ii.
Pulp Mills is the first occasion in which an international       court has held that prior assessment of trans-boundary environmental       impacts (EIA) is a requirement of general international law (para 204).
It       is also the first occasion when any international court has considered the       specific requirements of an EIA.
iii.
Both courts accept that governments must take a precautionary       approach to environmental risk management, but this does not operate as a       reversal of the burden of proof (Pulp Mills at para 164; ITLOS at       para 131).
Confirming Boyle's pivotal role, Sir Michael Wood, Member of the       International Law Commission, has said: `The International Court of       Justice in The Hague (which tends not to cite authors by name in its       judgments) has largely adopted his pragmatic approach, including in its       most recent judgment dealing with environmental matters, Pulp       Mills...(2010).
Likewise, Professor Boyle's writings were cited in 2009 by       a number of the participants (including by me acting as Counsel for the       United Kingdom) before International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in       Hamburg (established by the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention), in the       proceedings leading up to its first ever Advisory Opinion       (Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and       Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area).
This seminal Advisory       Opinion follows the Pulp Mills judgment, and thus we have the beginning of       a solid case-law on the subjects such as environmental impact assessments       and the precautionary principle/approach'.
(5.5)     The impact is reflected in the following honour citation: `The Jury has       decided to award the 2011 Elizabeth Haub Prize for Environmental Law to       Professor Alan Boyle in recognition of his exceptional accomplishments in       international environmental law.
In reaching its decision, the jury has       noted that through his pioneering and outstanding scholarly works       Professor Boyle has played an important role in structuring and theorizing       this new field of international law.
In addition to his great academic       achievements, he has also influenced the development of international       environmental law through his extensive practice as counsel in numerous       significant international environmental disputes.'
