     This research on devolution has been disseminated extensively through       social media outlets: Devolution Matters (Professor Alan Trench's blog - http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com); and What England       Means to Me (Professor Arthur Aughey's blog-http://whatenglandmeanstome.co.uk/       have respectively on average 40,000 and 50,000 hits per year.
It has also       been disseminated in local, national and international broadcasts and       through the publication of articles in local and national newspapers.
Through the active dissemination of the research and using the media as an       impact generating interface, the team's work has impacted on the tone,       language and framing of the debates about the English question and the       asymmetrical nature of devolution in the UK.
To establish a direct relationship between research and effect is always       problematic.
However it is clear that the public and policy debates have       been stimulated by the research undertaken and subsequent analyses of       Aughey, Birrell and Trench.
A major institutional context for these       debates about Englishness, and by extension Britishness, is the Parliament       at Westminster.
In a House of Lords debate in 2009, Lord Bew       referred to Aughey's research as a major political science intervention in       the debate which the government needed to note: `Now, when new Labour         wants to define positive Britishness and turns to its natural historical         intelligentsia, it does not receive much help.
In fact, the most         relevant academic interventions may now come from the community of         political science&#8212;the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, being a striking example         in his fine speech earlier today, the work of the Constitution Unit,         Professor Arthur Aughey's important work in Belfast, and even old hands         such as Professor Sir Bernard Crick' (see source 1).
As a       consequence of this citation, in December 2009 Aughey was invited to       participate in a roundtable discussion at Number 10 Downing Street       on the question of a written constitution for the UK, one proposal to       resolve the outstanding problems specifically related to the asymmetry of       devolution.
Convened by a member of the Number 10 Private Office's Policy       Unit Aughey's specific contribution was on the implications of       constitutional change for England and its distinctive place within the       post-devolution constitution.
Subsequently, contact was maintained with       the convenor of that event after the 2010 General Election and the change       of government, now as Director of the Institute for Public Policy         Research (IPPR).
IPPR took up the English Question as one of its       projects and Aughey's input into that project was both direct (being       consulted by the director of the project) and indirect, through       participation in a number of seminars run at the IPPR's offices in London       between 2010- 2013.
The Director of IPPR said that: `Aughey         ...pinpoints the factors that have led to an emergent English anxiety,         as well as those that weigh against the expression of that anxiety in a         new English nationalism' (see source 2).
A subsequent IPPR policy       paper by Professor Richard English referred specifically to the excellence       of Aughey's monograph on England in terms of the comprehensive nature of       the research as a vital reference point for framing future discussions       about English nationalism (see source 3).
The key impact has been the       realisation that English nationalism is (at the moment) `a mood not a       movement' and both sources indicate clearly how Aughey's work has enhanced       cultural understandings of the English identity among those tasked with       the formulation of new policy directions for England.
This `mood not a       movement' finding was explicit in his written submission to the McKay         Commission on the Consequences of Devolution for the House of Commons         (2012).
Subsequently Aughey was invited to give further oral       evidence when the Commission held its hearings in Belfast (June 2012) and       led to specific reference to his contribution to the Commission's findings       (see source 4).
Birrell's work on the comparative functioning of the devolved       institutions and their relationship to the Westminster Parliament led to       the invitation by the David Hume Institute in February 2013 to       contribute to their ESRC funded `conversation' on issues relating to       constitutional change in Scotland particularly as they related to social       security and welfare in Northern Ireland.
Jeremy Peat, the Director of the       David Hume Institute referred to this paper amongst others as `an         important, evidenced based and transparent contribution within the         critical debate in Scotland on possible constitutional change' (see       source 5).
In Northern Ireland, Birrell was invited to give evidence to       the Assembly and Executive Review Committee in Northern Ireland as       part of their `Review of D'Hondt, Community Designation and Provisions for       Opposition'.
His contribution focused on the question of reducing the       number of departments and the operation of the Northern Ireland Executive.
His evidence suggested that departmental reduction was a complex issue and       drew on comparative material to explain executive functions (see source       6).
The evidence was referred to in the final published report and an       article based on his evidence was published in the Belfast Telegraph       (9 May 2013) indicated that his work had public resonance, helping to       shape the debate.
The final report, as Birrell advised, did not recommend       a reduction in departments.
Birrell's research has highlighted issues and       difficulties in policy making processes in the Northern Ireland Executive       and Assembly due to both the mandatory power-sharing coalition and       weaknesses in the policy capacity of government departments.
His work on       the policy process, the devolved policy style, policy copying and forms of       delegated governance has been presented in seminars and discussions with       senior civil servants, MLAs and NGOs through the Knowledge Exchange         Seminar Series (KESS) which seeks to promote `evidence-led policy       and law-making within Northern Ireland'.
It is sponsored collaboratively       by Queen's University of Belfast, University of Ulster and the Assembly's       Research and Information Service (RaISe) (see source 7).
His participation       in an IPPR Project on devolution in practice - on issues of policy       divergence between the devolved administrations and England - and his       paper comparing devolution and asymmetric devolution in the yearbook       series "Contemporary Wales" informed discussion on the future of Welsh       devolution in context of the Silk Commission's deliberations.
Indeed, informing and advising government has been a constant theme of       the research team on devolution and Trench's impact has come largely from       advisory roles based on his research findings.
Prior to his appointment at       the University of Ulster, he has acted as a specialist adviser on       constitutional matters to the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee       (since 2010).
Since joining the University of Ulster, he has also       submitted written evidence to Part II of the Silk Commission on       the implications of a Welsh legal jurisdiction (see source 8).
Regarding       finance, and building on earlier submissions to such bodies as the Calman         Commission in Scotland, the Silk Commission in Wales, the Scottish         Parliament's Scotland Bill Committees and the Finance and         Personnel Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, he has been       involved in a major IPPR project, `Devo More', with one report published       in January 2013 and another (Devo More and Welfare) due in February       2014.
This research has led to his appointment to advise the Scottish       Conservatives' devolution commission.
Trench is also participating in the       emergent debate in Northern Ireland, commenting at a launch of a paper       commissioned by the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action's         (NICVA) Centre for Economic Empowerment on the potential fiscal       powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Finance Minister Sammy Wilson       launched the report with both Trench and Daithi McKay, Chairperson of the       Finance and Personnel Committee as keynote speakers on the day (see source       9), and he has been a keynote speaker at the Northern Ireland Assembly as       part of the aforementioned Knowledge Exchange Seminar Series.
Collectively, this research has been consumed and used in deliberations       by Parliamentary Commissions, Parliamentary and Assembly Committees and       public policy think tanks.
The general conclusions have shaped and     defined for politicians, administrators, interest groups as well as the     general public what the nature of `unfinished business' of devolution     entails, the opportunities and constraints of the processes and how the     gaping hole of England might be filled.
