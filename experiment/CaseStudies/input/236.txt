     The growth in the use of biopesticides depends crucially on the       regulation process underpinning their arrival to market.
As such,       regulation affects the agricultural and horticultural industries,       companies wishing to commercialise biopesticide products and also food       retailers that are pressing their suppliers to grow fresh produce free of       pesticide residues.
The Warwick research has led to improvements in the UK       regulatory system for biopesticides which is important for facilitating       more product approvalsA.
Since the Warwick research was started       and the new UK PSD biopesticides scheme was introduced, there has been a       430% increase in the number of biopesticide products approved in the UK       (see below).
The Warwick research has had a direct impact on the UK       government regulatorB, decision-makers in the European       Commission and European ParliamentC, biopesticide manufacturers       and crop growersD-F.     Impacts on the regulation of biopesticides:             UK regulatory policy: A significant impact has been to help         facilitate the implementation of a new regulatory system for         biopesticides in the UK.
The team provided training to the government         regulator on biological control science and regulatory innovation, held         workshops with government bodies, the biopesticides industry, growers,         retailers and others, and proposed for a set of principles to underpin         the new biopesticides regulatory system that came into effect in 2006         (enacted by the PSD, now the CRD).
This has been widely recognised by         PSD and the biopesticide industry as being of importance to the crop         protection industryA-G. For example, Richard Davis, the then         Director of Approvals at CRD, has stated "Biopesticides have presented a         fantastic challenge to both regulators and those developing alternative         control measures, working with the RELU team has helped people over that         hurdle"B.       European policy advice: Dr. Chandler was invited by the Agriculture         and Rural Development Committee of the European Parliament to advise on         the potential of biopesticides and other alternative crop protection         agents within the context of new European legislation on chemical         pesticide use being developed at that time (Directive 2009/128/EC).
Dr.         Chandler and Prof. Grant gave a lecture at the Parliament (December         2008) and Dr. Chandler was lead author on a detailed policy guidance         documentC.
The report recommended increasing the use of         biopesticides and other alternative crop protection products in the EU         and gave guidance on innovations for the regulatory system for crop         protection agents.
New EU crop protection legislation (Directive         2009/128/EC, Sustainable Use of Pesticides) was enacted in 2009 which         states that biopesticides and other alternative agents must be used in         preference to conventional chemical pesticides where they provide         satisfactory levels of control.
Impacts on commerce:         UK &amp; EU biopesticides industry.
The number of biopesticide         products registered for use in the UK has increased significantlyA.
Prior to the new UK PSD Biopesticides Regulation Scheme, only six         biopesticides were approved.
Today, there are 26 registered         biopesticides in the UK.
In the EU the number of registered biopesticide         active substances is also increasing, and has gone from 42 in 2008 to         around 100 in 2013D.
The EU biopesticides market is growing         at 16% p.a.
compared to 3% for conventional pesticidesD and         in 2010 was estimated at &#8364;40M.
UK retailers and growers.
Presentations on IPM, biopesticides         and biopesticide regulation were given to Sainsbury's.
Dr. Chandler         became an invited lecturer on biopesticides for the Waitrose Responsible         Agronomy Course (2008 &amp; 2010) which is mandatory for its suppliers         (this includes growers, technical managers, and fresh produce sales and         purchasing staff).
In his lectures, Dr. Chandler teaches about the use         of biopesticides in IPM and options for improving the sustainability of         crop protection.
Interviews with Marks and Spencer done in the Warwick         RELU biopesticides project led to M&amp;S having follow-up meetings with         researchers on biological pest controls, helping to inform their         pesticide strategyB.
Recognition of commercial impact by Defra: The Defra Science         Advisory Council recognised the value of the project in a report         published in 2007G.
The report stated that the research "has         succeeded in opening up a new dialogue among a range of stakeholders         from regulators through manufacturers, consultants and retailers to         growers, and is helping to prime the emergence of a new industrial         sector around bio-pesticides".
Helping shape the biopesticides sector: In 2011 Dr. Chandler         acted as consultant for a biopesticides industry conference organised in         Amsterdam by Informa (a global academic publisher and information         business).
The meeting was significant in being the first industry         conference of its size (100 delegates) to be attended by senior         representatives of global agri- businesses (Syngenta, Bayer, BASF and         Monsanto) and the biopesticides industry.
Dr. Chandler and Professor         Grant gave lectures based on the findings of their research on the         regulation and use of biopesticides.
In addition, Dr. Chandler         co-managed a pre-conference workshop on the science behind biopesticides         and IPM.
The meeting provided an opportunity for agrochemical and         biopesticide industries to discuss areas of common interest,         particularly with respect to IPM.
From 2012 there has been significant         new investment in the biopesticide industry with at least 22 corporate         deals for biopesticides globallyD.
Recognition by the Research Councils:         BBSRC impact case study: The research was featured on the BBSRC         website (2012 - present) as an example of scientific excellence with         impactH.
RCUK: An independent report for RCUK in 2012 on the UK societal         and economic impact of the RELU programme concluded that RELU research         has helped change policies and practices concerning the rural economy,         and cites the biopesticides research at Warwick as an exampleI.
