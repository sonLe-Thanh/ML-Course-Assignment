     Adoption and dissemination of BG1442 variety in Nepal       The history of BG1442 perfectly illustrates the impact of PVS on       identifying varieties farmers will likely adopt.
Although BG1442       had been introduced in Nepal in 1987, it had never been promoted or       officially identified.
Bangor-led PVS trials with local farmers       (1996-2006) and large-scale seed distribution (2001 onwards), resulted in       rapid gain in popularity of the variety and its official release as Hardinath1       in 2004 - a process that had been completely stagnant prior to the PVS       trials.
Surveys from 2008 show the magnitude of this popularity: 14-22% of       surveyed households in 10 districts grew the variety in 2008, compared       with none in 1997 [5.2,5.7].
Because it is grown in the fallow season, the       variety drastically improved not only income and food availability, but       also provided additional jobs.
Rice self-sufficiency increased on average       by over 2 months (25%) and grain sales of families with surplus by 900 kg       per family (24%), [5.2,5.7].
Growth area and adoption of Ashoka varieties in India       The spread of the Ashoka varieties started in 2001 in four states       in northern India, and continues during the period 2008-2012 (Figure 1)       [5.3,5.4] extending to three additional states.
In 2003, the varieties       were officially released for the first time in Jharkhand State and were       recommended for cultivation in Gujarat and Rajasthan through the State       Agricultural Universities by 2005.
These varieties have been adopted for       certified seed production and, through the dissemination grants (RF, DFID)       secured by Bangor, expansion of seed distribution continues throughout       northern India and seed production levels since 2008 represent over 40% of       the total recorded seed production of the Ashoka varieties (Figure         1).
By 2012, more than 900 t of seed had been distributed to over       226,000 farmers in villages throughout northern and central India (over       50% of these farmers were reached since 2008) [5.3, 5.4].
A survey in 2008 [5.1] showed that 95% of farmers who had been given seed       4-6 years earlier, continued to grow Ashoka despite no further       outside intervention, revealing its high acceptability.
Farmers had       distributed seed within their villages and to other villages over       distances of up to 500 km.
Many of these recipient villages had as high a       level of adoption as villages in which seed had been initially supplied       [5.1].
Seven years after its release, Ashoka was grown on 40-76%       of the available land of adopting farmers in the five study districts in       four states; while, for comparison, the popular public-sector variety       Vandana was grown on just 0-5% of available land 16 years after its       release [5.1 (Table 27)].
By 2008, in the five surveyed districts an       estimated 177,000 farmers were growing Ashoka varieties on       approximately 26,600 ha.
Since seed of Ashoka had already been       distributed in over 1,000 villages by 2007 [5.1 (Figure 1] and high       farmer-to-farmer spread had been found, it was assumed (conservatively by       using low-end estimates) that adoption rates could be extrapolated across       the upland rice areas in all of the districts in the four states.
Hence,       it was estimated that 420,000 ha were planted to Ashoka varieties by 2.8M       households by 2008 [5.1(Table 26)].
There is no post-2008 survey, but       since the number of farmers that was reached by subsequent dissemination       projects more than doubled (Figure 1) [5.4,5.5] and in view of the       expected substantial farmer-to-farmer spread, it is deduced that the areas       and households have substantially increased by 2013 from the 2008 levels.
Moreover, the varieties have been widely distributed in the neighbouring,       but not surveyed, states of Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, and Uttar       Pradesh.
Economic and welfare benefits of growing Ashoka       The Ashoka varieties are popular for their high yield (~15% higher       [5.1]), grain quality, superior taste, and fodder yield.
Their early       harvest provides food during lean periods and pest-and drought-resistance       result in low costs and labour requirement.
83% of surveyed Ashoka users       reported increased rice availability in 2008, with a mean increase in rice       self-sufficiency of almost one month (17%).
These direct benefits can       allow farmers to plant an additional crop or devote time to       non-agricultural activities, providing extra income and permitting them to       send their children to school [5.1].
Grain sales also increased by on       average 150 kg (46%) and farmers benefited from more, higher-quality grain       receiving a better price.
Based on an additional 15% yield on 700 kg       grain/ha, and a conservative market value of &#163;400/t, the Ashoka varieties       in India were estimated to provide a financial benefit of about &#163;17M per       annum in 2008 - a benefit that would have accrued annually from 2009-2013       [5.1 (page 33),5.4].
Growth area and adoption of COB varieties in Nepal       The first Bangor COB variety (Bharke-3004) was officially released       in Nepal in 2006, the second (Sunaulo Sugandha) in 2008, and the       third Barkhe-3010 in 2009.
Barkhe-1027 and Barkhe-2014       followed in 2012 and by that time these, together with the unreleased       varieties, had spread over 18 districts across the Terai.
Between 2008 and       2012, seed kits were distributed to over 146,000 households [5.5] and were       more popular than varieties developed by Nepal Agricultural Research       Council (NARC) released in the same period: 10-16% of surveyed households       adopted the COB varieties, as opposed to 6-8% for the NARC varieties       [5.6].
75% of the COB-variety users reported additional yields of 1 t/ha,       equivalent to two months of rice self-sufficiency, bringing approximate       rice grain self-sufficiency to the poorest farmers, or a 12% increase in       sales (300 kg on average) for more affluent farmers [5.2].
By 2012, the       varieties were grown on at least 50,000 ha by 275,000 households in Nepal,       thereby directly benefitting over 1M people [5.2, 5.5].
This highlights       the benefits of Witcombe's COB approach compared with traditional breeding       of new varieties: despite its simplicity and low costs, its adaptability       to farmers' needs makes it highly successful, far-reaching and significant       in impacting on farmers' livelihoods.
Combined, the rice varieties developed through the Bangor research and       disseminated widely in Nepal and India by our partners, have improved         the livelihoods of millions of people; they are grown on at least       500,000 ha in India and Nepal and provide higher yields of better quality       with no need for greater agronomic inputs, to the poorest farmers across a       wide range of rice-growing environments.

Cumulative Ashoka seed distribution (t) (diamonds, grey         line) and number of seed receiving farmers (squares, black line in over         1000 villages throughout central India (over 50% of farmers were reached         since 2008).
Data summarised from: [3 (Tables 5, 11)], [4 (Annexure 1)].
Because farmers were given seed amounts ranging from 2 to 20 kg and         shared excess seed with relatives and neighbours, the number of         beneficiaries shown here is highly conservative.
* For 2012, the amount of seed distributed was derived from the number of       seed-receiving farmers, assuming 2 kg per farmer.
