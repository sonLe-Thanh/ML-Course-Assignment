     Natarajan has been instrumental in renewing public interest in Hazlitt       since the late 1990s.
She is on the Committee of the Hazlitt Society[1]       which grew out of a 2001 initiative instigated by The Guardian to       restore his long-neglected grave.
Its &#163;26,000 restoration cost was funded       by private donations and gifts sent by some 700 Guardian readers, many of       whom attended the unveiling of the renewed gravestone on 10 April 2003,       the 225th anniversary of Hazlitt's birth.
The Society was then established       as a continuing collaboration between the Guardian and the academy with       the aim of raising awareness, understanding and appreciation among the       general public of Hazlitt's multiform achievement and of its continuing       relevance.
Natarajan's research demonstrating Hazlitt's diverse strengths       as philosopher, critic, aesthetician, journalist and radical is highly       pertinent to the aims of the Society.
Her explanations of his ability to       communicate complex philosophical, political, and aesthetic principles in       an everyday, conversational style means she is uniquely placed to promote       his achievements.
Her activities on behalf of the Society, underpinned by       this research, have been critical to the growth of its membership, which       is between 150 and 200 with about two-thirds being lay members.
Since 2007 she has been instrumental in organizing the Society's public         annual lecture,[2] held on the Saturday closest to       18 September (the anniversary of his death).
It is given by a leading       public intellectual known for his or her ability to engage large general       audiences; these have included philosopher A.C. Grayling, the politician       Tony Benn, the poet Tom Paulin, the writer Tariq Ali, and the critic Terry       Eagleton.
There is typically an audience of 150 to 300 people, the       overwhelming majority of whom (around 85-90%) are general readers who come       from across the country specifically to attend it.
Natarajan's expertise       feeds into the open discussion at the end of the lectures, as noted in the       transcript of the 2011 Benn lecture.
[3]     She is also editor of The Hazlitt Review,[4] an       annual peer-reviewed journal published by the Society to promote and       maintain Hazlitt's standing, both in the academy and to a wider audience       of about 200 lay readers, by providing a forum for new writing on Hazlitt       and his contemporaries.
Natarajan edits the annual lecture for publication       in the journal, and through this mechanism her scholarship reaches all the       members.
In 2000 Natarajan and colleagues Paulin and Wu founded an annual         Hazlitt "Day         School", a symposium comprising talks and plenary sessions       led by Hazlitt specialists which is open to members of the Society and the       wider public.
She now runs it with Gregory Dart at University College       London.
It attracts about 50-60 attendees each year, of whom about       three-quarters are non-academic.
Natarajan is a regular speaker (for       instance, in 2010),[5] thereby broadening the reach of       her findings to an interested literary audience which extends beyond the       academy.
She also regularly accepts invitations to talk about Hazlitt for general       audiences.
For example:            in 2008 she gave two public lectures with audiences of about 150 each         as part of the Oliver Smithies lecture series at Balliol College,         Oxford.
[6]        in 2010 she was the primary speaker on BBC Radio 4's In Our Time,         in an edition focusing specifically on Hazlitt.
[7] She         talked about the research undertaken during her time at Goldsmiths,         focusing particularly on the variety of his achievement, his         contribution to theatre history, his view of Shakespeare, and his         innovations in the essay form.
Although exact audience figures for any         single broadcast are unavailable, the estimated figure for programmes in         this series is two million, with the permanently-archived podcast making         it accessible to a substantially larger cumulative audience.
She         received a number of responses,[8] including the         following from a listener; for example: "Your contribution on           Hazlitt was excellent and I congratulate you for it!
It was during my           schooldays over half a century ago I read few of his essays!"
Her role in establishing Hazlitt's importance in English intellectual and       cultural heritage is reflected in the citation of her research in the       Wikipedia entry on Hazlitt, which receives about 5500 views per month.
[9]       Contemporary essayist Arthur Krystal noted in The New Yorker       (2009) that `Hazlitt has been enjoying a serious revival'.
He       attributed this to the founding of the Hazlitt Society and to new academic       research by `literature professors', naming Natarajan among the key       participants in both respects.
