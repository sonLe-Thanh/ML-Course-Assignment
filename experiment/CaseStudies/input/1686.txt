     Dr Jones' research has significantly influenced decision-makers, civil       society groups and the wider public, in the UK and internationally.
Policymaker Engagement     As one of Britain's leading experts on Southeast Asia, Jones is regularly       asked to advise British and overseas government agencies and has thereby       improved understanding of the region, supported policy analysis, and       enhanced policymaking.
Much of this engagement concerns regional security.
In the UK parliament,       Jones was the academic consultant on Southeast Asia: A Political and         Economic Introduction, a report to inform debate and scrutiny of       government policy (December 2011), and contributed to two seminars on       intervention at the House of Lords (January 2011).
With the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office (FCO), Jones participated in a policy planning session       on EU-ASEAN relations in August 2012.
He recommended the EU focus on       conflict resolution capacity-building on the South China Sea; EU- ASEAN       negotiations on such cooperation began         in September.
He also suggested developing academic exchanges under       the UK-ASEAN Knowledge Partnership; in July 2013 the         FCO launched `Collaborative Development Awards' for this purpose.
In       September 2013, he provided policy analysis and recommendations on       Southeast Asian security to officials from the FCO, Ministry of Defence       Department for International Development, and the EU.
Jones taught on the       FCO's Diplomatic Excellence and Knowledge Enhancement programme in January       2012.
He has also presented briefings and policy recommendations on East       Asian security issues to: Southeast Asian policy elites (Singapore,       October 2009); EU, Danish and Dutch foreign affairs officials (The Hague,       June 2010); World Bank and AusAID officials (Perth, December 2010), and       French Defence and Foreign Ministry officials (May 2013).
Jones' expertise on sanctions and Myanmar has helped policymakers and       NGOs reorient themselves at a critical juncture, as Myanmar emerged from       decades of military dictatorship.
Jones was the sole academic expert       invited to an FCO conference held to reformulate UK and EU policy towards       Myanmar (Wilton Park, March 2012).
His follow-up briefing paper, EU         Sanctions Against Myanmar: Proposals for Change, proposed radically       curtailing economic sanctions; this policy was subsequently         adopted.
Jones briefed the new British ambassador to Myanmar in July       2013, and participated in a UK/EU policy review on Myanmar in September       2013.
He also briefed staff from Med&#233;cins Sans Fronti&#232;res and the       Norwegian Refugee Council as they intensified their engagement in Myanmar       (January 2013), and the Malaysian High Commission (August 2013).
Jones       also participated in a British Council policy dialogue with a Myanmar       minister and senior officials in London (May 2013).
A workshop on       sanctions for UK policymakers is being organised for spring 2014, with       support from SPIR's Marketing and Communication Officer.
Dr Jones also       produces briefs for Oxford Analytica, a global analysis and advisory firm.
These briefs translate research findings into easily-digestible summaries       which are delivered to clients worldwide, including many businesses, over       50 governments, and major international agencies.
Public Engagement:     Dr Jones strives to enhance the wider understanding of Southeast Asian       politics and intervention by engaging with civil society and the wider       public directly, and via the media, supported by SPIR and QMUL media and       events teams and QMUL's Widening Participation office.
Jones's sanctions research has reached NGOs, activists and the wider       public through public debates (London, January 2012, c.150 attendees);       seminars (c. 50 Myanmar civil society activists, British Council, Yangon,       July 2012); and internal policy discussions (Australian BDS activists,       Perth, July 2013).
His research on Southeast Asia reached NGOs, activists,       UK policymakers and others via public debates on Thailand's political       crisis (London, May and July 2012, c.150 participants) and Myanmar's       transition (Oxford, March 2013; London, September 2013, c.100       participants).
Jones has also engaged secondary school students through RCUK's Global         Uncertainties programme, visiting schools to improve students       understanding of security challenges and stimulating debate (2010), and by       presenting research insights and controversies about intervention to       students at BSix college, Hackney (2010-).
