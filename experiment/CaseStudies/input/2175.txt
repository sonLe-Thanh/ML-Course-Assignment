     The underpinning research has produced impact via two state-of-the-art       resources: (i) the DECTE corpus, primarily intended for an academic       audience and (ii) the Talk of the Toon website, which has made the       collection accessible to the general public.
The reach and significance of       the impact lies in the preservation of the North East's distinctive       linguistic cultural heritage through informing and influencing the content       of education beyond the HEI.
This has been achieved by providing valuable       learning resources for teachers and educators from primary, secondary, FE       and HE levels, thereby extending the study of the region's linguistic and       cultural heritage in educational institutions in the North East and       beyond.
Informing and Influencing the Form or Content of Education       The Talk of the Toon website has been accessed 3882 times by 2269       unique visitors between 17 December 2012 and 31 July 2013.
There have been       27,248 page views (average page view per visit was 9 minutes).
Although       visitors from the school sectors of North Eastern England constitute the       largest number of users so far at 28% of the total, high usage is also       recorded by visits from York, Toronto at 13% reflecting the fact that the       site is also heavily used by educators and their students there.
Other       visitors hail from 16 countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada,       Japan, Russia, South Korea and the USA.
The website was designed with input from both examiners and teachers in       order to provide students and educators from primary to HE level with       resources featuring relevant cross-curriculum materials, including: (i)       activities relating to a variety of subjects in primary and secondary       education, incorporating English, IT and history; (ii) topic-based       browsing of the data with related visual material; (iii) linked audio,       text, photographic and video data; (iv) primary source materials for use       in student project work and classroom demonstration; (v) familiarity       with/provision of teaching materials related to local linguistic/cultural       heritage; and (vi) awareness of the link between the North East's       historical development and its distinctive dialect.
To ensure that the       project effected real change through take-up in usage of the website in       education, between 2010 and 2012 the project researchers held a series of       outreach sessions, sixth form conferences and teacher CPD days with       educators and students.
Evidence of the impact value of these workshops       can be seen in the teacher and student feedback statements from these       engagement activities.
Asked if the resources demonstrated were useful and       whether they would make use of them in the classroom, 95% of teachers       responded positively (IMP1).
Primary Schools: In May 2011, four groups of primary school pupils       (94 in total) and their teachers participated in workshops on dialect at       the Discovery Museum using materials collected in this project that the       Learning Officer praised for being "well thought-through", "inventive",       and for having "introduced [the students] to ideas they might not have         come across before" (IMP2).
Acknowledging changes that the       project brought to the museum and its visitors, she noted that the       workshops used "a medium of engagement that we don't use very often &#8212;         sound &#8212; which is difficult for us to acquire, particularly because of         issues over permissions and because it is time consuming to collect"       (IMP2).
This educational programme has informed young learners'       interaction with, and knowledge of, the importance of dialect within       culture.
Feedback from participants was positive, with one teacher       commenting that "It links well with developing pupils' understanding of         standard/non-standard English".
Learning about the differences       between accent and dialect was commented on by most children in their       feedback forms, as well as their surprise at there being more "Geordie"       words than they realised, with one young participant learning that "people         who have posh accents do not need to come from posh places" (IMP1).
Secondary Schools: Between March 2011 and July 2012, nine       workshops were held with 457 students and 53 teachers.
Participant       response was enthusiastic with teachers commenting "Would/will be very         useful for language/dialect investigations.
Quite a lot of our students         investigate North/Tyneside accent and dialect" and "[We] will         write it into our course!"
Student feedback was also positive.
At       one A-level workshop (April 2011), 73% of the students participating said       that they would use the resource for their project work.
Students at       Central Newcastle High School, for example, commented "I learnt a lot         of useful information to use in my exam" (A-Level) and "it         allowed me to become more confident in analysing texts" (AS-level).
Subsequent feedback and testimonials collected from teachers and examiners       have also been especially positive, and includes evidence that the website       has been firmly integrated into schools' syllabi as a key learning       resource around which lessons have been constructed.
The research websites       have been used for teaching (for example, of accent and dialect), as       starter activities and to prompt discussion (IMP3).
The materials       are also used in student project work and language investigations, with       one A-level educator commenting, "The resources area on the schools         area of the site is particularly useful for giving [students] some ideas         about areas they can study independently" (IMP3).
Another       teacher from Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College has incorporated the Talk         of the Toon resources into A/A-S level English Language lessons,       including the development of teaching materials and teacher notes.
He       commented: "The main usage is introducing the notion of the data         investigation project &#8212; collecting and trawling through data, selecting         an angle and devising a doable question and applying the `key         constituents'.
The data is smashing and it gives students opportunities         to approach studying it from all sorts of angles" (IMP4).
The use of the resources is confirmed via website hits from Darlington       between 17-23 June 2013 which represented 483 visits/4,961 page views       (average visit was 9 minutes) with 73.08% of these coming from the College       (IMP5).
Continuing Professional Development: From 2010 to 2012, the       research team contributed to three CPD workshops for A-level English       Language teachers (102 attendees).
The materials from this project formed       part of a resource booklet for teachers.
As well as citing key outputs       from the research (3), the DECTE corpus was used to provide       example activities for classroom teaching (IMP6).
Feedback for all       three sessions was enthusiastic and positive (IMP1), with 82% of       teachers at one event (December 2010) agreeing that the material was       directly relevant to their teaching.
These teachers noted benefits such       as: increased knowledge, generation of new ideas to take back to the       classroom, and interaction with other teachers and linguistics lecturers (IMP1).
This is a particularly important benefit since many A-Level teachers only       have university training in English Literature, rather than English       Language &#8212; though they are now expected to also teach the latter on       account of the steep rise in popularity of this subject (14,751 examinees       in 2003 and 24,382 in 2012).
The research has thus helped to improve their       teaching as well as their students' learning.
HEIs beyond the submitting unit: The academic corpora have been       used widely in HEIs all over the world.
From 2008-2013, 75% of the 119 new       access requests were from outside Newcastle University, including users in       24 different countries.
The academic and public resources have been       promoted by academics for their students at undergraduate and postgraduate       levels worldwide, including Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Peru and the       Netherlands as well as the US and UK (IMP7).
For example, in early       2013 a Professor at York University in Toronto, used the DECTE and Talk         of the Toon project resources in an integrated       undergraduate/postgraduate module on sociolinguistic research methods,       where the majority of students used the resources as part of both module       assignments.
The corpora were described as "an excellent resource for         sociolinguistic research, including for students with no knowledge of         the variety" [...] "important for having them think about whether         to work with education or occupation as a social variable, and think         hard about social class.
They also had to think about working with         decade of birth vs working with age at the time of recording.
And they         learned a lot about English, including its history (e.g.
origins of         `divn't', the `-ly' adverbs, etc.)"
(IMP8).
Another       Professor of English Linguistics at Paris Diderot University, who       described the corpora as "a unique resource for the research community"       has regularly used the resources in both MA student supervision and       teaching, "I have two presentations specifically giving examples from         the NECTE corpus exemplifying protocols and fieldwork" (IMP9).
Informing and Influencing the Museum/Cultural Heritage Sectors and           the General Public       The collaborative activity with primary students at Discovery Museum       (described above), also assisted in their educational outreach goals &#8212; as       did the production of a Talk of the Toon CD and booklet to       accompany the initiative now on sale across Tyne and Wear Museums with       profits going to the sector.
Discovery Museum's Learning Officer confirmed       that "we are always looking for new ways to engage school groups and         make our programme as varied as possible, and these workshops added a         unique element to the offer" (IMP2).
Through the inclusion       of photographic resources from existing collections in regional museums,       namely, the Tyne and Wear Museums and Archives and the Beamish Museum, the       Talk of the Toon website and booklet have provided a new outlet for       those resources to be appreciated by the public.
Furthermore, the project       funded the digital preservation of fifty selected films from the North       East Film Archive (NEFA), enabling them to subsequently offer footage "to         a number of other educational and non-commercial projects at a lower         price as transfers had been completed" in the words of their Film       Archive Co-ordinator.
As with the other collaborating institutions, he       added that the project "helped to raise the profile of the NEFA and the         work we do", as well as providing an excellent exemplar of how their       materials can be successfully exploited (IMP10).
The project websites, including Talk of the Toon, recorded over       139,000 hits between June and October 2012 alone.
Between December 2010       and October 2011, researchers delivered five public lectures in Newcastle,       Morpeth (county town in Northumberland) and Dublin, attended by a total of       470 people.
One of the lectures was posted on iTunesU and has subsequently       been downloaded over 1,700 times between October 2011 and the end of July       2013 (IMP5).
