             Rain noise: McLoughlin and Saunders test method for rain noise         formed the basis for an ISO standard (ISO 140-18: 2006); becoming the         standard method worldwide for assessment of rain impact noise by roof         and roof-light structures.
Commercial test facilities specifically         designed for this standard have been constructed in the UK and Germany.
Government guidance on the acoustic design of educational buildings;         BB93, which includes a methodology for predicting noise for different         intensities of rainfall, forms part of UK Building Regulations,         requiring specific design measures for rain noise assessed according to         the standard, compulsory in all new schools built since 2003.
Since         2012, rain noise assessment using ISO140-18:2006 has also been included         in the `Acoustic Performance Standards for the Priority Schools Building         Programme'.
Building envelope: Salford models for sound insulation of         profiled metal cladding constructions were implemented into a PC based         software package which was adopted by members of the Metal Cladding and         Roofing Manufacturers Association (MCRMA) in 1995.
Major UK construction         and manufacturing companies have adopted the models.
The software         package is still in use by the majority of MCRMA members, a remarkable         achievement given the rapid pace of developments in the industry and         software over that period.
Lam was commissioned to further update the         models by the MCRMA in July 2013.
Low frequency noise: Guidelines for assessment of low frequency         noise have been adopted as a standard approach for low frequency noise         complaints by Environmental Health Officers within UK local authority         noise enforcement teams.
The guidelines form a key part of the strategy         for dealing with noise complaints within the Environment Agency,         frequently cited in public enquiries.
University of Salford training in         the use of the procedure was commissioned by the Environment Agency in         2012 for their noise specialists.
Structure-borne sound: A new reception plate method for         characterisation of sources of structure-borne sound has been adopted as         a European standard method for sound sources in buildings BS EN         15657-1:2009 Acoustic properties of building elements and of           buildings.
Laboratory measurement of airborne and structure borne           sound from building equipment.
This standard is called up by         another standard EN12354-5: 2009 Building acoustics &#8212; Estimation of           acoustic performance of building from the performance of elements Part           5: Sounds levels due to the service equipment for prediction of         sound levels from services equipment.
The Salford team was commissioned by Defra, CLG and DECC to employ the         in-situ blocked force method in developing guidelines for prediction of         structure-borne sound from building-mounted wind turbines for         stimulating renewable energy generation by the removal of planning         restrictions where possible.
With usual methods for prediction and         evaluation of noise from large and small wind turbines not applicable to         structure-borne noise, the team was able to apply the blocked force         successfully and establish the 'source strength' as a function of rotor         speed for two models of micro wind turbines together with a prediction         methodology.
In 2009 a set of guidelines         employing the method suitable for adoption by local authorities was         drawn up and published on the Defra website, forming the basis of         standard practice in the UK.
Room Acoustic Diffusers: Cox's research has led both to an         international measurement standard and to new designs of diffusers ISO         17497-2.
As convener of ISO Working Group WG25 Cox contributed to the         adoption of the internationally agreed measurement method for diffusers,         his diffuser designs can be found hundreds of rooms worldwide, examples         include Sony M1 studios in New York, Cinema in Seattle and the         Hummingbird Centre in Toronto.
Cox worked as a consultant for the         world's largest manufacturer of diffusing products, RPG           Diffusor Systems Inc for over a decade.
Angus' diffuser designs have been exploited commercially in the Binary         Amplitude Diffusor/Absorber (BAD), which simultaneously provides uniform         sound diffusion at high and mid band frequencies.
Multi-scale porous materials: Umnova et al demonstrated the         `enhanced compliance', of multi-scale porous materials, specifically,         activated carbon, to provide significant acoustic benefits, for example         in sound insulation by making cavities appear acoustically larger than         their physical size.
The research outcomes led to the filing of two         patents and formation of the spinout company CarbonAir         in 2012 which has received two rounds of venture capital funding         totalling &#163;275k plus &#163;55k other investment for exploitation.
The company         has secured licence contracts, including with a specialist manufacturer         of acoustic treatment materials for studio and home theatre applications         and a 12 year license agreement with a German Tier1 supplier to exploit         multi-porous materials in car suspensions.
