     A database of narratives of women who participated in the Latin American       Wars of Independence (3.1) underpinned three strands of international       public engagement activity which have effected changes in public awareness       (transnationally), contributed to community cohesion (locally) and       inspired pride and reflection for young migrant women.
Davies presented the Libertadoras project and its database (3.1)       to the directors of the Latin American Women's Rights Service (LAWRS) in       London, the Women's Museum in Buenos Aires, the New Art Exchange (NAE),       Nottingham, and Southwark Council along with key research findings       (3.1-3.5).
The programmes which were subsequently developed with these       partners drew directly on these outputs and followed the theme of women's       historical struggle for independence in Latin America and the impact of       gendered political discourse.
They engaged specifically with the critique       of androcentric historiography and political discourse (3.2 &amp; 3.3),       and the recovered names and stories of women who participated in the Wars       of Independence, translating the research insights and findings into       cultural and community events to highlight the continued relevance of the       Libertadoras to a contemporary audience (3.2-3.5).
Sharing recovered histories to create new knowledge and raise         awareness     A range of cultural activities developed in collaboration with the       Women's Museum in Buenos Aires and based on Davies' research included       readings and workshops using primary historical sources, round-table       discussions, an exhibition of historical and contemporary art, theatre       productions and a community translation programme in which volunteers       translated the biographies of the women in the database from English into       Spanish.
The programme attracted 300 visitors from Buenos Aires, and from       Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Colombia, giving people new knowledge         about and new perspectives on their history, challenging       androcentric narratives of the Wars of Independence.
Participant feedback       (which demonstrates a palpable sense of excitement) includes the following       comments: `I am sure there are important women from the independence       struggles [in my region].
I am going to find them!
'; `[The material] helps         us to recognise difficulties from the past that are also present in the         current day'; `I intend to carry out readings with the women at the       public library where I participate in events', and `I certainly learned a       lot and I was reminded of things I had studied at university.
I learnt         to value the work of women that exists "behind" grand events.
For       example during war.
Women are essential!'
(5.1).
The programme of events, Libertadoras 19th C to 20th         C: A Century of Struggle, 15th August to 22nd September       2012, generated widespread national media coverage in Argentina, extending       the reach of the research into a wider public domain.
Radio stations that       covered the events included Rock Nacional, Universidad de Buenos Airies,       Radio Gr&#225;fica and several shows specifically targeted at women including Monday         Again and Mothers' Voice.
The National News Agency of       Argentina, national newspaper El Comercial, and Yahoo Mexico's       news page also all covered the exhibition (5.1).
The Museum Director       reflected on how Davies' research (3.1-3.6), which had been embedded in       the activity, had stimulated discussion, particularly around         Independence, and the relationship between `national' and `personal'         independence.
The participants were `keen to express opinions and to       deconstruct official points of view influenced by liberal, misogynist       history that hides the participation of women in historical crises' (5.2).
Increasing confidence and self-esteem within a community of young,         first-generation Latin American women in London     Young Latin American migrant women in London engaged with a programme of       cultural workshops (with outputs including exhibitions and theatre       performances) that had profound personal impacts on them.
The       Director of LAWRS commented that `using the vehicle of Las Libertadoras       to explore issues of identify and belonging, and cultural pride, has had a       notable impact on these young women's sense of self and their social       engagement more broadly.
The project has rescued the value and courage of       the libertadoras to inspire [...] all of us so that we can follow       their example' (5.3).
The LAWRS Development and Outreach Officer said: `It       was clear the young women had been inspired by the libertadoras       and that they identified with them.
This can be seen clearly in the photos       too' (5.4).
The impact of the performance and the exhibitions that were the outcome       of the LAWRS activity extended beyond the individual women involved, to       the audiences who engaged with the work through its performance/display,       providing new awareness of the nature and experiences of the immigrant         Latin American community in London.
The play, written and produced       by the young women (with the support of a drama teacher and LAWRS youth       workers), was entitled `Razones por las que luchar' (Reasons for       Fighting).
It was based on re-enactments of the lives of individual Libertadoras       that the women had selected from the database (3.1).
The play was       performed at the LAWRS AGM (November 2012) with an attendance of c. 150       women from the Latin American community and at the Institute of the       Americas, UCL (May 2013) to an audience of c. 50 including parents and       friends.
Attendees' feedback focussed on the link between the histories       presented and contemporary politics and culture: `...the performance was       important for young Latin Americans who were born in the UK to remember       their roots.
[These projects are] an awakening for our Latin American       community, for us to improve our conditions and have a better future';       `[...] it is good to get back in touch with history in order to         understand and change the political processes of the present' (5.5).
4,040 attended the exhibition Empowerment through Art: Photography         and Latin American Girls, at the NAE in March/April 2013 and at       Southwark Council premises in May/June 2013 (curated by British-Mexican       photographer Pablo Allison in collaboration with Roxana Allison).
The       exhibition featured 11 portraits of the girls and their own photographs on       the theme of women's independence.
The girls were photographed in the pose       of `heroines' having seen the images of `hero&#237;nas' in the image bank.
Visitor feedback attested to the effect of the work in raising awareness       about Latin American culture in general, and about gender identity within       the Latin American community more specifically: `The exhibition provoked         me to reflect on gender and ethnic identities'; `I learned about new       depths and richness in terms of Latin culture, history and identity'; `I       had no idea there were so many Latin Americans in the UK and that the       girls need support.'
Visitors who spoke to the young women `got a real       sense that the project had raised the awareness, but also expectations, of       the young women involved' (5.6).
A Southwark Councillor and cabinet member       for communities and economic wellbeing said: `We are thrilled to have       supported such an imaginative and inspiring project.
I hope visitors of       all backgrounds will be encouraged by the stories and go on to fulfil       their own potential in a way that positively impacts upon the local       community' (5.7).
The NAE curator reported that `audience feedback was       positive and the idea of how art can be a tool for empowerment especially       for recent immigrants was appreciated by all those who saw the exhibition'       (5.8).
Contributing to community cohesion in Southwark: the cultural and         language exchange     Southwark Council identified a need to improve communication with Latin       American migrants to their community, and invited Thomas (a Post-doctoral       researcher working with Davies on the project) to run a series of       workshops for its employees.
The aim was to help them better understand       the cultural, linguistic and social profile of its Latin American       community.
As part of these workshops, participants were introduced to the       image bank and database (3.1).
Feedback from council employees       demonstrates the wide-ranging influence of the talks, which they praised       for increasing knowledge and understanding, helping the teams to build       networks with the Latin American community and identify contacts within       it.
A council employee commented: `The sessions have definitely helped         with my job as I now have contacts with South American organisations       that I can refer some of our private tenants to [...].
The sessions have helped         my team to build networks with the South American community in Southwark'.
A Development Manager for the Safeguarding Children Board said `The       photographic presentation and meeting [with the Director of] LAWRs [...]       really gave me insight into Spanish and Latin American culture.
It       also gave me a good connection with the LA community which I know I will       be returning to in my professional life.'
Local community groups have been       so pleased with the effects that they have requested the project continues       (5.9).
