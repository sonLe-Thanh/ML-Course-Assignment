     The Sand Dune and Shingle Network is based within the Geography       Department     The aim is to conserve sand dunes and shingle as dynamic landscapes.
The       network seeks to achieve this by:-            Encouraging people to value and understand the habitats.
Championing the habitats.
Facilitating an exchange of knowledge and support actions that are         beneficial       Making the Network an active community of participants, and a         recognised source of expertise and authority at the global level.
The initiative builds on the results of networking, highlights projects       and publications, and develops opportunities for conferences, study tours       and workshops.
The Network also took the lead in developing, and operates       as part of, a European Dune Network and works closely with the Coastal and       Marine Union (EUCC), the largest European coastal NGO.
Formal support for the establishment of the European Dune Network was       given by the EUCC Council at its meeting in April 2010.
Agreed aims are       to:-            Promote the sustainable use and management of coastal dunes.
Support policies and actions that conserve the intrinsic natural         values of coastal dunes.
Develop a vibrant European network of communities concerned with         coastal dune use and management.
Support the advancement of knowledge and understanding of coastal         dunes.
Provide an international platform dedicated to coastal dunes          These aims reflect concerns that coastal dunes remain threatened habitats       across Europe.
The Network currently includes, many of the following groups: site       managers; national policy makers; students and researchers; biodiversity       officers; ecologists; geomorphologists and hydrologists.
It is currently       expanding the membership to include coastal engineers, golf course       managers, tourism interests, forestry interests, military sites and       landscape historians.
The Network operates by sharing information across       different sectors/disciplines and links science and management.
The common       interest is the natural resources of coastal dunes and shingle, and a       desire to find sustainable solutions to conservation issues.
The Network       encourages members to be active and to participate in discussions and       field meetings.
By September 2013 the Network had over 270 full members, and distributes       a newsletter published three times each year to about 500 contacts       worldwide.
It has established an `Occasional Paper' series through which       network events are recorded and disseminated.
Copies of these publications       and newsletters are free to download from the Network web site at http://coast.hope.ac.uk/     The Network team, principally Paul Rooney as the Director and John       Houston as the Project Officer, has co-ordinated and delivered a number of       outputs leading to improved understanding and/or management of coastal       habitats.
Examples include:-            Paul Rooney was commissioned to present ecological evidence for the         statutory agency &#8212; Scottish Natural Heritage &#8212; at the Public Local         Inquiry held between June and July 2008, which was relating to Donald         Trump's development of a golf course on Menie Links, Aberdeenshire.
The         Report to the Scottish Ministers by the Directorate for Planning and         Environmental Appeals is available at         http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/212607/0067709.pdf         (see also Stewart Angus section 5).
This decision is seen a watershed         for the future of coastal dune management, has wide implications for         environmental planning and decision-making.
As the Network Project Officer based at Liverpool Hope, John Houston         was commissioned by the European Community to produce dune management         models for fixed grey dunes and dune slacks in 2008.
These management         models impact upon dune policy and practice across Europe and are         available to download at         http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/management/habitats/pdf/2130_Fixed_coastal_dunes.pdf         and         http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/management/habitats/pdf/2190_Humid_dune_slacks.pdf        Network staff are invited members of the England Coastal Biodiversity         Integration Group, chaired by Natural England and attended by a range of         statutory bodies, research agencies and NGOs.
The Network is identified         as the `Dune and Shingle Champion' in this group.
During 2009, the Network team at Hope were commissioned by the         statutory agency `Countryside Council for Wales' (CCW) through contract         number 053 TSG 08 for a project `A study to assess stakeholder support         for implementing a programme of dune re-mobilization on selected dune         systems in Wales'.
The results of this study led to a countrywide         programme of dune re-mobilization, and have assisted CCW (now natural         Resources Wales) to re-position itself with regards to its approach to         dune management.
In March 2012 a Memorandum of Agreement was signed between Natural         England (statutory agency) and the Sand Dune and Shingle Network at         Liverpool Hope to provide a `Sustainable Dune Management' on-line         internal publication.
This provides a suite of tools for use by Natural         England Advisers to enable more effective responses to casework on sand         dune SSSIs, and to improve the quality and effectiveness of their advice         on strategies and schemes for coastal management.
