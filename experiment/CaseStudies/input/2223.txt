     Our research has influenced global anti-doping policy and practice since       2007.
This impact is       based on trusting relationships that we have developed and maintained       through the completion of       WADA-commissioned research.
The WADA is the global authority for       anti-doping and their reports       have a powerful influence on international agencies and agendas.
Thus, our       work impacts policy       and practice globally (WADA), continentally (European Commission) and       nationally (UKAD and       UKA).
The WADA's re-investment in our research team over nine years       identifies us as their       preferred research team for systematic, rigorous and impactful reviews       around doping in sport and       prevention education.
We identify eight main points of impact:            Our work has challenged established norms and practice in the         delivery of anti-doping         education and the shaping of anti-doping policy.
The WADA stated that         our reports "provide           a strong evidence base for anti-doping organizations to not only start           building education           and prevention programs, but those needing to adjust or justify           existing programs.
From           WADA's perspective these include our Ministries of Education Pilot           Project and our Play           True Generation Program".
In an impact statement, the Head of         Education and Athlete         Support at UKAD has provided further evidence of our impact on         challenging current         practice, and shaping future strategies, in the field of anti-doping         education.
Our publications have influenced practice and professional           services.
Policy and practice         at UKA has been impacted through Backhouse's role on the Anti-Doping         Policy and         Support team.
For example, she successfully advocated that UKA altered         their strategy to         target the wider athletics community.
UKA's Anti-Doping Manager stated         that Backhouse's         "education knowledge has been invaluable to the development of this           strategy which aims           to provide appropriate and effective anti-doping education for all           sections of the athletics           community in the UK".
UKAD have also drawn on our research         findings and expertise to         inform their four year education strategy (2011-2015).
Our research findings help to define best practice.
Based on         the 2007 and 2009         reviews, Backhouse was invited to provide expert advice to the European         Commission via         the Ad hoc Group of Experts on Doping in Recreational Sport.
Through this role, and in         collaboration with other international experts, Backhouse is sharing         best practice and         making policy and practice recommendations for doping prevention across         all 28 member         states of the European Union.
Backhouse has delivered workshops for         organisations such         as UKAD and Sports Medicine Australia to challenge and shape their         anti-doping strategy.
A further impact of our research relates to the influence that the         findings have had on global         debates on public policy and practice.
In response to our         reports, the WADA has altered         the anti-doping landscape of the global sports community.
This community         includes         researchers, international and national commissioners of research,         international and         national sport governing bodies, and sports performers and         professionals.
The WADA's         Director of Education stated that our 2007 and 2009 reports provided to         the WADA have         "proven to be key elements in the area of anti-doping social science           research.
Your reports           have been cited in most of the recent applications for WADA's Social           Science Research           Grant Program and, more generally, in many non-WADA funded research           reports".
Global economic and organisational impact has been achieved by         directing the WADA's         social science research priorities and funding streams in anti-doping.
Specifically, our         research has informed the worldwide allocation of research funds and         this has created a         strategic and evidence based funding agenda.
Therefore, our findings         offer a reference         point for further research on the social science of doping within and         beyond our institution.
Our research has challenged conventional wisdom and stimulated           debate among           stakeholders.
Following our 2007 recommendations, anti-doping         policy has shifted to         recognise the importance of values and skills-based education.
Both         reviews highlight the         need to establish global collaborative networks of researchers and         practitioners.
As a         result, the WADA has created a Researcher Directory (www.wada-ama.org/en/Education-           Awareness/Social-Science/Researchers-Directory/) to develop a         network of key         stakeholders and to increase visibility and awareness of social science         research.
The seventh main point of impact concerns health and welfare impacts         through the         influence on continuous professional development of practitioners             and researchers.
The initial research linked national and international beneficiaries         through collaborative         projects.
These links have supported the professional development of two         research         assistants (Atkins and Patterson) who were involved in the WADA funded         projects.
In         addition, the research team have secured internal funding for three         full-time PhD bursaries         (Director of Studies, Backhouse).
External funding from the Rugby         Football Union (see         section 3) is supporting the first graduate of this programme (Whitaker)         to pursue post-doctoral         research in the field.
Our commitment to addressing the gaps in the         literature, and         extending the research agenda, has given rise to a critical mass of         researchers focused on         doping and anti-doping in sport.
For example, Whitaker's PhD thesis         marked a significant         step in identifying the risk and protective factors of doping in sport         through the novel         application of the Prototype Willingness model.
Since the impact of our work is global and expressed through         world-wide education         programmes implemented by the WADA, our work provides direct benefit           to the health           and quality of life of sports performers.
Engagement with         education programmes founded         on our research, improves the awareness, understanding, and attitude of         sports         performers.
In turn, this contributes to a reduced risk of potential         harm associated with         reducing and preventing doping in sport.
In the UK, our impact is         demonstrated by the         7000+ athletes and their support personnel who have received anti-doping         education from         UKAD since 2011.
