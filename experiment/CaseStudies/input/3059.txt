Bringing new audiences to Aristophanes through accessible           translations     The research described in (2) above was disseminated through a "revised       edition" (actually, an almost complete rewrite) of the 1973 Penguin       translation of Acharnians, Clouds and Lysistrata (3g).
This work was designed especially to provide a closer translation which,       together with the introduction and annotations, would incorporate advances       in scholarship since 1973, including Prof. Sommerstein's own       contributions, among them the ideas published previously or subsequently       in (3b-f).
In the five years 2008-2012 this volume sold a total of         46,668 copies across all parts of the English-speaking world and       beyond (more than 85% of them outside the UK, including 3,646 in India:       see 5.1).
On the book recommendation site www.goodreads.com, from 1.1.2008       to 16.7.2013, the 2002 Penguin has received an average rating of 3.81 out       of 5 (5.2), and most of the comments indicate that both the comic and         political aspects of the plays have been successfully conveyed, often         to readers who previously knew little or nothing about ancient drama.
For more advanced students, the Aris &amp; Phillips editions of four other       plays (3a), completing a series covering all Aristophanes' eleven       surviving comedies, also provided a freshly constituted Greek text and       detailed commentaries.

Helping directors, performers and audiences         to "engage with history and the present day" through theatre productions     The Penguin translations have been selected as the basis of numerous theatre         productions (there were at least ten applications for permission to       perform them between January 2008 and July 2013), most notably a       production of Lysistrata at the University of Nottingham's       Lakeside Arts Centre Theatre in April 2013 to which Prof. Sommerstein       acted as consultant, providing important background information to the       director and offering "a useful sounding board [for his] initial       explorations into the text and concepts for it" (5.3).
The director had       chosen Sommerstein's translation from ten he had read because its       "language was the most accessible to the modern actor and audience       ...whilst all the time managing to stay faithful to the spirit of         Aristophanes[;... its] sense of fun and play and incredible       attention to period detail ... helped us to engage with history and         present day at the same time."
(5.4)     The six performances drew an audience of 1,222 (over 50% above the       expected numbers: 5.3) from across the East and West Midlands, and       attracted significant media attention (e.g.
from the Nottingham         Evening Post and the Guardian Online education section:       5.5).
Feedback from the many school and college teachers and students who       attended was exceptionally enthusiastic: of 38 teachers who answered the       question "How would you rate tonight's theatre education experience?
", 36       replied "excellent" (5.6), and their detailed comments showed that (as the       production team reported to the University afterwards) the production had       "proved ... that classical Greek drama most definitely could be         accessible, very funny, and extremely relevant to audiences of today"       and truly "fit[ted] well with Lakeside's core aims of presenting         access to excellence across the visual, performing and participatory         arts" (5.3).
In addition, Prof. Sommerstein recently assisted the National Theatre         (NT) to create a rounded presentation of Greek theatre for a         wide-ranging online audience by contributing, as one of three       speakers, to a short film on `Greek Comedy and Satyr Drama', published by       the NT in March 2013 on its YouTube Discover Theatre channel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-BvMbfkxcc)       and aimed especially at "students and teachers of English and Drama".
As       of 16.7.2013, this video had been viewed 2,120 times by a wide audience of       teachers, school children, theatre audiences, undergraduate students and       lifelong learners, thereby fulfilling "the objective of the National       Theatre to create content that is rich with information and available to       all".
According to the NT's digital content producer, "The contribution of       Alan Sommerstein was invaluable... as his particular knowledge on Greek       Comedy... illuminated that it was a vibrant, popular and important aspect       of Greek Theatre despite the greater prestige given to Greek Tragedy.
It       was our objective to create a collection that presented Greek Theatre       fully and thanks to Alan's knowledge this objective was satisfactorily       met" (5.7-8).

Contributing defining texts to curricula in Classics and Theatre           Studies throughout the English-speaking world     Both the Aris &amp; Phillips editions and the 2002 Penguin translations       are also now used as prescribed or recommended texts in several units of       the OCR and AQA AS and A-level Classics syllabi: OCR AS Unit AH1, A2 Unit       G3, &amp; A2 Unit CC9 (cf.
5.9a); and AQA AS Unit 1 Civ 1 &amp; A2 Unit 4       Civ 4: (cf.
5.9b).
These texts give sixth-formers the opportunity of       studying versions of the plays which are much more accurate, and         reflect more up-to-date scholarship, than those previously in use       (including the same translator's 1973 Penguin), without sacrificing intelligibility         or approachability.
A teacher at Loughborough Grammar School wrote       that the Aris &amp; Phillips Thesmophoriazusae "proved invaluable       for the students ... [and] brought the comedy alive" (5.10).
They have       also proved an inspiration to teachers and students of Drama and Theatre       Studies, for which the Penguin translation of Lysistrata has since       2009/10 been designated as a set text within sections A and B of the       "Theatre Text in Context" compulsory unit in the Edexcel A-level, A2       syllabus (5.9c).
A teacher of Drama at Barking Abbey School wrote that       this translation had helped students to "come up with some really       excellent concepts about how they would realise their concept of the play"       (5.10).
In addition, the Aris &amp; Phillips editions are now widely used as       course texts in HEIs throughout the English-speaking world (as evidenced       in 5.11 by statements and course descriptions from the UK, USA and New       Zealand), and they often inform course content along with the key articles       listed above (especially 3b) and with Sommerstein's Greek Drama and         Dramatists (London: Routledge, 2002) in the role of a reference       textbook.
One course convener (Victoria University of Wellington) writes       that "it would be impossible to teach Aristophanes without         Sommerstein" and that in three different Greek literature courses       "reading any works [of his] significantly influences the students'       understanding of the plays they study".
Another (University of Manchester)       requires students, in preparation for a seminar on Lysistrata, to       "look at one of the articles by Sommerstein listed in the bibliography and       consider how [his] views may have changed/developed since [1990]".
These       details, together, reflect the degree to which Sommerstein's texts and       translations have become the authoritative version of Aristophanes for       educational purposes &#8212; the "gold standard" as a third course convener       (Loyola University of Chicago) puts it &#8212; and is benefiting students and       teachers alike through access to up-to-date scholarship.
