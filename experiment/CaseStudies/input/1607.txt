     The model of farmers' decision-making developed by Willock and colleagues       has had a significant impact on (1) the development of Scottish Government       policy towards farming practices and the environment, (2) farmers       themselves through the guidance provided to them in pursuit of Scottish       Government policy, and (3) current Scottish Government policy towards       agriculture and climate change, as follows:     (1) Scottish Government policy towards farming practices and the         environment       European Union Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC, which came into effect on 19       December 1991, required all Member States to identify areas at risk of       nitrate contamination and to devise Action Programmes to reduce or prevent       future contamination.
Following The Scotland Act (1998), responsibilities       for agriculture and for the environment were devolved from the Westminster       Parliament to the Scottish Parliament.
In 2003, the Scottish Executive       (now Scottish Government) designated four areas in Scotland as nitrate       vulnerable zones (NVZs).
Thereafter, the Scottish Executive Environment       and Rural Affairs Department funded Willock and co-investigators from the       Scottish Agricultural College (SAC, now part of Scotland's Rural College)       [source 1] to conduct two research projects (Ref.
115-3138; Ref.
541-6157)       to examine farmers' activities in response to and attitudes towards the       2003 regulations and NVZs as designated.
Findings from the first study,       conducted in 2004/5, showed that farmers were often sceptical towards the       introduction of NVZs and often made few efforts to comply with the       requirements of the legislation.
The second study, conducted in 2006/7,       collected data from interviews with 376 Scottish farmers and from farmers       who attended four workshops, one in each of the NVZs in Scotland.
The       subsequent (2007) report of this study [source 2] produced findings and       recommendations designed to inform the Scottish Government in introducing       revised legislation under the EU Nitrates Directive.
In particular, this       report made five policy recommendations to promote       environmentally-oriented behaviour that would comply with NVZ Regulations.
These recommendations, based upon the model developed by Willock and       colleagues, had an impact on public policy and services in the Scottish       Government's implementation of The Action Programme for Nitrate Vulnerable       Zones (Scotland) Regulations 2008.
(2) Guidance provided to farmers in NVZs       The 2007 report of farmers' practices and awareness in relation to NVZs       identified differences between NVZ farmers and non-NVZ farmers in their       attitudes towards production and water management and environment.
As       noted above, farmers were often sceptical about the designation of NVZs       and thereby less likely to comply with the requirements of the       legislation.
The report also noted the potentially damaging effects that       mandatory environmental schemes might have on farmers' attitudes towards       the environment.
Of the recommendations included in the report, therefore,       two were designed specifically to have an impact on the guidance to be       provided to farmers to promote environmentally-oriented behaviour, as       follows:            Information must be clearer and it must reach all farmers in NVZs;       The scientific messages must be made more clearly and more         convincingly.
These recommendations were taken up in the preparation, framing, and       dissemination of the Guidelines for farmers in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones       [source 3], issued in 2008 by the Scottish Government.
Willock et al.
's       research has, thereby, had an impact on society, culture and creativity       through guidance issued to farmers under the Action Programme for NVZs.
(3) Current Scottish Government policy towards agriculture and climate         change       The model of farmers' decision-making developed by Willock and colleagues       continues to influence the policies of the Scottish Government.
In 2011,       the Scottish Government introduced its Agriculture and Climate Change:         Evidence on Influencing Behaviours Programme, to be carried out by       analysts in the Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services       Division.
This programme has three main aims:            to gain a better understanding of the range of factors influencing         farmers' behaviours (in general, and in relation to environmental         issues);       to consider the effectiveness of the climate change mitigation         measures in use/available to policy makers;       to consider how policy makers in Scotland, and opinion formers working         with farmers, could most usefully draw on these behavioural insights to         refine the suite of initiatives which aim to influence farming practice         in relation to mitigating climate change.
In its most recent (2012) report [source 4], this branch of the Scottish       Government takes the model developed by Willock et al.
to provide the       relevant evidence for understanding how farmers' behaviour is influenced       by `socio-economic, psychological and farming variables within a       comprehensive framework' (2012, p. 41).
The 1999 research conducted by       Willock and colleagues, and the model that it produced, thus continues to       impact upon public policy and services in Scotland.
