     Transgendered youth suffer high rates of harassment and violence.
To       address this, following Sci:dentity McNamara co-founded, with Jay       Stewart, Gendered Intelligence (GI).
Now the leading organisation in its       field, GI has received funding from, among others, the Equalities and       Human Rights Commission, Metropolitan Police, Allen Lane Foundation and       Awards for All.
Through GI's organisational vehicle, the research         impacts on: trans youth; mainstream youth; teachers; support       agencies; policy forums.
Kinds of impact include promotion of       self-esteem, changed attitudes, new training for teachers, training in       best practice for support, opinion forming among policy makers.
Described       as `invaluable' and `ground-breaking' in its impact on trans       youth nationwide the work is recognised at governmental level, through       formation of Equalities Office policy and commendation by the Minister         for Schools.

Promoting self-esteem in trans youth     Using techniques from McNamara's work GI developed a trans youth group       and mentoring service.
Sessions have involved over 60 family members and       care workers.
It has run 96 activities, some with Dulwich Leisure Centre       and Tavistock Clinic, for 941 youth.
Attendees said they were helped in       securing their identity and self-confidence (source B).
Phillip, 21:     Attending GI has been an invaluable social resource and a chance ...         to belong and feel safe somewhere... this experience has been           a huge boost for me.
(source B)     Kairos Soho, a London LGBTQ organisation and publisher, describe a       workshop:     This impact in the moment was reported as ground breaking amongst         participants ...
This is a specific example of the way of working that         impacts widely, one which is undoubtedly linked to the space that GI         occupy spanning academia and practice..... GI is an organisation that we         would approach if we wanted to really think about something &#8212; we         generally do not get this within the sector.
(source A1)     B. Delivering understanding and best practice in public bodies     GI offers both community resources and training sessions and workshops,       based on the research, for institutions seeking to develop more inclusive       policies and practices.
More than 69 organizations have commissioned       sessions.
GI also works with influential forums including The Gender       Recognition Panel User Group, Stonewall Education Coalition, the       Anti-Bullying Alliance, the Parliamentary Forum (source D).
In Bristol the NHS, City Council, LGB Forum and Bristol Primary Care       Trust have used GI's specialist knowledge.
Other clients include       universities (UC Falmouth, East Anglia, Anglia Ruskin) and charities       (Action for Children, Brook London, Antidote, Camden Sexual Health and       Education Team) alongside Southwark Council, Lambeth Council, Metropolitan       Police, City YMCA (London) and Equal Opportunities Flanders (source B).
Positive evaluations throughout indicate that the training changes         what people actually do (source B).
Graham Reed, of Brook London:     As a result of the training that GI delivered, Brook staff           feel more confident in delivering services to young Trans         people.
(source A2)     Ali Godfrey, of Generation Arts:     When setting up my own new organisation, I have been mindful of what I         have learnt from GI.
This has impacted ... in very simple everyday ways         of working like making the gender question on our application form more         inclusive.
(source A3)     Hannah Redler, of the Science Museum:     The unique perspectives members of the group brought to the issues         around technology and biomedical science ... continue to influence me         and ideas I have about programme[s] moving forward.
(source A4)     On a larger scale GI has helped create policy for the Government         Equalities Office, who said:     GI's `research and practical insight...gave us a unique insight into         the needs of trans youth... Their work helped to inform and shape the         trans action plan; and reinforced our commitment to ensure that the         needs of trans youth [were] reflected in the plan.
(source A5)     C. Training teachers and changing attitudes     Since 2009, GI has worked with 2090 students in 32 schools, colleges and       youth groups, challenging ideas that produce discrimination.
Over 70%       found these workshops useful.
Kirsty Yeoman, director of studies, Hereford Sixth Form College:     GI is different from other organisations as it provided detailed         insights into the experiences of the needs of young transgendered people.
(source A7)     GI has developed training for new teachers to equip them to discourage       bullying of queer and trans students.
Katherine Nissen, of the University       of St Mark &amp; St John, Plymouth, has taken over 400 trainee teachers to       GI's training conferences:     The conference day is the most rewarding day of my working life each         year...
I know how much of an impact the GI sessions will have on these         students and the hundreds of children they will teach during their         careers.
(source A8)     These workshops were observed by the Department for Education's       Anti-Bullying Team.
While policy prohibits civil servants from endorsing       the work of companies such as GI, the value that the Team put on GI's work       led to its being praised in July 2011 in a speech by Nick Gibb MP, the       Minister of State for Schools (source C).
