     The NEEMARC archive is both a physical, library-based resource, and,       increasingly an online resource by which original documents can be       accessed and searched.
It is a developing facility, with plans to draw in       and work with as wide a range of the public as possible.
The most       measurable impact is the extent to which it has been used since its       inception as a research resource by those outside the academy.
Measures of Impact:       The method of access to the archive will change to become largely online       as the process of digitization develops.
The following gives     (i) Walk-In Users 2011-2012:       Of 128 registered users in academic year 2011-2, 69 (54%) were academics;       2 (2%) were school students; 57 (44%) were from outside the       Learning/Teaching world     Of the academics, 66 (96%) were undergraduates, mostly from Sunderland, 3       (4%) were postgraduates.
One of the latter was from another University       (Tubingen in Germany).
Of the users from outside academia, the 'area of interest' breakdown was                                Personal interest (unspecified)           30           53%                             Family History           12           21%                             Mining History           9           16%                             Local History           4           7%                             Social History           2           3%                             Total           57                                     Online users:       It is already evident that online access has resulted in a rapid increase       in the scale and geographic scope of usage of the archive.
These are early       days in the process of digitization which will be continued in 2014-6.
Methodologies for evaluating the purpose of online access and its meaning       for the public are still under development.
The evidence below is a       preliminary analysis of the usage of the archive online.
Between April       2012 and January 2013 the NEEMARC website was used by 816 people situated       in 104 British towns and cities who may have made multiple visits.
The largest concentration of correspondents was in the region,       particularly Sunderland and Newcastle, but significant numbers resided in       Glasgow, the Midlands and London and the south east.
There were thirty       four worldwide users drawn from countries in five continents, the most       frequent foreign visitors being from the United States (26), France (16),       Australia (13) and Germany (13).
Peak times for the use of the site are       February to March and October to January reflecting the term times and       research periods in schools, colleges and universities.
Between April 2012       and January 2013 of 816 visits 502 were new visitors and 343 returning       visitors.
[Source: Google Analytics]     The digitized records came online in March 2013, so it is early days in       the process of analysing the users and collecting feedback from them as to       their background and interests.
One of the future projects is to design       more precise measures and follow-up interrogation of users.
(ii) The Process of Creation of the Impact and the Role of the         University of Sunderland            The creation of the archive was a crucial research activity for the         Unit, but the supporting research gives us a depth when it comes to         advising both the providers of these vital records and their         users.
NEEMARC is a cumulative archive which add to the collection in the         future, and continuing collaboration with the trades union and the         Institute of Mechanical and Mining Engineers (Newcastle upon Tyne)         continues to develop.
The academic staff of the University of Sunderland, as part of the         NEEMARC partnership, has provided the physical base for the archive,         and, through the Cultural and Regional Studies Beacon, the funding for         its digitization.
The online access is via the University's website.
We can say, on the basis of the available data, that the non-academic         users are driven by interests in family and community history, with         personal interests sustained by their descent from mining families          Dr Stuart Howard also a consultant and contributor to 'Britain In Their       Sites: Peterlee', BBC Radio4, May 2009, presented by Tristram Hunt,       produced by Julia Johnson (in it NEEMARC was referenced explicitly).
