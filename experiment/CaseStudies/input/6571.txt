     Research conducted at the University of Southampton has a) challenged         conventional wisdom       held by the UN bodies and stimulated public debate on safe water       statistics and b) informed         policies of the UN, WHO, and UNICEF on safe drinking water.
Wright's discovery that current UN guidelines overestimate access to         safe drinking water has         informed a contentious policy debate over the methodology used to       assess progress towards       Target 7c in the MDGs.
The Global Water Forum, a UNESCO initiative to       present knowledge and       insight from leading water researchers and practitioners, published a       summary of the findings in       July 2012, which said that 32m represented a "sizeable difference         compared to the 70m that have         begun to use improved water sources in these countries between 1990 and         2008."
The research findings on progress towards Target 7c of the MDGs has also       made an impact by       contributing to public debate.
In March 2012 the BBC Radio 4 and       World Service programme       More or Less, which questions and debunks official statistics in       the news, carried the findings in an       interview with Wright's co-authors at Bristol (5.1).
Two months       later the BBC's Environment Analyst       Roger Harrabin, drawing on Wright's research data from Jordan and       Nicaragua, reported that the       number of people without drinking water may be much higher than UN       estimates (5.2).
The report       quoted WHO sources as having "let Mr Ban (Ki-Moon) know in no uncertain         terms that his office         has badly understated the scale of the drinking water crisis."
In       May 2012, the findings were       discussed in a Scientific American article (5.3).
A blog post in       August 2012 by the director of the       Australia-based Development Policy Centre cited both the BBC and the       Global Water Forum       reports in its criticism of the UN.
Wright's work has therefore made an       impact on health through the       provision of better indicators for monitoring health and well-being.
The debates have prompted the UN Secretary General's Advisory Board on       Water and Sanitation       to recommend more meaningful and better resourced international         monitoring.
In their report       on Post-2015 Global Goal on Water, where they cite the work of Wright and       his co-authors, they       state that `Indicators and effective monitoring mechanisms need to be         built and adequately         financed to measure progress towards these 3 objectives', which       include `universal access to         sustainable sanitation and drinking water that is really safe' (5.4:       p. ii).
Wright's research that highlighted the effectiveness of ceramic water       filters in Zimbabwe and South       Africa was one of just three such studies included in an early Cochrane       Systematic Review and       one of five studies in a later review (5.5, 5.6).
The       systematic reviews were taken up by UNICEF       and WHO, as is normal practice, to develop a new policy-drive to push         home water treatment.
The Cochrane Review conducted by Clasen et al.
(5.5) was used in a       2008 UNICEF policy paper       to justify the new initiative, pointing out that low-cost home water       treatment interventions can result       in net savings to the public purse (5.7).
A 2011 WHO report, Strategic         Consultation on Household         Water Treatment and Safe Storage, cited the Hunter review (5.6)       to stress that home water       treatment can reduce diarrhoeal incidence, presenting the case for rolling       out new treatment       systems (5.8).
These policy papers in turn led to proposals to       promote home water treatment by       the 163 members of the International Network to Promote Household Water       Treatment and Safe       Storage, which is co-hosted by the WHO and UNICEF.
The stated aim of the       network, made up of       government health departments and NGOs, is "to contribute to a         significant reduction in         waterborne disease, especially among vulnerable populations, by         promoting household water         treatment and safe storage as a key component of water, sanitation and         hygiene programmes."
On influencing practitioners and NGOs, Wright et al.
's research       is cited by appropedia, which       promotes technology that works.
The website promotes the Kisii Filter       Bucket, and Wright's work is       one of three cited references on the filters' effectiveness (5.9).
