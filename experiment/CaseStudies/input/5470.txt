     Process / Events from Research to Impact     As a direct result of the aforementioned research studies, Carter &amp;       Shaw have been invited into sustained engagement with policy makers from       the national and devolved administrations, and internationally through the       EU, helping to inform and develop the economic case to support women       entrepreneurs.
Engaged scholarship is a cyclical process in which research       and impact interact over time, with little clear demarcation of either       stage.
Their early studies stimulated and informed a policy debate which       led to further research, either commissioned by government agencies or       funded by research councils.
As the research evidence base was developed       and became more familiar to and trusted by policy makers, opportunities       for engagement became more frequent.
Through an engaged process, where the       process itself becomes impactful, Carter &amp; Shaw have helped shape and       influence policy within the UK and devolved governments; influenced       practice among business support organizations; and improved the       understanding of factors that underpin access to finance opportunities for       diverse enterprises.
Description of Impact     Strathclyde research drawing attention to the importance of women       business owners in economic development and growth has been widely       accepted in policy circles, where the work has both stimulated policy       debate and influenced the framing of policy.
Impact on policy at UK       government level commenced during the New Labour administration and has       continued during the Coalition administration post-2010.
The researchers       engaged in meetings, seminars and private briefings with staff at the       Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS); at a 10 Downing       Street seminar under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Gordon Brown       (15/1/2008), with John Hutton, then Secretary of State for Business,       Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform, and Stephen Timms, then Minister for       Small Firms; with Geoffrey Norris, Head of the Downing Street Policy Unit       (28/1/2008); and Lord Davies, then Minister of Small Firms at BIS       (18/1/2010).
Carter's membership of the UK Government's Women's Enterprise       Task Force (WETF) (Source 1) and her chairing of the Swedish Presidency       Workshop at the EU Conference `From the European Charter for Small         Enterprises to the Small Business Act', Stockholm (6/10/09) (Source       2) provided opportunities for further impact on policy.
In September 2012,       Carter chaired the Women in Enterprise Commission at the Scottish       Government / STUC Women's Employment Summit, was subsequently appointed to       the Scottish Government's Strategic Group on Women and Work, and chaired a       series of workshops on women in enterprise for the Scottish Government,       some attended by John Swinney MSP Cabinet Secretary for Finance,       Employment and Sustainable Growth in the Scottish Government (October 2012       - April 2013).
The Scottish Government's Draft Framework and Action Plan       [2], co-written by Carter, included some of the key ideas and activities       identified as a result of these workshops.
The draft document was       circulated for consultation in May 2013 and recommendations incorporated       into the Scottish Government Enterprise Strategy.
Working with banks and leading finance institutions, Strathclyde       researchers have helped improve understanding of the complex factors that       constrain access to finance and assisted development of innovative       solutions to improve relative access to finance among diverse enterprises.
Carter and Shaw established strong relationships with senior bank staff       within the UK and internationally in the process of collecting data and       disseminating research findings.
While many personnel changes followed the       financial crash of 2008, their engagement continued across a range of       banking and finance organizations, including Carter's membership of the       Global Banking Alliance Advisory Board (2007-2009).
Shaw chaired events       for Independent Women, a wealth management consultancy in 2011 and joined       the Impact &amp; Innovation Committee of Foundation Scotland in 2012;       Carter, a Board Director of Women's Enterprise Scotland, has also worked       with RBS in its Supporting Diversity initiatives.
The need for a       specific focus on women's enterprise, and particularly their opportunities       to access finance, was recognised within the UK Enterprise Strategy (2008)       and Women's Enterprise Task Force Final Report (2009).
Access to Finance       was one of the central pillars of work identified within the Women's       Enterprise Task Force and was the subject of a joint banks and       policy-makers roundtable expert discussion at HSBC's Head Office in Canary       Wharf (2008).
Furthermore, the Women's Enterprise Task Force successfully       lobbied for a &#163;12million co-investment fund for women (the Aspire       Co-investment Fund).
Through the Enterprise Research Centre (ERC), Carter       currently leads the Diversity &amp; SMEs work-package with Monder Ram       (Birmingham), which aims to develop innovative approaches to improving       access to finance opportunities across diverse groups.
Reach and Significance:     The impact of the Strathclyde research has been to stimulate policy       debate regarding the importance of women's enterprise in economic       development; to influence the framing, development and implementation of       policy at various levels of government; and to influence the banking       sector in its understanding of the factors that underpin access to finance       opportunities for diverse enterprise.
The UK Government's Enterprise Strategy 2008 `Enterprise: Unlocking         the UK's Talent', published as a supplementary paper to the Budget       in March 2008, identified women as an under-represented group of       entrepreneurs (Source 3).
The Enterprise Strategy 2008 also announced       details of a &#163;12.5million capital co-investment fund for women and cited       Carter and Shaw (2006) [1] twice in Chapter 4 `Access to Finance'       pp.51-52, Section 4.16: "There is clear evidence that women-owned         businesses start with lower levels of overall capitalisation, and         research has established unequivocal links between this initial under         capitalisation and subsequent business performance&gt;."
... "The       research consistently shows that women-owned businesses have lower ratios       of debt finance; and are much less likely to use private equity or venture       capital."
The focus on women's business ownership as a source of economic growth       was more recently highlighted by the Women's Business Council's (2013)       report published by the Department of Culture, Media &amp; Sport / BIS       (Source 4) which cited Carter et al.
(2013) [5] in the following statement       "However, we also believe that there is substantial untapped benefit         due to women not achieving their full potential in enterprise         activities.
Currently, majority women-led Small and Medium Enterprises         (SMEs) contribute &#163;70 billion to Gross Value Added."
Among business support organizations, our work has influenced local and       regional provision of business support for women-owned firms by providing       a substantive evidence base that has helped secure recent EU and UK       Government funding for women's enterprise initiatives.
In 2013, Alison       Price, Chair of the Women's International Centre for Economic Development       (WICED), wrote, "Your research has been absolutely crucial in the         creation of WICED which is a global first in providing gender sensitive         business incubation, business support, policy influencing and social         entrepreneurship.
We would particularly like to acknowledge the         importance of your research in providing the empirical evidence required         to help shape the WICED model and its role in contributing to the         independent evidence base which has helped secure over &#163;9M private and         public investment in female entrepreneurship support infrastructure in         the North West of England.
I know you will be delighted to know that the         WICED facility achieved 100% occupancy in its first year of operation,         almost 2 years ahead of schedule and it now supports 74 new and growing         female owned enterprises onsite, in addition to over 340 new female         business start-ups annually and is in itself a fully sustainable social         enterprise.
We believe that this success is a reflection of the         effective adoption of a number of your research findings relating to         female entrepreneurship and the financing of women owned enterprises.
Further to the development WICED we would also like to acknowledge the         contribution that your research is making in the context of gender and         entrepreneurship in the current development of the Liverpool and         Manchester City Regions Local Enterprise Strategies and the framing of         the new European Structural Funds Programme, nationally and specifically         within the North West of England.
We would like to express our thanks to         you, Professor Shaw and the other members of your team at the Centre for         your continued work in this field as it is indeed making a critical         contribution in helping shape effective policy and practice in         supporting female entrepreneurship."

Dinah Bennett, Vice-Chair of the Women's Enterprise Policy Group, advisor       to the European Commission's ECOSOC Committee on Women's Entrepreneurship       and advisor to the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Entrepreneurship,       similarly reports that she "drew heavily on your [Carter &amp; Shaw's]         research findings to inform the development of enterprise policy         supportive of women entrepreneurs' access to bank finance...
In each of         these roles I have also drawn from the implications of your research,         using these to inform policy development".

Among banks and finance providers, the Strathclyde research has led to a       greater awareness of factors that underpin women's access to business       finance and has contributed towards a growing understanding of the need       for women entrepreneurs to raise initial capitalisation.
Although       women-led businesses perceive higher financial barriers, start with lower       levels of overall capitalization, use lower ratios of debt finance, are       much less likely to use private equity or venture capital, and are more       likely to be discouraged borrowers, there is almost no evidence of       supply-side discrimination, but substantial concerns exist that       demand-side debt avoidance is more pronounced among women.
The role of       government in correcting this `market failure' was seen in the creation of       a government backed &#163;12 million Aspire co-investment capital fund for       women, introduced in 2009 to help support high growth, women-owned       ventures, following the Women's Enterprise Task Force Final Report.
While       co-investment funds support high growth potential businesses, there is       residual concern that women-owned (and minority-owned) firms requiring       lower levels of finance continue to perceive difficulties in accessing       finance and may constitute the bulk of discouraged borrowers.
These       concerns are being addressed through the Enterprise Research Centre's       work-package on Diversity &amp; SMEs led by Carter.
The ERC is co-funded       by the British Bankers Association and enjoys senior level engagement with       Irene Graham, Director of the British Bankers Association taskforce, Dr       Richard Roberts, Director of SME Market Analysis at Barclays Bank and       Stephen Pegge, Director of SME Markets, Lloyds Banking Group, who are       supporting a focus on access to finance and perceptions of discrimination       among diverse SMEs.
