     The establishment of a suite of instruments by the MRC Epidemiology Unit       between 1993 and 2010 for measuring physical activity in different       population groups and settings and the production of an on-line DAPA       toolkit led by the Unit for the MRC Population Health Sciences Research       Network in 2011 to facilitate methodological knowledge exchange (1) has       promoted the use of measurement tools that are fit-for-purpose.
For       example, in its report on Measuring diet and physical activity in weight       management programme, the National Obesity Observatory cites the DAPA       toolkit as a source of information on questionnaires (2).
It also cites       validation work on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire       (IPAQ) (Ekelund et al, Public Health Nutrition 2006), a widely used       instrument for assessing the prevalence of inactivity which was used       recently in an analysis of global physical activity levels.
Although instruments such as IPAQ are useful for surveillance, there was       a need for a simple quick assessment tool that can be used in primary care       to identify inactive individuals as part of the assessment of risk.
The       short version of the EPIC-Europe questionnaire that was validated by       comparison to repeated measures of objectively assessed energy expenditure       (Wareham et al, Public Health Nutrition 2003) has formed the basis of the       General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) recommended by       the Department of Health (3) as a screening tool to be used in routine       general practice to provide a simple physical activity index.
The validity       of the instrument provides one justification for its use, but the       Department of Health report also cites the evidence from the Unit's       research showing that this simple tool independently predicts events such       as cardiovascular incidence and mortality (Khaw et al, Int J Epidemiol       2006).
The MRC Epidemiology Unit's research on physical activity, sedentary       behaviour and different outcomes has contributed to the recent revision of       the UK Chief Medical Officers' recommendation on physical activity (4)       with the work in adults ( Ekelund et al, Am J Clin Nutr 2008) and children       (Steele et al, Am J Clin Nutr 2009) being cited in the review of the       current scientific evidence relating sedentary behaviour to obesity (5)       which was undertaken as part of the work leading to the formulation of the       new guidelines which place a greater emphasis on the avoidance of       prolonged periods of sedentary time.
A number of pieces of NICE Public Health guidance have emerged over the       past 5 years aimed at describing the effectiveness of different approaches       to promoting physical activity.
The NICE Public Health Guidance (6) on       physical activity and the environment cites the Unit's analysis of       temporal trends in physical activity in the United Kingdom (Stamatakis et       al, 2007).
The more recent guidance on promoting walking and cycling (7)       cites the Unit's systematic review of interventions to promote cycling       (Yang et al, BMJ 2010) in the supporting evidence for the guidance       including Expert Testimony Paper 5 &#8212;Programmes to promote cycling.
The       recommendations for future research in this guidance draw heaving on       Expert Testimony Paper 3 which cites multiple publications from CEDAR to       demonstrate an approach to the evaluation of infrastructure developments       which have the potential to integrated walking and cycling into people's       daily routines.
This includes the evaluation of interventions such as       CONNECT2, a SUSTRANS project funded by the Big Lottery Fund to transform       everyday travel for local people in communities across the UK, creating       new bridges and crossings to overcome busy roads, rivers and railways, and       linking these to networks of walking and cycling routes, making it easier       for millions of people to walk and cycle for everyday journeys (8).
Evaluations of this type are able to demonstrate impact of overall and       domain-specific physical activity levels but are unlikely to be able to       demonstrate an impact on health outcomes, which need to be modelled rather       than directly observed (Jarrett et al, Lancet 2012).
The papers describing       the results of these models have contributed to analyses not only of the       benefits of promoting physical activity on health outcomes but are cited       in more extensive analyses of the health effects of climate change (9)       since physical activity, transportation, energy use, pollution and climate       change are closely linked issues.
