     The beneficiaries primarily include six villages (Merudandi, Purbapara,       Gotra, Naserkul, Rangapur and Tepul &#8212; population 9000) in West Bengal (sources           1, 2, 3), two in Cambodia (Prey Veng &amp; Kandal Provinces &#8212;       serving 4000 people) and one in Malaysia (trial supply in place) and a       small community in Lummi Island in the Washington State, USA (30 families,       source 4).
The technology has already been accepted by three       Government water agencies in India, Malaysia and Cambodia.
The impact is primarily provision of safer water at a low cost.
Apart       from benefitting hundreds of people directly, many communities are advised       to set up their own plants through online support system created by the       team (www.insituarsenic.org).
Interested people from all over the world       visit the group's website for more information (11112 hits during 15       January 2009 - 28 June 2013 and thousands of email queries).
More than 300       people visit this website every month and ask questions about this       technology using an on-line query.
Plants of 10,000 litre capacity based on the current design cost US$ 6000       (mains supply &#8212; India) and US$ 10000 (solar &#8212; Cambodia) respectively.
Solar plants have no recurring operation cost while conventional plants       cost US$ 1 to produce 10,000 litres of water.
Recently a plant operating       on solar power has been designed by QUB and installed by Royal University       of Phnom Penh in Kandal Province of Cambodia which is prone to heavy       floods.
Such plants produce safe water even at the worst flood situations.
All plants were set up by local plumbers and electricians from locally       available components.
Dates of impact     The research that started at QUB as a matter of concept development with       EU funding, was implemented for the first time anywhere in the world as       full scale replicable technology in 2008 by the QUB personnel for       supplying safe water to rural communities at a very low cost.
Between 12 June and 10 November 2008, Sen Gupta and his QUB team       installed 6 community water treatment plants in West Bengal, India, close       to the Bangladesh border (sources 5, 6).
Further       experimental plants were set up in Washington State (January 2011), Kota       Bharu, Malaysia (September 2011) and in the Prey Veng &amp; Kandal       Provinces of Cambodia (September 2011 &amp; February 2012).
The cleaner       water had a remarkable impact on the affected population.
Most people in       an advanced stage of arsenicosis showed signs of recovery in less than a       year [video clip (6.45 min, interview of the people starts after 3.5 min:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf-8wX-Y_Bc)].
Because the plants constructed are continuously operated, the impact is       ongoing.
The scale of the impact (e.g.
numbers of people affected,       outcomes in terms of health benefits, economic outcomes, lives saved, and       quality of life) is described above, and summarised in Section 1.
Other value-added activities     Community training programmes, mostly in cities, since 2008 &#8212; seven in       India; one each in USA, Cambodia and Malaysia.
India, Malaysia and USA are       three strategic country partners of QUB.
Community and rural outreach activities:     (i) Rural training events: 8 in West Bengal, India, 3 in Kota Bharu and       Kuala Terengganu (Malaysia) and one in Lummi Island, Washington State,       USA.
Total number of participants exceeds 2000 people.
(ii) Train the trainers programme for setting up water treatment plants:       Calcutta (3), Tata Steel City, India (3), and Phnom Penh (2).
Total number       exceeds 1000.
In a meeting held in Calcutta on 15 November 2011, between the Vice       Chancellor of QUB, the Deputy High Commissioner of UK and the Chief       Minister of West Bengal, a large water scheme for 0.7 million people in       Nadia District of West Bengal for arsenic removal using QUB's SAR       technology was approved.
The construction work started immediately.
The       new community plants run on solar power.
