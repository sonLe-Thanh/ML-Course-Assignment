     Process from research to impact     The original idea and research arose from Kerr at WestCHEM.
Initial       results with a WestCHEM-funded       PhD student led to interest from AstraZeneca who then decided to       collaborate with Kerr,       through funding an additional PhD student to work on the project at       WestCHEM.
The success of       those two students' research and frequent interactions between the Kerr       group and AstraZeneca       then led to immediate and extensive testing of the methodology at WestCHEM       and also within the       company on many of its drug candidate compounds.
Type(s) of impact     Process improvements     The Global Head of Isotope Chemistry at AstraZeneca explicitly indicates       the quantitative       difference that these catalysts are making within their drug discovery and       development       programmes.
In drug candidate compounds that are susceptible to HIE       reactions (about one-third       of all their drug candidates), 90% now use the Kerr catalysts while 10%       still use the older Crabtree       catalysts.
Since these studies underpin the development of all of the       AstraZeneca drug candidates,       it is clear that the new catalysts have a pervasive and significant       influence on the development of       new medicines within this multinational company.
Of course, since       AstraZeneca were parties in the       original collaboration first published in 2008, it is to be expected that       they would still have a lead in       applying it to their work.
New product ranges     An extension of the impact has been the adoption of the new catalysts as       commercial products by       Strem Chemicals.
They have marketed and sold the catalysts since October       2012 and in the 9       months since launch, [text removed for publication]     Reach and significance     Labelled compounds form an essential part of drug discovery and       development within the       pharmaceutical industry, allowing a rapid understanding of the metabolism       of candidate drugs, and       discrimination between candidates that can be progressed and those that       must be rejected.
Efforts       to improve the efficiency are important; efficiency gains of 10% in the       study of the pharma-cokinetics       of candidate drugs would bring savings of the order of $100M per drug.

The pharmaceutical industry is now applying the new technology directly       to its pipeline of       pharmaceutical candidates, with AstraZeneca in the lead, but with uptake       gathering pace globally.
At present, the principal impact is on operational efficiencies and cost       reductions for the       pharmaceutical companies, but the impact passes to the population at large       through the provision       of safer, more effective medicines at lower cost and with less       environmental impact.
The Global Head of Isotope Chemistry, AstraZeneca (Source 1) notes:     `The Kerr catalysts are now `state of the art' in this area of         labelling.
Indeed, on analysing our         internal data for the past 15 months (Jan. 2012 - March, 2013), within         our global drug         discovery programmes at AstraZeneca, of the tritiation by isotope         exchange, 90% of all         compounds investigated were labelled with the Kerr-type catalysts.
I         would predict that this         level of impact will continue within our company and will be replicated         within similar         organisations internationally.'
The former Associate Director of Isotope Chemistry, AstraZeneca, M&#246;lndal,       Sweden, currently an       independent consultant, (Source 2) says:     `These new catalysts have changed the map for the isotope chemist         world-wide and         especially in the pharma business.
The Kerr catalysts have been         transformational in that they         have delivered notable efficiency savings, with tritiation cycle times         down from approximately         3 weeks to less than 1 week; as well as these time savings, the use of         these catalysts at         such low loadings has significantly reduced (radioactive) waste.
These         catalysts are now         available from a commercial supplier and all chemists can use them very         easily.
Moreover,         they are shelf stable and, based on the confidence delivered by their         efficiencies, D tests are         now often discarded in drug projects, with the experimentation going         directly to the `hot'         process on the T manifold.'
(D = deuterium; T = tritium).
Further impact has arisen and continues to increase from the business of       Strem Chemicals who       now manufacture and sell the catalysts.
The Chief Operating Officer, Strem       Chemicals (Source 3)       reports:     `The commercial availability of Prof. Kerr's novel iridium complex         technology for the R&amp;D         community is significantly increasing the adoption, and future potential         use, of his associated         catalysis methods in industry in the widest sense and especially within         pharmaceutical         companies.
We have already seen interest and direct purchases from a         series of drug         companies and others in evaluating the technology in their direct         business-aligned         applications.'
Within the first year, Strem Chemicals' products were purchased by [text       removed for publication]       thereby extending the beneficial reach of Kerr's catalysts.
The application of the new catalysts within the pharmaceutical industry       ultimately impacts on       mankind, since we are dependent on the development of safe and effective       medicines at       reasonable cost and without detrimental effect on safety or the       environment.
Use of the Kerr       catalysts is helping to speed up drug discovery and development, allowing       a rapid understanding       of the metabolism of candidate drugs, and discrimination between       candidates that can be       progressed and those that must be rejected.
