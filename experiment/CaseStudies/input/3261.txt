     Rudd's 1995 article sparked media interest, leading to interviews       regionally, nationally (Radio 4's PM, Radio 2, BBC1 North-West Tonight       22/1/96) then internationally (BBC's World Service, stations in South       Africa and Australia 1996).
Since then, he has fairly regularly been asked       to discuss Blyton on radio and TV (e.g.
BBC North-West Tonight, 3 July       2000).
He was asked to write pieces on Blyton for the TES (3/1/97) and       for The Scotsman (21/6/00).
He was featured in a British Council       film (4/97), distributed internationally, and was interviewed/consulted       for three other programmes (Channel 4: Banned (Golliwogs, 4/05), Writers         and their Homes (`Blyton at Old Thatch', 4/05; Secret Lives:         Enid Blyton (16/12/96).
He was also featured on an award-winning       programme for Radio Netherlands (Mother Goose, 10/02) and a Woman's         Hour special `defending' Blyton (27/11/08).
Many non-academic groups       have asked him to speak over the years, from librarians (e.g.
Nottinghamshire County Libraries, 11/96) to, most recently, Lancashire       Women's Institutes, with 142 attendees [17/4/13]).
He has also spoken at       the Enid Blyton Literary Society (1996, 2000), and the Children's Book       History Society (2008).
In 2011, Seven Stories invited him to speak       alongside novelist and former Children's Laureate, Anne Fine (12/05/11,       available:http://soundcloud.com/7stories/enid-blyton-event/s-oZGeP).
His research was ground-breaking in challenging negative perceptions of       Blyton.
His impact has resulted in her work being taken more seriously,       with Rudd himself often being asked to contribute to this re-evaluation.
The widespread nature of this impact makes it hard to pin down to       specifics.
But it has infiltrated society at all levels, as shown, for       instance in ephemeral references like being quoted in Private Eye's `Pseud's       Corner', on the BBC's Quote Unquote, and in a New Statesman       competition (9/2/96) on Homeric rewrites of Blyton.
Rudd's engagement with the public concerning Blyton's work has been       continuous, repeatedly asked to comment on issues around sexism, racism,       nationalism, etc.
Much of this is ephemeral (personal testimonies, letters       and emails), but there are more overt markers, such as the decision to       mount the Blyton exhibition at Seven Stories (May 2013 -), as a       result of public demand, following on the success of the evening with Anne       Fine.
This exhibition (in which his work featured; he was also a       consultant) has currently received 41,078 visitors (7/11/13).
His       monograph also led the head of Trocadero (which acquired Blyton rights) to       meet Rudd to discuss the marketing of their Blyton oeuvre (as have other       organisations/publishers).
Most recently, the Canadian novelist Randy       Boyagoda consulted him for a Paris Review article on Blyton:       http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/06/25/five-in-the-colonies-enid-blyton%E2%80%99s-sri-lankan-adventures/.
The decision of the Open University to include Blyton on their       Literature syllabus (which first ran in 2010 with 1700+ takers) was also a       result of Rudd's impact, hence he was commissioned to write a chapter for       their coursebook.
Likewise, a number of schools and libraries have felt       emboldened to feature Blyton's work again, and have written letters of       appreciation; e.g.
I read some of your work on Enid Blyton and it did go some way to my       decision to increase and to some extent replenish the stock of Enid Blyton       books at my branch library.
...
The general feedback ... was extremely       positive.
...
I would say that your writings on EB gave me confidence in       considering her value as a writer despite her ideological and literary       shortcomings.
(Phyllis Ramage, Librarian, Harrow; email November 2013)     Leaving aside academia, his work has been reviewed in populist       publications, attesting to his work's impact in helping to articulate       and/or change views: `It is a fresh and very exciting approach to Blyton       that is likely to re-ignite (let alone kindle) interest in her work ' &#8212;       Sophie Smallwood, The Enid Blyton Society Journal.

`A thorough, sensible and balanced defence of Blyton.
This is a work of       judicious advocacy.
Some of its best sections demonstrate the blatant       misreadings, contradictions and emotional animus which have characterised       so many attacks on Blyton...Overall this is a timely and competent       corrective study.'
&#8212; Books For Keeps     The survey alone was a mammoth undertaking, but it is matched in scale by       Rudd's mastery of critical theory in general and of Blyton criticism in       particular and ...his knowledge of Blyton's vast oeuvre.'
&#8212; Children's         Books History Society Newsletter     `Rudd's enthusiasm for his subject makes a riveting read... Rudd clearly       has a brilliant mind, which together with an infectious enthusiasm, and a       dislike of poor scholarship, has helped to produce a book that is one of       the most important contributions to the study of children's literature       ever published.'
