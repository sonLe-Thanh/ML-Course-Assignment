     The European space industry has an annual turnover of approximately &#8364;8B       and employs over 35,000 people [evidence item c].
The UK space       industry has an upstream turnover of &#163;930M and a downstream turnover of       &#163;6.6B per annum, and directly employs over 8,000 people, mostly in highly       skilled occupations [evidence item d].
Over the past number of       years Dr Menon and his group have, uniquely for a UK-based mathematics       research group, worked with almost every major European company in this       sector, including Astrium (UK/France/Germany, turnover &#8364;5B), Thales/Alenia       Space (Italy, turnover &#8364;2B), GMV Space (Spain, turnover &#8364;50M), SCISYS PLC       (UK, &#163;43M), Deimos Space (Spain, turnover &#8364;20M).
Total research income to       Dr Menon's group from these contracts has exceeded &#8364;400K and has supported       4 full-time PhD students, a level of ESA funding that is unmatched by any       other maths-based research group in Europe.
As a result of these       collaborations, the WCAT software tool developed by Dr Menon's group has       transformed the way that the European space industry performs V&amp;V. Use       of the tool by European Space companies is now actively encouraged, and       increasingly mandated, by the European Space Agency, through specific       requirements written into Statements of Work (SoW) [see evidence item         e and evidence item f] for recent and future ESA projects.
By leveraging the power of advanced global optimisation techniques, and       packaging these methods in a user-friendly software environment, WCAT       allows industrial companies to make significant reductions in the cost of       the V&amp;V process for advanced space control systems.
This potential has       now been demonstrated in a number of different ESA-funded projects, across       several different application platforms.
The results of the application of       the WCAT to an autonomous satellite rendezvous system developed by the       Spanish company GMV, where a "chaser" satellite is required to rendezvous       with and capture a small canister containing samples from the surface of       Mars.
While 1000 Monte Carlo simulations (taking more than a week of       computations) uncovered no failure cases, the WCAT found a case for which       the chaser failed to capture the canister in only 339 simulations [1]       representing a saving of 60% in the cost of this stage of the V&amp;V       process.
In another recent study [2], use of the WCAT for the V&amp;V of an       attitude control system for a flexible telecoms satellite revealed       significant shortcomings in the traditional Monte Carlo simulation       approach.
For a range of satellite fuel-tank filling ratios (FR), two       hybrid optimisation algorithms encoded in the WCAT (HGA and HDE) were able       to identify higher values than Monte Carlo simulation (MC) of a       sensitivity function (S) reflecting the fragility of the attitude       controller to uncertainties in the bandwidth of the satellite's flexible       modes.
This more accurate evaluation of the controller's robustness was       achieved in each case with fewer simulations than the 1000 typically       required to ensure adequate statistical confidence intervals in MC       simulation campaigns.
Based on the demonstrated successes of the WCAT tool on several recent       projects, Dr Menon's group were approached by ESA in 2012 to produce an       updated version of the tool [evidence item e].
This work, funded       directly by ESA via a &#8364;60K research contract directly with Exeter       University (ESA Contract No.
4000104541) will leverage recent theoretical       work by Dr Menon's team on surrogate modelling and robust safety-margin       analysis to produce an enhanced and expanded version of WCAT for       application to a number of future ESA missions [4,5].
Head of Guidance and Control at ESA [see evidence item a]     `Our team at ESA and other key industrial partners significantly         benefit from the advanced verification and validation tools developed at         Exeter.
The benefits are in terms of the reduction of the time to market         and associated development cost while achieving sufficiently reliable         validation and verification results for multiple projects.
Especially         the methodology and tools developed at Exeter is capable of determining         the worst case performance and safety margins of designs and missions in         an efficient and consistent manner.'
Dr Menon was keynote speakers at an international workshop on "Worst Case       Analysis Tools For Guidance Navigation &amp; Control Systems" organized by       ESA at ESTEC headquarters in Noordwijk on November 13th &amp;       14th 2012 [evidence item g].
This workshop, which included       participants from all the major European space companies, research       organizations (CNES-France, DLR-Germany) and leading US/EU universities       (Berkeley, Minnesota, Stuttgart, Exeter) has effectively set the agenda       for ESA-supported research and development in this field for the next five       years.
In February 2013, Dr Menon's group initiated a new collaboration       with the Advanced Studies Group at Astrium UK in Stevenage, with the aim       of further integrating the WCAT tool into Astrium's design process for a       range of current and future missions [evidence item b].
In October       2013, Dr Menon's group was awarded &#163;50K, by esteemed CREST 2 &#8212; UK Space       Agency initiative of significant national importance [evidence item h], to       integrate the Worst Case Analysis Tool for developing a rapid auto tuning       tool for the Generic Rover Dynamics Model framework with Astrium Ltd.,       Stevenage, which also aim towards final integration and testing at ESA       Harwell Centre, Harwell, Oxford.
