     i) Expanding the domains where Welsh is used by young people: By       2001, this issue was recognised as a principal strategic theme in language       planning in Wales.
Citing `the research results', C6 acknowledged how       Gruffudd's research made them aware of the importance of influencing the       language of young people's languages domains.
As more and more Mentrau Iaith [Community Language Initiatives] came into       existence, so did the recognition through earlier experience with Mentrau       Myrddin that the use of Welsh by young people was a core area for       community language planning, policy and strategy.
Gruffudd's research       findings were now influencing the planning processes of a variety of       beneficiaries from the grass roots level, to the Chief Executive of       Mentrau Iaith Myrddin (C3) and senior Welsh Language Board staff.
From 2008, planning for the use of Welsh by young people has become       central within all Mentrau Iaith, as evidenced by annual reports and       corporate plans (C7).
All have appointed specific officers to promote the       use of Welsh with young people in the last five to ten years.
The impact       of Gruffudd's research in the Carmarthenshire area has been particularly       noticeable, leading in recent years to Welsh language care clubs, the ownzone       project, a youth theatre and an innovative pastoral service as evidenced       in C8.
C3 has stated that "...the strategic development work carried         out by the Mentrau Iaith in Carmarthenshire with young people was         largely based on the research into language use by this particular age         group undertaken by Gruffudd.
The model has now been used and adapted         across Wales, with Mentrau Iaith providing young people with more social         opportunities to use the language."
Recently, the use of Welsh by children and young people was identified as       an important strategic area by the Welsh government in `A living         language: a language for living &#8212; Welsh language strategy 2012-17',       pp.
28 - 32 (C9).
(ii) Embedding the tracking of linguistic progression between key         stages: The underpinning research highlighted marked differences in       approach in more traditionally Welsh-speaking counties, e.g.
Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire.
The guidance given to parents and       students here was weak and Gruffudd argued for a more proactive approach.
As a direct consequence of Gruffudd's report, language progression policy       was revised.
According to C2, the research has "...ensured that         consideration of linguistic progression and the language continuum have         become embedded in the language and education planning processes of         Welsh county councils from 2008 onwards."
C4 has stated that: "Ceredigion's Educational Language Strategy was         launched in 2008.
Gruffudd's research was instrumental in informing and         guiding policy and practice.
During the time immediately before the         blueprint for the Strategy was formed, Gruffudd was invited to visit the         Ceredigion Education Scrutiny Committee and address it on various         aspects of the research results.
This undoubtedly contributed positively         towards the Authority's establishment of the Strategy, directly         informing the Strategy's tracking of Welsh-medium provision and         progression between different key stages and influencing the whole         process of establishing new schools in the county....
Recently, the         strategy was a factor in motivating Ysgol Gynradd Aberteifi to switch         from being a mixed-medium school to being a Welsh-medium school [...]         Unquestionably, this dependable body of research advanced the case for         improving Welsh-medium education in the county."
In 2010, the Welsh government produced its Welsh medium education         strategy (C10), describing it as `a historic milestone'.
For the       first time ever, the Welsh government tracks and sets progression targets       for Welsh-medium education, between KS 2 and 3, and KS 3 and 4.
`Local         authorities will be expected to agree targets for Welsh-medium         education, to be submitted as part of their Welsh in Education Strategic         Plans to DCELLS for annual monitoring from 2011.'
(p.22) This       national strategy puts in place the proposals made by the research       commissioned by ACCAC in 2004, along with the previous reports by       Gruffudd.
(iii) Expanding Welsh medium school education in the context of         language policy for the normalisation of a minority language: RHAG [Parents         for Welsh medium Education] used the underpinning research as a       basis for its own normalisation plans for Welsh medium education.
A       particular example of this [which can be corroborated by C5] is the 1999       plan RHAG formulated for the Swansea region.
It argued for (i) a sixth       form at the only Welsh medium secondary school in the area, (ii) a second       Welsh medium secondary school, and (iii) new schools in areas of the       authority where lacunae were identified based on an analysis of demand       using Gruffudd's research's arguments for holistic, geographically       balanced, normalisation of the provision of Welsh medium primary schools.
The normalisation plan, again using the template provided by Gruffudd's       research, was presented in the context of enhancing national language       policy by contributing to the maintenance of Swansea's percentage of 13%       Welsh speakers and for the County to measure the demand for Welsh medium       education.
During 2008 - 2013, (i) and (ii) had been embedded in the       system and a substantial inroad made into (iii) with two new schools       opening in areas high on the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation in 2011.
C11 notes a rise in the percentage of 7 year olds receiving Welsh medium       education in Swansea from 8.6% (2001) to 12.6% (2011).
Gruffudd's research has informed the activities of RHAG and persuaded him       to engage in the campaign for Welsh-medium education as the pressure       group's elected Chair in 2000-03 and 2009.
He is presently its research       officer, and in 2012 was elected Chair of Dyfodol i'r Gymraeg, a       cross-party pressure group for the Welsh language.
RHAG has campaigned with parents and local government to develop Welsh       medium school education across Wales, leading to the opening of 15 new       Welsh medium primary schools since 2008.
C12 provides an evaluation of the       growth of Welsh medium education 2002 to 2012.
The Welsh government's Welsh medium education strategy (C10),       states that it now expects `local authorities to plan effectively for       Welsh-medium provision' (p.13).
The body of policy-changing research       produced by Gruffudd, often for government agencies, informed, influenced       and led in part to this `historic' statement.
