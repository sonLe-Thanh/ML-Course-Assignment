     Time pressures, coupled with increased access to convenience foods, mean       that busy people continue to buy ready meals.
Approximately 270 million of       these products were sold in the UK in 2012, demonstrating their hold over       the nation's eating habits.
Researchers from the University of Glasgow have helped consumers to make       straightforward choices between healthy and unhealthy convenience foods.
Using an innovative dual approach, they developed the highly successful       line of Eat Balanced pizzas,a as well as a 7-day online menu       plan that is available on the Eatwell Everyday website.b These       two complementary initiatives offer a fresh approach to tackling poor       nutritional choices and have received extensive global media attention.
Lean has also conveyed the concept of healthy fast food directly to       consumers through his involvement in public engagement activities.
For       example, in June 2013, he was invited to speak at the York Festival of       Ideas, a two-week cultural programme comprising more than 120 free events       held across the city.
The Eat Balanced pizzas come to market     Pizza is a popular ready meal that is worth around &#163;800 million annually       in UK sales.
The Eat Balanced pizzas are the direct result of       collaboration between the University of Glasgow and Glasgow-based food       company Eat Balanced.
The CEO of Eat Balanced,c Mr Donnie       Maclean &#8212; whose business objective was to make it easier for people to       achieve a balanced diet without compromising convenience and taste &#8212;       explains how the partnership with the University of Glasgow came about: "I         ran various ideas past a few leading academics, but the one who was most         engaged and shared my passion was Professor Lean.
His wealth of         experience with the balanced plate and many other publications were very         relevant to what we wanted to achieve and meant that we quickly shared         the same vision.
When we experienced challenges, Mike always used his         experience and wisdom to tackle the issue and find solutions."
Bringing the Eat Balanced pizzas to market also involved other UK       companies, including Cosmo's (a pizza manufacturer) and Seagreens&#174;       (who sourced the seaweed included in the pizza dough).
The Eat Balanced pizza range, which currently comprises cheese and       tomato, spicy chicken, and ham and pineapple varieties,a fills       a gap in the market by providing a ready meal that is both quick to       prepare or cook and healthy.
More than 25,000 Eat Balanced pizzas have       been sold in the UK since they went on sale in September 2012.c       The pizzas are stocked in Scottish stores by Sainsbury's and Asda and are       available for home delivery by Ocado in England and Wales.a       Asda and Sainsbury's are the second and third largest supermarket chains       in the UK by market share, respectively, while online grocery retailer       Ocado makes more than 18,000 deliveries to British households daily.
The University of Glasgow concept of nutritionally balanced convenience       meals has earned considerable media attention; consequently, the Eat       Balanced pizza has achieved international recognition within an extremely       short timeframe (around 18 months).
The pizzas have featured in BBC       Scotland News TV coverage (second most shared and third most read page on       the whole BBC News website that day, and the most popular story in the       Scotland section of the BBC website), the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme       (interview with Lean) and the BBC Radio 2 Factoids show with Steve Wright.
They have also been mentioned in articles published (either online, in       print, or both) by Daily Mail, Guardian, Metro, Daily Record, The       Scotsman, The Courier, Yahoo.com, New York Daily News, Times of India, Die       Welt, Asian Correspondent, Canada TV News, Top News Arab Emirates,       Huffington Post, and Gizmodo.a,d The Eat Balanced pizzas also       featured on primetime UK television when Maclean appeared in The       Entrepreneurs, a two-part documentary following the fortunes of a group of       Scottish new-start businesses that aired on BBC2 on 24th April and 1st May       2013 to an audience of about 24 million.
Eat Balanced has been recognised by several business organisations and       has received a total of 10 awards.a The pizzas were showcased       in March 2012 at the Food &amp; Drink Expo in Birmingham, UK.
This       exhibition is the largest food and drink trade show held annually in the       UK, with around 550 exhibitors and 20,000 attendees, including buyers from       major retailers and wholesale distributors.
The Eat Balanced pizza range       won the Best New Idea award at this event, an initiative designed to       support the launch of new products.a,e More than 50 exhibiting       companies put their products forward in 2012 and visitors to the show       voted for their favourite product.
The manager of the showa       stated: "Eat Balanced Pizzas are truly innovative and have the scope to         make a huge impact on how consumers eat; we hope being named Food &amp;         Drink Expo's Best New Idea helps them achieve this."
The pizza range       also won the Best New Product award at the UK Best Business Awards (2012).a,f       These awards recognise business excellence and are open to private, public       and third-sector organisations; four rounds of judging are conducted       annually by 20 independent experts, with winners holding their title for       12 months.

Credibility of meal-based balanced nutrition endorsed by leading           experts     In addition to creating the Eat Balanced range of healthy pizzas, the       University of Glasgow researchers have delivered practical targeted advice       to further help the general public engage with nutritionally-balanced       eating.
The Eatwell Everyday website &#8212; which features the menu plan       developed and tested at the University of Glasgow &#8212; was launched by the       FSAS in Dundee on the 30th April 2013.g This event, which       focused on the science of nutrition, was opened by Michael Matheson MSP,       the Scottish Government Minister for Public Health.
In the first 3 months       after its launch, the Eatwell Everyday website received 9,058 page views       from 1,397 unique visitors in nine countries, including the UK, USA,       India, and Australia.h The user-friendly and common-sense       nature of the Eatwell Everyday menu plan was highlighted by The Herald and       Medical Xpress (with a combined potential audience of around 2.5 million).i     The Eat Balanced pizzas show solely green (low) and amber (medium) levels       of fat and salt content on their food labels (in accordance with the June       2013 Department of Health front-of-pack nutrition labelling scheme).
In       February 2013, a representative from the Scottish National Rugby team       announced that the Eat Balanced pizzas formed part of the preparatory diet       of the players ahead of their winning Royal Bank of Scotland 6 Nations       match against Italy.a,j The team's lead nutritionist stated: "The         Eat Balanced pizza is not only a great idea, it's a great product too         and one which can easily be integrated into the player's nutrition         plans.
Typically pizza is seen as a guilty pleasure but the Eat Balanced         pizza can be used as part of a fuelling or recovery strategy without the         player being concerned about an excessive salt or fat intake."
