     The outreach programme run by the Philosophy Department and its students       has played a crucial role as a medium for communicating our research.
`Philosophy in the City' (PinC), which was founded in 2006 as a schools       outreach programme, now has links with eight local schools and other       institutions involving young people, such as afterschool clubs and the       Roundabout homeless shelter.
A significant part of this activity is       student-led, where seminars and discussion groups are run by our       undergraduate and graduate students, based on the sort of research-led       teaching they have received themselves within the Department.
PinC has       been very successful, serving as a model for programmes developed by other       departments at Sheffield (such as `History in the City'), while also       receiving external recognition (for example, in 2007 it came runner up in       the THES award for Outstanding Contribution to the Local Community).
From early June 2008, academics in the Department gave lectures at the       annual PinC conference called `Philosophize!'
in which the schools came       into the University for a day of activities.
More recently, teachers       involved in the programme suggested greater staff involvement and asked us       to provide lectures in schools, in addition to the seminars run by our       students.
This process began in 2011, with individual staff visiting       particular schools.
We have now intensified this activity with a series of       school visit days, an educational programme which we have called `The       Examined Life'.
For these events, a variety of schools bring pupils into       the University for the day.
The series has involved over 320 local Y10       students, from six schools.
The main focus of the day is the staff       lecture, which is then backed up by seminars led by our students.
Hopkins       and Bennett both gave lectures at Silverdale school and Stern and Saul       spoke at Outwood academy, while Olson, Stern, Hookway, Saul and Shemmer       have each given lectures to audiences from a variety of local schools in       the `Examined Life' series.
There is clear evidence that both forms of activity have been successful.
Reports from both teachers and students regarding the individual staff       visits were extremely positive.
Commenting on the lectures by Hopkins and       Bennett at Silverdale, the teacher concerned remarked `Both of the         lectures were brilliant.
Chris Bennett's lecture, and the preliminary         and follow-up sessions had a profound impact on the way that my students         thought about punishment.
The idea that punishment was something that         someone might have a right to had never occurred to them previously.
Rob         Hopkins' insights into the emotive aspects of the paradox of fiction         were equally novel and thought-provoking' [S1].
The `Examined Life' days have also been highly successful.
The Head of       Philosophy/RE at Meadowhead School commented on `A fantastic day that         delved deeper into the issues raised as it evolved through the seminars.
Students were able to develop their beliefs and challenge others to do         the same.
A thoroughly enjoyable introduction to higher education'       [S2].
Feedback from the whole body of pupils also showed positive       engagement with the events, with enjoyment rated at 6/10 overall, 23% of       the respondents rating the experience as 8/10 or above and 28% expressing       an interest in studying Philosophy at degree level [S3].
Figures from       Silverdale school alone were even more impressive: 73% said they `thought       differently about the issues' after the Examined Life days, while 60% said       they were now more likely to go to university, with 80% saying they would       now choose Sheffield as the place to study for their degree [S4].
Comments       include: `Re-evaluated my thoughts on society and morals...influenced         me to question the origins of my morality more than ever before'; `I now         understand my concept of morals better', `it makes me think about         impacts of actions more', `made you think deeper about the things you         wouldn't normally', `it made me look at other aspects of Philosophy',         `gave me a chance to voice and discuss my opinions' [S3].
The success of these activities has led to local schools changing their       curriculum provision in line with the research areas of the department.
For example Silverdale school's entire KS4 RE and SMSC provision for Y10       students is delivered through `The Examined Life' series.
Work from       Silverdale school shows a profound engagement with the research topics.
For example, a number of student essays now offer animalism as a sensible       approach to take on questions of personal identity, through exposure to       Prof Olson's work [S1].
In addition to the direct impact of our teaching on the school pupils, we       have also used our research expertise to engage with the teachers       themselves.
On 24th June 2013 we organized a conference for A-level school       teachers working in philosophy, which was attended by 29 teachers and       covered 22 schools from across the country.
This event enabled us to       broaden the teachers' understanding of the curriculum, and ways in which       it might be made of more interest to their pupils, by offering `state of       the art' accounts of current research, based upon our expertise.
The       conference was a great success, with 71% of attendees rating the subject       knowledge refreshment aspect as Excellent.
93% felt the conference would       have a lasting impact (41% at a significant level) upon their teaching.
Comments included: `interesting new areas I wouldn't have previously         covered or would have done differently'; `extra "string to bow"         as a CPD/INSET course'; `the content/presentation of lectures         gave me a lot of good ideas for teaching similar areas of the         curriculum'.
All attendees expressed an interest in attending       similar events in the future and all are keen to work with us to develop       the format and other school and college events [S5].
Taken overall,       therefore, this case study shows how we have delivered impact at the level       of civil society, cultural life, education, public discourse and public       service, in the following respects:            informing the intellectual lives of school children, while leading         them to think about and question various aspects of their ethical and         social lives, and their heritage       providing access to advanced philosophical ideas in an accessible way       helping provide ideas and intellectual skills to enable school         children to participate in discussions on philosophical issues       enabling schools to deliver education in these areas more effectively,         and assisting in the career development of teachers
