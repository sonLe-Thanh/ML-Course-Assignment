     Context     The Surrealism Centre afforded a context in which academic research was       able to inform the exhibitions and artistic collaborations described.
Received views about Surrealism were challenged, and new, inventive       approaches to display were adopted, thus animating gallery spaces and       encouraging more active audience engagement.
Through collaboration with       the Centre, major contemporary artists were led to discover in Surrealism       a fruitful source of inspiration for their creative practice (5.1, 5.2).
i. Subversive Spaces: Surrealism and Contemporary Art       (2009) Whitworth Art Gallery; Compton Verney, Warwickshire; Sainsbury       Centre, UEA.
Visitor total: 72,922.
Pathways to Impact     Subversive Spaces was developed with the Whitworth Art Gallery as       a flagship, ambitious loan exhibition.
It adopted the rubrics of inner and       outer space in order to trace two distinct itineraries from Surrealism to       contemporary art.
A key section dealt with themes of interiority and       psychic disturbance, drawing extensively on Lomas's research into       Surrealism, psychoanalysis and hysteria.
The exhibition explored       commonalities between Surrealism and more recent art.
Reach and Significance     i.
The Whitworth's visitor numbers (49,966) represented a huge increase       on the same period in previous years.
The Gallery's report notes that Subversive         Spaces `showed an increase in the 25-45 age group (31%), a target       group we are keen to increase'.

Louisa Buck, on BBC Radio 4's "Front Row", commented: "What's so good       about this show is it is very, very well curated."
Manchester         Confidential reported "This is the Manchester art scene pushing its       limits, eliminating them, and providing something at international level".
Visitor book comments were highly appreciative.
The exhibition was       included in The Independent's Five Best around the Country, The         Art Newspaper's Pick of the Week, and The Times' Critics'       Choice.
(5.7)     Mounting an exhibition on this scale and ambition has transformed the       Whitworth's approach to exhibitions and its public perception.
According       to the Director, `the process enabled the Gallery to develop a new mode of       academic engagement, which culminated in an internationally significant       exhibition'.
(5.9) Other impacts:     a.
The gallery was led to develop a wholly new system for managing loans.
(5.7)     b.
A downloadable pdf self-guided visit pack for teachers and students       was produced that was so successful the gallery's Learning Team now       produces similar resources for every major exhibition.
(5.7)     c. The complex planning and design led to new guidance protocols for       curators.
(5.7)     d. Subversive Spaces was followed by other cutting-edge shows       that moved the Whitworth centre-stage in Manchester's contemporary       cultural scene.
(5.7)     At each of the venues, educational programming and outreach activities       targeting groups within local communities were scheduled: their success is       a notable feature of the final project report.

Narcissus Reflected (2011) Fruitmarket Gallery,       Edinburgh.
Visitors: 30,003 (exceeding target figure of 25,000).
Pathways to Impact     This exhibition was a main outcome of the Centre's AHRC-funded project on       Surrealism and sexuality.
The Narcissus subject &#8212; a vehicle for homoerotic       desire in Surrealist and more recent art &#8212; allowed the research to be       presented in a format that was accessible to a public audience.
Careful       selection and arrangement of works enabled viewers to appreciate meanings       and make connections themselves.
Reach and Significance            Visitors' book comments demonstrate the excitement felt by visitors.
(5.6) The gallery's report to its funders noted, `the exhibition         attracted audiences who may not otherwise come to the Gallery... visits         to the website for Narcissus Reflected were up 22.9% on the same         time last year to 13,777 visits... Facebook referrals are up 53% at 358         visits and Twitter has seen the most impressive jump in visit         referrals'.
(5.6)       The gallery noted increased donations compared with equivalent         periods.
Bookshop takings during the exhibition were &#163;23,778, far higher         than the target of &#163;17,000 as well as for previous exhibitions.
(5.6)       The exhibition was extensively and appreciatively reviewed in the         local and national press as well as in art journals: for example, `this         is a great show of ideas, rich and complex' (Independent on Sunday);         `a clear and careful show... the results are both visually intriguing         and highly scholarly' (The Times).
(5.5)       The exhibition gave Fruitmarket a new sense of its potential: through         the mix of works, the loan of prestigious objects, the academic input,         and the reaching out to new audiences.
As staff attest, and newspaper         comments agree, the exhibition changed Fruitmarket's profile relative to         other galleries in Scotland.

Artist collaborations     Pathways to Impact     Owing to the reputation of his Surrealist Bureau (Manchester Museum, seen       by an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 visitors since 2005 (5.8)), US artist       Mark Dion was commissioned to produce a work responding to the       Dada-Surrealist collections at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
German       artist Gregor Schneider produced Kinderzimmer, an installation to       accompany Subversive Spaces.
Colm T&#243;ib&#237;n declared Kinderzimmer       `the most exciting and compelling single space created anywhere for a long       time' (5.3).
After participation in a roundtable discussion (2010) hosted       by the Surrealism Centre, in 2011 Ron Athey recruited a team of local       artists and orchestrated a new performance on automatic writing in the       university's Whitworth Hall.
Reach and Significance     Each case illustrates how dialogue with academic researchers has given       fresh stimulation and new challenges to artists, influencing their       practice and exposing it to different contexts.
