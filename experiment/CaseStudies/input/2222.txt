     The importance of the results of the research work undertaken at       Newcastle University as part of the research projects were recognised by       the industry partners (Bombardier Transportation, Alcan) and the UK Rail       Safety and Standards Board.
These organisations (and in particular       Bombardier Transportation, who had collaborated in the work and       co-authored publication P1) informed the standardisation organisations of       the project results.
As a result of these activities the output from this       work was incorporated into two European standards (S1 and S2 as listed in       section 5), both adopted across Europe in 2008:            EN 15085 Railway applications &#8212; Welding of railway vehicles and         components (in particular Part 3, Annex H).
EN 15227 Crashworthiness requirements for railway vehicle bodies.
One of the elements of the research output that facilitated the uptake of       the project results was the fact that the joint redesign solution provided       to prevent weld unzipping did not affect normal operations and       manufacturing processes to a significant degree and therefore the market       uptake was almost immediate.
The main recommendations involved the use of       an alternative filler wire, Al-Mg, that proved to provide a microstructure       more resistant to tearing, instead of the Al-Si normally used by the       industry, and also a localised thickening of the extrusion cross section       at the joint to compensate for the strength loss arising from the heat       input from the welding process.
The latter joint design feature was the       result of an optimisation process as excessive thickening of the cross       section resulted in promoting weld unzipping.
These two standards have       been mandatory for railway vehicles since April 2008, and remain in force       now.
The former Head of Crash Safety at Bombardier has confirmed in a letter       to the University that the standards were developed on the basis of the       research carried out at Newcastle, making two key statements (S3):            The R&amp;D work carried out at Newcastle University was of           excellent quality and its significance was recognised at an early           stage in the project by our Legislation and Standards Group which is           heavily involved in the development of Rail Standards in Europe.
The           manner in which the work was carried out was in line with one of the           Bombardier key objectives of "Flawless execution".
Importantly these standards would not have been introduced without           the recommendations and underlying scientific work carried out at           Newcastle University.
All European rail vehicle manufacturers have to comply with the standards       in order to market their products, and all worldwide manufacturers wishing       to sell aluminium rail vehicles in Europe have to ensure that the vehicles       comply with the standards.
The European annual rolling stock market is       worth in excess of &#163;10 billion (S4), and most new build unpowered rolling       stock is aluminium rail vehicles.
The former Head of Crash Safety at Bombardier also notes (S3) that EN       15227 is now being embedded into a Technical Specification for       Interoperability.
The European Interoperability Directive (2008/57/EC)       sets out a number of essential requirements to be met for interoperability       in the European rail system, which include safety, reliability and       availability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility       along with others specific to certain sub-systems.
The Directive also       requires the production of mandatory Technical Specifications for       Interoperability (TSIs) which define the technical standards required to       satisfy those essential requirements.
TSIs in essence set out the expected       performance levels of the European railway system, and so standard will be       a benchmark for new product development in aluminium rail vehicles for the       European market.
The Head of R&amp;D of the Rail Safety and Standards Board has noted that       the research has (S5):     "made a significant impact on the safety of aluminium rail vehicles in         Europe and beyond."
The motivation for the original research was to improve passenger safety,       which it is difficult to quantify.
Thankfully, there has not been a crash       which replicated the conditions of the Ladbroke Grove incident.
However,       we can note that since the introduction of the standards there have been       no reported instances of weld unzipping failures within the European rail       system.
