     The Bristol-BBC Anchor Collaboration was formed in 2009 to create a       stronger presence for the BBC in Bristol's media landscape.
To this end, a       Memorandum of Understanding was created to shape the BBC's engagement with       key regional agencies (including SWRDA, South West Screen, Skillset,       Bristol City Council, Bristol University and the University of the West of       England, Watershed Arts Trust), signed by the BBC's Director General       (2009).
Under Stage 1 of the Collaboration, four working groups were       established: Innovation, Archiving, Skills, and Local News and Journalism.
These explored ways for the BBC to work with local media agencies to       strengthen news culture in Bristol.
The Group was managed for the BBC by       Diversity and Communities Editor for the English Regions and reported to       the Chief Operating Officer, BBC (see T1 below).
Jones was appointed Chair of the News Group (2010-12), her research       directly influencing its work and the design of the Newshare pilot (see       below) (T1, T2, T3, T4).
The BBC's Editor, English Regions, says Jones'       research informed the Group's `analysis of the problems and agendas for       the BBC in the context of increasing use of participatory digital media by       a wide range of semi-professionals and amateurs and the way the BBC could       build links with community media organisations rather than maintaining a       "top down" approach to newsgathering' (T1).
The Chair of the Community       Media Association (CMA) states that Jones' `longstanding research into the       importance of the BBC adapting to new digital news platforms and the role       of user-generated content ensured that she identified priorities that were       cognisant with the needs of both the BBC and the dispersed network of       semi-professional and amateur local news content developers that the (CMA)       represents' (T3).
Jones led the Group to initiate: (i) sustainable models for local digital       news content origination and delivery; (ii) partnership and co-production       models to create a more permeable and diverse local news landscape,       involving citizen journalists; (iii) newsharing initiatives providing       access to BBC archive content; (iv) skills sharing and access to BBC       training provision (T1, T2, T3).
Gibbons confirms that these priorities       flowed from the argument made in her research that partnerships would       strengthen the content of both parties (T3).
The BBC's Editor, English       Regions, says Jones was `influential in the Group identifying       co-production and partnership models as a key to harnessing locally       relevant news content' (T1, T2).
The Group designed the Bristol Newshare       pilot (June 2011-April 2012) to test these initiatives (T1).The pilot was       the first experiment of its kind in the UK and was used as a model for       similar experiments in other UK regions (Norfolk, Luton and Northampton)       (T1, D4).
Key Outcomes from the work of the Group and the Newshare pilot         include:     1.
A pioneering system of co-production embodied in the partnership         between BBC and community media radio stations Ujima and BCFN:         supporting a burgeoning community of semi-professional and amateur news         producers; engaging local and hyper local news sources; and opening up         the news agenda to voices outside the mainstream via voluntary sector         journalists (T2).
2.
A multilateral, multiplatform local news archive sharing system         between the BBC and local not-for-profit news providers who were         signatories to the CMA's Memorandum of Understanding 2009, to strengthen         both sectors' content (T2).
This resulted in local stories grounded more         firmly in local knowledge, reflecting a more representative range of         community interest groups through neighbourhood partnerships (D5) and         adding to the richness of news content.
3.
Skills sharing and volunteer training programmes design to enhance         local news reporting.
The BBC's Editor, English Regions, confirms Jones         was influential in the Group's `consideration of innovative training         models to give community and amateur journalists insight into         professional newsroom standards' (T1).
To this end, she commissioned a         research report by Senior Lecturer in Journalism at UWE Phil Chamberlain         to map the ecology of local news supply and training needs, and develop         methods for offering skills-based courses to deliver local news         training.
Pilot `Taster Sessions' were conducted to test out models.
His         report was submitted to the group in 2011 (D4).
4.
The Group's key strategic finding was that local news initiatives         should be embedded in a wider `cultural ecology', `harnessing the input         of key talent incubators in Bristol' (T2).
The Chair of Bristol Media, a         member of the News Group and part of the BBC Anchor Collaboration in         Phases 1 and 2, confirms Jones' key role in briefing the Group in this         regard: `conducting research on models for TV delivery of digital news         content &#8212; extending her published research on the role of PSBs in         collaborating with community media networks' (T2).
This finding informed         the design of Phase 2 of the Anchor Collaboration (signed for         2014-2017), as a further step in diversifying Bristol's news media         ecology (T2).
Benefits to Stakeholders     The Bristol Newshare pilot offered an opportunity for Jones to test out       her arguments that the BBC should identify ways of moving from a PSB to a       model of Public Service Communication, and examine the viability of       solutions she identified in a real situation.
This provided a model for       BBC local news partnerships across the UK and tested measures to create       (i) a sustainable news ecology with (ii) greater diversity of voices,       which (iii) strengthened local content, (iv) leading to a change in       thinking in the BBC and Bristol's media networks which will inform change       in the future.
BBC: Public Service Communication     1.
The Groups designed and tested initiatives to create a         paradigm-shifting model of digital local news content curation and         delivery for PSBs (T1, T2).
The `challenge of ...the digital revolution'         for the BBC is to distribute its resources effectively to meet its         Public Purpose Remits' (D1).
These include `sustaining citizenship and         civil society', `stimulating creativity and excellence' and         `representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities' which         instructs the Trust to ensure that the BBC `reflects and strengthens         cultural identities through original content at local...level' and         `promotes awareness of different cultures and alternative viewpoints,         through content that reflects the lives of different people and         different communities within the UK' (D2, pp 3-4).
The 2006 Royal Charter adds that these should be achieved through         `helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications         technologies and services' (D3, p3).
Principal benefits identified by         the BBC's Editor, English Regions, in this regard were: (i) expanding         the range of communities of interest represented in order to address         diversity in content and users addressed; (ii) challenging orthodox news         agendas by expanding the pool of contributors to BBC news; and (iii)         extending the Corporation's reach and increasing licence fee payers'         access to the BBC as listeners, through the provision of more locally         grounded relevant, accurate and culturally attuned content (T1).
The         Editor confirms the testing of models `allowed us to reconceive of our         relationship with community news media groups, and to consider our role         as curators of local content, originated by small entrepreneurial         companies, semi-professionals and amateurs (T1).
2.
Significant commercial impact flows from the Group's demonstration of         the viability of partnership models.
The BBC, as part of its licence fee         arrangement, is required to contribute &#163;25 million towards the         development costs of the new Local Media Companies in the UK.
Some, if         not all, of this contribution will be `in kind'.
Their Editor confirms         the Group's testing of this partnership, co-production and training         model `contributed to the BBC's thinking as we consider how to channel         our resources to support the development of a new generation of local         media companies and to create new newsroom practices for         digitally-enabled news-share environments' (T1).
Wider Industry Benefit: Supporting the Sustainability of the Local         News Sector     1.
A key benefit was training opportunities as BBC offered community         media companies insights into professional content-development practices         and access to training resources for volunteer news producers (T1).
This         included on-the-job skills development with amateurs working alongside         BBC personnel and access to BBC training resources, e.g.
40 Bristol         volunteers attended a day of BBC Bristol Training Workshops (T3).
As         Chair, Jones brokered these arrangements (D4).
2.
Further industry benefit derived from community radio stations         exploiting BBC archive content during this period for their broadcasts.
The Chair of Bristol Media confirms this led to BCFN and Ujima radio         stations strengthening their brand and achieving a higher profile, while         Bristol's media sector's commitment to audio as a medium for news         delivery was also strengthened (T2).
3.
Stakeholders have a clearer view of the conditions for, and obstacles         to, effective partnerships and the best conditions and mechanisms for         creating change' and working together towards industry innovation         benefits (T2, T3).
A direct outcome in this respect was a rewrite of the         BBCs 2009 Memorandum of Understanding defining the partnership between         the BBC and the Community Media Association (CMA) (February 2013,         awaiting BBC signature) (T2, T3).
This business intelligence will inform         future rollout (T2, T3).
4.
The News Group enabled a conversation between a disparate group of key         stakeholders from PSB to community-based and open-source media (T2, T4).
Jones `created a vibrant and energised group...to respond to the         challenges of news provision in the digital age' (T4).
Bristol Media's         Chair confirms that this `has continued to influence the development of         Bristol as a media city' (T2).
Public Life and Community Benefit: Diversity and Community Relevance      1.
Public and community benefit is created by enabling new kinds of         content with local relevance and authenticity and the inclusion of a         wider range of voices, to revitalise public culture.
CMA's Chair says         this was a key interest for CMA and `was achieved through the BBC         working with a wide range of volunteer reporters, and its involvement of         BCFN as a partner' (T3).
He sees this as a change flowing from Jones'         leadership (T2).
The BBC's Editor confirms Jones' commitment to these         objectives (T1).
Bristol Media's Chair agrees: `(Jones') research has         impacted upon the strategic input of stakeholder groups in Bristol's         media sector, and informed future debate on the news culture of Bristol         as a media city, and the BBC within this ecology, ensuring local digital         news provision is sustainable and reflects a diverse community of         voices' (T2).
