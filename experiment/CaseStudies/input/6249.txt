     We now present evidence for research cited in s2 and s3 to show impact in       the development of new software and hardware technologies that have       delivered commercial and economic benefits, with examples cited for two       companies.
The first demonstrates very specific impact within the original       industrial sector; the second shows that the impact has extended beyond       the original domain.
Example 1     The understanding of process simulation for reflow soldering was utilized       within a research contract with Datapaq Ltd, leading to a new product       offering that has seen significant success [5.1].
Datapaq's Rapid       Oven Setup (ROS) currently enjoys sales of around 700 units per annum, of       which 90% are exported.
Datapaq is the market leader in Europe, with       substantial market shares in China, the USA and SE Asia [5.2].
Datapaq is a process data logging company, selling hardware with       associated software to visualise and analyse acquired data.
This project       extended their offering with a software tool (ROS) that provides a       predictive capability for a given process and a methodology utilising a       characterisation artefact (Heat Transfer Sensor (HTS)) that enables       automatic process model creation.
Loughborough developed the algorithms,       simulation techniques and methodologies for automated model creation and       calibration, along with designing the prototype HTS [3.1, 3.4 &amp;         3.5].
The reflow soldering of printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a key step in       the manufacturing of electronics.
PCBs vary in cost from a few pence to       tens of thousands of pounds, with the more expensive boards playing       safety-critical roles in, for example, aviation.
Improving control of the       ovens used for reflow soldering reduces failure rates, benefitting the       industry, its customers and end-users.
For each new product or solder paste introduced the reflow settings have       to be optimised.
This is traditionally a time consuming process, but ROS       automates it quickly, easily and accurately by calculating the optimum       settings for any combination of oven, product and target profile.
ROS also       reads CAD files, automatically producing detailed PCB thermal models.
By       using Datapaq's HTS to measure the specific oven performance, the ROS tool       can ensure the optimum profile is found, thereby reducing scrap and saving       time and money.
It works on all reflow ovens.
The understanding of reflow soldering derived from the research [3.1         &amp; 3.2] enabled the derivation of control strategies to ensure       PCBs fell within specific process metrics by adjusting zone temperatures,       airflow rates and conveyor speed [3.4 &amp; 3.5].
The understanding derived from the original project in the process       control and optimisation strand [3.1] was capitalised on allowing       Datapaq to deliver novel products to the electronics- manufacturing       sector.
They state: "The technical advantage that we gained from         working in partnership with Loughborough University has enabled us to         maintain our market leadership position in Europe particularly in         Germany and France.
In these developed markets the end users need the         benefit afforded by working with a solution that maximizes production         efficiency to be able to compete with competitors from lower wage cost         economies."
[5.2] The impact from our research in developing       the ROS product has clearly generated both commercial benefits for the       company concerned and has been economically beneficial in terms of       contributing to its market position.
Example 2     Specifications and involvement with our research partner Maya Heat       Transfer Technologies [5.3], led to new solver capabilities, based       on research in s3 [3.1 &amp; 3.2].
These capabilities are:     (a) automated FE model building direct from electronics CAD.
Maya state:       "This demonstrated the feasibility and time savings associated with         this approach.
Maya then worked with its business partner (now Siemens         PLM) to incorporate this technology into the finite element pre-         processing environment as a new FE model creation method.
The technology         was successfully developed and delivered to customers worldwide.
It has         found application in other areas of thermal analysis including         spacecraft and automobiles.
In the latest generation of software (NX         CAE) the technology has been extended to provide direct creation of an         FE mesh from the PCB definition.
This has removed the need to create a         mesh for the PCB and for each component type."
[5.3]     (b) a technique to define physical movement during a thermal simulation,       for which Maya state: "modeling of motion, was added to the thermal         solver with enhancements to the UI to allow definition of the motion.
Again, the technology has been delivered to customers worldwide and has         been used in other industries.
As well as modeling PCB's in reflow ovens         the technology has been used to model other manufacturing processes, sun         tracking antennas and various spacecraft mechanisms."
[5.3]     Maya's business partner has several hundred active licenses for software       containing these capabilities.
