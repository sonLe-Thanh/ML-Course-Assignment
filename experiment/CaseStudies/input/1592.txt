     On 31 March 2011 the BBC published an article (in Chinese) summarizing       the book's main findings       [1].
The article introduces Professor Sterckx's research into       cooking and dining in ancient China       and how cooking and dining in ancient China reveals philosophical,       political and social thinking and       practice both in ancient and contemporary China.
The first section is       entitled `governing is like       cooking' and stresses messages including harmony, fairness and equality.
The second section       refers to Professor Sterckx's work on dining etiquette in China and on the       importance of dining in       social life.
The third section is entitled `food affecting virtue' and       focuses on how dining and food       was believed to affect and/or reveal human character and personality.
On 6 April 2011 the BBC article was adapted and republished by China's       national news agency       Xinhua and the China State Council information office [2], [3].
From early May 2011, this article       was adapted for mock exams and teaching materials for the Chinese       University Entrance       Examinations, starting with Henan province (7 May 2011), and then across       all thirty-one provinces       in China except Tibet.
Instruction is mainly through the form of mock       exams with teachers       explaining the questions in the class room.
The mock exams cover contents       including etiquette in       social interactions, virtues, food nutrition and civilized, healthy life       styles.
These are presented as       assisting in the construction of Chinese citizenship among teenagers       across China.
It is impossible to quantify exact user numbers across China since       schools have some freedom to       select teaching resources.
But we can establish that in Jilin [7],       Jiangsu [10] and Shandong [11]       provinces, the article was included in a mock exam paper issued as       required materials for exams       across the province.
In 2011 the total number of students enrolled in       higher education entrance       exams in Jilin province was 165,761 [5].
In 2012 it was 162,208 [6].
This suggests that, in Jilin       province alone, the number of students who have been exposed to the       article in examinations may       be as high as 160,000 per year.
In Jiangsu province, the number of       students enrolled in higher       education enrolment examinations was around 475,000 (2012) and 500,000       (2011) [8].
In       Shandong, that figure was 550,677 in 2012 and 620,000 in 2011 [9].
It may be useful to know that,       in 2011, overall high school student numbers across China totalled       24,548,200 [12].
Keyword searches of Professor Sterckx's Chinese name &#32993;&#21496;&#24503; combined with       the Chinese terms       for food &#39154;&#39135; in standard search engines (e.g.
Google) result in 53,900 hits       (24 March 2013).
The       majority of these web entries appear to be adapted articles for mock exams       and teaching materials       in Chinese for secondary schools across China.
The same article published by Xinhua Net was also included among the       official learning resources       for the Civil Servants Examinations in Xinjiang province, published in       2011 [4], and continued to be       used in 2012 and 2013.
Candidates for the Civil Servants Examinations in       Xinjiang province       totalled approximately 223,195 in 2011 [13] and nearly 100,000 in       2012 [14].
Due to Xinjiang       Province's multi-ethnicity, messages included in the article were applied       to local settings and       several key points in the article such as mutual respect between       ethnicities and cultures, dealing       with ethnicity-related matters in a fair, calm and measured manner, were       elicited.
