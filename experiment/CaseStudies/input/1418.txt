     The Sheffield Alcohol Research Group (SARG)'s strategy for impact is one       of on-going       engagement with policy stakeholders, from developing policy-relevant       research questions through       to responding rapidly and flexibly to the timescales of the policy debate.
SAPM has played a central role in informing the UK and Scottish       Governments' policy decisions to       introduce minimum unit pricing (MUP) as a central feature of their alcohol       strategies.
The research       has also stimulated and advanced public debate in the UK and       internationally.
Our research has been central to policy decisions:     Scotland.
2009: The Scottish Government used       English SAPM results to support its decision to       pursue MUP policies and commissioned a Scottish model adaptation.
Results       were presented to       the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol.
2010: We       served as expert witnesses in       the Alcohol Bill (Scotland) enquiry, Scottish Parliament Health and Sport       Committee.
Also in 2010,       a first attempt at MUP legislation failed in Parliament.
2011: The       new majority SNP Government       introduced fresh MUP legislation.
In the bill's explanatory notes [S1],       SAPM results feature on 13 of       24 pages.
2012: We appeared before the Scottish Parliament Health       and Sport Committee and       SAPM results were referenced in the Committee's report [S2].
The Alcohol       (Minimum Pricing)       (Scotland) Act 2012 was passed.
A legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky       Association centred, in       part, on a critique of the evidence.
A Scottish Government rebuttal used       SAPM results.
2013:       SARG submitted an expert witness report to the Court of Session, which       dismissed the legal       challenge.
SAPM evidence was referred to by the judge to reject claims of       a poorly-targeted policy       [S3].
Our research has stimulated and informed policy debate:     England.
2008: Evidence briefings were invited by       policymakers in the Department of Health, by       the Prime Minister's Special Advisors at No 10, and by the Chief Medical       Officer (CMO).
2009: The       latter influenced the CMO's Annual Report, which cites SAPM findings and       lobbies strongly for a       MUP [S4].
SARG also gave oral evidence to the House of Commons Health       Select Committee,       and SAPM estimates are cited in the final report [S5].
2010: SAPM       findings were used directly by       NICE in recommending MUP.
SARG briefed senior Westminster civil servants       from the Cabinet       Office, Treasury, Department of Health, Home Office, DCMS, DCSF, and       DEFRA.
2011: SARG       was invited to a Government Engagement Workshop to discuss the draft       Alcohol Strategy.
2012:       The Alcohol Strategy 2012 included a commitment to introducing MUP, and       SAPM findings were       cited by the Prime Minister in his foreword [S6].
A 2012 House of Commons       Health Select       Committee report noted "The debate so far is based almost entirely on the       work of the Sheffield       Alcohol Research Group" [S7].
SAPM results have been cited prominently by       a range of bodies       engaging in public debate on alcohol policy, including the British Medical       Association, Alcohol       Concern [S8] and the Alcohol Health Alliance (which includes the Royal       Colleges of Physicians,       General Practitioners, Nursing and Psychiatrists, Cancer Research UK).
2013:       The Impact       Assessment accompanying the Government's consultation on the Alcohol       Strategy drew heavily on       SAPM results.
In response to stakeholder engagement with the Home Office       and Department of       Health SARG published new evidence on the equality aspects of MUP.
SARG       also published       rebuttals to several industry-funded reports critiquing SAPM.
In July, the       UK Government replaced       the MUP commitment with an alternative floor price (level of alcohol duty       attracted by a product,       inclusive of VAT).
According to ministers, MUP remains under consideration       as a future policy.
The research team have worked to advance public debate thorough regular       appearances across       all major UK print and broadcast media from 2009 to 2013.
Examples of       public exposure to the       issues around alcohol MUP and its effects are evident from our engagement       with flagship radio       and television programmes, e.g.
BBC 10 o'clock news (27/09/2009,       28/09/2009, 23/03/2012),       Question Time (26/05/2011), Panorama (28/09/2012), Daily Politics       (23/03/2012), BBC Radio 4       Today programme (18/01/2011) and You &amp; Yours (08/06/2010).
There has       been extensive       newspaper coverage, e.g.
Financial Times (28/09/2009), Guardian       (15/05/2009, 13/10/2009,       30/04/2013), Independent (03/05/2009), Scotsman (09/09/2009) and Daily       Telegraph (14/05/2009,       24/03/2010).
An article on MUP was also invited by the New Scientist.
International.
SARG have given invited briefings to the: EU       Commission Advisory Meeting on       Alcohol Cost Benefit Analysis, European Presidency Expert Meeting on       Alcohol and Health,       European Commission DG Health and Consumers, and to senior civil servants       of the National       Australian Government and the Western Australian Health Committee.
SAPM       results are cited in       policy debate by, amongst others, the Australian National Preventive       Health Agency, Canadian       Public Health Association, Irish Department of Health, the New Zealand Law       Commission, and       World Health Organisation [S9].
Our research has informed national healthcare guidelines:     Our findings were used directly by NICE in making recommendations in June       2010 for minimum       pricing and also programmes of identification and brief advice.
SAPM       modelling evidence       statements underpin five of the eleven recommendations in the NICE       guidance [S10].
