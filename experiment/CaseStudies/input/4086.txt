     Our close engagement with key stakeholders has led to impacts on       international policy and Brazilian environmental policy.
Extensive media       coverage has stimulated widespread public debate.
Informing International Policy     The intact Amazon rainforest is currently absorbing about 1 billion       tonnes of carbon per year (i.e.
more than 10% of annual anthropogenic CO2       emissions), but this has been almost completely offset by the carbon       dioxide emissions due to deforestation over the last few decades.
Largely       in response to widespread tropical deforestation, the UNFCCC introduced       the mechanism Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest         Degradation (REDD) in 1995.
REDD is a set of steps designed to use       market and financial incentives to reduce the emissions of greenhouse       gases from deforestation and forest degradation.
Exeter's research       concerning changing fire frequency in Amazonia and the implications for       REDD policy [3] is referenced in UNEP and FAO documents [a,b].
More general concerns over the risk and impact of Amazonian forest       dieback led the World Bank to fund a project in 2008 with the goal "to         assist in understanding the risk of a potential reduction in biomass         density in the Amazon basin induced by climate change impacts (Amazon         dieback) and its implications".
Cox and Jupp of the University of       Exeter were contracted members of the World Bank's project team along with       collaborators from Brazil, Japan and Germany.
Interim reports from the       project were presented to the UNFCCC "Subsidiary Body for Scientific         and Technical Advice (SBSTA)", and the project outcomes continue to       feed into public debate [c] and UNFCCC policy discussions       concerning the "permanence" or otherwise of tropical carbon stores [d].
The project published its full report in 2010 [e], concluding that       fertilization effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide         levels on forest ecosystems like the Amazon have proven to be a key         unknown", and that "Amazon dieback should be considered a         threshold for dangerous climate change".
Both of these conclusions       derive in large part from work carried-out by researchers at the       University of Exeter (see Section 2).
Our most recent research findings, which constrains the loss of tropical       land carbon under climate change, were reported by the International         Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) to the United Nations         Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) "Subsidiary Body for         Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA)", at its meeting in Bonn in       June 2013 [f].
The results of this research have also been made       available to UK policymakers through Cox's position on the Scientific       Advisory Group of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC),       where they have contributed to the UK's more positive attitude towards       avoided deforestation within the UNFCCC negotiations.
Brazilian Environmental Policy     Our research in this field has also had a very direct impact on       environmental policymakers in Brazil.
After the publication of his paper       in 2010 [3], Luiz Aragao met with policymakers from the Acre regional       government of Brazil to discuss the policy implications.
Out of that       meeting grew a long-term collaboration between the University of Exeter, the         Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE), and the Brazilian         State Government of Acre, which culminated in the funding of a joint       project called "PULSE-Brazil", which Cox leads.
This project is developing       a Geographical Information System (GIS) to display and analyse data on the       changing environmental conditions in Brazilian Amazonia, so as to inform       policy concerning responses to environmental change in the State of Acre       and other vulnerable States of Brazil [g].
PULSE-Brazil has       enabled very direct interaction with the Environmental Secretary of Acre       (Vera Reis) who has attended all of the project meetings, and has been       aided by the hiring of a Portuguese speaking project manager (Duarte       Costa) who is spending extended periods working alongside the Acre       officials in Brazil to facilitate effective knowledge exchange.
Informing Public Debate through the Media     The iconic nature of the Amazonian rainforest and its importance for the       Earth System, make our research of great interest to the public and the       media.
Research from the University of Exeter has contributed       significantly to public debate, appearing in newspapers and television       programmes.
For example, the Amazonian drought of 2010 and its mechanisms       were discussed extensively by the BBC [h], and the "Amazon Dieback       Scenario" was covered by the New York Times in 2011 [i].
Amazon       dieback was also described in the BBC1 Horizon "Hot Planet" episode that       aired in 2009 and 2010, and on which Cox appeared and was the scientific       consultant [j].
In 2012, Cox spent 2 weeks in Amazonia making a TV       programme, which aired in the US in October 2013 (http://www.thetippingpoints.com/).
