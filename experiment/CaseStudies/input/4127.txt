     The project represents an innovative collaboration between a university       cultural studies research       centre and a commercial business which aimed to address a gap in the       skills market for Orkney's       cruise industry &#8212; developing language qualified tour guides.
This was in       response to research       conducted on behalf of, and in collaboration with, Orkney Islands Council,       Orkney Harbours, and       Cruise Orkney.
This programme was aimed at addressing a shortage of qualified tourist       guides who can explain       the cultural context of Orkney in a range of languages so that visitors       from all over the world can       have the full benefit from their visit and carry away lasting memories.
Many tourists visiting the       region have very limited or no English language skills, especially those       that are in the region for       short periods of time such as those arriving on cruise liners.
There is a       growing and increasingly       lucrative market for multilingual tour guides to enhance the Orkney       experience.
Orkney Harbours'       Michael Morrison noted "This intensive course provided a much needed       requirement for languaged       guides for the cruise industry and for Orkney tourism generally."
(Source:       Letter from Orkney       Harbours).The main source of revenue for tourism operators on Orkney is in       fact tours from cruise       liners.
The major loss of revenue occasioned by tourists preferring to       spend their money on a trip       at another port which provided a language guide was a fundamental blow at       the sustainability of       the industry and also affected retailers, craftspeople etc who relied on       the cruise liner spend.
The programme encouraged local people to see tourism and cultural       heritage as providing career       opportunities.
It presented cultural heritage to local and tourist alike       in a new and integrative       manner and improved the understanding of cultural heritage as having       economic benefits and       thereby improving employment opportunities.
Communities need to be able to       create and manage       their own cultural capital and to be empowered by an understanding of and       value for what they       have and the products thereof.
There is a clear relationship between       knowledge and power and       our research agenda has allowed us to help the communities to make the       leap from the theoretical       to the practical, and indeed the practicable, use of their lived       experience.
The course started in March 2010 and the first 11 students graduated in       October 2010 in English,       Spanish, French, German, Swedish and Polish.
Bookings for 2010 and 2011       increased as a direct       result of this course which was repeated in 2012 with 17 graduates and       will run in Shetland in       2013.
The first iteration was only available in Orkney.
The second       iteration was also placed online       and attracted students from all over Scotland as well as in Orkney.
The       sessions were recorded       and this allowed existing guides to undertake a recognised CPD opportunity       by accessing topics       and lectures of specific value to them.
This was clearly successful.
Orkney Harbours have pledged       to finance any further courses (source: letter from Orkney Harbours).CNS       has been asked by       STGA to run a similar course in Shetland in 2013 and STGA have discussed       the possibility of       running the course in the Western Isles in 2014.
STGA have also requested       resources for a       Scotland wide Blue Badge (higher level) course to run from 2014.
This project had impact in the following areas:            Economic prosperity.
We applied our research to creating a course         leading to job         opportunities that were not previously available and which contributed         to the economic         prosperity of the Orkney community.
We also safeguarded jobs attached to         the cruise         industry and income streams for local businesses which would have been         severely affected         by a downturn in business.
This was a major stimulus to the tourist         experience in Orkney         and will impact on Shetland and the Western Isles in the years to come.
Cultural life.
We interpreted cultural capital to create a sustainable         resource with community         ownership.
We preserved and presented cultural heritage in a new,         enriching, and         interactive way which was considered excellent in every way by the         stakeholders and         clients.
Education.
This was a unique education opportunity with economic and         social inclusion         benefits for lifelong learners.
There was also measurable impact on other cultural sectors, eg.
Archaeology as fully         trained tour guides were available to interpret the sectors and maximise         tourist experience.
Impact was therefore economic, social, and experiential.
Indicators for         this include the         following:          The funding received from Orkney Harbours for both iterations of the       course was given as it was       deemed of crucial significance to the cruise industry in Orkney.
Kirkwall       was named the best British       port of call in the 2010 UK cruise industry awards, and the islands as a       whole were voted the UK's       top destination for cruise liners in 2010 and 2011.
Kirkwall came second       in the international cruise       industry awards in 2013.
74 cruise ships booked to visit the islands during 2012.
Those booked for       2012 had a combined       gross tonnage of 1.6 million tonnes and together will have 43,000       passengers.
2013 was shaping       up as a bumper year, with Princess Cruises making three additional       bookings involving 3599       passengers each time, bringing the total to 78 liners booked with 61579       passengers in total.
Disembarkation figures 2009-2012 (source: Orkney Harbours)       2009: 26,978     2010: 25,464     2011: 29,875     2012: 41,563     From these figures, it can be seen that the disembarkation numbers were       declining until 2010 and       increased incrementally after 2010 when the first tranche of fully trained       guides were available.
This increase was directly linked to the availability of such guides       (source: Orkney Harbours)       Impacts in Orkney from tour guide work generated by the first course,       including induced impacts,       are estimated at 7 ftes (11 in head count) and &#163;140,000 in income.
The       second course generated       an estimated 17 ftes and &#163;340,000 in income (source: CNS Economic Impact       Study commissioned       by Highlands and Islands Enterprise).
