     This research was part of the evidence used to formulate Defra policy in       relation to Nitrate       Vulnerable Zones (NVZ).
The NVZ Regulations impose legal requirements on       farmers within       NVZs to aid the reduction of nitrate pollution of UK groundwater and       surface waters fed by       groundwater.
The NVZs cover about two-thirds of UK farmland.
The main       impact has been       to reduce the nitrate concentration in surface and ground waters, since       the NVZ Regulations       were introduced.
The research led to the component of the regulations on       timing of manure       application to land, restricting the time when manure could be applied to       avoid autumn       application when nitrate was found in the research to be at greatest risk       of leaching from       manure.
The impact of the research and the resulting Regulations has been       demonstrated       in a report by ADAS for Defra based on assessments of nitrate pollution in       2009 and 2010.
