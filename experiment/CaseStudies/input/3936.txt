     The University of Reading holds the world's largest archive of materials       relating to the Irish writer Samuel Beckett.
The Beckett manuscript and       book archive, housed in the University's Special Collections (http://www.reading.ac.uk/special-collections/collections/sc-beckett.aspx),       is the focus of Beckett-related research at Reading, and is also open to       academic researchers from other institutions and to the public.
Each year       it attracts over 250 visitors, including scholars, curators, theatre       practitioners, media, publishers and interested members of the general       public.
All visitors to the archive are invited to contact Reading       researchers working in their specific area of enquiry, to support their       visit.
The archive itself therefore not only provides a resource for       Reading researchers, but also facilitates their direct interaction with a       broader non-academic constituency of users of the archive and the related       research.
We have chosen to evidence three major recent moments in this REF cycle       as illustrations of the impact that Beckett projects from our staff       continue to make, as well as to suggest the grounds for our future       initiatives.
These moments have been selected to demonstrate the range of       our impact initiatives with regard to Beckett and the archive: from making       available the processes of his creativity through manuscript editing; to       public engagement activity derived from material at Reading; to deployment       of the manuscript and documentary materials in the archive to inform new       productions of Beckett's dramatic work.
Each area is signalled in the       narratives of specific instances below.
Across this impact census period, however, there have been many other       interventions into a variety of cultural activities related to the case       study &#8212; interventions which have altered awareness of the significance of       drama, cultural innovation, and artefacts.
Beckett scholarship at Reading       is derived from attention to the processes of creation which underlie the       published works, and it is a shared concern between colleagues to curate       events and display archival materials in informed ways that both speak to       our research, and alter public perceptions of authorship.
These       interventions include theatre productions and media events drawing upon       our tradition of engagement with the history of Beckett theatre production       (most recently Waiting for Godot at 60 (2012)).
There have also       been significant exhibitions involving curated materials from the archive       relating to the creation of Beckett's unique published work, which have       had key importance in their contexts (e.g., the loan of the `Film'       notebook to Kinemathek Berlin for the exhibition `Experimentelles       Fernsehen' 19 May to late July 2011; and also to the Irish Museum of       Modern Art: `The Moderns', 20 October 2010 to 13 February 2011).
The link       between Beckett and Visual Art, integral to Carville's interest and       reflected in `The Moderns', has underscored our various recent loans to       the Beckett Festivals at Enniskillen (2012, 2013).
These have excited       theatre practitioners, critics, and local people.
The Festival Director,       has noted that `It was the positive feedback on the Beckett archive       presentation last year that has led the festival to commission the much       larger exhibit of `Samuel Beckett: Witness to the Twentieth Century' for       2014'.
Manuscript editing: The Beckett Digital Manuscript Project         makes available to the broader international public the writer's         manuscripts in an accessible electronic format (www.beckettarchive.org)         with accompanying print analyses.
Tools available on the site allow         visitors to see Beckett's manuscripts in their original, handwritten,         format; in a variety of languages; and through a print transcription.
The project is opening up the archive to a wide range of constituencies         (including theatre directors, education professionals, therapists,         language specialists, and artists).
The project also generates new ways         of thinking about Beckett's work, especially for users in the field of         creative practice, by enhancing understanding of his compositional         strategies and his engagement with advances in the arts, technology,         media and science.
The release of the first three modules (Stirrings           Still, The Unnamable, and Comment Dire), has reached         constituencies including, for example, theatre practitioners working         with the public sector, in schools, hospitals and prisons.
Responses         from various areas of interest have been positive: one arts website         urges `I hope this is the wave of the future and that more libraries and         estates will enter into projects such as this one.
I encourage readers         to go check out the impressive demo.'
Another writers' and artists' site praises the `rather wonderful         resource that has just debuted on the World Wide Web.'
As further         modules are added to the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project site (the         project runs to 2037), it is anticipated that the impact of the         initiative will expand significantly, with regard to thinking about the         processes of creation of text, theatre performance, and film.
Public Engagement: A further key aspect of our impact activity         involves intervention in those places and sites crucial for the         development of Beckett's distinctive writing across genres.
Carville has         created outreach events around his research on Beckett and Visual Art.
This has involved talks at the venues where Beckett himself had been a         visitor in the 1930s, venues which provided him with indelible images         that then recur in his work.
Carville spoke to audiences of 50+ at the         Wallace Collection, London in March 2013, and at the National Gallery,         London, in April 2013, drawing attention to the correlation between         those paintings which we know that Beckett admired, and the occurrence         of similar images in the novels, and in the design of the production of         several of Beckett's dramas.
Carville's research, which draws upon the         notebooks held at Reading, is therefore being carried into the original         contexts Beckett was familiar with.
In the process, people's perception         of particular art collections, and of the relation between the visual         and the verbal, is changed.
The Education Officer at the Wallace         Collection, has noted that `Dr Carville's lecture was a fascinating         insight into how the art of 17th century Holland influenced one of the         greatest writers of the 20th century.
It challenged both the museum and         our visitors to interpret and engage with our collection in new and         interesting ways and encouraged us to make new connections between art         and literature that we hadn't made before.'
Theatre Productions: English staff frequently host theatre and         film directors and producers at Reading.
Staff deploy their research         into the development of Beckett's own plays and past international         productions of his dramas, in order to inform new productions of his         work through textual and theatre history, including the author's own         decisions about staging and performance.
These discussions frequently         involve close consideration of the manuscript record.
That material, in         its turn, is frequently curated or re-presented in connection to         specific productions.
A recent instance of this is in connection to         Beckett's Not I, which was performed by Lisa Dwan at the         University in April 2013, and subsequently at the Royal Court Theatre.
The performances were staged (and filmed for Sky Arts) against         the backdrop of a curated exhibition, which included Beckett's original         manuscripts for the drama alongside materials relating to its         performance history, to create a unique event attended by over 200         people.
The aim was to alter public perception of the immediacy of         performance by placing it within various creative histories.
Feedback         taken subsequent to the events recognised the ways in which they had         changed peoples' sense of the possibilities of relating the writing         process per se to performance, and the alteration the         performances had made for a sense of what art is and can achieve.
Examples include: `Having the original manuscripts helps to         bridge the gap between what was in Beckett's mind and what the audience         experiences on stage'.
`I had the opportunity of having contact with a         new kind of theatre performance I wasn't familiar with.'
`It made me         realise that most of even our unconventional theatre is conventional.'
Our intention is to continue these links of performance to manuscript         text and theatre history in future international biennial Festivals, and         to expand our outreach to include younger viewers during the next         iteration.
