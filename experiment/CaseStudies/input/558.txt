     The experimental method of public engagement using Competency Groups       (CGs) has had significant impact in two local communities (Ryedale and       Uck).
The research approach to the theory and practice of co-producing       environmental knowledge, in which researchers actively engage and       collaborate with local residents affected by flood risk, has led to deep       and sustained impacts in localities in which public confidence in flood       risk management expertise had been lost, resulting in a policy impasse.
The broader lessons from these interventions in terms of the utility of       the CG methodology elsewhere continue to spread as the Ryedale case is       held up as a national exemplar of effective `public engagement' in       situations of policy dispute that, in turn, has attracted international       interest.
The greatest impact, thus far, has resulted from the activities of the CG       in Ryedale (Sept. 2007 -Oct. 2008), which came to call itself the Ryedale       Flood Research Group (RFRG).
In the case of the RFRG, the research       collaboration (September 2007 - October 2008) took place in the context of       a policy stalemate in a community that had lost confidence in the local       Environment Agency (EA) and come to distrust the expert models upon which       it relied, as the provision of local flood defences repeatedly stalled.
The co-produced modelling work of the RFRG led the Group to propose       `upstream storage' as a means of reducing flood risk in Pickering.
This       proposal involved placing a series of mini-dams (or bunds) in the upper       catchment using vernacular materials in keeping with the (designated)       landscape.
Such an intervention had been previously dismissed by the       consultants advising the flood management policy of the local EA.
The       clear impact of the CG approach in this case has been to empower local       people to become involved in producing alternative flood risk management       strategies.
The RFRG presented its working methods, bespoke modelling work       and `upstream storage' proposal at a public exhibition in the Civic Hall       in Pickering in October 2008 [Section 5: C1], and in a report - `Making         space for people' [C2].
This event attracted over 200       visitors, including representatives of the local EA, and gained extensive       coverage in the local media which, in turn, produced a sequence of further       research impacts.
Four months later, the Group's `upstream storage' proposal was       incorporated into a successful multi-agency bid to a national competition       launched by Defra to fund pilot projects that could demonstrate the       potential of land management measures to reducing flood risk.
The       Pickering project was one of three to be funded (&#163;700,000).
It ran for two       years from April 2009 and included a local member of the RFRG on its       Project Delivery Group.
These `upstream storage' proposals have since       received District Council funding and are now under construction in the       catchment [R6].
The role of the RFRG's work in this successful       multi-agency funded project in demonstrating the potential of land       management techniques (in this case `upstream storage') was acknowledged       in the EA's publicity about the project both locally and nationally.
The       Catchment Manager for the EA described its influence in the following       terms: `The RELU Project was very much a catalyst for our bid to Defra         for the Pitt review Project "slowing the Flow".
The RFRG study provided         background information, technical support and public support which         helped progress the upstream storage element of the Slowing the Flow         Project.
The production of the model by the RFRG and the identification         of the key bund locations from this initial large scale modelling         provided significant cost savings to the Slowing the Flow project.
The         work completed by the RFRG within Pickering once again highlighted         Pickering's flood risk and provided a large amount of background         material that was used to inform the tender for the Defra demonstration         project.
This also provided key links with the communities and an         opportunity for knowledge share across the projects.
The final point to         make is that this work enabled us to improve our relationship with the         community in Pickering and one that will hopefully lead to a successful         outcome for all.'
[C3].
The Defra demonstration project involved testing the RFRG's `upstream       storage' proposition and extending the Group's modelling work to look at       additional catchment interventions, such as debris dams, that might also       contribute to this method of flood risk reduction in Pickering.
The       project received much interest and approval with the local `Gazette and       Herald', for example, reporting on the benefits of the project on 29th       August 2012, and noting that `... the select committee on Environment,         Food and Rural Affairs concluded that projects like Pickering `slow the         flow' are class leaders of their type, and that they should also qualify         going forward for payments for eco-system services.'
[C4].
This project has become a national exemplar in various national agencies'       advocacy of `natural' or `whole catchment' techniques of flood risk       management, as seen on the Defra website [C5].
Hansard reports       show that the Pickering case has been discussed in the UK Parliament       (House of Commons) on four occasions (4/11/2010; 23/06/2011; 06/07/2011       &amp; 08/09/2011) and has been the subject of written questions on two       occasions (06/07/2011 and 11/07/2011) [C6], thus demonstrating the       wider UK policy impacts of the CG approach.
In July 2010, Ryedale District Council approved &#163;800,000 funding to       construct `an upstream storage scheme', building on the approaches       stimulated by the RFRG's work [C7].
The first phase of this scheme       (woody debris dams) led by the Forestry Commission is now in situ in the       catchment.
In March 2013, the District Council announced a further tranche       of funding to support a second phase of construction (an earth bund) led       by the EA.
Thus, the CG approach, pioneered by Whatmore and her team, has       contributed materially to changing flood risk management practice in the       Ryedale catchment.
International interest in the application of the CG methodology to       knowledge controversies associated with flood risk management is now       developing, as evidenced in the expressions of interest by public       authorities and consultancies advising on flood risk management in       Queensland, Australia.
The Leading Floodplain Management Consultant, BMT       WBM Pty Ltd, for example, emailed Prof Whatmore saying: `Once again I         would like to thank you for your presentation on Thursday night.
I found         it incredibly informative and useful, both as a catch up on where the         Pickering scheme was and in understanding the methodologies and         techniques and most importantly the outcomes your team achieved.
I         emailed Rebecca Ralph requesting a copy of your presentation and/or         paper if that is possible as I am very keen on implementing similar         approaches here in Queensland and seeking to influence the local         authorities on understanding the benefits of true community engagement         on often controversial ideas and schemes.'
