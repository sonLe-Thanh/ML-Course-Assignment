     Chemical archaeology       Evershed began to combine chemistry and archaeology to capture       public interest and stimulate       chemistry education in the 1990s and has continued to evolve this to the       present day via the full       range of mechanisms.
The combination regularly attracts students not       normally inspired to study       chemistry:     School and college educational outreach            Presentations to schools by Evershed and his team have a         profound impact on students         and teachers, with the latter recognising the value of conveying the         ideas of chemistry         through case studies drawn from ancient human societies from across the         world (a).
Formalisation of this is evidenced by inclusion of Evershed's work on         the chemistry of food         residues in ancient pottery in the Nuffield GCSE Chemistry textbook.
First published in         2006, this text is used by most OCR GCSE Science (TFCS) students         [estimated by OUP to         be ca.
75% of those students, &gt;20,000 students p.a., based on market         share (b)].
Evershed's work has contributed to more than 20 documentaries         broadcast worldwide         most recently: The Making of the Fittest: Got Lactase?
The           Co-evolution of Genes and Culture         by HHMI (c).
On the 1st October, since         posting in March 2013 the film had 43,429 stream         attempts and 21,483 downloads.
Members of his team (Cramp and Salque as PhD students         and Gill as PDRA) authored         educational articles in the RSC's journal Catalyst circulation         10,000 (d).
Public outreach events             Evershed and his team have promoted the wider interest in         chemistry through archaeology         via &gt;50 community events, public outreach activities and         presentations to local interest         groups throughout the UK, e.g.
'Set7', 'Chemistry Alive', 'Scientific         Power to the People',         ChemSix, 1996, University of Bath Millennium lecture Series (2         invitations), University of         Bristol Centenary celebrations and Open Days, Discover 2010, Oxford May         Music Festival         2011, and the Bristol Festival of Nature 2011-2013.
A highlight of this         activity was the         group's participation in the 2009 Royal Society Summer Science         Exhibition (RSSSE) (e,f)         attended by &gt;5000 school/college students, members of the public of         all ages and         backgrounds, and academics/educators of all types (school teachers to         FRS).
Developed in 2009 `The Palaeodetective' display as an outreach         tool.
Central to the display         is a computer game played on touch-screens, enabling users to learn         about ancient worlds         through `cases' drawn from the group's work.
The game is designed for         any age and         appeals to many interests.
The exhibit originally created for RSSSE 2009         has been re-used         over a dozen times, including at Festivals and University Open Days, and         is available to         teachers online (e).
This game has now been played by thousands         of children and adults.
Dunne from Evershed's group represented the University         of Bristol in the 2013 `Soapbox         Science Event', promoting women in science, presenting an informal         interactive street talk         "Milking it" at the South Bank, based on her archaeological         chemistry research (g).
Media interactions and engagement             Evershed's research has generated over 10 press releases, he         has given over 50         interviews to print and radio media and contributed to 12 documentaries.
Evershed's media engagement has resulted in vast coverage of         his research in the         national and international media, including, for example, over 100         newspaper and         magazine publications and nearly two dozen national and international         interviews.
Typing "Evershed ancient dairying" into Google gives         &gt;100,000 hits referring extensively to         his group's work in a diversity of sources from across the world.
In this respect his work continually reinforces the importance of         chemistry in understanding the         origins of humankind.
Detection of vegetable oil fraud       In 1996 Evershed collaborated with the Leatherhead Food Research       Association (representing a       consortium of food producers comprising FOSFA, International, Unilever       Research, Bedford, UK,       and Nestec Ltd., Lausanne, Switzerland).
The Bristol-based PhD student (Woodbury)       developed a       new method for detecting the adulteration of corn oil which was       incorporated into the CODEX       Standard for Named Vegetable Oils (CODEX-STAN 210-1999) (h).
The       CODEX was published in       1999, but remains the UK (and international) standard for detecting       vegetable oil adulteration,       thereby protecting consumers' economic and health interests through the       REF period.
Evershed's       methodologies predate the recent horse meat debacle, emphasising the need       for the use of       sophisticated analytical methods to ensure the quality of the food we       consume.
Although such       frauds are rarely injurious to human health they raise moral concerns,       however, the famous       "Spanish Toxic Oil Syndrome" resulted in 600 deaths, emphasising the need       for constant vigilance.
Murder case       Approached by the Metropolitan Police, Evershed's team rapidly       reconfigured their methodologies       to provide unequivocal evidence that led to an immediate confession and       subsequent murder       conviction (i).
The methods employed were published (6) with       the agreement of the Metropolitan       Police in 2009 to provide an exemplar for others to follow.
The case       rested on the substantial       stable isotope database built on Evershed's archaeological       chemical research, bolstered by       further samples provided by the "Body Farm", made famous by       Patricia Cornwall's novel of the       same name.
