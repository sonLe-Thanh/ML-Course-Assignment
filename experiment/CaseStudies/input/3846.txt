     This research has had a far-reaching and significant impact on the lives       of patients with depression.
Other beneficiaries include health service       commissioners and providers, mental health workers, and the wider populace       through the economic benefits of increased productivity and reduced       welfare costs (in 2007, depression's total annual costs in England were       &#163;7.5 billion, &#163;1.7 billion health service costs, &#163;5.8 billion lost       earnings).
Reflecting his expertise, Richards was a national advisor to       the Department of Health (2008-2011) on the design and implementation of       the nationwide IAPT initiative and the underpinning informatics systems.
The results of Richards' research are currently being implemented       nationally and internationally, providing more treatment options for       patients, and informing service and training provision.
The research       results provide the empirical bedrock for the low-intensity, high-volume       component of the &#163;700m implementation of IAPT services throughout England1.
The IAPT programme has been described in a Nature editorial2       on 27th September 2012 as "a world-beating standard thanks         to the scale of its implementation and the validation of its treatments         by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence"       (pp473-474).
It continues to receive unanimous cross-parliamentary support       in both houses of parliament, for example House of Lords Early Day Motion       1433; 09.02.2011 "...welcomes the news that 3,660 new psychological         therapists, trained under the Improving Access to Psychological         Therapies programme, are in place as of January 2011; commends the         current Government for its on-going commitment to invest in the IAPT         programme; also commends the previous Government for starting the IAPT         programme...".
The programme underpins the current coalition       government's mental health `No Health without Mental Health' and       talking therapies strategies.
Key successes of the programme in the first three full financial years       from 2008 onwards, as documented by the Department of Health3,       include:            Over 1 million people entering treatment       680,000 people completing treatment       Recovery rates consistently in excess of 45%; 65% of people         significantly improved       Over 45,000 people moving off sick pay and benefits       Nearly 4,000 new practitioners trained          The vast majority of these patients receive treatments established and       delivered through Richards' research programme.
These impressive       implementation results have been underpinned by Richards' team in Exeter,       and their academic and professional publications.
They have created the       IAPT para-professional `Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner' (PWP) role       and established it as a core component of the stepped care IAPT treatment       delivery method.
In addition to trial results, Richards et al's       publications include the first major international edited textbook on       low-intensity CBT (Bennett-Levy, Richards, Farrand, et al, 20104);       the national curriculum for IAPT low-intensity workers (Richards, Farrand       and Chellingsworth, 20115), and three sets of educational       guidebooks for HEIs, low-intensity Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner       (PWP) students and their supervisors (Richards and White 2010; 2009a;       2009b 6,7,8).
These materials are in use throughout the HEI       sector and the NHS in England.
Richards also worked closely with public       and patient involvement representatives in his IAPT national advisor role       and advised RETHINK, the national mental health charity, on their       ultimately successful tenders for a number of IAPT services in England.
In addition, the recent (2009) NICE guidelines on depression9       references the work of Richards' group, and particularly notes that the       results of the recently published CADET trail (2013) "should inform         further updates of this guideline"     Richards' research has prompted interventions to be implemented       internationally: For example, he is an advisor to the `Mindspot'       Australian Federal Government service commission won by Macquarie       University, Sydney, to implement low-intensity CBT throughout all states       in Australia; he is also advisor to `Beyond Blue' the national Australian       Depression Initiative10.
