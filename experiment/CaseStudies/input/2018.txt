     Wood and Plester's empirical research has not only challenged the       conventional tabloid wisdom       that textism use is detrimental to the reading ability of children, it has       initiated a new line of       empirical academic research and directly impacted on public policy and       practitioners' use of texting       language in their teaching.
Impact dissemination process and dates     The initial data [1] was published in a practitioner journal in order to       generate discussion amongst       teachers and within schools regarding how mobile phones were perceived by       educators.
As a       result of this paper and the media debate stimulated, Wood was       seconded to Becta for a three-       month period from January 2010, to review the academic evidence of which       technologies improve       English skills in school children, which included the mobile phone       research.
The Becta review is       available via the Institute of Education's Digital Resources Archive (http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/1670/).
In December 2012 Wood was invited to present a seminar at the       Department for Education on the       potential of technology to impact on children's literacy, which reviewed       the research evidence on e-       books and mobile phone use including Wood's own research.
Wood       was then asked to review       and comment on the draft National Curriculum for English in Key Stages 1       and 2 with respect to its       treatment of technology.
Wood's seminar was also attended by       OFSTED and Dyslexia Action, and       Wood was invited to discuss her work in more detail with these       organisations in 2013.
Coventry       data [2] was referred to by Crystal in his book `Txting: the Gr8 Db8', and       the findings [2,3] were       also widely disseminated to the general public via a published case study       on the British Academy       website [a] and through mainstream national and international media       [b,c,d,e].
Becta then funded       the intervention study [5] to examine the question of whether mobile phone       ownership could boost       literacy attainment in primary school children.
Most recently, Wood's       research [1,2,3,4,5] was       covered in the BBC4 documentary series `Growing Children' as part of the       programme on dyslexia,       screened in August 2012 (average daily reach for BBC4 in the week it was       screened: 2.3 million       viewers).
Following the media coverage of the research, Wood was invited to       be a keynote speaker at the       Youth Libraries Group (YLG) annual conference, with 200 delegates       from across the UK (2009).
The presentation included reviews of her research with respect to       technology and literacy, and       discussed the ways in which technology is best integrated with the       curriculum.
The Youth Libraries         Group presentation was published as a book chapter in `Read to       Succeed', a text aimed at       librarians who work with children and young people (Wood, C. 2011.
`How children begin to read'.

Wood       was also invited to be a panel       member by the National Literacy Trust at the launch of their 2012 annual       survey results.
The       survey found children are more likely to read via digital sources than       traditional print media, and       Wood's research was identified as an important contribution to the       debate about the potential of       technology to impact positively on children's literacy [f].
Beneficiaries Primary and secondary school teachers,       trainee teachers, youth and school       librarians, parents, school-age children.
Nature of the impact and evidence     The text messaging research has impacted on public attitudes in       relation to popular perceptions       and understandings of how mobile phones may influence the development of       young people's       written language skills.
Prior to the publication of the research [1]       there was an accepted popular       media argument that text messaging was responsible for the apparent       decline in literacy       attainment amongst children.
For example, in the Guardian http://tinyurl.com/oyf4hof       and famously,       in the Daily Mail http://tinyurl.com/y7g7lvc.
Wood's research examined these questions empirically,       and directly challenged the assumptions about the negative impact of       texting behaviour.
As a direct       result of the Coventry research, online blogs and media coverage worldwide       now increasingly       challenges the idea of textism use being detrimental to young people's       literacy skills, citing the       Plester and Wood's research as evidence [for example: b,c,d,e,f].
The work has begun to impact on public policy within the Department         for Education (DfE).
Following the DfE seminar in December 2012, Wood's research [2]       was incorporated into a       Department for Education report on research evidence on writing [g].
The       report acknowledged       that there was now evidence that texting could make a positive       contribution to children's       phonological awareness.
Wood's research has also impacted the work       of the National Literacy       Trust [f].
Director, Jonathan Douglas, states "We have used it as a         central evidence base for our         policy work with the Department for Education.
It has stimulated further         research which the         National Literacy Trust itself has undertaken.
It has also supported new         practices in teaching         literacy in the 900 National Literacy Trust schools, members of our         network who develop and share         innovative evidence-based approaches to literacy...It has helped us to         understand the contribution         that texting and informal digital communication makes to formal skills         associated with writing.
We         have taken this exploration further with our own research which         demonstrates that blogging in         leisure time impacts positively on writing skills...
It has helped us         understand the importance of         phonological awareness in developing writing skills and that this         awareness can be developed in a         playful and relevant way.
This emphasises the importance of         contextualising literacy pedagogy in         real life interests and experiences.
This has fed into programmes such         as the National literacy         Trust's Premier League Reading stars project which operates in 1,000         English schools."
In terms of impact on practitioners, there is evidence that       innovative teachers worldwide were       beginning to use `text-speak' to aid learning English prior to the       publication of Wood and Plester's       empirical research.
For example, teachers were using it in Scotland and       the Scottish Qualifications       Authority (SQA) came under fire for allowing children to write answers in       text speak, as long as       they showed an understanding for the subject, although pupils who used       phrases such as "2b r nt       2b" or "i luv u" would not be able to get top marks' [h].
This example is       taken from an article about       Wood's research, which suggests even where Plester and Wood's       work may not have inspired the       use of texting in education, it may have contributed to legitimizing it.
In the US, the best selling       book `Teaching Generation Text: Using Cell Phones to Enhance Learning'       outlines stories from       educators, parents, students, counsellors and anyone using cell phones to       enhance learning -       suggesting it is currently taking place in the classroom [i].
The blog       associated with the book [j]       directly references Wood's research, and the value of text       messaging in teaching.
It also outlines       how the research could be employed in the classroom such as to translate       poetry into `text-speak'       in order to aid understanding and create useful summaries.
The research is also endorsed by Marc Slater who developed Ultimate       Spelling software, a widely       used worldwide spelling software programme for students.
He has commented       in a recent press       release, "This latest research is very interesting.
For texting to help         kids spell, it sounds great.
We         just hope that research continues to support these findings as texting         seems to be more and more         a part of everyday life."
(http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb9955790.htm)     Conclusion     Wood and Plester's pioneering rigorous empirical research has       changed the way that the public,       policy makers and educators worldwide view, accept and use text-speak to       develop English       Language Skills in children and adolescents: "The full implications of         the research to policy makers         and practitioners have yet to be fully grasped.
They are challenging         and, I believe, must lead to         questioning of how literacy is taught and assessed.
And indeed what         literacy is.
For this reason I         see this research as being at the very cutting edge of the global debate         which is defining what it         means to be literate in a society driven by, and delighting in, digital         communication" &#8212; Jonathan       Douglas, Director of the National Literacy Trust.
