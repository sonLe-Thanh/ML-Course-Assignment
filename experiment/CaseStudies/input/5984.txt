     The impact of this research is three-fold:     First, the `Conker Tree Science' project produced a cohort of thousands       of citizen-scientists producing verifiable, geo-located scientific       field-data across time and space.
These data greatly enriched our       understanding of C. ohridella, its impacts, and the spread of this       moth.
These data resulted in scientific publications (noted in section 3),       but the impact we emphasise here is how these citizen scientists were       prompted to record the environmental impact of this invasive pest.
Their engagement is evidenced by the following figures:            we generated 10,000 data points from members of the public over a         3-year period       we received 6,160 uploads to our data set from 2,450 devices during         2011-12       an additional 1129 people took part in the project using the website,         with 2646 records added.
over 2,100 people took part in the parasitoid research.
Here we asked         citizen scientists to calculate parasitism rates of the moths by running         mini-experiments at home/school (Pocock and Evans 2011; Pocock and Evans         (under review)) [2: post 31 Oct 2011; post 12 October 2011].
These numbers evidence the substantial reach of this project into the       public domain.
The scientific community benefitted from this exercise due       to the production of robust field-data.
Members of the public benefited       from an enhanced sense of engagement with, and understanding of, their       environment.
They also benefited from an increased engagement with the       inputs, processes and results of environmental research &#8212; this was       evidenced by reviews of the App on iPhone App Store (68 ratings) and       Android Market (23 ratings) and feedback left by users of the website [1;       3].
Second, the project, and its successful engagement with this wide public,       also had an impact on the growing field of `citizen science' and how this       is best practiced.
This is evidenced by the publications and events that       celebrate `Conker Tree Science' as an example of best practice in citizen       science and, indeed, of the best citizen science that Britain has to       offer:            `Conker Tree Science' was selected by RCUK for its website as a         leading example of `excellence with impact'.
Indeed, for RCUK this is         one of the dozen best examples of work they have funded with `Policy'         impact "...which makes a significant contribution to the UK's economy,         society and quality of life" [4].
RCUK also included the project in the official book that marked the         Queen's Diamond Jubilee (2012).
RCUK had two pages to represent the best         of British Research.
It cited its Royal charter and its "duty to         disseminate and communicate research to the public" [5: 306], and then         highlighted `Conker Tree Science' as the best example of Citizen Science         is a section concluding "We take the research beyond the Universities"         [5: 306].
In their words: "It's a great example of how the public can         get involved in an active piece of research" [5: 306].
The book was         presented to The Queen and was delivered to every head of state round         the world.
`Conker Tree Science' was also used as an example of how to test and         modify citizen-science.
It featured in the recently published `Guide to         Citizen Science' (produced by the UK Environmental Observation Network).
This guide provides best practice guidelines at the national level for         Citizen Science; it is freely available via the UK Environmental         Observation Network website [6].
This project is also used by Research Councils as an example of good         practice.
The Media &amp; Public Engagement Manager at NERC, uses Conker         Tree Science in her training of NERC-funded researchers [7].
Likewise,         Evans was invited to speak at the 2012 `Town Meeting' of the BBSRC `Tree         Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative' on ways of using citizen         science to help monitor the arrival and/or spread of invasive insect         species.
Therefore, future citizen scientists, and scientists hoping to use       citizens with mass field-data observation and collection, all benefit from       this project's development of best practice (as recognised by RCUK).
Third, `Conker Tree Science' had impact as an initiative that `enhanced       public attitudes and values about ecological change' while also `changing       public awareness and behaviours in relation to the Environment' [8: 69].
In particular, the reach of this impact was demonstrated by its       substantial media coverage (and this reach can be quantified):            The project was launched on BBC Radio 4's Material World         programme (10 June 2010).
It subsequently featured on BBC 1's The           One Show (16 September 2011, average daily audience 5 million) [2:         post 20 September 2011], and BBC 2's Autumnwatch Unsprung (2.2         million viewers, 14 October 2010).
Regular updates were featured on regional ITV and BBC news bulletins,         and on local radio.
The research was also featured throughout the print media, including:                 The Observer (7 July 2011),          The Times (30 August 2011),          Metro (6 September 2011),          The Daily Mail (12 September and 10 October 2011),          The Telegraph (16 September 2011) and          The Sunday Times (18 September 2011).
[2: section `Publicity,           presentations etc.'].
In 2012, as a result of the success of "Conker Tree Science," we         partnered The Observer newspaper (circulation 250,000) to         develop a new citizen science project to monitor the spread of 10         invasive species (included horse chestnut leaf-miners).
This too         increased public awareness of this threat and about our shifting         ecosystems [9].
The smartphone app had 18,000+ downloads in 2011, and for a time was         the most downloaded educational app in 2011 [4; 2: post 20 September         2011].
Beneficiaries here include members of the public who learn more about the       environment.
School children also benefit by taking part in the scientific       method and learning how it is used to tackle contemporary environmental       issues.
This will be the case especially here, as the reach of this       dissemination has been so broad.
Finally, the project also generated data for Forestry Research:            The data have been combined with other data about the leaf-miner to         generate understandings of how the species has spread geographically and         the pace of this diffusion (see maps at [10]).
These beneficiaries include the Forestry Commission and users of         forests and woodlands for recreational purposes.
This citizen science         approach also outlines a possible way to monitor other tree pathogens         and forest pests in the future.
In sum, this project influenced the behaviour and knowledge of 5000+       individuals [2: post 12 October 2011].
It informed and enhanced their       understandings of the environment and its changes, made them think about       conservation, and prompted them to gather field-data for better       understandings of the leaf-miner problem.
As such, this project became an       example of best practice `citizen science' and it was celebrated as such       by RCUK.
The initiative was also celebrated by the national media and, via       this route, this environmental issue reached millions more people.
Finally, the data produced was of publishable quality and also informed       how Forestry Research understand and represent the problem of the       Horse-chestnut leaf-miner moth.
All this constitutes impact of       significance and reach.
