     Information and advocacy to Parliamentary Groups and Organisations     Following a talk and written submission by Williams to the All-Party         Parliamentary Group         (APPG) on Acquired Brain Injury, chair Bob Russell MP tabled       parliamentary questions*1       (18/1/10) about the knowledge of TBI in prison groups.
Answers revealed       that the Ministry of       Justice did not keep data on or monitor TBI.
An APPG for Prison Health report (2011)*2 endorsed       Williams' recommendations: policy       should better reflect the prevalence of TBI in offenders; offending and       reoffending could be       reduced by acknowledging the role of TBI in criminal behaviour; early       intervention and neuro-       rehabilitation in childhood could contribute to reducing crime; mandatory       screening should be       provided for head injuries at first reception.
An ESRC Seminar Series "Developmental Social Neuroscience, Ethics and         the Law"       brought together leading neuroscience researchers and clinicians with       lawyers and policy       makers to explore policy implications.
The final seminar Neuroscience,         Children &amp; the Law       19/6/12, hosted by the Parliamentary Office for Science and         Technology, presented       William's research*3*9, informed       parliamentarians on advances in neuroscience relevant to the       criminal justice system, and led to further discussions in Parliament*9       on how to take account of       the neurocognitive status of young offenders and their capacity to engage       in judicial       proceedings and rehabilitation.
An overview report on implications for the justice system*4 was       commissioned from       Williams by the Barrow Cadbury Trust and launched by the APPG on Penal       Affairs in       Parliament (4/12/12).
The recommendations referring to neurodisabilities       identified in vulnerable       children were circulated to over 200 MPs and members of the House of Lords       to inform debate       regarding the Children and Families Bill (2013) and the Anti-Social         Behaviour Bill (2013).
With respect to repeat offending, the brain injury research was cited         by Secretary of State for         Justice, Chris Grayling MP in a speech to CIVITAS: "Astonishingly,       it's far more likely than       not that if you're a young person in custody you will have experienced a       traumatic brain injury.
Somewhere between 65 and 70% [65.1-72.1%].
(June 2013)"*5.
The       Secretary of State       estimated that recidivism costs the taxpayer ~&#163;10 billion p.a.
Creation of a Partnership to take the work forward: Williams       helped to establish and originally       co-chaired the Criminal Justice and Acquired Brain Injury Interest         Group (CJABIIG).
Now       chaired by an eminent cross-bench peer*10 who was HM Chief       Inspector of Prisons 1995-2001, this       is a consortium of charities created to develop the evidence base and       policy links, and includes key       brain injury charities (Headway UK, Child Brain Injury Trust, Encephalitis       Society) and law sector       charities (Barrow-Cadbury Trust, Howard League, Prison Reform Trust)       charged with improving       the welfare of offenders' lives and social outcomes.
Stakeholders include       the Youth Justice         Board (YJB).
Work resulting from this Partnership leading to reform in UK         judicial/prison system:     Offender Sentencing: The Barrow Cadbury Trust (BCT) asked Williams       to talk in Parliament       on brain and maturity (early 2011).
This evidence contributed to new       guidelines for judges       issued 2011 by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales, as summarised       in Williams'       BCT report*4.
Williams was also commissioned to write an       article on brain injury and crime in a       CPD newsletter for judges*6.
Young Offender Screening: Since 2012, Williams has assisted the       YJB with assessment       procedures including a new screening system ("CHAT"), written to include       TBI considerations,       which has been piloted, is now in use in the secure estate (approximate       annual intake 4000       young offenders), and will be rolled out into the community system in       2013/2014.
Adult Offender Screening: Williams has consulted on developing       similar screening systems for       adults in prison through advice and training (Jan 2013) provided to the       National Offender       Management System (NOMS Executive Agency of the Ministry of Justice       responsible for       prisoner health) and HM Inspector of Prisons.
Williams was also consultant       to a pilot project for       screening in Leeds Prison conducted by the Disability Trust.
These       initiatives could in due       course affect all offenders coming into the UK prison system &#8212; whose       offender population in       2012 was 86,048, of whom a substantial proportion are likely to have some       form of brain injury.
Earlier Intervention: YJB and Disabilities Trust have developed a       collaboration for joint funding       of link workers to screen and rehabilitate children with TBI in Leeds and       Manchester prisons       (funds awarded Feb 2013) with Williams as research consultant.
The Office of the Children's Commissioner awarded Williams a grant       (Jan 2012) to write a       systematic review and policy document*7, highlighting       significant neurodisability in the offender       population.
He also contributed in the area of neurodisability to a working         group for the Royal         Colleges (Psychiatry, Paediatrics and Child Health, GPs), on guidelines         for         Commissioning Care For Children And Young People In Secure Settings       (June 2013)*8.
As an example of local impact in the Prison Service, Essex Brain       Injury Services has added a       low secure neurobehavioural ward of 8 beds to their existing 14-bed locked       rehab ward and 2 x       3 bed community houses, citing Williams' research.
Williams co-led the British Psychological Society response to the       House of Commons Public       Bill Committee Inquiry on the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing         Bill (July 2013).
Broader dissemination     A Policy Review for the Professional Practice Board (PPB) of the         British Psychological         Society was commissioned in 2012 from Williams, who continues as       Chair of the PPB working       group on Brain Injury and the Justice System.
The policy work has been reinforced with widespread media coverage,       including BBC R4       `All in the Mind (Nov 2010), BBC World Service Newsday (Nov 2010) (the       World Service has       1.39 million UK listeners, 44 million worldwide) BBC R4 Today (Oct 2012):       (6.67 million listeners       RAJAR), The Independent (2012) http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-silent-epidemic-of-head-injury-in-young-offenders-8216841.html,       The Guardian (Oct 2012)       http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/oct/19/brain-injury-justice-young-offenders.
