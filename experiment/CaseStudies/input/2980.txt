     Background: The JRF report developed a multi-dimensional       capabilities approach to well-being to take into account the social,       as well as the physical, personal and environmental factors that are       involved in the conversion of external stresses into losses in well-being.
In collaboration with colleagues from the Department of Geography (UoM),       these were incorporated into a detailed socio-spatial index of       vulnerability, which permits a thorough mapping and statistical analysis       of the distribution of climate disadvantage.
This methodology permits an       approach to local and national mapping that grants policy makers not only       a sense of where the main concentrations of climate disadvantage are to be       found, but also more fine-grained information on what the specific sources       of disadvantage are in different locations.
This is crucial, as different       locations require distinctive policy interventions, depending on the       specific local conversion factors at play.
Pathways: The JRF report was disseminated at a series of meetings       with national policy making bodies, local authorities, housing       organisations and civil society groups.
As a result of subsequent uptake,       a range of actors are now able to better target adaptation strategies and       policies to the specific needs of different populations.
The primary           impact of this research can therefore be charted at two       levels.
(1) Nations and Regions: At the UK level, results       were presented to the `Adaptation Sub-Committee' (ASC) to the Committee on       Climate Change meeting (London, 5th April 2011), with [A] then       utilised extensively within the ASC report (2011) that informed the `UK       Climate Change Risk Assessment' (2012).
It states: "Vulnerability is         also determined by the characteristics of local populations, including         age structure, income levels, education, health and mobility.
A recent         study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that these         socio-economic characteristics can have a significant effect on the         inherent vulnerability of a local community to climate risks.
For         example, the study found that the North West and Yorkshire had a higher         proportion of communities vulnerable to flood risk than the South East".
The `Risk Assessment' also cites [A], as does a 2012 ASC report that       revisits [A], citing the finding that "deprived communities...         generally have a lower capacity to prepare, respond and recover from         flood events" [1].
In Wales a special meeting was organised with the Welsh       Government (Cardiff, 10th October 2011), with research outputs       being subsequently utilised internally to engage stakeholders (including       Ministers) around key principles, and moving to ensure that social       vulnerability and related justice issues were given appropriate       consideration in their activities.
As the Welsh Government's knowledge       transfer advisor notes, the JRF report was "particular[ly]         useful as this had a Welsh perspective and looked at a number of         different angles that I had not seen covered elsewhere e.g.
deprivation         and access to services" [2].
In Scotland, the work was       picked up by the ASC in their report to the Scottish Government.
Subsequently two meetings were held in Edinburgh (16th May       &amp; 12th September 2012) which acknowledged the potential to       transform the research into useful policy, encouraging SEPA to fund a       follow-on project, using additional SEPA datasets to map climate       disadvantage in Scotland.
The Scottish Government's Principal Research       Officer recognises this, noting that: "Through the original work and         the work under the Scottish Government contract, there has been a         greater awareness within SG of the importance of considering         geographical patterns in flood social (or socio-spatial) vulnerability         in addition to the geography of flood hazard-exposure", also       confirming that the report for the Scottish Government was "referred to         within the forthcoming Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme"       [3].
The JRF `Climate Change and Social Justice' programme was the subject of       an independent evaluation which showed that [A] was one of the most       important pieces of work commissioned by JRF, and has `substantial       traction' amongst JRF's key audiences, with "many examples of         instances where the messages from this project have been picked up"       [4].
For instance, the Environment Agency (EA), which advises local       authorities and communities on flooding were "impressed with the JRF's         well-grounded academic framework and robust research" noting that: "JRF         research on adaptation and social justice has been at the cutting edge.
We specifically changed some of our research plans in order to build on         JRF findings, rather than duplicate work they had already done" [2].
Finally, JRF noted the importance of this work within their own ongoing       programme: "we have prioritised it in our own communications activity         and JRF's programme manager has devoted substantial time and resources         to support its dissemination including seeking out opportunities to         present the findings and discuss the implications with key audiences in         many fora" [4].
This is also evidenced through substantial       dissemination support, and the subsequent funding of ClimateJust (JRF/EA).
(2) Local and Civil Society: At a local authority         level the research was disseminated though a series of meetings with       `Regional Climate Change Partnerships' for local authorities including:       Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland (16th April 2012); South       East (23rd October 2012); Yorkshire and Humberside (27th       November 2012) [4].
The director of Climate East Midlands notes that: "It         was particularly helpful for those audiences and for Climate East         Midlands partners to gain new insights into climate justice... via the         local case studies of specific neighbourhoods...This research work is         starting to have a positive effect on practitioners and policy makers in         the East Midlands, for instance by reference to its findings in the         Leicestershire Climate Ready Plan...
This is the first type of area         based adaptation plan in the East Midlands and is promoted by Climate         East Midlands as an example of leading best practice.
It contains an         action, with nominated lead responsibility to `map socio-spatial         vulnerability to climate change in Leicestershire" [5].
These and       other events led to requests for information and further meetings with       additional local authorities including Calderdale, Cheshire West and       Chester, East Riding of Yorkshire, Knowsley, North East Lincolnshire,       North Lincolnshire, Powys, Rossendale and Wigan.
The JRF evaluation       revealed that the report was "being used widely by local authorities         in their own climate change work to draw out social justice arguments         and inform discussions with colleagues to create a shared agenda"       [4].
For example, one local authority officer reports: "We found the         mapping work... to be very useful and have applied it locally using our         own datasets in conjunction with adult services.
We are currently adding         in datasets on public health to the map.
I think it could make a         difference to how services are delivered in the future for example         through the relocation of adult day care centres" [2].
Also,       Hampshire County Council "has been using the mapping approach in its         own analysis of social vulnerability" at an enhanced local scale       [4], and Wigan Council has stated that as a response to this work, they       are "revising our climate change strategy and action plan and will         place a particular focus on climate change adaptation" [6].
Finally,       the JRF report is "being used as a basic evidence source for local         Health and Wellbeing Boards' Joint Strategic Needs Assessment promoted         in the guidance provided by DH officials... [and] used to scope         local action plans" [4].
At the civil society level, meetings have taken place with       community groups (Westminster, 22nd September 2011) and housing       associations (Manchester, 10th October 2012).
The research has       since been used by groups to formulate responses to adaptation.
For       example, The Mersey Forest has used the data to help define an area for a       Big Lottery `Communities Living Sustainably Fund' application on community       led adaptation in practice.
The research has also garnered wider media       coverage around the theme of justice in climate change adaptation,       including an article in The Guardian [7].
Overall, the JRF report has       reached a wide audience and garnered "... international interest...         linked to a presentation by JRF at the Future Cities adaptation         conference held in Hastings on 26/7 February 2013 which was attended by         a range of European cities involved in a European project on adaptation         where social justice issues were new to some of the audience and some         participants particularly remarked on the interesting approach taken on         the vulnerability work" [4].
A range of secondary impacts have also emerged from the       research at UoM.
The SDC project `Redefining Prosperity' considered       whether improvements in well-being can be decoupled from increased       material consumption.
Undertaken prior to Professor O'Neill's JRF work,       his `think piece', commissioned by the SDC, `Living Well Within Limits:       Well-Being, Time and Sustainability' (2008), considers both the promise       and limitations of hedonic theories of well-being in answering this       question, arguing that objective state theories offer a better starting       point for both addressing the question, and for understanding the nature       of inter-generational moral and prudential concern.
The brief was utilised       in the final SDC report, written in 2009 [8].
The research has also been       presented to the public through philosophical societies in Manchester,       Lancaster and Kendal, and also at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas (28th       October 2011); a presentation is available online, with 1046 viewings [9].
In May 2009 Professor O'Neill's invited contribution on well-being       informed the Commission for Rural Communities (CRE) inquiry into the       `Future for England's Upland Communities', as acknowledged in a later       report [10].
