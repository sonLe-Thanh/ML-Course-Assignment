     The Head of Research and Development, EDF Energy, writes: `We have a         fifteen-year long relationship with the OU and consider its expertise in         combining small scale and large scale residual stress measurement         techniques, together with analytical modelling techniques, to be unique.'
[5.1].
The OU and Nuclear Electric measured residual stresses in a weld repair       [5.2], using neutron diffraction, following a steam leak at Hunterston       power station in 1997.
This led to an OU/British Energy research training       partnership (within the EU-funded thematic network TRAINSS, 1998-2001)       involving neutron diffraction measurements of residual stress in long and       short weld repairs [3.1].
These were the first measurements of their kind       and revealed the surprisingly severe nature of residual stress fields       associated with repairs which, most importantly, demonstrated that the       simplified 2-D finite element predictions of stresses at weld repairs       routinely used by British Energy to support safety cases for repairs were       not conservative.
`This resulted in a multi-million pound program of         weld modelling development and validation at British Energy (2001&#8212;10) to         underwrite safety cases for repaired AGR [Advanced Gas-Cooled       Reactor] weldments prone to reheat cracking' [5.1].
The UK AGRs       operate at coolant temperatures significantly higher (over 600&#176;C) than the       water-cooled reactors used elsewhere in the world where temperatures are       below 350&#176;C: this is a demanding operating regime for ageing plant       susceptible to creep degradation (for example reheat cracking and creep       crack growth) in the presence of residual stresses.
In 2004 British Energy funded our `Boiler Spines Residual Stress       Measurement Programme', a five-year research project to quantify residual       stresses using neutron diffraction and the contour method, and measure       spatially resolved weld properties using digital image correlation, on       carefully designed benchmark welds and mock-ups of complex nuclear plant       welds.
This work has had a direct impact on life-extensions of nuclear       plant in the UK [5.3].
Our results were used by British Energy to develop       and validate the use of more realistic heat source and material hardening       models in weld residual stress simulations [3.5], to characterise the       nature of residual stress concentrations at weld repairs [5.4] and to       validate predicted creep relaxation of residual stresses.
The outcomes of       this research have mitigated uncertainty associated with the development       of reheat cracking: `The new understanding of weld repairs and refined         life analysis methods, underpinned by the OU measurements, has allowed         the lives of Hartlepool and Heysham 1 AGR power stations to be extended         to 300,000 hours, rather than the previous restriction of 175,000 hours         caused by uncertainty about creep damage to weld repairs in the main         boiler support structures.
The previous restriction would have required         the reactors to close early.
With each reactor generating around &#163;700k         of electricity per day, these life extensions represent a major         contribution to the UK economy, on jobs and on security of electricity         supply.
It also deferred the need for decommissioning and replacement of         two nuclear power stations at a cost of several billion pounds each'       [5.1].
In aggregate the economic impact of lifetime extensions for the       Hartlepool and Heysham 1 twin-reactor power stations, from 2011 to 2019,       amounts to electricity generation worth over &#163;8 billion.
The application and impact of our research has continued through       characterising residual stresses in dissimilar metal welds for pressurized       water reactors in Japan and France, and on a critical component in a       reactor in Australia that was rendered barely usable due to a water leak,       until a repair was justified.
`Our collaborative measurements with the         Open University team to validate the FEA [finite element analysis] model         of the reflector leak was a critical input to the process that         identified the successful reactor repair method.
The OPAL reactor         provides neutrons to both undertake neutron beam science and the         production of radio pharmaceuticals for Australia.
If the reactor had         not been repaired then the economic impact would run to many millions of       [Australian] dollars per annum.'
[5.5].
Finally, new numerical modelling methods, underpinned by our       measurements, are now widely used by the regulated nuclear industry in       life assessment procedures for pressurised water reactor plant.
The weld       modelling technology validated by our measurements has been captured in       the R6 Failure Assessment Procedure [5.6], transferred by EDF Energy to       the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, and applied to       the pressuriser surge nozzle of Sizewell B Power Station to justify       relaxation of the inspection interval, `saving the station &#163;1m per         annum in lost electricity generation' [5.1].
