     The research has helped enhance the performances of British Para-swimmers       at major competitions and improved coaching practice in Britain; it has       impacted on the international system for classifying Para-swimmers and has       also helped promote the sport to the wider public.
i) Biomechanics Support for Great Britain Para-swimming     The first impact of the research was its significant and sustained       contribution to the development of British Para-swimmers and their       coaches, leading to outstanding performances by British swimmers at       International competitions including, most notably, the Beijing 2008       Paralympics, the IPC World Swimming Championships, 2010 and the London       2012 Paralympics.
The new knowledge gained through the research has been       used to educate and inform Britain's leading coaches and elite swimmers       such as multi world champions Ellie Simmonds and Amy Marren, helping them       to identify strategies for optimising their performances.
Direct application of the knowledge generated by the research was       achieved through Dr. Carl Payton in his role as Biomechanics Lead for the       British Para-swimming squad [A].
As a member of the High       Performance Science and Medicine Team throughout the impact assessment       period, Dr. Payton was responsible for the delivery of biomechanics       support services to elite athletes on the British Para-swimming World       Class Programme [E, F].
The primary aim of the support was to       provide swimmers with evidence-based advice on how to improve technical       aspects of their performance, e.g.
turning technique, arm coordination,       streamlining.
A number of research tools were developed to monitor the       progress of Programme athletes, e.g.
velocity meter, semi-tethered       ergometer [B].
Dr. Payton worked directly with British       Para-swimming coaches and swimmers at the High Performance Centres in       Swansea and Manchester, at UK and overseas training camps, and at       international competitions (including the last four Paralympic Games).
The impact of the research on the performances of British Para-swimmers       is difficult to quantify directly.
However, British Para-swimming clearly       believes that the work is having a significant impact as they continue to       fund it.
Funding in Paralympic sports is limited.
National Governing       Bodies will not continue to fund applied research unless they perceive it       to be of significant benefit to them.
In the London 2012 Paralympics,       Britain had more individual swimming medallists than any other nation (24)       and finished with a medal haul of 7 gold, 16 silver and 16 bronze.
The       sport science support, including the biomechanics, is perceived by other       nations as World-Leading and to have contributed significantly to the       ongoing success of British swimmers.
A testimonial on file from the Sport       Science and Sport Medicine Manager at British Swimming confirms, "The         biomechanical support we receive from Carl Payton falls into 2 areas: 1)         on deck support to athletes and coaches and 2) major development         projects which answer the big performance questions for Rio 2016.
Working with Carl Payton, British Para-Swimming are able to tap into an         extensive pool of expertise.
The link with MMU has allowed British         Para-Swimming to benefit from several applied projects which would be         considered cutting edge within the Paralympic swimming environment.
"[C]     The knowledge generated by the research has also been disseminated to       coaches and other practitioners at International, National and Regional       level through presentations at coaching conferences, workshops, seminars       and publications in coaching journals (examples listed at end).
ii) Biomechanics Support for the International Paralympic Committee         (IPC)     The second impact of the research is the provision of new scientific       knowledge that led to the decision by the IPC in 2010 to use the research       to improve the fairness and objectivity with which elite swimmers are       classified for international competitions.
An effective classification system should provide athletes who have a       disability with an equitable starting point for competition by minimising       the impact that their impairment has on the outcome of the event.
The       current swimming classification system relies on expert, but predominantly       subjective, opinion, rather than on empirical evidence.
In 2009 the IPC       mandated the development of a new, evidence-based classification system       for swimming.
Research groups from Australia, USA, France and the UK were       then invited to contribute to the project, with the UK group (led by Dr.       Payton) taking the lead on the assessment of drag (resistance).
Over 200       elite swimmers have been tested and preliminary results (Oh et al.,       2013) indicated that the current classification system significantly       disadvantages certain swimmers by placing insufficient weighting on drag       assessment.
These findings highlighted an important deficiency in the       current system and provided an understanding of how drag assessment could       be incorporated into the new system.
The knowledge generated by the drag       research has been communicated directly, in written reports, to swimmers       and coaches in over 41 countries and indirectly to an even broader       audience via the IPC website (http://www.paralympic.org).
As the Medical and Scientific Director for the International Paralympic       Committee writes (in a statement on file at MMU [D])"The         further development of sport-specific classification systems on the         basis of scientific evidence is critical to the continued growth of the         Paralympic Movement and for opportunities available to athletes with a         disability.
This project will form the basis for the revision of the         classification system for IPC Swimming to become credible, valid,         transparent and consistent with the IPC classification code.
The IPC         recognises the lead role of MMU in this project."
iii) Direct Impact through Coaching, Workshops, Newsletters and Media         Dissemination       Secondary impacts have been achieved through the dissemination of Dr.       Payton's research findings at a range of conferences, workshops and events       to the professional and amateur coaching community throughout the impact       period.
Most notably Payton has run workshops for the British       Para-swimming Coaches Annual Meeting, Liverpool (2011), provided the       keynote address and various demonstrations on Biomechanics Support for         Elite Swimmers with a Disability to the 16th FINA Sports       Medicine Congress, Manchester (2008) and in 2013 he was a speaker at the       first ever World Coaches Conference.
Payton has also contributed many articles to coaching publications       including the Peter Harrison Centre Newsletter (2011) [E],       SportEX medicine newsletter [F] and the chapter on Biomechanics       in the British Disability Swimming Delivering on Deck Handbook.
His role and his approach to using biomechanics within it was featured in       an Independent newspaper article:       http://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/biomechanics-the-gold-standard-434485.html
