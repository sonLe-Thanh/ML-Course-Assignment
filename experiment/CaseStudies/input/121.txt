     The Process     After the publication of his first article on Ealing's Saraband for         Dead Lovers (Johnston 2010),       Johnston contacted Studio Canal UK (then operating under the name Optimum       Releasing) to       discuss the release strategy for its Ealing Studios Collection range.
Liaising with Candy Vincent-       Smith (then Optimum's Head of Catalogue Development, DVD), it became clear       that Optimum       would welcome research-led support around catalogue development.
Johnston       and Williams were       then given unrestricted (and unparalleled) access to the Optimum back       catalogue of British cinema       titles, and asked to use their research expertise to suggest titles, shape       future catalogue       development, and contribute to Optimum's commercial success.
In 2012, Studio Canal UK licensed 450 titles from its British cinema       catalogue to Network       Distributing, another DVD company with which Johnston had a relationship.
Network's Head of       Marketing, Hugh David, contacted Johnston for a series of research reports       (based partly on work       already undertaken, but with a focus on a range of titles from the Ealing       Studios back catalogue):       again, the research expertise of Johnston and Williams was sought in order       to ascertain potential       titles for DVD release and to support Network's commercial success through       that release       programme.
Studio Canal UK and Network Distributing are, alongside Granada and the       BFI, responsible for       releasing the bulk of British cinema DVDs within the UK.
They play a       significant role in the creation       of the British cinema DVD canon and demonstrate the important function       that academic research       can have on these gatekeepers, most notably around the wider cultural       rediscovery and       popularisation of older catalogue film titles.
Impacts and Benefits     Studio Canal:            Studio Canal UK believe that Johnston/Williams' `academic research...         translates into         commercial activity' and is essential to improving `our knowledge of the         catalogue and the         release potential therein' (Vincent-Smith, March 2012)       Studio Canal's decision to re-release Woman in a Dressing Gown         on DVD (and in a limited         cinema release) was propelled by Williams' research (2008, 2013b) and         recommendation         of it as a key title in British cinema       Williams' championing of the film `as a feminist text' led directly to         Studio Canal applying for         funding from the Independent Cinema Office to release it as a         `culturally important film'         (ibid.).
The film was subsequently screened at 39 cinemas across the UK         in August-         September 2012       Studio Canal noted that special features such as Williams' interview         on the DVD would         `help sell DVDs' and would `legitimise' the release (ibid.)
The Woman in a Dressing Gown DVD subsequently sold 2120 units         (British Video         Association (BVA) figures: Green, September 2013), described by         Vincent-Smith as a         `good' return for a catalogue release       Johnston and Williams' recommendations from the catalogue also         included Dance Hall and         Nowhere to Go (1958), subsequently released on DVD by Studio         Canal UK in 2012-13          Network Distributing:            Johnston's Ealing research (2010, 2012) `directly impacted the choices         and content for         releases in that series [Network's The Ealing Rarities Collection]...         the commercial value of         his... contribution is large indeed' (Hugh David, February 2013)       Network had released 6 volumes of The Ealing Rarities Collections         (each containing four         films) by the time of submission       Johnston's research around Network's 450 licensed titles `was huge...         doing work of a         depth and scale that we simply could not achieve in day-to-day industry         activity, confirming         some professional instincts, dismissing others, and speeding up the         process as a whole of         commercial assessments on this vast archive' (ibid.)
By 16th September 2013, the first six Ealing Rarities         collections had sold a combined total         of 3827 units (Volume 1: 920; Vol.
2: 1038; Vol.
3: 739; Vol.
4: 521;         Vol.
5.: 388; Vol.
6:         221) (BVA figures: Green, 2013)          The impact here, then, is a direct contribution to wealth creation within       the DVD sector of the       creative industries, adding value to commercial projects through Johnston       and Williams' academic       research and the transfer of that knowledge to specific DVD distribution       partners.
Williams' work on       Woman in a Dressing Gown (2008, 2013b) impacted Studio Canal's       plans for a DVD release and       created cause for a nationwide cinema re-release; Studio Canal relied on       Williams and Johnston to       expand their Ealing DVD range; and Network planned their 2013 Ealing range       around Johnston's       recommendations.
In all these cases, the research impact has been on the       strategic and       commercial imperatives of Studio Canal UK and Network Distributing.
Studio Canal UK's business benefitted economically from Johnston and       Williams' research on       British cinema.
It continues to `use their research to identify possible       commercial areas of       opportunity further in advance' (Vincent-Smith, March 2012); while Network       see the collaboration       as `huge', `making commercial assessments' that `impacted the choices and       content' of their       release strategy (David, February 2013).
