     The research from Cardiff demonstrated that hospital data was an entirely       new measure of violence that if shared appropriately would represent an       innovative approach for measuring and influencing the success of       violence-prevention strategies that is independent of the criminal justice       system.
UK Government policy and crime-prevention practices     During the assessment period the impact of the Cardiff research has been       on policy-making and implementation at the level of National UK Government       with evidence of emerging international adoption.
The following indicates       the trajectory along which impact has developed:     2010: Based on Cardiff research showing the effectiveness of       data-sharing in reducing community violence the College of Emergency       Medicine (representing over 3,000 emergency physicians in the UK and       internationally) published Clinical Guidelines to its membership [5.1]       recommending adoption of the `Cardiff Model'.
In the same year the Institute of Alcohol Studies (IAS) published a       factsheet [5.2] on alcohol and crime.
The IAS is a       government-independent organisation serving the public interest through       the use of scientific evidence to underpin increased awareness.
Importantly this includes drafting of commissioned government reports of       alcohol-related issues in society.
The IAS factsheet [5.2]       used the Cardiff research to highlight that police statistics seriously       underestimate the amount of violent crime actually taking place.
It       commented on the Cardiff approach of sharing information from Emergency       Departments (four citations to Shepherd's work)  "enabling police to         intervene in violent incidents earlier than would otherwise be possible,         reducing the severity of the resulting injuries."
In May 2010 the coalition government's programme for UK government       (Cabinet Office publication [5.3]) made a clear commitment to "make         hospitals share non-confidential information with the police so they         know where gun and knife crime is happening and can target ......crime         hot spots."
2012: The Home Office's alcohol strategy [5.4]       includes a commitment to promote the College of Emergency Medicine's       guidance on the `sharing of information' to both understand the scale and       range of the violence locally and to allow preventative action.
The Home       Office strategy explicitly cites the research of Shepherd and a commitment       to the "Cardiff Model" of data-sharing, stating: "The Coalition         Programme for Government included a commitment to require hospitals to         share non- confidential information with the police....The         implementation of this commitment focuses on all types of violent         assault - many of which are alcohol-related.
To deliver this commitment,         we have promoted the College of Emergency Medicine guidance which is         based on the `Cardiff model'.
In Cardiff, this approach has shown a         sustained reduction of violence-related attendances of up to 40% We will         encourage all hospitals to share non-confidential information on         alcohol-related injuries with the police."
In the same year the Department of Health (DH) issued national guidance       to members of Community Safety Partnerships (CSP) including the police,       health authorities and local authorities.
It reinforced the coalition's       programme commitment on sharing information to tackle violence.
The DH       guidance cites the Cardiff research and the important role of hospitals to       promote community safety.
It explicitly links this to the government's       programme to support Emergency Units in introducing the `Cardiff Model' of       data collection and sharing [5.5].
As a follow up the DH       launched (January 10th 2013) a webpage on its www.gov.uk news       site which promotes engagement of CSPs and NHS through the adoption of the       `Cardiff Model' and provides resources to support information sharing.
2013: The Coalition Government's Mid-Term Review stated "we         have established a national scheme requiring hospitals to share         information on gun and knife crime" [5.6].
To assess the       degree of implementation the DH and the Home Office commissioned the       Centre for Public Innovation and Gecko Social Health Outcomes to conduct       an independent audit of progress.
This audit showed one- third of       Emergency Units and CSPs were sharing information at the level set out in       the College of Emergency Medicine guidelines [5.1].
The report       prompted Public Health Minister Anna Soubry to write to health chiefs and       police chiefs throughout the country requiring them to implement effective       data-sharing methods.
Her letter [5.7] draws attention to the       College of Emergency Medicine guidelines and to the DH guidance on       information sharing (including the DH webpage of supporting resources)       both of which are explicitly based on the Cardiff research.
In February 2013, Norman Lamb (Minister of State for Care and Support,       DH) publicly linked the commitment of the coalition government and DH to       Cardiff research stating "I am pleased to report on the efforts we are         taking in the Department of Health to roll out the `Cardiff Model'...We         know the Cardiff model works.
Now we need to ensure every community sees         the benefit."
[5.8].
Addressing the public health need and the economic savings that can be       made [see 3.7] the coalition government continues to drive       forward implementation of its commitment on preventing violence through       the (Cardiff) approach of multi-agency information sharing of hospital       data [5.9].
In 2013 the Dutch government through the country's       Ministry of Security and Justice launched a pilot National Violence       Approach Programme using the `Cardiff Model' in seven of Amsterdam's       hospitals with, if successful, national rollout anticipated in 2015 [5.10].
