     Working in the context of a divided island seeking new political and       social relationships DB, using       research evidence, has influenced policy makers and practitioners that,       through school       partnerships and innovative teaching and learning approaches, ICT has an       important role to play in       helping teachers and young people come to new understandings within and       beyond the Irish       border.
4.1 Impact on teachers     According to the NFER report (2011, p.97), detailed in section 2,       professional development in the       use of ICT on the DB programme `helped to develop teachers' skills and         confidence in this         area' and this, in turn, was regarded as `one of a number of         significant motivators for         teachers' participation in the project'.
Further, a Joint Inspection       report by officials on both sides       of the border in Ireland (2012), said that the professional development       provided by the DB       programme improved the quality of learning; key findings, such as the       insights into what kinds of       practice facilitated collaborative learning using ICT were disseminated in       research reports to all       teachers and used as the focus for professional development at annual       planning conferences.
The       report noted that the DB programme `has contributed to and utilised         international research to         ensure that it is focused on improving the quality of the learning         experiences for the         participants' (Source 1, p.5).
4.2 Impact on children's learning     Data from the 2011 NFER report (2011), Teaching Approaches That Help         to Build Resilience to         Extremism among Young People, noted that `pupils reported         increased awareness and         tolerance of pupils from the other side of the border.'
(Source 2).
The data from the NI/ROI       Joint Inspection report (Source 1, 2012, p.12), confirmed these findings.
It noted that `99% of the         schools in Northern Ireland strongly agreed or agreed that the programme         has led to `a         positive change in pupils' values and attitudes, eg.
open-mindedness,         acceptance, self-confidence,         empathy and curiosity.'
Research by Austin and Hunter (2013)       reported that, even       one year after their involvement in the programme, students who took part       were extremely positive       about their experiences and far more likely to want to repeat such links       compared to pupils in the       same schools who had not taken part.
4.3 Impact on educational policy; ICT accreditation and assessment     The data generated by research into the DB programme has led to changes       in the accreditation of       ICT; a letter from the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and       Assessment (CCEA) (2012)       has confirmed that since 2009, the scheme run for all schools in NI was       amended to include       "exchange" because of the work of the programme.
It stated, `In 2009,         CCEA introduced a         revised version of the ICT Accreditation Scheme for pupils at Key         Stages1, 2 and 3 which,         for the first time, included the requirement that ICT should be used for         "exchange".
This         new focus was introduced as a result of the growing number of schools         that were already         using ICT for inter-school links through the Dissolving Boundaries         Programme'.
The ICT       accreditation scheme will become mandatory for all schools in 2014 in NI       (Source 3).
The Joint Inspection report (2012) recommended that `the Department         of Education should         ensure that the outcomes of the DB programme are linked more clearly to         the principles of         the Cohesion, Sharing and Inclusion policy.'
These recommendations       have resulted in a       directive being issued in July 2012 by the Department of Education to the       local education       authorities in NI to take account of the work of the DB programme for       cross-community relations       and the delivery of the 14-18 curriculum (Source 4).
4.4 Impact on global policy and practice     Israel     The DB programme's use of ICT has had a direct, medium-term impact in       developing a similar       project in Israel, based on links between Orthodox Jewish schools, secular       Jewish schools and       Arab schools (Source 5).
In explaining the design of their own project       they noted that `A number         of computer-mediated communication (CMC) projects have been carried out         among diverse         populations, specifically populations in conflict, based on the contact         hypothesis.
Probably         the best documented one is Dissolving Boundaries,         ... between Northern Ireland and the         Republic of Ireland (Austin, 2006)'.
The authors further noted that       `Austin and Anderson (2008)         claim that a new paradigm is emerging that can bring together insights         from both social         learning theories in education and insights from social psychology'.
An interim evaluation of       the Israeli project showed that the year-long links were building trust       between pupils and key       recommendations in this evaluation were put into practice in 2013.
This       led the Ministry of       Education in Israel to expand the programme in 2013-14 (Source 6).
England     Similarly, research into the effectiveness of the work in Dissolving       Boundaries has had an impact       on the Schools Linking Network (SLN) in England, an organisation set up       after the race riots in       Bradford in 2001 to foster better race relations between young people in       schools.
As a       consequence of a presentation on DB, the Director of SLN wrote in December       2011: `While we         have always used ICT to introduce pupils to each other, we have not         until now used it to         develop on-going collaborative work.
SLN has now put in place a clear         ICT strategy which         we will be able to offer to schools across the UK to support our         on-going programmes'       (Source 7).
In terms of the impact of the DB programme compared to other initiatives,       the Centre for Cross-Border       Studies was commissioned by the Department of Education in NI to review       all cross-border       educational programmes.
Having assessed all the evidence available, it       commented that DB was       `the single most outstanding example of mutually beneficial         cross-border cooperation...         between schools anywhere in Europe, let alone Ireland' (Source 8).
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland educational cooperation     The financial support of the two Departments of Education for DB since       1998 has enabled them to       partially fulfil the obligations of Strand 2 of the Belfast Agreement       which placed a responsibility on       the two governments to establish areas of mutual cooperation.
The       programme has been       discussed on several occasions at the North-South Ministerial Council,       most recently in February       2013 when a joint communique noted the launch of a DVD `featuring both         Education Ministers'       which showed how ICT was being used to promote community cohesion and that       `experiences         gained within the Dissolving Boundaries Programme have assisted in the         development of a         similar programme in Israel' (Education Joint Communique, Source 9).
Overall, DB effectively fits with the UoA research impact strategy by       working in an all-Ireland       developmental context and actively pursuing research which has influenced,       demonstrably, policy       and practice in education, north and south.
Subsequently, its insights are       proving valuable to       other contested societies.
