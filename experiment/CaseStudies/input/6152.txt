     From 1994 - 1999, Loughborough University developed a series of prototype       acoustic deterrent devices named PICE-EX, PICE-97 and PICE-99, generating       an ultrasonic acoustic swept signal up to frequencies as high as 160 kHz.
Since 1999 this system was then later commercialized under the       AQUAmark100&#8482; trade name by the AQUAtec Group based on the underpinning       research outlined in section 2.
1) Influenced changes in government / EU policy     The on-going (since 2008) impact on international policy of the       underpinning research outlined in section 2 is seen in various amendments       / enforcements to European Commission legislation established in 2004 (EC,       2004) concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries [5.1].
This legislation included a requirement to use acoustic deterrents to       reduce fisheries by catch.
This regulation was influenced by Loughborough       University's (LU) research in this area and the specifications for the       pingers to be used the AQUAmark product specifications.
Mandatory use of       pingers with these specifications was also included at this time in the       national porpoise action plans of most of the EU countries and in the       action plans of ASCOBANS (Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans       of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas; www.ascobans.org).
An example of international implementation at this time can be seen in the       ASCOBANS "The Swedish action plan" ASCOBANS, Document AC11/Doc.
15(P)       Harbour Porpoise Action Plan for Sweden.
(ASCOBANS 2004) [5.2].
The       on-going impact of these regulation and subsequent international and       national implementations is evidenced below.
In 2010 as part of the Memorandum of Understanding, the European Union       requested the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to       review incidental catches of cetaceans in European waters and to advise on       the implementation of certain provisions of the earlier Council       Regulations (EC, 2004) No 812/2004.
These provisions continued to advise "acoustic         deterrents using basic 10 kHz signals and more complex multi-signal       (such as the LU influenced AQUAmark100 product), be deployed on static         gear are effective in reducing by-catch of harbour porpoise" (ICES,       2010) [5.3].
In 2013 data from Danish fisheries trials using       AQUAmark100 systems was published to suggest greater spacing of pingers       could be effective for implantation in Danish gillnet and hake fisheries       (Larsen et al., 2013) [5.4].
From 1st September 2013 the UK's Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has       announced its intent to enforce the implementation of the European       Commission No 812/2004 regulations for specific UK fisheries.
In this       statement all vessels measuring 12 metres or over using certain nets are       required to fit acoustic dissuasive devices, known as pingers to help       reduce cetacean by-catch (MMO, 2013) [5.5].
The Aquamark100 system       using LU influenced research is specifically listed in this document as a       regulation-compliant device.
2) Changed the worldwide debate around achieving reductions in         accidental by-catch by fisheries     There has been continued world-wide debate on the use of acoustic       deterrent systems for the reduction of by-catch (accidental capture of       marine mammals and others in fisheries).
This debate has extended to use       of such systems to also prevent depredation (prevention of damage to       fisheries by marine mammals) (SFGEN, 2002) and extension to a wide range       of species including larger whales and sharks (Dawson et al.,       2013) using acoustic deterrent devices including the AQUAmark system [5.6].
In 2008 when Gazo et al, reported in trials in the Mediterranean       that nets equipped with AQUAmark pingers using Loughborough developed       algorithms received less predation damage (87% fewer holes) than nets with       non-functional devices or without pingers (Gazo et al, 2008) [5.7].
Reducing net damage is a commercial imperative for fisheries.
Also in 2008       Brotons et al.
reported a large scale study of an artisanal       gillnet fishery around the Balearic Islands using several pinger types       where "the use of active pingers apparently discouraged dolphins from       interacting with nets, dramatically so in the case of the Aquatec       (AQUAmark100) pingers" (Brotons et al., 2008) [5.8].
3) Contributed to commercial growth of UK business through sales of         the commercialized systems     The AQUAtec Group Ltd undertook to commercialise Loughborough       University's patented technology and have marketed it under the name       AQUAmark100&#8482;.
They also have a series of additional products still using       Loughborough's original PICE developed signal suite as the foundation       technology.
To date, AQUAtec have sold over 14,000 systems internationally       at an average unit cost of &#163;80 (Dawson et al., 2013) [5.6]       making it the market leader in Northern Europe and significantly reducing       by-catch in a wide variety of fisheries internationally.
In 2007, the       World Wildlife Fund (WWF) awarded a `Special UK prize' to the Aquatec       Group Ltd for the AQUAmark systems and its work in by-catch reduction,       this reduction continues within the assessment period.
In the WWF       announcement the contribution of Loughborough University through their       longstanding partnership with AQUAtec was also acknowledged.
