     This underpinning research has been widely disseminated through numerous       leading publications, articles and on-line forums, which has led to       enhanced public awareness of history's claims to practical relevance.
Since 2008, Tosh's research publication Why History Matters has       been marketed to a public audience.
This publication of high-quality       historiographical research acted as an advertisement of the social utility       of history for non-specialists, and has occasioned the broader       dissemination of Tosh's research insights amongst a large number of       teaching institutions and a public audience.
In this sense Why History         Matters has complemented the well-established use of The Pursuit         of History, and the updated editions published since 2008, in       teaching A-level students and undergraduates more broadly.
Taken together,       these publications have drawn on, and substantially developed, insights       generated from Tosh's more specialised research to have the following       impacts:     Influencing the delivery of curriculum and syllabi through the         widespread use of The Pursuit of History and       Why History Matters     The Pursuit of History has contributed towards maintaining the       infrastructure of the discipline of history.
In particular, it answers to       the principle laid down in the Benchmarking Statement that reflexivity       should be an integral aspect of all undergraduate programmes.
In order to       meet this The Pursuit of History book is prescribed or recommended       reading extensively in History BA and PGCE courses, and it is also used       widely in further education courses, including A-Levels.
Why History         Matters is also being widely used in historiography courses at       universities (examples include: the University of Southampton, HIST1112       `Historians and History'; the University of Sheffield, HST202 `History and       Historians'; Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), 201 `Thinking History';       Stanford University, History 200H History Colloquium; Keele University,       HIS-10026 `History, Media, Memory: The Presentation of the Past in       Contemporary Culture'; University of Northumbria, Newcastle Cultural       Heritage Management MA, HI0727 `Heritage and History'; the University of       Oxford, Diploma in Local History; Edge Hill University also uses Why         History Matters during the interview process for prospective PGCE       History students).
Indicators of reach of this impact include the distribution of       the publications and sales figures.
Currently, over 600 public and       university libraries hold the books internationally (source:       worldcat.org), reaching a wide audience.
Sales figures since 2008 also       indicate the wide influence of the research:                                            The Pursuit of History (all editions)            Why History Matters (2008)                             2008           4970           2105                             2009           9265           1306                             2010           10626           506                             2011           5611           706                             2012           4324           584                             2013 (to 31st July)           642           Data not available                             Total           35438           5207                          Evidence of the importance of these publications as an educational       resource internationally includes their translations into Swedish,       Serbian, Turkish, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Chinese since 2008.
The widespread usage of both Why History Matters and The         Pursuit of History in introductory modules to the discipline is       complemented by the effect it has on students' understanding of history.
A       blog of reviews of Tosh's publications by students at the University of       Mary Washington demonstrates an enhanced understanding of the processes       and contexts of history:     `our thought processes need to be adjusted to fit the context', `I now       understand that history is a great tool to explain how we got to where we       are today, but is not meant to predict where we are going', `I now have a       better understanding of the process of historical study, but realizing how       we as historians tend to use our social memory more than our historical       awareness.
This reading especially caught my attention'.
Evidence of the usage of the research for secondary teaching includes       general reference to both publications, for example at the Historical       Association and by the History Teachers Association of Ireland, when       demonstrating the value of history for students.
Tosh has been active in       communicating his research on the theme of `Why History Matters' directly       to secondary school teachers at events held in conjunction with the       Historical Association (for example, in February, May, June 2009).
Contributing to the wider public understanding of history as a         practical discipline:     This research has continued to underpin wider public engagement, in       particular through public lectures and popular writing.
For example, to       coincide with the launch of Why History Matters in May 2008, Tosh       delivered a briefing paper at a History and Policy event, (http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-79.html)       whilst other key contributors also formally responded to the research and       its relevance for public audiences.
Similarly, in August 2008, Tosh       addressed an audience on the theme of 'Critical citizens: reflections on       history's public role in Britain' at the Australia House in London.
This       lecture was subsequently broadcast on ABC radio in Australia.
Tosh has       utilised this research in two articles in History Today,       advocating the role of history in citizenship: `A greater degree of value'       (History Today Vol.
60, Issue 1, 2009), and `Citizen scholars' (History         Today Vol.
62, Issue 7, 2012) in order to reach a more diverse       engaged audience.
Further media engagement includes Tosh's contribution to       a radio programme focusing on masculinities through the prism of Captain       Scott (`Amanda Vickery on ... Men', BBC Radio 4, 9 Sep. 2012).
The reception of Why History Matters (2008) amongst politicians       and policy makers demonstrates the significant contribution of the       work to a wider public understanding of history as a practical discipline.
The book has been reviewed widely, including by leading historians on the       History and Policy website, which is explicitly directed at a non-academic       audience.
Gordon Marsden MP, and former editor of History Today,       commented on the importance of the book in his review: `he is particularly       sensitive to &#8212; and sensible on &#8212; how history can give us a proper       assessment of changes over time &#8212; crucial to today's opinion-formers and       policy-makers', `he is onside for popularizing history but not       bastardizing it', and recommended that `policy-makers, media men and women       and, dare I say it, politicians, should all read'.
Evidence of the significance of Tosh's research includes       engagement at a policy-making level and the citation of Tosh's       historiographical works in a briefing paper for the House of Lords written       by Ian Cruse (14th October 2011, LLN 2011/030).
The paper was       circulated in advance of the debate to `call attention to the teaching of       history in schools'.
In particular, Tosh's research was used to explore       the value of studying History in the `Why Study History?'
section of the       document.
Subsequent debate in the House of Lords drew on the document.
