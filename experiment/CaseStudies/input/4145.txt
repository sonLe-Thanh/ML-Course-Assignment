     The work on the BBC-PS has had impact by (i) shaping educational practice       and content (at       both secondary school and university level) and by (ii) informing academic       and public debate and       understanding of issues around leadership, tyranny, oppression, and       resistance.
Impact on Educational Practices     This work has laid the foundations for (a) the reform of educational       curricula, (b) the production       of educational resources, and (c) engagement with students, teachers, and       academic staff.
(a) Reforming Educational Curricula     From 2008 on, the A-level exam board OCR has designated the BBC-PS as a       "core study" for       their A-level (AS and A2) syllabus1,2.
Between 2008 and 2013,       over 100,000 students took OCR       Psychology at A level, with more than 60,000 students also taking it at AS       level.
The study was       also incorporated as a key component of the Open University's introductory       course in Critical       Social Psychology3 and is taught as part of university courses       on classic studies in psychology.
Haslam and Reicher were awarded the British Psychology Society's Annual       Award for       Excellence in Teaching in September 2009.
The citation for the award       recognized "the pioneering         way in which Haslam and Reicher have contributed to teaching psychology         in the UK by         developing innovative resources and engaging with both teachers and         students".
This award has       itself been the subject of positive follow-up articles in a range of       outlets (e.g., The Psychologist and       The Higher Education Academy Psychology Network Newsletter).
In September 2010 Haslam received a National Teaching Fellowship from the       Higher Education       Academy in recognition of his work on the BBC-PS.
The citation for the       award stated: "It is hard to         make good television programmes; it is hard to do good science; it is         hard to develop high-quality         teaching materials.
But although each of these things is hard on their         own, the task of combining         them is far harder.
However, ... work on the BBC Prison Study [shows]         that these combined goals         can be achieved and that when they are, the dividends are enormous.
This         project has made a real         difference to the landscape of psychology, and, through this, to public         debate about the most         important of topics."
(b) Producing educational resources     Haslam and Reicher worked with BBC Active (the educational arm of BBC       Publications) to       produce a boxed set of Videos/DVDs4 which has been sold to over       250 institutions, and includes a       full transcript and a 140-page teacher's manual.
First published in 2005,       The Experiment became       one of BBC Active's five best-selling products for the Higher Education       market.
Haslam and Reicher also worked with On-line Classroom (an independent       producer of       academic resources) to develop a 30-minute introductory DVD5       for teachers and students       (released in 2009, bought by more than 100 institutions       worldwide).
Additional material included a       summary of the main quantitative findings from the study (in the form of       an animated presentation       of graphs that describe results of key psychometric measures) and       `Frequently Asked Questions'.
As one reviewer noted: "This is easily the best DVD that Online         Classroom have produced so far in         terms of editing, animation and use of original footage.
(...) I will be         using the DVD as a revision         lesson for my students this year and because of this will do a much         better job of teaching this fab         study next year"6.
(c) Engaging with students and teachers     Haslam has disseminated this work in more than 25 lectures to school       students, typically to       groups of around 800 at a time.
Moreover, this work has been the basis for       various keynote       addresses including an OCR conference on the new core studies in 2008, the       Association of       Psychology Teachers' Conference in 2009, the AS Psychology Student       Conference in 2012, and       the British Psychology Society's Annual conference in 2013.
Haslam has       also spoken about the       BBC-PS at numerous national and international academic seminars and       conferences: e.g., invited       lectures at Yale University (where Milgram conducted his obedience studies       in the 1960s), and at       the Universities of Cambridge, Cardiff, Coventry, Dundee, Exeter, Keele,       Gloucester, Leeds, LSE,       Manchester, Oxford, Surrey, Sussex, Southampton, and York.
Impact on Public Debate     Shaping debate through media outlets     This work has had a fundamental impact on discourse around issues such as       group dynamics,       tyranny, leadership, and stress within and beyond academia.
Following       dissemination in broad       disciplinary magazines like The Psychologist7, and in       interdisciplinary publications such as       Scientific American Mind and PLOS Biology8, the       research has been widely discussed in national       and international newspapers, magazines, and television programmes &#8212; e.g.
BBC's Newsnight       and Hardtalk.
In April 2013 the study was the focus of an extended       treatment on the BBC Radio 4       programme Digital World.
In May 2013 it also provided the frame       for an interview (with Haslam) in       the podcast series Voices on Ant-Semitism organized by the US       Holocaust Memorial Museum9.
Shaping debate through the BBC Prison Study Website     The BBC-PS has become a key reference in the public's understanding and       debate of issues       around power, tyranny, and resistance.
Indicative of this, a Google web       search with the phrase       "BBC prison study" generates a total of 41,400 hits (Nov 2013).
In 2008 Haslam and Reicher created an official BBC Prison Study website       (www.bbcprisonstudy.org)10       which outlines the study's key findings and presents a comprehensive       analysis of relevant theoretical issues.
Moreover, as a way to address       specific user groups, it       includes frequently updated sections providing (a) answers to FAQs, (b)       academic publications, (c)       teaching resources, (d) a glossary and useful links, (e) useful       quotations, and (f) a summary       timeline that describes pivotal events and interventions of the study.
The       website also includes a       blog about contemporary real world issues (also published in The         Psychologist) and a range of       activities (i.e., discussion questions, exercises, and psychometric       tests).
Since its launch in later 2008, this website has been used with       increasing frequency (see Figure       below): it has received over 600,000 unique visitors.
Over the two years       ending in July 2013, it       recorded more than 350,000 sessions, with an increasing proportion outside       the UK and USA.
(Clearly its audience goes way beyond UK students.)
On this basis, the       study can lay claim to       being not only one of the largest field studies in social psychology of       the last 30 years, but also one       of the most influential.
