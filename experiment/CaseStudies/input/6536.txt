     The impact in this case study consists of very practical outcomes &#8212; the       design and       delivery of programmes designed to support the development of school       leaders and       headteachers in particular.
The claims of impact are therefore directly       related to the       provision of developmental activities &#8212; in other words how academic       research of       various types informs and influences professional practice.
Impact here is       understood       as the extent to which research and writing in the academic community       influences, to a       significant extent, the programmes that inform the career development of       the       professional community of school leaders.
Significant changes to the       delivery of       programmes to accommodate the research findings are evidenced in the 2010       NCSL       Middle Leadership Development programme.
Judging impact in leadership development is complex because there are so       many       significant intervening variables.
It is very difficult to demonstrate a       precise correlation       and causality between following a leadership development programme,       attending a       course or reading materials and confidence that any change in       effectiveness can be       attributed to that experience.
Therefore impact is being understood here       as `first level'       i.e.
engagement rather than `second level' i.e.
demonstrable change.
Leadership       effectiveness is the result of a highly complex series of interactions and       there is no       accurate methodology for isolating out the specific factors.
However it       can be argued       that changing the processes and content that informs the design and       delivery of       leadership development is therefore, of itself, significant.
Innovative       leadership       development, at the very least, contributes to the debate about       sustainable educational       practices.
The programmes coming from the research have the potential to       shape the       nature of school leadership and the resultant impact on school communities       and the       values and attitudes held by social communities associated with these       public       environments.
The outcomes which demonstrate the practical application and impact of       the research       described include:            Designing and writing the NCSL Middle Leadership Development Programme         2010.
This became the standard text for middle leadership development         programmes         2010-2013;       Designing and writing the National College for Teaching and Learning         Modular         Programme for Level 1 &#8212; National Professional Qualification for Middle         Leaders         2012-2013;       Writing the Learning Centred leadership modules for the European         Community         funded project on `Deep Learning' in Slovenia on behalf of the National         School for         Leadership in Education in Slovenia 2011-2013;       Contributing to the design, development and delivery of the `Forbairt         ' (Forwards)         programme for experienced school leaders For the Leadership Development         in         Schools programme in the Republic of Ireland 2005-2013;       Contributing to programmes on outstanding and high performance         leadership         organised by the OBE Consultancy in the Netherlands 2008-2013;       Designing and delivering `Good to Outstanding' programmes for a number         of local         authorities in England &#8212; Cambridgeshire 2011 and 2012 and Suffolk 2012         and         2013;       Acting as a reviewer for academic journals on proposed articles         relating to         alternative perspectives on school leadership;       Acting as external examiner for doctorates in this subject area.
West-Burnham's research and writing has continued with a range of       publications on the       theme of aspects of outstanding leadership:     West-Burnham, J.
&amp; Chapman, L. (2010) Education for social         justice: Achieving         wellbeing for all, London: Continuum;     `Leadership for outstanding teaching and learning.'
School         Improvement and Inspection       Issue 31, May 2012;     `Kje so Meje?
Izobraxevanje, sola in skupnost' in Vodenje v vzgoji in         izobrazevanju       2/2011 (`Where are the boundaries?
Education, School and Community " in       Leadership       in Education 2/2011 Ljubljana Slovenia);     `Passend onderwijs begint met inclusieve schooltaal' Kader Primair       Vol 17, No 4,       December 2011 ("Effective education begins with a shared language in       schools"       'Primary Framework Vol 17 No 4 December 2011).
West-Burnham's work has been translated into Malaysian, Slovenian, Dutch,       Swedish,       Arabic and Chinese.
The translations are evidence of the impact his work       has had in       the international community where the debate and discourse about effective       leadership       has spread to many practitioners and contributed to developing the values       underpinning school leadership.
