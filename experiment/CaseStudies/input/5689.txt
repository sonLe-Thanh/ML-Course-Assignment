     Research by Winchester School of Art academics has directly enabled Tate       Liverpool and Tate       Modern to bridge the gap between art, cultural institutions and the       public.
In addition, co-developed       exhibitions and related events generated over &#163;140,000 in ticket sales.
Dawson's 2009 performance installation based on his Etzler research for       Tate Modern was visited       by 90,000 members of the public, many of whom actively participated in       `creative learning through       play', destroying provided materials to create omni material sculptural       forms [5.1].
As part of the       event, participants were briefed on Dawson's research findings and       co-opted into Etzler's `Tropical       Emigration Society'.
The event's curator Cedar Lewisohn, said the event       `celebrate(d) the Tate       Collection in its widest form...what we wanted to do was come up with lots       of ideas which explored       arte povera in its widest context.
Participation is a really big       aspect of it, and materials, the use of       material, using impoverished materials in new ways' [5.1].
This early example of a collaborative partnership was formalised through       the Global Futures       Centre and Tate Liverpool in 2011.
Since then, WSA research findings have       been disseminated to       key museum staff during generative meetings for Tracing the Century       (17/5/12, 23/6/12), Glam!
(4/10/12, 6/12/12, 15/1/13, 7/6/13) and Keywords (16/1/13, 7/2/13,       5/4/13, 18/6/13).
Lindsey Fryer,       Head of Learning, says researchers' `historical and contemporary       perspectives' communicated       during these meetings have led to new Tate strategies to `engage a range       of publics from early       years and families to young people [...] and independent learners' [5.2].
Specific examples of how WSA research improved Tate exhibitions include       Davis' research       supporting her proposal that curators' could adopt an alternate focus and       organisation for Tracing         the Century.
This resulted in the development of new ideas in the       museum's presentation of key       principles &#8212; an impact reflected in Tate's decision to change the       exhibition's name from Tracing the         Outline to Tracing the Century, a direct reference to Davis'       insights on the evolution of drawing.
The show attracted 5,115 visitors, generating &#163;7,894 in ticket sales.
Visitor feedback included the       comment `(Curation) was better than normal.
It was a brave         choice...quite inspiring really' [5.3].
For Glam!
WSA research findings contributed to Tate Liverpool's       decision to broaden the remit and       audience of the show beyond the traditional bounds of an art-interested       audience.
Its curator       Darren Pih says WSA research demonstrated the `show needed to be       re-calibrated to make it       more legible [...] as an attitude and style, requiring a more       anthropological focus' [5.4].
Harris and       Davis translated their socio-historical analysis of 1970s art into a       timeline that was fully reproduced       in the exhibition catalogue.
WSA researchers designed the exhibition's       `glamscapes' &#8212; walls of       visual material (e.g.
record covers, magazines, etc) identified in their       research as `revealing how       fine art ideas fed through to the front-face of popular culture'.
The       lasting institutional impact is       evidenced by Francesco Manacorda, Tate's Artistic Director, who said: `The         success of         Glamscapes has made me ... think this is a way in which we can encourage         our audiences to         discover why contemporary art is relevant in relation to their life'       [5.5].
Glam!
was visited by 25,763       visitors (&#163;134,981 in ticket sales).
One man who described himself as an       infrequent visitor visiting       with his son said: `I took my son because he is into his music and all the       way round we discussed       art.
What does that mean?
What do you get out of that picture?
For me it       does change my view of       art.
It is interesting' [5.3].
WSA research was further disseminated to the public through Glam!
's       wide national coverage,       including in-depth articles in The Daily Telegraph, The         Guardian and discussions on BBC 4's       Review Show and BBC R4's Front Row, [5.6] as well       as in extensive international media exposure       [5.7].
Further public engagement included Glamorama!
(a Tate event chaired by Harris which       featured Faiers in a panel discussion on the impact of glam on popular       culture for 80 paying       members of the public) and Glam!
and the 21st Century Factory       (learning events for 576 fifteen-to-twenty-five       year-olds with contribution by Gilbert).
Feedback suggested participants       had fun,       gained greater knowledge and understanding of the period, and that the       event changed their       perception of the museum's role.
One said: `I had no idea such events         existed!'
[5.3].
The economic benefit to the Tate and the public benefits from Glam!
were extended through the       exhibition's tour to the Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt (13 June-22       September 2013).
As announced       in autumn 2011, it will then travel on to the Lentos Kunstmuseum, Linz.
WSA's work with Tate on exhibitions and public learning has demonstrated       the wide-reaching       value of academic research deployed in partnership with museum and gallery       curators, learning       and communications specialists.
This has benefitted their working       processes as well as directly       enriched the diverse publics who have visited these shows and taken part       in related events.
