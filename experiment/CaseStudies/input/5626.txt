     Kabuki theatre and the rich culture of printmaking that attended it       developed and thrived in Japan in two regions, each with their own       distinctive theatrical and visual cultures and styles: Osaka       (incorporating Kyoto) and Edo (modern-day Tokyo).
The more gentle and       realistic images of Osaka Kabuki have been very much eclipsed by the more       austere and static images of Tokyo, particularly in the post-World War II       period given the rapid ascendancy of Tokyo as principal economic and       cultural centre.
As the first exhibition of Osaka prints since 1975, and       the very first in Europe, Kabuki Heroes as both exhibition and       catalogue has had a significant and enduring influence on subsequent       exhibitions and the international market for and more general interest in       Osaka prints, and has served as a primary source of information for the       accessioning and cataloguing of major international collections.
A recent exhibition of Osaka prints in Luxembourg, "Schatze der Kamigata'       / Tr&#233;sors de Kamigata: Gravures sur bois japonaises d'Osaka 1780-80,"       which ran from November 2012 until March 2013, relied heavily on the       research activities associated with the preparation of Kabuki Heroes       as well as the catalogue (6, below).
The exhibition featured works from       the private collection of Osaka Prints of the German collector Hendrick       L&#252;hl.
As part of the Kabuki Heroes research project, Gerstle and       his collaborator from Japan, Professor Ryo Akama, photographed his       extensive collection over a one-week stay at his house in 2003, taking       more than 3,000 photographs.
Many of his works were then included in the       British Museum exhibition in 2005, the success of which helped in the       negotiations with museums in Luxembourg, and more recently, Krakow       (October 2013), who agreed to host the exhibition (7).
The Bibliography of       the Luxembourg catalogue lists Kabuki Heroes c under the       abbreviation "AK London" as the most recent of five key sources for the       exhibition.
As the first major international exhibition to feature the prints of       Osaka, so long overshadowed by the works of Edo, Kabuki Heroes       both garnered the interest and enthusiasm of new audiences, even in Osaka       itself, who had been unaware of the city's distinctive printmaking history       and imbued Osaka prints with a commercial legitimacy that had hitherto       been absent.
K&#244;iichi Sawai, Curator at the Osaka Museum of History, has recently       commented in an email to Professor Gerstle (5):     "Osaka prints were not so well known even in Osaka itself before the         2005 Kabuki Heroes exhibition.
The exhibition itself was         successful in raising the profile with the general public, but the         sustained impact has been on Yamamoto-School Traditional Dance and other         Osaka traditional arts which have seen a steady revival in recent years         stimulated directly by the Kabuki Heroes exhibition."
Peter Ujlaki, international dealer in Japanese prints, who is based in       the Osaka area, has also confirmed the importance of Kabuki Heroes       in raising awareness of and interest in Osaka traditions and the positive       impact the exhibition and catalogue have had on his business (1):     "Before that exhibition opened, one could find curators of important         institutions in Osaka who had no idea that Kamigata-e [Osaka prints]         ever existed.
Others knew of their existence, but thought of them as a         poor provincial tradition unworthy of serious study.
By the time the         show closed, every local art scholar knew otherwise, and so did Kansai's         art establishment... if not also Tokyo's."
"We can see continuing repercussions in, for example, the make-up of         the recent Hokusai exhibit at The Osaka Municipal Museum of Art [in late         2012].
Instead of the standard museum survey of this artist, a large         section of the show was devoted to the work of Osaka artists who had         come in contact with Hokusai.
I don't believe this slant would have         occurred to the organizers without the spotlight on Kamigata-e, still         fresh in their memory, provided by the British Museum show."
"Personally, I now rarely have to explain the term Kamigata-e when I         meet well-informed Kansai residents, which is a dramatic change from a         decade ago.
The impressive catalogue &#8212; I always keep both the English         and Japanese versions close at hand &#8212; give added weight and credibility         to the subject, and this helps me greatly in my business... it is now         much easier to interest institutions and individuals in the idea of         collecting Kamigata-e."     Izzy Goldman, London-based art dealer in Japanese art and prints remarked       in an interview in January 2013 that there has been a continuous rise in       demand and prices paid for Osaka prints since the exhibition, which has       legitimised the trade of these previously undervalued images, and that he       keeps a copy of the catalogue for ready consultation when selling Osaka       prints (2).
Major museums have also benefitted from the exhibition and catalogue       throughout the period January 2008-July 2013 and beyond.
A curator at the       Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which has the largest collection of Japanese       prints in the world with more than 50,000 items, has confirmed that she       and her colleagues regularly use the catalogue to support that museum's       own externally-funded projects (running from 2006-07 to the present) to       accession many thousands of prints for the first time.
The process of       accessioning has meant that the Museum has been able to host exhibitions       of Osaka prints and to lend its Osaka prints to other museums       internationally (3).
Timothy Clark, curator at the British Museum, has highlighted the       influence of Kabuki Heroes on the curation and planning of that       museum's landmark Shunga exhibition, which opened in September 2013 (4):     "The Kabuki Heroes research project and exhibition had an         impact on two aspects of our work at the British Museum.
The first is         the process of working closely with academics on a multi-year research         project in preparation for an exhibition.
The `Kabuki Heroes' AHRC grant         enabled us to establish a network of scholars in Japan and         Europe/America.
This pattern then influenced the current         exhibition project on 'Shunga: Sex and Pleasure in Japanese Art' (2013).
We were able to build on this earlier network, extend it and create a         group of more than 30 scholars.
This scholarly base enabled us to         present a strong case to the Museum's exhibition department to prepare         an exhibition on explicitly sexual art.
The second impact of Kabuki       Heroes was in the example of constructing an effective exhibition.
The         creation of a theme of `kabuki culture' within the exhibition to show         how the prints and books were produced and circulated was effective for         the audience.
We have used this model again for Shunga in making sure         that the audience was able to grasp how shunga circulated, who consumed         it, and how it related to non-shunga works and to society in general.
The Kabuki Heroes project was also the occasion for BM to add         major works of kabuki-related art from Osaka to the national collections         and these are now available to scholars and the public worldwide through         the BM's Collections Online."
