     This case-study focuses on EU-Pacific international relations and       development policy, and provides evidence that as a result of Crook's `own       research on knowledge practices and method for knowledge-exchanges in a       Europe-Pacific context' we now have `an enhanced effectiveness to the EU's       external actions in the Pacific' [1].
In terms of a widely applicable method for knowledge-exchange, Crook's       research suggests that there is both necessity and real productive virtue       in respecting and maintaining differentiation, and in working with       incommensurability rather than against it: `the acknowledgment and       creation of gaps between the EU officials, the European researchers, and       the Pacific researchers involved in ECOPAS project, i.e.
Dr. Crook's       concept of knowledge transfer, has been instrumental in bringing a       critical mass for the process to be launched' [2].
Since joining St Andrews, Crook's development of the `Pacific       Connections' method for knowledge-exchanges has been trialled, put into       practice and impacted upon different kinds of audiences - mining         industry, general public, UK and EU international policy &#8212; and met       with different receptions, and led to diverse forms of impact evidence.
Whilst Crook's research insights have, since 1997, been communicated to       the mining industry (in person, and through publications 2004,       2007b, 2007c), the internal corporate impact of research perceived as a       reputational challenge to change behaviour, or as an adversarial critique,       is necessarily harder to evidence than where a more positive user-friendly       relation exists: in 1997 Ok Tedi managers told Crook to disappear, kicked       him out of town in 2001 and withdrew cooperation in 2004; in 2010 Crook       made two presentations to the International Council on Mining and Metals &#8212;       evidence of their internal impact took the form of the ICMM's subsequent       disengagement.
In 2010, Crook organized and participated in a series of `Pacific       Connections' public events [6] to coincide with his organization       of ESfO2010, the 8th conference of the European Society for       Oceanists (which he chaired, 2008-10) [7].
These public events       included `Double Visions', an exhibition of contemporary PNG art       (co-organized with Fife Contemporary Arts and Crafts, and shown in       Kirkaldy and St Andrews), and a public talk Crook gave in Kirkcaldy about       the exhibition which drew on the `double visions' required to comprehend       Melanesian knowledge-practices; `Lost Land of the Volcano' which engaged       the BBC producer and a presenter of the TV series and which questioned the       inter-relation between indigenous knowledge and biodiversity; and `Avatar'       which was designed around the participation of the movie's anthropological       consultant, and involved an anthropologist employed by a PNG mine, a PNG       researcher and activist, and Global Witness to discuss the commodity       chains and `resource wars' linking the UK and PNG.
In a UK international policy context, Crook was invited by the       Foreign and Commonwealth Office to speak at a high level roundtable       involving UK Ministers and Pacific Ambassadors, invited by the       Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to speak alongside the Papua New       Guinea High Commissioner in Westminster Hall on the Milennium Development       Goals [`your insight into social relationships in [PNG] society'... were       `fascinating', `we received wonderful feedback' 3], and to provide       a video film to kick-off FCO Minister Swire's debate with University of       Papua New Guinea students in Apr 2013 [8].
However, the central focus of this impact case-study is on the European         Union and highlights the context of a large bureaucracy in which       policy-making is geared to a hierarchy of political decisions and research       evidence.
Impacts are made evident in the responses of research users as a       relationship of trust is built up and is manifested by step-wise requests       for subsequent inputs into new contexts and by remarks over previous       inputs.
In early 2010, the EU EEAS Pacific Division, recognized that the research       it drew upon mainly originated beyond Europe, and when Crook sent details       of his research and of the ESfO2010 conference and invited them to attend,       EEAS phoned Crook to discuss the thinking behind the conference rubric:       this derived directly from Crook's Min research [2007a, 2007b].
EEAS and       DG-RTD sent delegates who addressed the opening plenary [7], and       asked Crook to nominate participants for a meeting in St Andrews with       European research leaders, and then again to give a keynote talk, and to       nominate speakers and delegates who would be offered EU-funding for a       large workshop in Brussels [9].
At this workshop, the EU announced       that the ESfO2010 conference had leveraged their policy aim for a research       network and policy interface, and the EEAS Head of Pacific Division       publicly thanked Crook for demonstrating a method for the       knowledge-exchange relations that they could work with, saying it was       `clearly going to be very important and a really key part of making the       proposed network and policy interface a success' [1].
Additional       evidence of impact at the workshop is that EEAS and DG-RES publically       called for St Andrews to play a lead role in responding to their FP7       funding call.
This resulted in the ECOPAS consortium with Crook as a point       of contact for DG-RTD and EEAS which expressed a hope that Crook would be       involved in the knowledge-exchange policy interface with several EU and EC       units with a Pacific remit.
EEAS also invited Crook to assist them in organizing a High Level Panel       focused on the Pacific at the European Development Days event in Warsaw       (Dec, 2011) and were so taken with Crook's `Pacific Connections' method       (which won a competitive slot at EDD2011) to create a dialogue between EU       attempts to connect development ideas to Pacific ways, and Pacific       attempts to connect to development initiatives, that they asked to merge       this HLP with their own.
`Pacific Connections' responded to EEAS' request       for recommendations to the EU as it seeks to renew its development       partnership with the Pacific.
The EC's Commissioner for Development asked       Crook to draft his introductory remarks, and of his own accord praised the       research linkages between different scales.
The EU Ambassador to the       Pacific closed the event by acknowledging the profound insight it had       given him into Pacific people's lives and future EU-Pacific relations, and       summing up that `this marks the day Europe was initiated into the Pacific'       [2, 10].
The deputy head (Pacific, EEAS) wrote to Crook thanking       him for his work and results in delivering the EDD event, which he       described as `excellent', and as indication of the impact on EEAS policy       thinking, asked Crook to provide advice on how policy related to the       Pacific (which is covered by the Cotonou Agreement with the ACP regions),       might be accommodated by the EC's internal re-organization (in 2011) which       has separated the Pacific from other ACP regions and re-aligned it in with       Asia.
ECOPAS was awarded FP7 funding and, since the project started in December       2012, Crook has been engaged in close cooperation with EEAS and       knowledge-exchange with various EC units, has chaired a series of Pacific       Connections events in Brussels (at the European Parliament and EEAS), and       in St Andrews on gender inequality and on sustainable development attended       by EEAS [2].
For example, in May 2013, two roundtables held in       EEAS focused on sustainable development and gender issues attracted 48       participants from 24 units and organizations across and beyond the EC,       including four Pacific ambassadors and the Director General of the       Secretariat of the Pacific Community: `the success of such an event is       normally very difficult to ensure', `Dr Tony Crook...managed to transfer       knowledge and inform policy stakeholders successfully, creating moreover       significant and sustainable links' and `All these successes were down to       the design of the format based on the method for knowledge exchange       designed by Dr Tony Crook' [4].
Each of these events have involved diplomats, policy-makers and regional       organizations from the Pacific who have endorsed the Pacific Connections       approach, and encouraged and commended the EU for making their external       actions more effective in this manner.
Indeed, the language of `Pacific       Connections' has been adopted by an internal EU review, and now provides       the terms in which European external actions are conceived.
Crook's       research insights into, and method based upon, Melanesian       knowledge-exchange have been `instrumental' [5] in making EU       external actions in the Pacific more effective.
