     In the particular case of the transfer of sensor technology from the       physical sciences to medicine,       the full-scale realisation of impact depends finally on the clinical       acceptance and widespread use of       the technology.
Full impact is therefore approached asymptotically over       many years.
Here we       report the impact has been achieved for multiple detector technologies and       that the results of a       coordinated programme of detector development over nearly two decades,       based on a Bioimaging       Unit with its own dedicated laboratory space, include the following       significant achievements:     (i) Initial patient trials of a portable gamma camera (in clinic,           Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham)     Confirmation of diagnosis in breast cancer, melanoma and in certain other       cancers is achieved       using "sentinel node biopsy".
This requires the surgeon to locate and       remove relevant lymph nodes       so that they can be tested to see if the cancer has spread.
The position       of the lymph nodes is       usually detected by injecting a short-half-life radioactive substance into       the tumour, which then       drains away via the lymphatic system.
The location of the first (sentinel)       node is usually detected       with a non-imaging gamma probe, with low precision.
The new camera       provides the surgeon with a       visible light image overlaid with the pattern of uptake of a radioactive       tracer such as 99mTc (a       short-lived emitter of 140 keV gamma rays).
The gamma channel of the       camera provides both sub-mm       spatial resolution and sufficient energy resolution to discriminate       against scattered photons,       which would otherwise blur the image structure.
Early collaborative work       in this area with Prof.       Robert Ott (Institute of Cancer Research) led to a patent originally filed       in Dec 2000 (Devices for       imaging radionuclide emissions, Lees, Fraser and Ott).
This patent has now       been granted in       Australia and Canada.
A second patent covering the concept of simultaneous       optical and gamma-ray       imaging "Imaging Device and Method" was filed on May 16th 2005 and has now       been granted       in the USA, Europe, Australia and Japan with the application still pending       in Europe and the USA.

The hybrid camera will improve sentinel node localisation, reduce       surgical trauma, improve patient       outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
To date, images of 12 patients (a)       presenting with a       number of cancer types had been recorded in clinic at the Queen's Medical       Centre.
Ethics       approval has been received for up to 100 patients in the period 2013-15.
(ii) Commercialisation of the small format, high resolution gamma           camera (b)     In September 2007, the University of Leicester formed a spin-out company,       Gamma Technologies       Limited (GTL), to begin commercialisation of the camera technologies.
GTL       has raised over &#163;250k       first stage venture funding and is currently seeking second-round funding       for safety certification       and the manufacture of early-adopter prototypes.
A UK-based medical       devices company is       currently performing due diligence on GTL with a view to investing &#163;900k       in by the end of 2013.
(iii) Design, manufacture and delivery of novel tools for       (a) proteomics and so for the field of       neurotoxicology (c) and (b) for the detection of scleritis in       ophthalmology.
(iv) Patient trials of said opthalmology spectrometer,       involving ~15 individuals to date.
(v) Establishment of a novel sensor-based unit within a       large, working Hospital A&amp;E Department,       involving over 100 patients in two distinct clinical studies.
(vi) Contributions to the evidence base that space science       and astronomy can have significant       economic and societal impact beyond their blue skies research agenda (d,e).
