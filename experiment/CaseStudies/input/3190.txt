     The underpinning research has delivered clear, economic impacts and has       led to a comprehensive       revision of the ISO standard on ink colorimetric characterisation, which       has significant impact on       practitioners and has changed printing industry practice.
Economic         impact is evidenced in the       following three examples:     1) The underpinning research [R1, R2, and (in particular) R3] has led to       the development of a new       class of functional products at the core of the range produced by Nth       Degree Technology, a spin       out company from Group Info Tech.
The capabilities of this approach to       printed electronics has       enabled the production of an addressable Electroluminescent (EL) paper       television display, and       the launch of a self-illuminated point of sale poster based on EL       technology (posters that make use       of printed lighting).
As a consequence of the studies undertaken with       Swansea University as part of       its research program into image transfer, a new business has been       established.
"These two developments were the basis for the creation of the new         company, Nth degree         technology [...] So, from that early start, we now have a company valued         at $50 million           with an enormous IP portfolio that feeds into market spaces worth           several hundreds           of billions of dollars."
Chief Technologist of Nth Degree Technology     2) Many of the companies in the printing sector are small-to-medium sized       enterprises with little or       no resource for research and development.
The expertise generated as a       result of the research       led by the WCPC initiated by the publications outlined was recognised by       the European Regional       Development Fund, which provided technology transfer funding for a number       of industry facing       projects.
One such project, the Digital, Industrial, Packaging, Lean and       Environmental (DIPLE)       printing project won the 2009 EU Regiostar award.
Based at Swansea       University, DIPLE led       projects with partner companies to support their long-term viability and       to transfer knowledge,       particularly in relation to the printing and coating of novel inks at high       speed.
Whilst many       companies were supported in their economic growth, an excellent example is       the development of       conductive inks for printed electronics and health with Gwent Electronic       Materials (GEM).
"Through the DIPLE project, we were able to secure access to expertise         on ink transfer and         volume printing at the University for the development of our Carbon and         silver conductive         inks.
The extensive facilities and experience of running high volume         printing presses are         beyond the resources of even a high technology company such as GEM.
The         net benefit         can be seen in the sales of these inks during the period 2007 - 2012,         which was well in           excess of &#163;3m".
Chief Executive Officer, Gwent Electronic Materials     3) The Welsh Government has provided funds through its Academia 4       Business programme, which       enables Welsh SMEs to become involved with advanced printing and coating       activity at Swansea.
The Printing of Functional Materials (Print FM) project has been targeted       at the development of       processable functional coatings.
A key function is conductivity since this       is required in all printed       electronics and is often applied via vapour deposition.
New materials       (carbon nanotubes and       functionalised exfoliated graphene) created by Haydale Ltd (a Swansea       University spin out) have       been formulated into electronic inks (C3).
"The direct benefit has been to assist in obtaining a           &#163;1,500,000 investment, the         establishment of new premises, development of a range of new products".
Business Development Director, Haydale Ltd     In 2011/2012 alone, the products generated revenue for the company of       &#163;140,855, led to three       new patent applications and the employment of two new staff.
Impact on practitioners across the printing industry is evidenced       through the revision of an       ISO standard as a direct result of the underpinning research.
Most       packaging is printed using       flexographic printing.
In 2012 this had an estimated value of $263m.
Prof       Claypole served as a UK       expert on ISO standards through the TC130 graphic arts committee to enable       the research [R4,       R5, R6] at Swansea to be integrated into new standards.
An experimental       program at Swansea to       evaluate the standards for ink colorimetric characterisation for       flexographic printing identified       deficiencies in the method of test print preparation which resulted in       there being no control on the       ink film thickness.
ISO 2846-5 "Graphic technology &#8212; Colour and       transparency of printing ink sets       for four colour printing &#8212; Part 5: Flexographic printing" has been         modified to address these         issues.
To quote from the introduction to the 2013 revision of ISO       2846-5, "After the debut of this         part of the ISO 2846 series, a paper (R4) was published that challenged         the technology used here,         indicating that there were inadequate controls on the film thickness".
The new standard has       included film thickness measurement.
