     The research has made a substantial and sustained contribution to       decision-making and policy in workforce dialogue on training, skills       development and union learning.
Stuart has presented to the       Advisory and Steering Groups of Unionlearn, and other national and       international union and policy bodies (e.g., Skills Australia [A]).
The team has contributed to the development of workplace learning and       policy in three key areas.
Impacts on the TUC and other Unions       Unions need to integrate learning into their policies and systems, for       example through rule books, branch structures and union roles, so       enhancing the demand for improved provision of training opportunities,       especially for low-paid/low-skilled workers.
Here, there is no simple,       linear means of impact - change takes place progressively, through the       presentation of expert evidence.
CERIC's evidence base and presentations       (e.g., at the annual Unions 21 conference in 2008, at a TUC       annual-conference fringe event, 2010 and at the Unionlearn Annual       Conference, 2011) [B] has had a measurable and `major impact on         TUC policy on skills' (TUC Unionlearn Director) [C].
It is       frequently included in Unionlearn's policy/guidance publications,       dedicated toolkits and has thus contributed to dialogue within unions on       learning and the training of union learning representatives.
The benefits of the evidence gathered has gone beyond the TUC-Government       policy relations as it has shaped how individual unions act with regard to       employee learning, e.g.
proactively promoting learning and evaluating the       training provided.
Approximately 230,000 people per year benefit from the       training opportunities provided by Unionlearn and without union       encouragement many of these workers would be either reluctant or unable to       access learning [B].
The Chief Executive of the Campaign for       Learning provides evidence that the EU EQUAL research (iv) helped       with their relations with government, employers, trade unions and other       stakeholders in the UK learning and skills arena and comments that the       thinking and research: "have been core features of the subsequent         design of some of our major programmes - notably...the annual Learning         at Work Day....that supports over 5,000 workplaces a year to hold         learning events" [D].
The recent evaluation, BIS grant (viii), identified the need for       the TUC to pay more attention to data collection, storage and monitoring1.
As the TUC Unionlearn Director confirmed, `The process of working with         CERIC helped Unionlearn improve the quality of internal         evidence-gathering, both quantitative and qualitative.
That process has         now become embedded and has been enormously helpful to improving our         flow of internal MI [management information] and using it to         improve outcomes.'
This has included the creation of several new       posts at the TUC [C].
Impacts on government and policy     Strong and institutionalised learning partnerships can benefit individual       employees and organisations.
The analysis of WERS 2004 showed the positive       impact of collective bargaining on training outcomes.
From 2007 onwards,       the TUC used this argument to encourage government to increase support for       collective bargaining with employers on training.
This was largely       rejected by the former government, but did encourage the joint working       group that explored the wider benefits of workforce dialogue on training       and skills; its joint statement has been widely cited.
CERIC research is used by Unionlearn in their day-to-day engagement with       government policy makers.
It shapes and informs discussions in this area;       and helps set the agenda.
The research provides hard objective evidence on       which to base arguments.
Recently and significantly, the CERIC employer       survey demonstrated that employers favoured working with unions on       learning and training.
Citing wide-ranging contributions to organisational       learning practices and outcomes, this work was mentioned by Rt.
Hon.
Dr.       Vince Cable MP as important in showing how union learning can contribute       widely to UK PLC [E] and was covered in an article in The         Independent [F].
Dr. Cable commented: "An evaluation by         Leeds University shows that of 80 per cent of people on Unionlearn         projects said they got good value, but also two-thirds of employers said         they were extremely useful for their businesses; and I think that is a         very good story" [E].
The study was also used by the       American Society of Training and Development [G] and has been used       extensively by the TUC (in dissemination and deliberations with the CBI)       and by government departments [H] and [I].
The TUC       submitted the evaluation findings to BIS as part of the Comprehensive       Spending Review, and these contributed to the ongoing funding of       Unionlearn (despite major cuts in public spending): `Evidence,         generated by a detailed and rigorous study of over 400 employers with         over one million employees was the first large-scale, high-quality study         of impact.
It was subjected to intense scrutiny by experts from the         Treasury and BIS, who were impressed by its findings of substantial         employer support and major impact in terms of both learning and wider         productivity outcomes.
The study undoubtedly played a major part in         persuading the incoming coalition government to continue the         &#163;21.5 million BIS funding for Unionlearn' (Unionlearn Director) [C].
In the Foreward to the Annual Unionlearn Conference Report 2011, the Chair       comments: "The core grant to Unionlearn and the Union Learning Fund,         however, was not reduced.
This reflects the cross-party support for         union learning and recognition of its positive impact as evidenced by         the in- depth evaluation carried out by Leeds University Business         School" [B].
The Director of Unionlearn further confirms that "CERIC's work has         had a major impact on TUC policy on skills.
This in turn has impacted on         BIS and UKCES national skills policy, not least through the work of the         four union commissioners on UKCES but also in the close engagement which         Unionlearn has with BIS and other national agencies' (Unionlearn       Director) [C].
Impacts on business and organisations     The research contributed to policy debates on raising the demand for       workplace learning, particularly among low-skilled workers, and how       workplace dialogue can contribute to this - as evidenced in policy reports       published by the CFL, invitations to speak to policy bodies such as Skills       Australia, and involvement in consultations (e.g.
by the UK Commission for       Employment and Skills) [J].
CERIC research has also `helped         unions and Unionlearn to better understand the drivers of employer and         employee engagement and workforce development' (Unionlearn       Director).
This has influenced arguments by the TUC that `there is a         great deal of scope for both hard and soft levers to drive up employer         engagement (e.g.
on apprenticeships)'.
It has also impacted the       joint work between unions and employers, through Unionlearn policy, which       has `resulted in a much wider approach to development, including more         emphasis on issues such as CPD, higher learning, employee development,         skill utilisation, particular needs of disadvantaged workers and         different sectoral needs' [D].
CERIC research on       co-investment and collective learning funds (CLFs) has been used in a       number of ways, according to a senior policy officer: "informing the         advice that we give to trade unions when designing their strategies for         strategic engagement and approach to dialogue with employers and other         partners around workplace learning" [K].
