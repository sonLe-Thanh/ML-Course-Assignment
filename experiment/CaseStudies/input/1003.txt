     Penty, White and Seeds (together with Dr David Wake, UCL, and Dr David       Parker,       entrepreneur) founded Zinwave in November 2002 to commercialise the       research results and       associated patents, which were all assigned to the spin-off.
Penty and       White have supported       all the investment rounds and helped with product development.
They have       also both served       on the company's Technical Advisory Board (2002-2012).
System 3000 DAS is Zinwave's main product.
Its unique selling point,       namely broadband       radio-over-fibre distribution of radio signals over a DAS network, is       founded on research       carried out in the FRIDAY and subsequent RAIS projects.
It is a       three-stage system,       constituting a Primary Hub, Secondary Hubs, and Remote units configured in       a tree network.
It       uses fibre cable for connectivity and offers true wideband capabilities       that allow simultaneous       support for any wireless standard including 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE, PMR/LMR,       DVB-H, TETRA, Wi-       Fi, WiMAX and RFID.
Full management control over this spectrum allows new       services to be       added on-demand without deploying additional system components.
The       technology can be       configured in a single, dual star or mixed architecture to meet exact       service needs.
Rival       solutions require the installation of dedicated narrowband equipment for       each and every       different wireless standard, which is less flexible, more expensive and       more complex to       maintain.
[text removed for publication] Zinwave's headquarters are in Cambridge,       but it has employees       based in America and Malaysia.
It employs approximately 25 people.
Zinwave made System 3000 generally available in 2008 and recorded its       first revenue of       approximately GBP1M in 2009.
Annual revenue in the year ending December       2012 was       GBP3M despite difficult market conditions.
Commentators have identified Zinwave as a company on a high-growth       trajectory: ABI       Research named Zinwave in 2012 as "part of the next generation of DAS         vendors and one of         the companies to watch out for as the DAS market evolves" (Ref 8);       and the Red Herring       Europe 100 Awards placed Zinwave among the finalists in April 2013 in its       listing that       "analyses and selects the top private companies in the European region         ... positioned to grow         at an explosive rate" (Ref 9).
Zinwave has sold its DAS product to three client types: Systems       Integrators, Network       Operators and Building Owners.
Systems Integrators, in this context design, are the companies       that deliver, install and       support bespoke communications solutions in a client's building or across       a client's site, using       expert knowledge of products and systems.
Zinwave has established formal       relationships with       over 40 such Systems Integrators, which account for over 90% of its       turnover.
Systems Integrator Obelisk delivered a DAS implementation at the       Convention Centre Dublin       (CCD) in 2010, working with ISM OpenOptics, and stated: "When         deploying cellular coverage         across multiple operator networks and multiple services, including O2,         Vodafone and Meteor,         throughout the conference centre across the full service mix, being able         to simply plug them in         without worrying about service specific hardware is a major advantage.
Zinwave's system has         provided us with the most cost effective solution while the intelligence         and flexibility of the         architecture simplified deployment of cellular sectorisation.
Thanks to         Zinwave's innovative,         future proof DAS, we can add any future service at any frequency that         may become available,         with the ability to easily expand to meet future needs" (Ref 10).
ROOTS Communications (Singapore and Malaysia) stated: "Flexibility,         scalability and easy         deployment are key to all our installations and Zinwave's DAS offers all         of this.
In addition, its         ability to support all existing services as well as new ones on the same         hardware layer makes         it compelling to our customers because it eliminates the need for         expensive rebuilds or         upgrades" (Ref 11).
Radio Access BV (Netherlands) stated: "We have deployed Zinwave's DAS         in numerous         projects because it essentially allows us to provide our customers with         a "wireless highway"         from which they can run multiple services, irrespective of the         frequency, over a single platform.
It is unique in its ability to support all cellular frequencies, such as         GSM and UMTS, as well as         closed networks, over a single hardware layer making it completely         future-proof" (Ref 12).
Network Operator, Verizon Wireless, selected Zinwave in 2012 to       support its 4G mobile       network roll-out in the USA.
This is a significant achievement for a       company of Zinwave's size       and maturity, because large operators, such as Verizon, which is the       largest wireless operator       in the USA and one of the largest in the world, tend to be conservative       and choose to buy from       well-established large equipment suppliers.
The speed with which Zinwave       has attained formal       supplier status is also impressive.
This is related to Zinwave having a       unique product and       meeting all the requirements for quality, service and support.
TriPower, a Systems Integrator working for Verizon, stated with regard to       its project at the       Pepsi Center Arena in Denver: "The joint effort between TriPower as         the deployment partner         and Zinwave's 3000 DAS system allows us to deliver an optimum wireless         solution for high-         demand coverage...In addition to ensuring calls are successfully         connected, the DAS will allow         smart phones, tablets and other mobile devices to access the Internet,         send text messages         and quickly share photos and videos to social networking sites, enabling         visitors of the arena to         have a great network experience" (Ref 13).
Building Owners benefit from Zinwave's DAS through improved       in-building reception and       coverage of wireless systems, while reducing installation and operating       costs.
The Zinwave       system also keeps their options open for choosing new wireless standards       in the future.
Dolya &amp; Co highlights these benefits with reference to the UEFA Euro       2012 tournament co-       hosted in Ukraine: "The Zinwave system offered great flexibility and         was easy to install.
Its         simple architecture and its multi-frequency support enabled us to         integrate UEFA's two-way         radio system onto the overall DAS without affecting performance or         signal output.
During the         opening ceremony it became apparent that our installation was the only         one that provided         reliable coverage underground.
Zinwave's DAS therefore played an         important role during the         tournament - acting as the "lifebuoy" for all critical radio and public         safety communications"       (Ref 14).
Other buildings benefitting from deployment of Zinwave's DAS include: the       Erasmus MC and       Martini Hospitals (Rotterdam and Groningen, Netherlands); a Garmin data       centre in New       Jersey; the 9/11 Memorial Museum in New York City; Jakarta international       airport; the Perry       nuclear power plant outside Cleveland, Ohio; and the Westfield retail       complex in Melbourne.
