     The research in this case study has had an impact on the following four       areas of policy and practice:     Influencing UK legislation       In 2008, the Government considered proposals to introduce legislation       criminalising the sex buyer in England and Wales.
The proposal was       presented as an anti-trafficking measure, as it was claimed that the         majority of sex workers in the UK were victims of trafficking.
However, groups opposed to these proposals (including Safety First       Coalition, English Collective of Prostitutes, x:talk project collective,       International Union of Sex Workers) drew upon O'Connell Davidson's         research to challenge such assertions and to lobby more effectively       against Clause 13 (subsequently Clause 14) of the Policing and Crime Bill,       2009 (A,B,C).
The English Collective of Prostitutes have said "Prof         O'Connell Davidson's research was crucial in the run up to the         introduction to the 2009 Policing and Crime Act... [lending] invaluable         weight and credibility to our work" (A).
The research influenced and informed Parliamentary debate.
The         Government ultimately enacted a revised version of the original         proposals, criminalising the purchase of sexual services from       prostitutes subjected to force, not the purchase of sexual services all       together (as set out in the 2009 Bill).
Influencing international agencies/global organisations       The research has been adopted and widely referenced in reports by         international agencies pressing States to address the labour and       migration policies that co-construct demand by leaving some groups       vulnerable to exploitation.
This includes the International Labour       Organisation (D), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in       Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (E), the       Council of Europe and the International Organization for Migration.
The       research funded by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (6) was the         first systematic study of demand, and its findings, as well as those       of the ESRC funded research (7), in the words of the Executive Director       Anti-Trafficking, Austrian Institute for International Affairs (OIIP),       have:     "had and will have a strong impact on further approaches and responses         to the complex problem of human trafficking, in the sense of enabling         decision-makers, stakeholders, NGOs and International Organizations         (such as UNODC, OSCE, IOM, ICMPD...) and politicians to shift the terms         of international policy debate on the demand side away from mere guesses         and ideologically-rooted suppositions to addressing the conditions that         make persons vulnerable to trafficking".
(F)     The work has also been instrumental in providing an evidence base for         NGOs lobbying for trafficking to be understood as a product of       restrictive immigration controls, and not merely organised criminality or       demand for prostitution (A, G, H).
Influencing the work of NGOs on child migration       In addition to influencing international NGOs addressing trafficking in       general, the work of NGOs on child trafficking has also been       informed by the research.
O'Connell Davidson's work on children's agency       within migration and the identified need to build resilience among migrant       children to protect themselves against trafficking and exploitation was       the focus and starting point for a discussion forum attended by 115       researchers and NGO representatives from across Europe at an NGO       conference on child migration.
Participants considered how research can       `influence actual changes for children in migration', and a quote from       that report illustrates how this research has shifted thinking in the         field of migrating vulnerable people:     "If [Anderson and O'Connell Davidson's] conclusions are correct, which         I think they are, we have to ask ourselves if we, as NGOs, have accepted         simplifications in analysing root causes and effects of migration based         on binaries such as, internal versus international migration, voluntary         versus forced, temporary versus permanent, legal versus illegal and so         on.
And that we by accepting those simplifications may have fed         ineffective means and even advocated for inadequate solutions for         children in migration.
Further, we might have focused too much on media         coverage and funding results".
(I)     These comments signalled a change in NGOs' attitudes and approach to         child trafficking that was informed and influenced by the research       and which continues to the present day (J).
The research has also informed       the design of a multi-country initiative (GATE project) working with child       migrants funded by the Italian branch of the charity `Defence for Children       International' (J) and O'Connell Davidson has been invited to act as a       scientific advisor on this project as the expert in the field.
Actively informing and changing attitudes       O'Connell Davidson has actively raised awareness of issues concerning       children, trafficking, and migration among UK and European government       officials, policy makers, law enforcers, non- governmental organisations       and trade unions.
O'Connell Davidson spoke on trafficking at the RCUK All       Party Group for Global Uncertainties, House of Commons, November       2012.
The research was cited by the Council of Europe in the       background paper (K) for a conference on preventing trafficking in human       beings in Bulgaria, December 2012, which brought together around 130       Ministers, civil servants, law enforcement agents, and non-governmental       actors from the 47 Council of Europe members States.
O'Connell Davidson was also invited to give a keynote address at this       conference and to run an expert workshop on the demand-side of       trafficking.
In June 2013, she was invited to speak at the Organisation         for Security and Co-operation in Europe annual alliance against       trafficking conference (attended by more than 300 senior government       officials, national anti-trafficking rapporteurs, representatives from       NGOs, law enforcement agencies and trade unions) (L).
She also gave a       keynote at the Dialogue Forum of the Austrian Government's         Anti-trafficking Regional Implementation Initiative in June 2013, a       meeting of around 50 governmental and non-governmental actors and law       enforcement officials from 15 European States (F).
The research also featured in media debate on prostitution policy.
O'Connell Davidson was invited to participate in a debate with Fiona         MacTaggert MP in the March 2008 edition of Prospect Magazine       (M) (circulation c.32,000); she appeared on More or Less, BBC       Radio 4 (c.1.4m listeners) on 9 January 2009 to debate the reliability         of statistics being cited by MPs pressing for criminalisation of the         purchase of sex, and her critique was reproduced in a Guardian       article (print circulation c.311,000) by Nick Davies on 20 October 2009       (N), who had approached O'Connell Davidson when researching the piece.
