     Farthing's research into the use of art collections as a tool for       teaching drawing has impacted on the teaching of drawing at a national       level, has been utilised by the University of the Arts London's Widening       Participation programme as a vehicle to raise attainment and aspiration in       its partner schools, and has been exploited to extend the audience for       museum collections.
For the development of UAL Awarding Body Level 2 and 3       Awards, and Certificates in Drawing, Farthing contributed insights arising       from his examination of how the use of collections and transcription could       inform drawing, as well as those developed from his exploration of drawing       as an activity beyond a fine art context.
Farthing led the team of UAL       staff who wrote the qualification and was instrumental in the creation of       the course structure.
Part of the Diploma's originality is its promotion       of the creative role of drawing across the curriculum, taking drawing       outside the art room.
The development stage of the qualification was       financially supported by Deirdre Hopkins, patron and founder of the UAL       Rootstein Hopkins Chair in Drawing.
The UAL Drawing qualifications have been delivered by an increasing       number of providers since accreditation in 2010, with over 10,000 students       within England having achieved one of the qualifications.
There has been a       substantial increase in the number of approved centres offering the       qualifications (rising from 21 in 2010/11 to 30 in 2011/12 to 50 in       2012/13).
These range from FE Colleges and HEIs to sixth forms and Adult       Learning providers.
The majority of approved centres deliver the       qualifications in addition to a full time main programme of study.
Evidence of the positive impact of the award can be gleaned from comments       made in the report by External Moderators to the qualification in the UAL       Awarding Body Chief Examiner's Annual Report 2011/12 Creative         Framework: `The quality of drawing in most cases was high and         evidenced a real benefit from the units, confirmed by student         evaluations.
What was a particular aspect of the assessment evidence in         this sample was the confident and inherent use of drawing by students         who were not natural draughtsmen.
This is to be applauded and         celebrated.
This has been a well run programme and students have quite         obviously benefited from the experience, the drawing units have enhanced         their confidence and understanding resulting in stronger portfolios and         a higher level of HE acceptance.'
There have been series of well attended events to support the ongoing       delivery of the qualifications.
A standardisation event was held at       Leeds College of Art and representatives from over 30 centres attended,       including delivery staff and external moderators.
The Drawing         Conference 2012 organised by UAL in collaboration with the Royal       Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) at the National Gallery in       February 2012, enabled 46 representatives involved in the delivery of the       qualification to attend a major venue, discuss the conceptual framework of       the qualification, and have the opportunity to see presentations by       artists including Farthing and Turner Prize winner Grayson Perry.
In       addition, Deirdre Hopkins in support of Farthing's work subsequently       funded a series of masterclasses to support teachers in the delivery of       the curriculum.
To complement the drawing qualification and serve as a       body of research materials, Farthing has edited and published sketchbooks       of key figures that utilised drawing to inform their creative thinking       across a range of disciplines.
The first in the series was the sketchbooks       of architect Nicholas Grimshaw (2009) and the second was those of the       stage designer Jocelyn Herbert (2011), both published by the Royal       Academy.
The third in the series, on filmmaker Derek Jarman (Sept 2013),       was published in two English language versions (UK and US), by Thames and       Hudson and in German by Deutscher Kunstverlag.
The UAL Drawing qualification is used as part of UAL's Widening       Participation programme.
The qualification has been chosen as the vehicle       for this programme as it translates across the curriculum, giving students       a range of transferable skills, and is an excellent means through which to       explain the creative sector.
The drawing programmes are aimed at young       people of 14 -15 years of age who are studying visual arts subjects and       who think that they may be interested in a career in the creative sector;       six cohorts of students have been taught since 2010-11.
The courses are       run on Saturdays by UAL tutors and supported by UAL student ambassadors,       with additional masterclasses featuring professional practitioners.
Research visits to the V&amp;A and Tate Britain include talks and       instruction from staff from the museum education departments.
Teachers       from participating schools observe and take part in some sessions.
The       programme gives students an insight into potential careers within the       creative industries, introduces `art school methods', builds confidence,       as well as professional and personal skills, and brings together       like-minded young people.
As one of the schools involved in the programme       says: `For the students involved it has raised attainment levels,         developed social skills and broadened horizons.
The success of the         drawing qualification and the Saturday course is in short evidenced by         the change in our young people.'
The value of the activity is evidenced by high attendance and retention       rates within the cohorts with an average pass rate of 89 per cent and a       retention rate of 91 per cent.
The programme participates in The Sorrell       Foundation's (a charitable organisation which aims to inspire creativity       in young people) National Art &amp; Design Saturday Club (NADSC).
As part       of this initiative, students exhibit their work at Somerset House       alongside 13 other NADSC groups of young people working with Art &amp;       Design faculties in universities and colleges across the UK.
Further       evidence of the significance of impact achieved comes from UAL's OFSTED       Inspection Report, 28th February 2012: `The University [...] makes a         significant contribution to social inclusion and widening participation         in Higher Education.
Inspirational and innovative activities involve an         extensive range of partners including employers, Local Authorities,         schools, specialist art and design and general further education         colleges.
Each year around 2000 students from schools and colleges         benefit from participating in a very well planned series of Saturday         workshops, summer schools and portfolio days.
Some of these lead to         intermediate level accreditation in drawing contributing in raising         attainment and aspiration in partner schools.'
Farthing has collaborated with the Ashmolean Museum on The Elements         of Drawing: Enhancement and Dissemination for Impact project       (2010/11) funded by the AHRC.
The project aimed to enhance the       sustainability and impact outside academia of the Elements of Drawing       website, which publishes online the collection assembled by John Ruskin to       support his teaching of art and drawing while Slade Professor at Oxford.
As part of his Co-I role Farthing created an online drawing course and       directed the educational areas of the project.
He built upon his previous       experience of working through Ruskin's The Elements of Drawing in       the exhibition and publication Leopard and Leaf, as he       investigated the use of the Ruskin collection as a tool for teaching       drawing while constructing the course.
He produced an 8-week practical       drawing course based on Ruskinian principles, using the objects in the       collection, writing the scripts, selecting the drawings and acting as the       interface between the student and the website via his recorded spoken       demonstrations.
The resource is free to use by amateur artists via the       project website, the Oxford University website and iTunes U.
On iTunes U       there have been over 300,000 downloads of the 9 lessons.
Farthing also       supported the development of other online resources (factsheets,       worksheets, etc) for the Elements of Drawing project designed for       use by the teaching profession and targeted at Key Stage 3-4 and 5 pupils.
