     Research at Lancaster (Popay, Gatrell, Thomas, as cited in sections 2 and       3) carried out in the NCCCE has had significant, cumulative impacts on       public sector thinking about, and approaches to, public involvement in       health policy, practice and research locally, nationally and       internationally.
As a result of this body of research the public in the UK       and internationally is now significantly better engaged in influencing       health policy and practice, in particular those from disadvantaged       communities, leading to improved health and wellbeing and enhanced       employability of a broad range of people.
This research also shaped the       national network of NHS Patient and Public Forums established in England       between 2003 and 2007, and has reframed the way in which social exclusion       and vulnerability are addressed in the report of the Global Commission on       the Social Determinants of Health (Marmot Report) and the WHO EURO Health       Strategy.
Specific examples of and evidence for this impact is as follows.
The Salford Social Action Research Project (SARP) resulted in a major       revision of Salford City Council's housing renewal plans and shaped their       successful bid to join the New Deal for Communities initiative in 2000,       with government funding of &#163;50 million over 10 years.
SARP has also had a       lasting legacy on the way Salford City Council engages with its       communities resulting in the production of gold standards for community       engagement, which have been used by other Local Authorities (5.1).
The       findings of this work (3.1, 3.2) were reported at a national conference       with a key-note speech by the then Minister for Public Health Hazel       Blears, and the national Director for Primary Care Dr Colin Thome (5.2).
The Health Development Agency also used the findings from our research       (3.3, 3.4) in policy and practice development workshops (Ref 5.3) and in       2004 the work was also cited in the briefing paper prepared by the Health       Development Agency to support the task groups overseeing the       implementation of the Choosing Health White Paper.
(Ref 5.4)     Findings from SARP and Strategic Action to Promote Healthy Communities       (SAPHC) were incorporated into a resource to support NHS trusts through a       process of organisational culture change.
This resource was piloted with       six health trusts in England and was made available online in 2004 (5.5).
Subsequently these pilots helped shape the network of Public and Patient       Involvement (PPI) Forums set up in every NHS trust in England by the       Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health in 2007.
Popay was       Vice Chair of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health       (CPPIH) which implemented, performance managed and supported the PPI       forums.
Additionally, according to the Director of the Centre for Public       Health at NICE, SARP, SAPHC and research undertaken at NCCCE "was         fundamental to the framing of the scope [and] supported the         commissioning of the evidence" for NICE guidance on community       engagement published in 2008.
Our evidence review "was influential in         making the case for mixed method evidence reviews, which are now a core         principle of the NICE public health methods manual" (5.6).
The NICE       guidance was widely distributed in the NHS and was also recommended to       local authorities by the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) which       noted that it was "An important milestone in recognising public         engagement as a potential instrument of health improvement" (5.7       p24)     Internationally, Lancaster research (3.5, 3.6) has reframed the way in       which processes of social exclusion and vulnerability were presented in       the report of the Global Commission on the Social Determinants of Health       and has been integrated into the new WHO EURO Health 2020 strategy (5.8).
According to the Head of the WHO European Office for Investment for Health       and Development our "pioneering work has brought qualitative social         science research in from the margins of academia and policy making in         the field of public health" and "This work has been a significant         factor in moving the policy focus in organisations such as WHO away from         a narrow concern with the deficits of social groups traditionally         described as socially excluded on to the processes that lead to         disadvantage and to the resilience and capacities of disadvantaged         groups".
Most recently, with funding from the MRC, our research has       informed the production of an online Public Involvement Impact Assessment       Framework (PiiAF) with associated guidance and dedicated resources.
This       has been described by the NIHR National Director for Public Participation       and Engagement in Research as "a really important piece of work"       (Ref 5.9) and was referenced in an editorial in Nature (Ref 5.10).
