     The programme of research, dissemination and service support by       Swansea University and collaborators has provided scientific foundation       for major changes in conveyance to hospital by emergency ambulances.
In       England, for example, the proportion of emergency calls leading to       hospital conveyance has fallen from 68% (4.3 million of 6.3 million in       2007-8 to 55% (5.0 million of 9.1 million in 2012-3 (Figure 1).
Though       causal inference in this multifactorial field is difficult, we estimate       that hospital conveyances in 2012-3 were some 1.2 million fewer than       expected if the pattern of 2007-8 had continued.
If the cost of these       avoided ambulance journeys alone is calculated, at &#163;20 per journey       (source: NHS unit costs), we estimate the marginal benefit of the journeys       avoided as &#163;24 million.
These reduced attendances at ED are very likely to       yield even more savings for the NHS, but the value of these is more       difficult to estimate.
Figure 1: 999 calls and consequences 2000-13 (source NHS Information Centre)          Snooks's leadership in this field is exemplified by her initiation of,       and continued engagement with, the 999 Emergency Medical Services Research       Forum and the Thematic Research network for emergency, UnScheduled and       Trauma care (TRUST) (http://www.trustresearch.org.uk/en/);       both link service providers and researchers in setting emergency care       research priorities and promoting evidence-based policy and practice.
Swansea University and collaborators have achieved impact on patient       care, service efficiency and staff development not only in the UK but also       internationally, notably across Australia and Canada.
The results of our       research have been used during the development of strategies, guidelines       and standards issued by governing bodies including the Department of       Health, Welsh Government, NHS Scotland and authorities in Victoria,       Australia and Alberta, Canada [C6-C11].
That this research has achieved       impact on policy, service delivery and patient experience over 2008-13, is       also recognised by key people in this field:     "Professor Snooks's work was used in the strategic review of NHS         Ambulance Services in England [C7], the catalyst for transforming         ambulance services over the last seven years ... to modernise services,         professionalise staff, and provide care that is more efficient for the         NHS and appropriate for patients, whilst maintaining safety standards."
[C1]     "Snooks's studies, at the forefront of pre-hospital research, have         significantly influenced the development of new models of ambulance         service care ... including the development of alternatives to ambulance         conveyance, telephone triage, and the safe management of falls.
This         work in turn has influenced national policy on reorganisation of         delivery models for ambulance and pre-hospital health care."
[C2]     Ambulance service providers across UK have implemented phone-based advice       in accordance with recommendations from the Department of Health in       response to our research.
For example NHS Direct nursing staff at several       sites now provide advice to Category C emergency callers, the least       urgent.
In 2012-13 over 360,000 emergency calls in England were resolved       through telephone advice, avoiding ambulance dispatch (source: NHS       Information Centre).
Our work on the development and evaluation of `Treat and Refer' protocols       and extended paramedic roles has prompted all UK ambulance services to       introduce pathways for ambulance crews to assess patients for alternatives       to hospital admission.
We are aware of similar service models being       adopted internationally, for example in Australia and Canada:     "Snooks's work, including evidence of caller satisfaction and very few         adverse events from referrals instead of conveyance, supported         implementation of a point-of-call referral service in Victoria.
The         model is being rolled out across Australia."
[C3]     "The change from routine dispatch of an ambulance for every call         resulted in the referral of 40,000 callers in the state of Victoria to         alternative care in 2012-3, thus increasing availability of ambulances         to respond to emergency calls."
[C11]     "In Alberta, Canada we have developed and implemented models of care         that avoid automatic transportation of 911 patients, based on Snooks's         innovative work on `Treat and Refer' and we have introduced extended         training for paramedics to make decisions about who goes to hospital and         who is best left at home with a community-based care referral."
[C4]     "Professor Snooks's study findings have been used to support the         development and implementation of new services including: (1) Since         2009 paramedic-nurse teams have staffed rural EDs, assessing and         treating patients overnight with on-call physician support;     (2) Since 2009 advanced paramedics and nurses have staffed our         dispatch center, providing advice to field paramedics, and coordinating         emergency calls and inter-facility transfers;     (3) Since 2011 advanced paramedics have responded to calls at nursing         homes, delivering emergency care at the bedside &amp; avoiding         unnecessary transport to emergency depts."
[C5]     Hence translating the research by Swansea University and our       collaborators into practice has achieved impact across many countries,       with benefits to patients, their families, and healthcare providers by       identifying safe alternatives to conveyance to hospital by emergency       ambulance for those without immediate care needs [C12].
