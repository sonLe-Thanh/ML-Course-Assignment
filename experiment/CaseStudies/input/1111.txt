     Although it has been clear for some time that climate change can have       harmful effects, it is only       recently that the protection of human rights and equity concerns have been       accepted as legitimate       considerations in guiding and targeting climate change policy.
Professor       Caney's research has       made a significant contribution to this development.
His application of       ethical frames &#8212; such as       human rights thresholds and intergenerational justice &#8212; to climate change       policy is now used by       major actors in the climate change field ranging from international       organisations, to governments       and NGOs.
Caney was an Advisor to the International Council on Human Rights         Policy (ICHRP) &#8212; an       independent policy body &#8212; on the inclusion of human rights concerns in       their 2008 report Climate         Change and Human Rights.
[C1] The report is acknowledged as       a critical moment in establishing       the centrality of ethical considerations in the climate policy debate [C2].
It drew on Caney's       research and gave particular prominence to his concept of human rights         thresholds, which made it       possible to connect the ethical concerns raised by climate change to the       legal apparatus of human       rights.
This was one of the first policy reports to clarify how human       rights can be considered as an       essential dimension of climate change policy.
It had a powerful framing       effect on the wider debate       and shaped the policy positions of major actors such as the UN &#8212; the Human       Rights Council and       the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (see below)[C2].
(1) Shaping the adoption of human rights and equity concerns as           legitimate considerations           in guiding and targeting climate change policy     Caney's research has informed the positions adopted by a range of UN       bodies, the World Bank       and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) on human rights and       climate change.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): Caney's work has       contributed to the explicit       concern for human rights and equity reflected in the latest Assessment       Report (AR5) issued by the       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The IPCC works       under the auspices of the       United Nations and is the leading intergovernmental scientific body for       the assessment of climate       change.
It provides rigorous scientific information on climate change and       its potential       environmental and socio-economic impacts to decision makers.
Its reports       are the authoritative       source of information in international climate change negotiations and       have a critical impact on       policy responses.
Caney was a member of the working group that drafted the       report's chapter on       `Social, Economic and Ethical Concepts and Methods'.
Other chapters on       `Impacts, Adaptation and       Vulnerability' and `Mitigation of Climate Change' also cite his research [R1,         R3, R5, R7].
In all,       Caney's arguments that climate change has substantial effects on human       rights, intergenerational       justice and distributive justice are cited in six chapters of the report.
The IPCC's fifth assessment       report will shape worldwide responses to climate change from 2014 onwards.
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights       (OHCHR): Caney's research       and the ICHRP report in turn shaped the thinking of the OHCHR on the       relationship between       climate change and human rights.
Both Caney's work [R1] and the       ICHRP report are cited in       OHCHR's analysis [C3].
The OHCHR report refers to Caney's argument       that a moral concern for       intergenerational justice imposes a duty on current generations to       mitigate climate change in order       to safeguard the rights of future generations.
UNICEF: Caney's work on intergenerational justice has shaped       UNICEF's position on climate       change.
Following Caney, UNICEF argues in its report `A brighter tomorrow:       climate change, child       rights and intergenerational justice' that the rights of future       generations must be a key       consideration in policy making on climate change and cites Caney's work [R1,R4]         [C4].
The World Bank: Caney's work has also influenced the World Bank       Group's approach to climate       policy.
Caney contributed a commissioned background paper on `Ethics and       Climate Change 2009'       to the Bank's World Development Report 2010 which included the       argument (referencing Caney)       that climate change policies should take account of fairness in the       distribution of responsibilities       and costs, human rights, and intergenerational equity [R1-4] [C5].
The report sets the framework       for the Bank's climate change policy.
International Trade Union Congress (ITUC): Caney's research [R5]       and contributions to an ITUC       seminar on climate change had considerable influence in shaping the ITUC's       view of climate       change as jeopardizing not just labour but also human rights.
The ITUC       represents 174 million       workers in 156 countries and its call for climate change policies that       protect both sets of rights is       enshrined in the ITUC report `Making Common Cause: Human Rights, Labour       Rights and Climate       Change' [C6], which formed the basis for the ITUC's contributions       to the UN climate change       negotiations in Canc&#250;n       (2010) and Doha (2012).
(2) Shaping policy: biofuels, human rights and the equitable           allocation of burdens     The research on normative principles to guide climate change policy [R5,         R6] has been particularly       influential in shaping policy initiatives with respect to biofuels.
As a       result of his work Caney was       invited to join the working party on biofuels of the Nuffield Council         on Bioethics and had a central       influence in developing the six ethical principles advocated by the       Council as a guide for biofuels       policy [C7].
The principles &#8212; which include respect for people's       essential rights and the equitable       distribution of benefits and costs from biofuels policies &#8212; were published       in the Council's report       Biofuels: Ethical Issues (2011) of which Caney is a co-author.
These principles have shaped the       frameworks applied to biofuels policy in the UK and at the European level.
The principles influenced the criteria applied in the first voluntary         schemes to certify the         sustainability of biofuels approved by the European Commission [C7].
The UK Bioenergy Strategy, published by the government in         April 2012, reflected the Nuffield         Council's six ethical principles [C7], and the Chair of the House           of Commons Energy and           Climate Change Select Committee (Tim Yeo MP) endorsed the report's         six principles as         "completely beyond argument", [C8].
In October 2012, the UK's Technology Strategy Board employed         the six principles in its         `Responsible Innovation Framework' to guide innovation in the area of         synthetic biology.
In all, the six principles have been among the most influential outputs       of the Nuffield Council.
Since       publication, the main page for the report (www.nuffieldbioethics.org/biofuels)       has been viewed       more than 25,000 times and the report PDF has been downloaded 2,700 times.
(3) Shaping the public debate about climate change     The research has generated wide public interest: Caney was invited to       speak on how principles of       justice and human rights should inform climate change policy by UNESCO,       Policy Network, the       Danish Institute for Human Rights, the Centre for Sustainable Energy, the       E3 Foundation, and in       the Oxford Amnesty Lectures.
His work was recommended by Mary Robinson in       her 5 essential       readings on climate justice [R5, C9].
His proposals for       safeguarding the rights of future generations       in democratic political processes that address climate change were quoted       by the Rt Hon Ed       Miliband (then Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change) in his       speech `The Road to       Copenhagen' at the LSE on 17 November 2009 [C10].
In sum, by demonstrating the effects of climate change on human rights       and equity, and charting       how these concerns can be considered in policy, Caney's research has had       important impact in       framing ethical considerations in the debate about climate change       policies.
The work has had       significant reach enabling major stakeholders from UN bodies, the World       Bank and the ITUC to the       European Commission and the UK government to formulate positions that take       account of the       ethical issues raised by climate change and to develop policy frameworks       that address them.
