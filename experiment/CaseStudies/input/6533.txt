     The practical outcome of Clarke's research is the Pop-Up-Foundation, an       incubator organisation which hosts a set of practical, research and       dissemination projects.
These enable and promote opportunities for people       in different geographical settings to experiment, share findings and learn       about sustainable living solutions.
The underpinning research has been formative in the development of new       thinking about how people can participate in the design and development of       sustainable solutions in their own lives.
In so doing, they may       participate in a broader social movement which is taking place in adapting       human consciousness to changes brought about by changing climate and       environmental conditions.

http://newindianexpress.com/education/edex/article1352030.ece     Public debate has been informed and shaped by the approach Clarke has       taken to the work because it is outward facing and has challenged       established norms on sustainability, particularly through the engagement       of school and local communities.
He does not primarily speak through his       work to the academic community.
Instead, he uses the academe to facilitate       the debate and ensure that it remains credible and grounded.
As a part of       Clarke's broader role working with a global consultancy company (Mott       MacDonald), he has used their internal global network to formulate a       strategic method to connect communities that were grappling with similar       environmental, social and economic challenges.
This method provides a       common platform for debate and enquiry across the worldwide network, and       is the basis of his involvement with the World Bank as a selected       Knowledge Provider.
Public debate and increased cultural understanding is evident in the       media interest through television, radio and newspaper articles.
Clarke       has pursued the debate at numerous conferences and meetings worldwide such       as the International School Effectiveness and Improvement Congress       (Keynote speaker January 2011) and the World Innovation Summit in       Education (WISE) Conference Qatar (November 2012, Keynote speaker),       through to numerous seminars and invited speaking events around the world       (Vancouver Schools network Keynote speaker 2012, Adelaide School       Principals Conference 2012, to community-based events such as the       Transition Towns Gathering in Liverpool 2011, Nesta conference 2011,       Regional Corporate Sustainability Seminars (Manchester 2011) and       International Cooperative Movement Convention (2012), Canadian Education       Research Congress, Vancouver 2013 (Keynote Speaker), Food Security       Conference Brescia, Italy, (Keynote Speaker), Food Security Special       Invited Summit, Washington DC, USA (World Bank).
He has worked       independently, but has also shared research interests with colleagues       working in other supportive sectors and with other disciplines.
He has       been keen to illustrate this through the range of articles submitted, from       the substantive self-authored work which formulates the preconditions of       the work in progress and scopes some of the next steps, to the       collaborative pieces which were invited as chapters within specific themed       books (see the Community Renaissance chapter in Coates 2010) to the       invited paper for the seminar series for the Centre for Strategic       Education based in Australia, to the chapter with Kelly, for the       International Handbook of Educational Effectiveness.
This process of       research and writing is evidence of the impact the work has had on       democratic participation in the global community's exploration and       evaluation of sustainability practices.
Evidence of the impact of the work outlined in this case study is shown       in the following two examples.
In East Lancashire, a network of primary       schools has developed over time which continues to work on sustainability       curricula.
Such initiatives have resulted in demonstrably much greater       levels of community outreach through innovative use of the school       landscape, food growing and healthy living schemes.
The Pop-Up-Farm project has been used in Uganda to inform and facilitate       a structured approach to renewing the school community after civil war.
The outcome of these direct links has been the formation in 2011 of a       company selling coffee (Happy Coffee Bean Company), the profits of which       are returned to the school community to support their regeneration       programme.
The impact of this programme reaches beyond the school by       enabling children of the community to realise a place for themselves in       the future through improved social welfare practices and employment and       educational opportunities.
Overall, the main thrust of the work of the Pop-Up-Foundation and       Clarke's research through this vehicle has been to contribute to improved       social, cultural and environmental sustainability through the influence on       creation and delivery of curricula and the shaping and informing of public       attitude and values.
