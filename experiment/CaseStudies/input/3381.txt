     The "Sporting Playgrounds" research (Sec.3, Refs.1-5)       demonstrates impact by increasing children's MVPA and VPA and represents       an improvement in childhood health attained in a cost effective manner.
By       way of a narrative context from research to impact, between 2000 and 2008,       alongside the peer reviewed journal outputs, outcomes from the "Sporting         Playgrounds" research were disseminated to over 1000 practitioners       and policy makers via invited sessions at 13 local, regional and National       events for schools, public health play and public sector agencies.
These       included PE and School Sport Club Links (Hyde-2005); Lancashire Healthy       School Good Practice Conference (Chorley-2005): Play research Network,       (Bristol-2006) and Rotherham PCT (2006).
Since 2008 the LJMU "Sporting Playgrounds" research has featured       in both National and International evidence-based reviews, educational       policy statements and practical guidance in printed formats.
In the UK, "Sporting         Playgrounds" research has been promoted in reviews by Play England       and the National Children's Bureau that advocate the role of recess based       play in moving children towards the recommended accumulation levels for       physical activity (Sec.5, Source.Ai/Aii).
In the USA, The National       Association of Physical Education (Sec.5, Source.B) reported       evidence (Sec.2, Ref.2) within their position statement in the       drive to increase appropriate and novel opportunities for non-curricula       physical activity within schools.
Active Living Research Briefs (2011,       2012; Sec.5, Source.Ci/Cii) featured multiple exemplars of RISES "Sporting         Playgrounds" research within its "key" results that subsequently       informed policy statements within the USA (Sec.5, Source.Cii p.5).
To further demonstrate the geographic reach and significance of this       research, in 2008 `A Call for Action' was made to change legislation by       the Government of Western Australia via the Children's Physical Activity       Coalition (CPAC) Charter for Active Kids.
Within this document RISES "Sporting         Playgrounds" research was highlighted when constructing the action       point to "provide traditional and innovative playground markings in       schools to motivate participation in physical activity before school and       during breaks in classes" (Sec.5, Source.D p.18-19).
Most recently       the American Journal of Paediatrics (Sec.5, Source.E) published a       policy statement on the crucial role of recess in promoting physical       activity.
RISES "Sporting Playgrounds" research (Sec.3, Ref.4)       are the only references cited from outside the USA and this has led to       policy recommendations (Sec.5, Source.E; 3 &amp; 4, p 185)       outlining the benefits of playground design for child development and       recess as a contributor to daily MVPA targets.
The Liverpool "Sporting Playgrounds" work was incorporated in to       the 2008 NICE Public Health Guidance 8.
The NICE Environment and Physical       Activity group was reconvened in 2010 to discuss new research evidence and       update Public Health Guidance 8.
The consensus was that RISES "Sporting         Playgrounds" research remained central to the "environment" guidance       produced in January 2008.
Public Health Guidance 17 `Promoting Physical       Activity for Children and Young People', published in January 2009, was       chaired by Professor Gareth Stratton and promoted aspects of play for       families, including children's active play (Sec.5, Source.Fi/Fii).
Locally, the "Sporting Playgrounds" project has informed the       School Improvement Policy of Liverpool City Council (Sec.5, Source G),       and impacted the redesign of school playgrounds in a region of the UK that       is exposed to significant health inequalities.
Furthermore, the UK based       company Magical Markings was commissioned by the "Sporting Playgrounds"       project to implement the playground markings.
The economic impact of this       research was reflected by the Director of Magical Markings (Sec.5         Source.H) who stated that "the research at the Liverpool John         Moores University helped me to form integral parts of my business plan         and helped gain a `competitive edge' at a time, when at is most         prosperous, 47 employees were employed by the company working all over         the UK".
The health impact of changing physical activity in this manner is       important, since it has recently been demonstrated that increasing VPA by       5 minutes per day reduces the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.
Health economics analysis of our RISES "Sporting Playgrounds" data       concluded that the cost of increasing playtime VPA by 5 minutes per day       was &#163;5.40 per child per year (Sec.5, Source.I).
According to       current NICE criteria, this modest amount represents an extremely       cost-effective intervention to enhance the health outcomes of children.
