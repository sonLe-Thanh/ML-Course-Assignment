     The research of Hemingway's group has directly informed national and       international public health       policy, clinical guidelines and the development of underpinning methods       which have subsequently       been implemented and have had an important impact on the healthcare and       health of the UK and       international populations, and our capacity for carrying out research for       patient benefit.
Clinical investigation of patients with suspected or confirmed         coronary disease     Since the early post-war period the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) has       been the most widely       performed diagnostic test for stable angina.
In March 2010, however, NICE       guidelines on Chest         pain of recent onset (CG95) recommended the following: "Do not         use exercise ECG to diagnose or         exclude stable angina for people without known CAD".
Hemingway was a       member of the Guideline       Development Group and his research is cited 16 times in the guideline [a].
This has led to one of       the most significant changes in the diagnostic pathway of patients with       suspected stable angina for       decades.
In the light of recent evidence showing the modest incremental       value for exercise ECG &#8212;       the strongest contemporary UK evidence coming from our research &#8212; NICE       made this bold       recommendation, which has subsequently been implemented.
This recommendation has since gone on to change clinical practice.
For       example, an analysis of       diagnostic testing at the Newcastle Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic in 2011       reported that: "The         proportion of the study population before and after the guidelines         undergoing exercise testing was         50.1% vs 0.0%; for calcium score/CT coronary angiography 0.0% vs 14.7%;         for functional imaging         25.6% vs 13.4%; and for invasive coronary angiography 15.3% vs 25.8%.
The proportion not         requiring further testing was unchanged (30.0% vs 31.0%)" [b].
An analysis from the Royal Derby       Hospital in 2013 reported that "implementation of the 2010 NICE         guidance...resulted in a greater         proportion of initial discharge to primary care with less frequent         outpatient review and similar rates         of referral for coronary angiography" [c].
CG95 also made recommendations based on our research on sex and ethnicity       in angina pain.
The guideline recommended: "Do not define typical and atypical features         of anginal chest pain and         non-anginal chest pain differently in men and women" (recommendation       1.3.3.2) and "Do not         define typical and atypical features of anginal chest pain and         non-anginal chest pain differently in         ethnic groups" (recommendation 1.3.3.3).
These two recommendations       (arising from ref.
5 above)       for the first time make an unequivocal statement to clinicians that       typical anginal pain does not       differ by sex and ethnicity.
This is important because it has previously       been used as a post-hoc       justification of why rates of procedure use might differ between these       groups.
Treatment of patients with angina     From the perspective of the patient, or the health system payer, one of       the most significant       decisions taken among patients with angina relates to the mode of       revascularisation (coronary       artery bypass graft [CABG] or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]).
Our work was cited ten       times in the NICE guidelines on Management of stable angina       (CH126) issued in July 2011 and       directly influenced recommendations, all of which were `Key priorities for       implementation' [d].
First, `When either procedure would be appropriate, explain to the         person the risks and benefits of         PCI and CABG for people with anatomically less complex disease whose         symptoms are not         satisfactorily controlled with optimal medical treatment.
If the person         does not express a         preference, take account of the evidence that suggests that PCI may be         the more cost-effective         procedure in selecting the course of treatment.'
Second, `When either procedure would be appropriate, take into account         the potential survival         advantage of CABG over PCI for people with multivessel disease whose         symptoms are not         satisfactorily controlled with optimal medical treatment and who have         diabetes or are over 65 years         or have anatomically complex three-vessel disease, with or without         involvement of the left main         stem.'
Our published unique `real world' cost and outcome data highlighted the       prevalence of patients       who are judged appropriate for both forms of revascularisation (refs [1]       and [3] above) and       underpinned to specification of these recommendations.
Our UK evidence       base added to that       internationally has led to a slowing in the rate of increase of PCI for       stable coronary disease.
Co-existing depression among people with myocardial infarction     Our systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the role of depression in the       prognosis of coronary       disease have contributed in part to recommendations in European guidance       on the need to assess       psychosocial factors in these patients.
Hemingway contributed to the 2007       guidelines on       cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice from European       Society of Cardiology, and the       most recent (2012) guidelines directly cite our work in support of the       identification of depression as       a specific risk factor in CVD [e].
These are the strongest       recommendations to date that clinicians       might consider psychosocial factors in addition to the better recognised       behavioural and biological       factors.
