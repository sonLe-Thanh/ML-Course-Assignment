     The results of this research programme have demonstrated that, in younger       women undergoing       IVF replacing one embryo at a time (ie.
eSET), results in livebirth rates       are comparable to the usual       policy of double embryo transfer.
This research also established that eSET       leads to higher rates of       term singleton liveborn babies i.e.
healthy babies in comparison with       double embryo transfer.
The Aberdeen research group's Cochrane systematic review [2] and       subsequent print publication       [3] was influential in informing policy within the United Kingdom, where       the Human Fertilisation and       Embryology Authority (HFEA) &#8212; the IVF regulatory body for the UK &#8212; set up       an expert group to       advise on Multiple Births after IVF.
This Group referenced the Aberdeen       review in its       recommendation, which advised eSET (with transfer of a second frozen       embryo) and set targets       for twin rates after IVF [a].
This resulted in an increase in the uptake       of eSET from 4.8% in 2008 to       14.7% in 2010 and a corresponding decrease in multiple pregnancy rates       [b].
The implementation       of eSET has been particularly noticeable in younger women who have the       best chance of       achieving a livebirth, but the overall success rate has not been affected       as a consequence of this       policy.
Although the results of the initial Cochrane systematic review led to a       degree of change in the IVF       sector, many practitioners remained unconvinced until the publication of       the individual patient data       meta-analysis of all relevant randomised trials [4].
This meta-analysis       showed that eSET in a fresh       IVF treatment cycle (without an additional frozen embryo replacement)       resulted in a higher chance       of a single healthy baby (live baby born at full term).
This work was       widely publicised by the       national and international media, the NHS and the global professional       organisation for       Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [c,d,e] and highlighted by the HFEA on       its website [a].
It was       also promoted by the "One at a time" website &#8212; a professionally-led       website in the UK aimed at       reducing the risks of multiple pregnancies associated with fertility       treatment.
This meta-analysis       was also cited in the updated NICE guideline [f] on infertility published       in 2013 as clear evidence of       the benefit of eSET to mothers and their babies.
Along with the paper from       the Aberdeen group       on the cost effectiveness of alternative embryo transfer strategies (eSET       versus DET) in IVF in       women of different ages, it also served to inform NICE guidance on       selective use of eSET in       women of different ages [f].
In the UK, the impact of the research       directly and indirectly through       HFEA recommendations is evident from national data published by HFEA [b].
Between 2008 and       2011, HFEA data show that rates of eSET have increased from 4% to 18% (25%       in women aged       18-34 years) in all IVF cycles in the UK and twin rates have fallen from       27% to just under 20%       [a,b].
There is no evidence of any compromise in livebirth rates per IVF       treatment in the UK over       this period with perhaps even a modest increase from 26% to 32%.
Results of the Aberdeen research group's individual patient data       meta-analysis on eSET, which       included data from over 1300 women, has also informed clinical guidelines       on IVF embryo transfer       policies internationally in countries such as Canada and South Africa       [g,h].
Most recently, the       United States, which has also used our research as evidence to inform its       eSET policy [i] has also       witnessed an increase in eSET in women under 35 years of age &#8212; from 4.5%       in 2007 to 11.75% in       2011 [j].
In summary, the initial impact in the UK occurred just after the Cochrane       review and received a       further boost after the publication of the IPD meta-analysis and health       economic papers prompting       policy changes within the regulators, HFEA, [a] and NICE [f].
Countries       more initially resistant to       eSET (Canada, South Africa and USA) have now developed guidance [g,h,i]       and have cited the       Aberdeen work.
The effects of these more recent changes on international       guidance on eSET are       already apparent with evidence continuing to accrue.
The claimed impact as defined by REF guidance is, therefore on public         policy and services;         practitioners and professional services and health and welfare       in the UK and internationally.
