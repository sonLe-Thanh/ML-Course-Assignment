     In 2011, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics established a Working Party to       consider `The impact of the disclosure or non-disclosure of information       about a person's genetic origins in families created through donor       gametes'.
Susan Golombok's expertise in this field led to her being       invited to be a member of this eight person Working Party.
The other       members were drawn from the fields of philosophy, medicine, law, social       anthropology and clinical genetics.
Her research features prominently in       the final report `Donor conception: Ethical aspects of information       disclosure' and contributed to the report's recommendations.7,8     In 2011, Susan Golombok was also appointed as a Member of Advisory       Committee for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Review of       Sperm, Egg and Embryo Donation.
Her research is acknowledged as having       contributed to two policy decisions resulting from the review:9,10       (i) Her unexpected finding that large numbers of children were being born       from the sperm of individual donors contributed to the decision to limit       the number of families a single donor can create to 10.
As stated on the       HFEA website in 2011, `The Authority was persuaded by views expressed       during the consultation that, for psychological reasons, a limit should be       placed on the number of possible siblings that a donor-conceived person       could expect to have'; (ii) Her research on egg sharing, showing that       concerns about the negative psychological consequences of egg sharing       appeared to be unfounded, contributed to the decision to permit egg       sharing to continue to be practiced in the UK.
In 1998, the HFEA decided       that egg sharing should be regulated not banned, and since that time egg       sharing has been scrutinised by the HFEA on several occasions,       highlighting the division of opinion regarding this practice.
The HFEA's       Open Authority Meeting in October 2011 revealed growing ethical approval       for egg sharing, informed in part by Susan Golombok's research.
In addition, in 2012 Susan Golombok was asked to give evidence, based on       her research on children born through egg donation and surrogacy, to both       the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and HFEA, on new techniques for the       prevention of mitochondrial DNA disorders.
This is controversial because       children will be born with genetic material from 3 people.11 In       July 2013 the UK Government supported the introduction of mitochondrial       replacement therapy which will enable women with mitochondrial disease to       have healthy children.
Since 2008, she has been invited to give evidence,       based on her research on families created by assisted reproductive       technologies, to the Government's Science and Technology Committee; the       Joint Lords and Commons Committee on the Human Embryos and Tissues Bill;       the Department of Children, Schools &amp; Families; the Prime Minister's       Strategy Unit; and to foreign institutions such as the United States       Department of Health and the Norwegian Law Commission.
A further earlier impact of Susan Golombok's research is its contribution       to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (2008), including the       replacement of the clause in the original 1990 Act requiring fertility       clinics to take into account the child's `need for a father' with a clause       requiring clinics to consider the child's need for `supportive parenting'.12       Her research also influenced the decisions to allow lesbian couples to       become the joint legal parents of children born through assisted       reproduction at a licensed clinic and to allow gay male couples to become       the legal parents of children born through a surrogacy arrangement.12       Furthermore, her research showing that some donor-conceived individuals       express a strong wish to make contact with their donor siblings       contributed to the decision to enable donor-siblings aged 18 or older, and       born from 1991 onwards, to be given identifying information about each       other in cases where both parties consent.12 These provisions       came into force in 2010.
The findings of Professor Golombok's research have also informed the       counselling of those who wish to undergo treatment with donated eggs,       sperm or embryos, particularly in relation to counselling regarding the       implications of disclosure versus secrecy about the child's biological       origins.7     Professor Golombok's expertise and her acknowledged commitment has led to       frequent invitations to inform the public and enrich public debate on       assisted reproductive technologies.
In 2012/13, she spoke at the Hay       Literary Festival, the Cheltenham Science and Literature Festivals, the       British Science Festival and at public engagement events organised by the       Wellcome Trust.
She has appeared in the media on several occasions, for       example, Woman's Hour, BBC and the Guardian, Independent and Sunday Times.13       The report of her survey of the school experiences of children with       same-sex parents14 formed the basis for training material for       teachers distributed to thousands of schools,15 and her report       on gay adoptive families has been distributed to adoption professionals       throughout the UK.16
