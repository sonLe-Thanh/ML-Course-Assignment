     [text removed for publication]     In the REF2014 period Shell has used SQUEEZE software to go from a       treatment every six months to a treatment every 12 months, saving &#163;3M per       well per annum.
A partial list of the wells for which this OPEX reduction       has been achieved is Pierce B1, Guillemot P3, and some Bittern wells,       leading to savings well in excess of &#163;10M per year.
[S4]     As a result of ERPE research, service companies tendering for work are       required to demonstrate expertise in designing field treatment programmes       using the SQUEEZE software.
In the last three years, 102 industry       representatives have undergone SQUEEZE training at our Edinburgh campus       and at industry offices in Aberdeen, Norway, Dubai, Malaysia and USA.
As       examples of service company use of SQUEEZE software, we provide two       quotes: Clariant Oil state that they "use the most recently updated         version of the SQUEEZE modelling software (currently SQUEEZE 8) to plan         all the scale inhibitor squeeze operations that we manage for our         clients.
Across the global organization this equates to approximately         300 squeezes per year and protects over 500,000,000 barrels of produced         water resulting in many billions of dollars of protected oil         production."
[S1]     Nalco Champion "...use the latest version of the SQUEEZE software for         all our squeeze designs, which annually numbers approximately 250         squeeze treatments.
Along with our current customer contracts we are         required by operators to demonstrate expertise in the use of the SQUEEZE         software in tendering for chemical squeeze business.
In the past 12         months Nalco Champion has been able to secure contracts worth over         $3,000,000 based on our ability to use the current version of this ERPE         developed software."
[S2]     Prevention by inhibition is by far more cost effective than cure taking       into account typical workover costs in the UK N Sea of ca.
&#163;25 M/well       excluding the associated loss of production.
ERPE is a recognized world       leader JIP supporting the industry in terms of learning on this key scale       management area.
A Production Chemistry Team Leader at Talisman Sinopec       Energy UK Ltd commented that "All the scale management activity in the         North Sea that our company undertakes is impacted by the research that         has been undertaken by ERPE over the past decade....Talisman-Sinopec         Energy UK Limited has some fifty four wells under active scale squeeze         management protecting 36,798 barrels of oil production per day.
This         production typically equates to a significant portion of the company's         annual production and revenue."
