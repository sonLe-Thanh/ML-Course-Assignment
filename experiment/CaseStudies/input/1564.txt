     The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) subsequently adopted       Ridge &amp; Ziebland's (2006) recovery research extensively into their       guidance on the treatment and management of depression in adults in the UK       (2010), see:       http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12329/45896/45896.pdf.
More than 10 pages of this NICE guidance are devoted to Ridge's research       on depression and recovery.
More than this, the recovery work was widely       taken up by the consumer mental health movement, and is summarised or       reproduced in full on many hundreds of consumer and information websites       throughout the world (a Google search for the Ridge &amp; Ziebland journal       paper turns up 15,000 hits).
For example, the award winning `Working       Together' service user organisation has reproduced Ridge &amp; Ziebland's       research in full (see http://www.workingtogetherforrecovery.co.uk/recovery_library.htm)       so that consumers can benefit.
Further, key charities and health sites       have commissioned Professor Ridge to translate his recovery findings for       consumers (e.g.
see CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably): http://www.thecalmzone.net/help/issues/depression/       and the Healthista health channel:       http://www.healthista.com/mind/how-to-spot-depression-in-man/).
In terms of professional practice, many commentators noted that the work       moves the field beyond the current rhetoric advocating a general `recovery       approach' (see below).
In terms of specific contribution to insight,       McKenzie (2009) notes that the main value of the work is the `scholarly'       approach taken to `establishing the therapeutic potential of narrative.'
McKenzie (2009) notes that while the NHS requires mental health       practitioners to adopt a recovery model in their work, `[Ridge] provides       significant signposts as to what that practice might contain.'
Therapy         Today called the book `an excellent addition to the literature on       this subject' (Townsend 2009).
One practitioner wrote "This book opened       new horizons to the area of depression"       (http://jameswoodward.sdnet.co.uk/review-ridge.htm).
Writing in Pulse magazine for GPs, Dr Clare Etherington, said of the work,       "essentially hopeful, enjoyed reading... stimulated thought about everyday       practice."
The book was given 5 out of 5 stars by the practice-based Nursing         Standard (Vol 26, no.
47, 2012).
Nursing Standard       subsequently commissioned and funded Ridge (2012) to translate his       findings into a step-by-step guide for nurses, describing how nurses could       operationalize recovery for patients with depression (Nursing           Standard, 26 (47).

Ridge is regularly invited to talk to, and write for, consumers directly       about how they can recover from depression.
So for example, he talked       directly to users on the Sky TV `ChrissyB Show' about how they could       recover based on his research.
The ChrissyB show regularly has over 10,000       viewers, and there are over 260 views of his Sky `recovery from       depression' video on Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it79DRfuXB8).
In addition, Ridge regularly talks about recovery, translating his       research, for his popular Huffington Post blog.
So when Ridge disseminated       his research on recovery via his own blog, the public avidly shared it:       207 people shared it on their Facebook page, a further 620 people shared       it by `liking' the page on Facebook, and 63 people tweeted the article       amongst their networks, effectively ensuring that the research went global       (http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/professor-damien-ridge/depression-creating-hope_b_2997084.html).
The CALM recovery page discussed above was also shared by 132 people via       Facebook, and is read by many thousands more every month.
An event, `Living         or Just Surviving,' was held on the 8th of October 2013       at the University of Westminster, and this translated the recovery       research for a broad audience of 150 public attendees (Eventbrite       statistics).
The CALM charity subsequently made Professor Ridge a Trustee,       acknowledging the very high value of his recovery and mental health work       to the public, and in particular its value in helping suicidal men, many       of whom are depressed.
