     Ilika Technologies Ltd focuses on three key markets, namely energy       storage and capacity, materials for improving electronic component       performance, and new materials that have interesting catalytic, electronic       and magnetic properties.
The company uses a high-throughput technology       based on a modified molecular beam epitaxy system, developed by the CSO       (who started the company).
This is a case study demonstrating economic       impact through the improved performance of an existing business by the       introduction of new processes and procedures.
Specifically, the       introduction of functional oxide based deposition technology into Ilika       who had previously only focussed on metal and polymers.
The CEO and CSO of       Ilika have stated in the final reports of the KTP862 [S1] and 7023 [S2]       that the know-how transferred to Ilika from Sheffield enabled Ilika to       leverage contracts in excess of &#163;1M with blue-chip companies such as       Toyota, Toshiba and Ceramtec in the area of tuneable devices,       piezoelectrics, and lithium-ion batteries which rely on oxide based films       and ceramics [S3].
These and similar contracts constitute ~ 30% of the       revenue generated by Ilika since 2008 [S3].
The contracts undertaken by       Ilika using technology embedded by Reaney have led to improvements in the       product base of a number of multinationals, broadly within the arena of       `materials for energy', such as micro-batteries, and illustrate the       breadth of impact realised through his research.
The crucial role of the underpinning research in realising this economic       impact both within Ilika and via their contracts with blue-chip       multinationals, is summarised by the CEO as follows:     "Professor Reaney's research has been instrumental in the economic         growth and stock market flotation of Knowledge Transfer Partner Ilika         Plc.
The knowledge he provided to the company allowed it to develop         entirely new expertise in functional oxide based deposition technology         and a more sophisticated approach to ceramics that has allowed it to         access new markets and new customers, and grow existing relationships.
For example, Prof Reaney's techniques are employed for the automotive         hybrid and electronic car market and, in terms of impact since 2008,         have generated revenue of &#163;3m.
IP has also been generated with Toyota in         2011, resulting in three patents (JP2011222415A, WO2011/128976A1,         WO2011/128977A1), the opportunity to work further with Toyota, and also         to exploit that patent technology in other markets."
Another product opportunity that has arisen via the ability to design and       produce micro-batteries is for the smart home market &#8212; to communicate and       link up electrical devices.
These batteries can be powered by a small PV       type device, have long life, and low levels of leakage.
This has resulted       in Ilika filing for two patents themselves and for the Company to develop       a whole new range of applications and markets.
The company has also expanded its workforce from 5 employees to 35 since       2004, and the CEO estimates that a quarter of staff are currently working       on projects directly attributable to the new technology gained from       Professor Reaney's research.
Ilika's success has also benefited the UK and       wider global economy.
Since 2004, Ilika has spent an estimated &#163;800k on       consumables, infrastructure and equipment in the UK and a further &#163;700k on       equipment globally.
Ilika floated on the London Stock Exchange with shares       valued at &#163;20M [S4].
The CEO has personally recognised that without       Reaney's involvement it would have been considerably more difficult to       develop the company in areas that rely on oxide based technology for their       main applications and devices, as follows:     "Ian's knowledge and expertise is globally pre-eminent and has been an         extremely important factor in the growth of the company."
Reaney now acts as a consultant with Ilika to advise on future and       current oxide based functional material programmes.
