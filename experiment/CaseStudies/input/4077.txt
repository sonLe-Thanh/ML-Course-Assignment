     Adoption by industry:       Neal's Yard Remedies is an independent British manufacturer and retailer       of natural and organic skin and body care products with stores in the UK,       mainland Europe, North America, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.
In       November 2012, Neal's Yard Remedies incorporated Darbre's research into       their marketing tools and public messaging, including a video featuring       Darbre and her research.
They stated that "by avoiding parabens, we       believe we have avoided subjecting our customers to a potentially       dangerous and carcinogenic cosmetic ingredient.
This is a perfect example       of the precautionary principle" [a].
In June 2012, The Organic Pharmacy, a British manufacturer and retailer       of organic health products with stores in the US, Europe, and Asia       Pacific, incorporated Darbre's research into the information they make       available to their customers.
Darbre was an invited expert at their       `Prevent Cancer Evening', which was recorded and posted on their website       [b].
In keeping with The Organic Pharmacy's ethos that "consumers have the       right to make an informed choice" [b], the event aimed to provide guests       with an opportunity to learn more about the cutting edge science being       conducted on carcinogenic chemical compounds and has become part of the       educational material the business provides to its customers.
Informing policy recommendations:       The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) provides the European       Union Commission with the scientific advice needed to prepare policy and       proposals relating to consumer safety, public health and the environment.
They have prepared a series of opinions on parabens [e.g.
[c], which cites       Darbre et al.
(2002) J Appl Toxicol 22(4):219-26] and in       2005 were specifically asked to prepare an opinion based on Darbre's       findings linking underarm cosmetics and breast cancer [d, cites 10       articles by Darbre including [2]].
Though the final opinion of the SCCP       was that there was insufficient evidence to suggest causation, the issue       had successfully been raised with the European Commission.
In 2009, The Danish Ministry of the Environment conducted a survey and       assessment of the risk to children less than three years old exposed to       chemical substances in consumer products [e].
This assessment cited       Darbre's research showing that parabens could accumulate in the skin and       be absorbed [e, pg 179-180].
The survey, which included the research of       Darbre and others, led to Denmark's Environmental Ministry taking a       precautionary approach with young children and banning parabens in lotions       and other cosmetic products aimed specifically at children under 3 years       of age on March 15th, 2011 [f].
The ban by the Government of Denmark then prompted the European       Commission to seek guidance from the Scientific Committee on Consumer       Safety (SCCS) to determine whether the EU should take the same       precautionary measures as Denmark [g].
Again, Darbre's research was used       to inform the opinion of the Scientific Committee [f, cites [2] and two       other articles by Darbre], which eventually came to the conclusion that       there wasn't sufficient evidence to warrant the same action across the EU.
Supporting campaigns by non-government organisations:       Darbre's research has been incorporated into the public awareness campaign       materials of numerous not-for-profit, non-government organisations around       the world.
These include, for example, one of Canada's leading       environmental organisations, David Suzuki Foundation [g] and the Organic       Consumers Association, representing 850,000 members in the US [h].
Increasing public awareness:       Darbre's research has raised awareness of the oestrogenic effects of       parabens to the general public through extensive coverage in the media.
Examples of this coverage include:            BBC Radio 4's Today programme (12 Jan 2004) - 7.18 million         listeners/week (2011 audience figure)       Front page spread on The Sunday Times (11 Jan 2004) -         readership* of 2,525,000/week       Pg 4 of The Observer (11 Jan 2004) - readership* of         1,056,000/week        MailOnline (12 Jan 2012) - 5.3 million visitors/day**         USA Today (13 Jan 2012) - 26.3 million unique visitors/month**         Reader's Digest Australia [http://www.readersdigest.com.au/information-about-parabens]         - 373,956 unique visitors/month**         Sydney Morning Herald (18 Mar 2013) - 2.5 million unique         visitors/month**         New Scientist (12 Jan 2004) - 9.7 million page views/month**         The Huffington Post (12 Jan 2012) - 39 million unique         visitors/month**        Documentaries were made with Dr Darbre by BBC3 ("How dirty can I         get?
", 10 Sept 2007) and Channel 4 ("How toxic are you?
", 11 Oct 2007         and "How toxic are your kids?
", 18 Oct 2007) and by France2 Envoye         Sp&#233;ciale (3 Mar 2005).
* readership values from mediauk.com as of July 2013;     ** statistics from the company's website     Darbre's research is also helping to raise awareness through the       materials produced by government agencies, such as the US Food and Drug       Administration [i, cites 3], as well as charities, such as Cancer Active       [j] and Breast Cancer Fund [k].
Darbre is currently a patron of       CancerActive.
Finally, Darbre's research has also featured in numerous popular books       including Altering Eden: The Feminization of Nature by       award-winning BBC TV science producer D. Cadbury (1999), Choosing to         Heal: Surviving the Breast Cancer System by J. Edwards (2007) and Toxic         Beauty: The Hidden Chemicals in Cosmetics and How They Can Harm Us       by D. Mellowship (2009).
