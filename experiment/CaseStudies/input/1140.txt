     Value of preventing rail fatalities (Projects 1 and 2)     Dr Covey's research at Durham provided robust evidence that a single       value of preventing a fatality (VPF) should be applied across all rail       fatality cases, regardless of whether an accident involves single or       multiple fatalities.
This valuation has been used to inform decisions not       only about investing in specific safety improvements but also in the       deployment of engineering solutions and the operational management of the       railways.
Previous rail policy had used two VPF figures, placing a premium on       incidents with multiple fatalities.
In 2002/3 the VPF for preventing a       single fatality was &#163;1.25million and &#163;3.46million per equivalent fatality       for prevention of multiple fatalities.

The research that Dr Covey conducted contributed to the decision to       abandon the use of a higher value as noted by Deloitte in their 2009       review of value of life estimates for the National Audit Office "Following         the outputs of the research commissioned by the Rail Standards and         Safety Board (Covey et al., 2008) and resulting industry discussion and         agreement, the same fatality value is applied to each fatality prevented         whether the accident relates to a single or multiple-fatality accident"       (1).
The concept of a single VPF figure continues to be fully adopted by the       Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB).
Their latest policy document Taking         Safe Decisions (2009) - recognised as the authoritative guidance on       how the rail industry takes decisions that affect safety - uses a single       VPF for all rail cases (2).
The VPF that is used in cost-benefit analysis is also used in the RSSB's       Safety Risk Model.
This model is used by the rail industry and its       partners to quantify the consequences of hazardous events thereby allowing       them to prioritise their investment in safety and make optimal decisions       about engineering solutions and operational management.
Specific examples of how the VPF derived from Dr Covey's research has       affected decision making include:             A key recommendation following the Ladbroke Grove rail accident in         October 1999 involved the fitting of `burst panels' on new-build trains         to prevent fuel tank rupture.
However a follow-up analysis in November         2008 using Dr Covey's updated VPF research demonstrated the costs far         outweighed the benefits and significantly weakened the case for         upgrades, saving the industry an estimated &#163;3.3 million in unnecessary         costs (3)        Network Rail used the updated VPF figures in a decision to introduce         "another train coming" warning at 63 level crossings in the UK in 2012.
The upgraded audible warnings use a warble and spoken alarm when a         second train is detected, and were installed at crossings on the London         to North East England route (4).
Impacts of air pollution on health (Project 3)     Dr Covey's research directly contributed to the monetary valuation of the       impact of air pollution on health for the first time.
The findings of this       DEFRA-funded project have informed recommendations put forward by the       Interdepartmental Group on Costs and Benefits (IGCB) on the values that       should be assigned to a range of health endpoints when using the impact       pathway approach for valuing changes in air quality (full details of how       the study informed the recommendations can be found in Annex 2 in (5)).
The strong impact of the research on IGCB's recommendations is       illustrated by the following quote "Following the publication of this         report, an expert workshop on the Valuation of Health Benefits of         Reductions in Air Pollution and Use of Values in Appraisal was held in         June 2004.
The recommendations of this workshop informed an IGCB paper         that sought to agree the valuation of health benefits in policy         appraisal.
These recommendations were agreed interdepartmentally and         therefore form the basis of the valuation of health benefits within the         current analysis.
The monetary valuation of health benefits represents a         major development in the IGCB methodology" (5).
The impact pathway approach is the central methodology currently       recommended by DEFRA (6), the Department for Transport (7), and HM       Treasury (8) for appraising proposals that lead to changes in air       pollution.
Supplementary Green Book guidance provided by HM Treasury in       May 2013 notes how the values used to monetise health impacts have been       derived from this DEFRA-funded study (8).
Examples of how the impact pathway approach and monetised values of       health impact have been used include:             Transport for London used the impact pathway approach when developing         a Low Emission Zone, which aims to improve health by reducing exhaust         emissions from heavy-polluting road vehicles.
The values recommended by         IGCB were used to forecast the monetised health benefits of the scheme         (estimated benefit &#163;140m-&#163;210m) (9).
In December 2012 DEFRA awarded &#163;2 million in grants to develop 42         similar low emission zones across England (www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/12/31/2-million-air-pollution/).
The projects were expected to demonstrate value for money and where         possible a quantitative evaluation of the health benefits of the air         quality strategies proposed (10).
