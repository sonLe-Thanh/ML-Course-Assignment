     With shrinkage having a significant economic impact on the profitability       of retailers around the       globe ($232 billion annual losses), a key measure of impact has been the       number of organisations       that have adopted the tools and techniques developed by Beck through his       research to try and       address these losses.
For instance, the New Loss Prevention approach,       including the Loss       Prevention Road Map and Pyramid is now part of the working practices of       the following companies:       Adidas (Global), Ahold (Europe and USA), Best Buy (US), Coles (Australia)       Checkpoint (Global),       Metro (Global), Proctor &amp; Gamble (Global), Sainsbury's (UK), Target       (US), Tesco (UK), Walmart       (UK, US and International) and Woolworths (Australia): http://www.ecr-shrink-group.com/case-studies.
In addition, parts of the De Beers family of companies have begun to adopt       this approach       for the control of diamond losses across their value chains: De Beers       South Africa, NAMDEB       (Namibia), DEBMARINE (Namibia), DEBSWANA (Botswana).
In 2013, Beck worked       with Durex to       help them redesign their packaging to improve the deterrent impact of       security-related symbols and       product protection devices &#8212; the new packaging will be launched in late       2013.
In addition, Beck has organised and presented at a wide range of       practitioner conferences and       workshops around the world to raise awareness of his research and offer       practitioners the       opportunity to gain hands-on experience of using some of the tools he has       developed, including:             Introducing New Loss Prevention: Barcelona, 2009; Dublin, 2010;         Dallas, 2010; Philadelphia,         2010; Orlando, 2011; Leicester, 2011; Luxemberg, 2011; Botswana, 2011         &amp; 2012; Namibia,         2011 &amp; 2012, Johannesburg , 2011 &amp; 2012; Brussels, 2012; London         2012.

He has also presented to senior loss prevention teams within particular       organisations, such as       Walgreens, 2010; Walmart, 2011; Metro, 2012, Adidas, 2012; De Beers       (Global Senior Executive       team), 2011; De Beers South Africa (Senior Executive team), 2011 NAMDEB       (Namibia, Senior       Executive team), 2011; DEBMARINE (Namibia, Senior Executive team), 2011       &amp; 2012;       DEBSWANA (Botswana, Senior Executive team), 2011.
In addition, Beck has been invited to present his work at practitioner       and academic conferences       including, the Retail Leaders Association annual conferences in the US       (2009); the annual Retail       Fraud Conferences in the UK (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 &amp; 2013); the       US Food Marketing       Institute annual conference (2010); the American Society for Industrial       Security (2012) and the       annual ECR Europe conferences (2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 &amp; 2013).
Beck has also produced over 20 reports on this subject, the majority of       which are made freely       available to the practitioner community via the web.

Persuading retail organisations to publish statistics on their levels of       loss is not easy &#8212; it is       considered highly sensitive information and not something they are       generally prepared to make       publicly available.
However, a review undertaken for ECR Europe Shrinkage       Group (an influential       joint trade and industry body which Beck has been the academic advisor to       since 1999) by       academics from Cranfield University estimated that for those organisations       adopting the Loss       Prevention Road Map (9 companies responded to the survey) they estimated       they had saved       &#8364;620,574,000 in one year through using the approaches developed by Beck       (with Chapman and       Peacock) as part of the ECR Europe Shrinkage Group (2010).
More recently (2012), a representative from the Australian retailer       Coles, announced that by using       the approach developed by Beck and the ECR Europe Shrinkage Group, they       had achieved an       annual saving of Aus$100 million, with an expectation that a further       Aus$100 million would be       saved in each of the following two years.
More broadly, in 2010 then       Chairman of Tesco, Sir Terry       Leahy and Co-Chair of ECR Europe, said of the work of the ECR Europe       Shrinkage Group: `in the       hands of consultants this would be worth millions'.
Through working closely with a wide range of companies and representative       bodies, undertaking       extensive dissemination work through producing practitioner publications       and organising and       presenting workshops and seminars, Beck's research findings have been       widely adopted across       the world.
They have made a significant difference to the way in which       organisations not only think       about the problems they face but also how they go about developing more       effective and       sustainable strategies to improve their business performance.
