     Provenance of corroboration     The Leeds MoD group conducted its research on a commercial-in-confidence       basis, funded [5,6] by the MoD (formerly as RARDE, DRA and DERA; now as       the private company QinetiQ).
The Leeds research underpinned the MoD's       ballistic-simulation computational code &#8212; known as "GRIM" &#8212; that was       developed by QinetiQ for its main UK customer, Dstl, both of whom are in       the rare position of being able to provide corroborative evidence of       impact.
QinetiQ's Senior Research Fellow, the current President of the International         Ballistics Society [E], has accordingly provided two supporting       statements, namely: [B] a generic summary of the end-user benefits       accrued, and; [C] a review of specific impacts, in diverse areas, together       with dates.
Both the content of [B,C] and the claims made in this case are       "fully endorsed" [D] by the current Programme Weapons Leader at       Dstl (the main end-user of the GRIM codes underpinned by the Leeds'       research), who states " I have been so impressed by the         capability that it [GRIM] provides to [the] MOD, that I have continued         to fund a number of developments ... the numerical simulation capability         has allowed the MOD to maintain an international credibility in the face         of a changing research focus and financial pressures" [D].
The following list of areas in which GRIM has been applied at both       national and international levels bears testimony to both the reach and       significance of the impact generated by the underpinning Leeds research.
Unless otherwise stated, all claims and quotes in (a)-(b)       and (c)-(f) refer to [B] and [C] respectively.
(a) R &amp; D cost benefits for the MoD     QinetiQ states that the Leeds research was "seminal to the         development of [its] current capability" for several reasons,       including enabling the MoD to focus on a development path that saved the       company "2 years in development work and &#163;1.5m-&#163;2m in costs and         guaranteed a method that was robust and worked."
QinetiQ add that "Leeds         research has continued, up to the present day, to underpin the annual         income (&#163;4m) of the Warheads Technology Group at Fort Halstead".
The Leeds research underpinned the validity of QinetiQ's numerics and       demonstrated the benefits of adaption as an effective approach towards       predictive numerical simulation, as a result of which it enabled QinetiQ       to develop what it describes as an "integrated numerical         simulation-experiment methodology" that it is now deploying "over         a widening number of areas with significant cost savings."
QinetiQ uses the adaptive numerical simulations to "routinely develop         concepts without having to resort to large numbers of experimental         trials with significant cost savings".
As an example, the company       has described how it recently used simulations to develop an explosively       formed projectile verified at one-third-scale using three experiments, so       that only one experiment was needed to validate the full-scale prediction.
QinetiQ asserts: "Previously this would have required up to 10-20         experiments", and; "This has enabled the MoD research programme,         under severe budgetary pressures, to continue to deliver advanced         research output cost effectively."
(b) International recognition for the UK     The Leeds research underpinning QinetiQ's numerical simulations has given       the company a position of international expertise in the field: "In         this regard we now have a world leading capability in our approach,         which is unique to the UK and Europe and generally in the USA," the       company states.
The ability to advise others and share the research has       also given QinetiQ credibility and enabled collaboration on cutting-edge       research with international allies: "By being able to share this         research with our collaborators in the US National Laboratories we were         able to establish the UK as being credible, providing us access to         related US research with significant benefits to the UK."
In more general terms, QinetiQ states: "The Leeds research helped the         UK maintain a leading internationally recognised capability in numerical         research, its ability to write 3rd generation software and its         application in advanced and complex problems of interest to the defence         and security industries."
QinetiQ continues to benefit from the Leeds research as it builds on its       expertise in the area of numerical simulation.
The company states: "We         are currently [2011] developing a new code with a completely different         strength treatment, which would not have been possible without the         underpinning provided by the Leeds research."
[A]     (c) Protecting the lives of the armed forces     The advanced numerics of GRIM, developed with support of the Leeds       research, have been used by QinetiQ to rapidly assess new threats to the       British Armed Forces in Afghanistan and, latterly, Iraq.
Between 2003         and the present day, GRIM has been used extensively in the battle       against improvised explosive devices by allowing Dstl to develop new       countermeasures for deployment on vehicles and body armour, and in the       protection of military bases, all of which has led to a "resultant         reduction in front-line casualties".
QinetiQ further state that "Without         the Leeds work we would not have been able to develop our physically         based material algorithms in a predictive capability         to be able to respond to these urgent operational requirements."
(d) Protecting the public     The simulation system has also found civilian applications.
Between 1995         and the present day, QinetiQ has supported other government agencies       to assess the effects of different threats to transport and       public-building infrastructure, including planning aspects for the 2012       Olympic Games.
"As a result new strategies have been evolved and the         potential of new materials in construction identified", states       QinetiQ.
(e) Increasing productivity in the oil industry     Between 2008 and the present day, QinetiQ has been working with       oil-extraction companies to improve yields from oil wells.
QinetiQ notes       that "In many oil wells only 50% of the available oil is actually         extracted, particularly in wells that exhibit low permeability.
The main         reason is because it is uneconomical and impractical to use standard         perforation technologies, which are based on explosive shaped charges."
QinetiQ has used GRIM and its fundamental understanding of materials to       develop a new perforator that increases the energy imparted to the rock       above that offered by conventional perforator shaped charges; this has       been achieved through the use of materials that react under shock loading.
The higher energy results in significantly larger bore-hole volumes which,       in tests by the company GEODynamics [F], have "increased oil flow by         30-40%".
QinetiQ add that "The fundamental understanding of the         behaviour of these reactive materials under shock loading and         interpretation of experiments was only possible through the use of GRIM.
This significantly shortened the R&amp;D process, by approximately one         half, the time to market and cost of the programme".
Additionally,       QinetiQ "has been able to licence the new perforator design [G],         which is now being extensively used by the industry, throughout the         world, earning royalty fees and benefiting UK oil companies and the         economy".
These royalties comprise a "significant fraction"       of the annual &#163;4m income to QinetiQ's Warhead Technology Group       (see quote in &#167;4a); the exact fraction is commercially sensitive       and has not been disclosed by QinetiQ.
(f) Informing expert witnesses     QinetiQ have used GRIM to inform expert witnesses in several high-profile       inquiries, including the Lockerbie disaster, the Oklahoma bomb and the       fatal Larkhall gas explosion.
Although these predate the REF period,       QinetiQ state that the GRIM study into the first of these "resulted in         the development of appropriate security strategies and the development         of a `bomb proof' liner for the luggage holds of short haul aircraft":       it is reasonable to assert that the impact of these two developments is       both far reaching and, more importantly, has not only continued into the       REF period, but will continue to do so beyond it.
