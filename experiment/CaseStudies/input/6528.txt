     Reach     Plenum was presented on six occasions in Europe and Australia       between 2010 and 2012.
As a site-specific public work, each time it was       projected onto different buildings and surfaces the configuration of the       space created a unique visual experience.
Festival and event curators       confirm that, over the six performances, the installation was experienced       by over 240,000 people; if website visitors are included, this rises to       well over 300,000.
The organisers of the Lux Scientia festivals &#8212; at Toru&#324; (Poland), Tallinn       (Estonia) and Durham &#8212; reported that a total of 240,000 visitors attended       the three festivals, which also generated over 500 press, online and       TV/radio features.
The festivals' combined reach was further extended by       125,980 website visitors and 2,294 views of the Lux Scientia micro-site.
The UK curatorial team, the Artichoke Trust, drew 150,000 visitors to the       Durham Lumiere alone, significantly more than the other two light       festivals combined.
Durham County Council estimated that the Lumiere       generated &#163;4.3 million for the local economy.
Figures are unavailable for the Skyway '10 festival appearance (Poland,       2010), but two other Plenum performances saw audiences of just       over 2,000 each: KickArts Contemporary Arts in Cairns, Australia reported       2,100 visitors over June and July 2012; while the Cambridge Music Festival       (November 2012) attracted an audience of around 2,500 over the two-night       projection onto King's College Chapel.
Again, the work's online presence       extended the audience, with almost 3,300 Youtube views (in aggregate) of       six videos of Plenum posted at various times between early 2011       and July 2013.
Significance     Festival curators have commented on Plenum's significance and its       reception by audiences.
M&#225;rio Caeiro (Toru&#324;), who commissioned the       original 2010 work, described Plenum as `thought provoking and       exciting', noting in particular that it had:     the capacity to manifest most complex facts as proposed by scientific       knowledge through both sensorial and artistic language .
.
.
in a way       which isn't didactic in the worst sense, but truly aesthetic .
.
.
the       work explores the urban form in an idiosyncratic and unexpected way .
.
.
after some minutes, the whole ecosystem of the artwork becomes patent,       [and] it was frequent to see people absolutely fascinated with the       processes.
After the 2012 Cambridge Music Festival, during which King's College       served over two nights as the venue for the light and music projection,       the festival's director said of the installation's visual aspect:     It shows how art can be inspired by science and how science is       fundamentally beautiful, both visually and intellectually.
It makes a       nonsense of the supposed `boundary' between the arts and sciences and it       is important that both artists and scientists work to break this down &#8212;       especially in Cambridge, a city renowned for its culture but also for its       `technology cluster' which is sometimes perceived not to engage with local       people.
This particular performance created press interest from sources as       diverse as Gramophone, technology publication Cabume, the       BBC, and student newspapers Varsity and The Cambridge Student.
The latter reported that `many King's students appeared to enjoy the show,       despite not seeming to know what it was about', and included humorous       impressions alongside more considered observations of the artwork: `One       third year medic described the show as, "impressive, weirdly hypnotic and       seriously atmospheric in the fog" .
.
.
Another third year medic said she       felt she "was going to be abducted if she stared at it too long".'
The installation's Australian curator reacted positively to the work's       seamless blending of visuals and music:     The combination of the sounds and the visual made that I felt I was       WITHIN the work; there were no boundaries between sound, visual and       myself, it was an experience of being entirely "present", all "thought"       becoming "non-thought" .
.
.
I found the work utterly inspiring.
Longevity     Plenum is now migrating from public art to concert-hall       performance, in which the visuals will be projected inside the buildings       rather than onto exteriors.
In this form, it has been booked for three       separate music festival appearances during 2013/14: the Huddersfield       Contemporary Music Festival (November 2013), Frome Festival (July 2014)       and Kings Place Festival, London (January 2014).
This shift demonstrates       that Plenum has succeeded as a customisable piece, capable of       presentation in a wide range of environments and able to reach different       audiences.
