     (citations e.g.
[A] are to corroborative sources in section 5)     The impact arises through an outreach programme delivered by Professor       Brian Foster that       portrays the development and achievements of modern particle physics with       illustration through       music.
The format was first developed in 2005 by Foster with the virtuoso       violinist Jack Liebeck       (Professor at the Royal Academy of Music and Classical Brit Award winner       in 2010) and discusses       the quest to unify the laws of physics as Einstein tried, inevitably       unsuccessfully, to do.
Since       Einstein loved the violin and played it all his life, Foster and Liebeck       use the violin to illustrate the       concepts of modern particle physics and introduce an additional dimension       to a science lecture.
By       appealing to music lovers who might otherwise never attend a science       event, they also attract a       new audience to hear about physics.
The content of the two shows in this programme concentrates on the       answers that accelerators       and experimental particle physics are providing to the big questions of       why the Universe exists,       what are the laws that govern it and why it has evolved as it has.
The       outreach is thus directly       underpinned by research by members of the department: instrumentation and       accelerator       development and experimental work ensure that the most exciting and       topical areas of LHC       analysis are communicated, while the theoretical work on many aspects of       these phenomena       develops the wider context and provides continuity from Einstein's work on       unification of the forces.
The first show, "Superstrings", illustrates Einstein's development of       General Relativity, discusses       why he failed to unify the laws of physics and describes how superstring       theory could succeed       where Einstein failed.
The second, "Einstein's Universe", discusses       Einstein's contribution to       quantum theory and the development of accelerators that led to the LHC.
Both shows describe the       construction of the LHC and its detectors, concentrating on the ATLAS       Semiconductor Tracker       built at Oxford and showing the magnitude and complexity of the assembly       of ATLAS.
They       conclude with the latest LHC results, including work in which Oxford has       played a crucial role [7].
They are interspersed with music that Einstein loved, played by Liebeck;       finally Foster and Liebeck       play a Mozart duet.
The violin is used to illustrate key concepts in the       lectures such as the       relationship between wavelength and resolution and the vibrational modes       of strings; Liebeck not       only plays the violin but has an important role in helping Foster explain       the science.
Some events       in larger venues are followed by a concert featuring music that Einstein       particularly enjoyed.
The       conception and delivery of the "Einstein's Universe" event were supported       by an STFC Large       Award (Science in Society scheme) of &#163;92,521.
Reach     A total audience exceeding 17,000 attended either Einstein's Universe (90       performances) or       Superstrings (26 performances) between January 2008 and July 2013       (inclusive).
More than 8000       of these attendees were at events given for schools.
The events were       hosted in the UK, Spain,       Germany (including twice in German), France, New Zealand (2 tours), the       USA and Japan.
A tour       in New Zealand in July 2013 performed at 10 venues to a total audience of       2,350.
Elizabeth Kerr, a       former Chief Executive of New Zealand's Arts Council, reviewed `Einstein's       Universe' on Radio NZ       Concert (a predominantly classical music channel) as succeeding in getting       "the music people to         the science" [B].
Other comments included, "Clear interesting         lecture graspable by an arts         graduate".
Several YouTube videos are available, two of which were       financed by Institute of       Physics Publishing and are available on their YouTube page with over       15,000 hits between them       [C].
Secondary reach via media coverage is described below.
Significance     Engagement with physics by non-scientific audiences:       Questionnaires indicate 95% audience       satisfaction with the events [D].
In a more detailed survey of a general       audience in Oxford in 2012,       75% of respondents agreed they were likely to discuss physics with someone       else as a result [D].
On Radio NZ Concert, Kerr picked out topics from the event including       superstrings, mini black       holes and the Higgs particle and found it "a very interesting glimpse         into the world of the scientists"       [B].
Increased interest in physics by schoolchildren: Letters       and emails received from teachers       who attended an event [D] have described immediate interest from students:       "[my pupils] came out         buzzing and I had to try and answer some quite complex questions in the         bus on the way home",         "... the students were discussing it all the way back to the school"       and "The lecture provoked much         discussion at our subsequent Physics lessons" [E].
Teachers indicate       that they are keen to host or       attend either lecture again, regarding them as highlights of their wider       programmes of extra-curricular       activity.
One teacher, a winner of an IoP Teacher of Physics award in       2012, wrote,     "There is no doubt that lectures such as yours (and yours was one of         the very         best) raise the profile of the subject and can sow the seeds for         youngsters to         want to go on to further study in that field."
[F].
As part of such programmes, teachers report that they consider the       lectures to have played a       significant part in increasing the numbers of students taking Physics at       A-level and generating a       more positive attitude to science with greater engagement in lessons       [F,G].
Influence on future study and career choices: Foster has       received letters and emails saying       that the lecture has inspired the writers to study physics further, and       these are echoed by teachers       who consider that the events have inspired students to study physics at       university, including by       going beyond the school curriculum.
A Year 10 pupil wrote in 2010, "After         attending your lecture I         understood much that I didn't before... You have inspired me to become a         Particle Physicist."
A       local newspaper article after a performance in New Zealand in 2013 was       headlined simply       "Professor inspires pupils".
More specifically, a UK teacher wrote       that students     "...were further motivated to research science, and particularly         Physics, courses more         widely and we believe they have become much more aware of the         possibilities within         and beyond study at degree level.
They have also gone on to attend a         residential course         at a local university which, previously, they may not have been         motivated to do."
[E]     Benefits to schoolteachers: A teacher in New Zealand       explained on local television that the clips       on YouTube had helped him to decide to take the students to a performance       and that demand from       the students greatly exceeded the number he could take.
His impression of       the event was that "it'll         certainly spark enthusiasm and interest" and that he would like to       use some of the ideas in his own       physics classes [H].
A UK teacher writes that a local performance was "an         opportunity to re-appraise         and re-evaluate how we present Physics in the classroom and outside of         the classroom"       [E], and another that the show "opened a window to widen discussions         with students".
Further reach through media coverage     The wider reach from these performances has been considerable, with       estimated audiences of       millions [I] through broadcasts and articles in both UK and international       media.
For example:            "Einstein's Fiddle", a 15 minute programme for BBC Radio 4 co-written         by Foster, was         broadcast in 2009 and 2010 and remains available on the Radio 4 website.
The performances have been covered in many national and international         newspapers as         well as in the specialist musical press, for example "The Strad" and         "Gramophone" [8].
Extended interviews with Foster on Radio 3's Essential Classics (5         interviews, October         2012), "In Tune" (2/2/2011) (also including Liebeck) and "Private         Passions" (4/5/2008).
UK regional broadcasting including Jack FM, BBC Radio Oxford and BBC         Radio Scotland.
Coverage of the two New Zealand tours in 17 news publications (2013)         and on Radio New         Zealand (2009, 2013) included an interview in which Foster described         present and future         experiments, the Higgs discovery and how physics research has evolved         since Einstein [7].
Evolution and sustainability     Both shows have developed continuously in the light of experience and as       new results emerge       from physics research.
Funding for the programme, typically &#163;500 per       performance to cover       expenses and Liebeck's fees, has come from the STFC, the Nuclear       Institute, La Caixa for a tour       in Spain, Royal Society New Zealand, ticket sales at events other than at       schools and individual       hosts.
The lectures are planned to continue for the foreseeable future in       response to continued       strong interest from potential hosts.
A recent spin-off, "Particle       Partitas", tracing the history of       particle physics, was commissioned from the composer Edward Cowie and       premiered in June       2012.
