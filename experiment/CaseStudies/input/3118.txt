     Product improvements: The research outlined above led       directly to improvements in the       technology underpinning Guidance Microwave Ltd.'s seven active target       products.
The new       technology means that operating range performance is increased by 50%,         from some 600m to         900m; at the same time, production costs have decreased by         around 25%.
As a result shipping       companies now benefit from more reliable, short-range navigation       when berthing large ships, an       improvement that is of particular importance to oil tankers berthing at       oil rigs, often in severe       weather conditions leading to poor visibility.
In addition, port       authorities have greater assurance         that ships will be able to berth quickly and safely.
The new approach to active target design conceived by Brennan and based       on SSB modulated       backscatter, and demonstration of its effectiveness in both reducing the       signal processing burden       and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and operating range, led directly       to the adoption of a new       technique across the entire Guidance Microwave Ltd. product range, as       indicated in the following       extract of a letter (in April 2012) from the Managing Director of Guidance       Microwave Ltd:     "In 2008 we were developing a 24GHz positioning system for use on         land, based on our existing         9GHz positioning system used for local positioning of ships (RadaScan).
We were developing an         Active Target to replace the very large and bulky Van Atta targets for         RadaScan and wished to do         the same for the Portscan system.
We contracted your services to help         with the development of         the system concept and this resulted in the outline design for the         Active Target.
This design has         successfully been patented.
"The Active Target has since been developed for the RadaScan system         and has been a very         successful product for our company.
All of the old Van Atta targets have         been replaced with the         new and much smaller Active Targets.
To date, we have sold approximately         280 Active targets       [700 as of July 2013] with current sales of approximately 25 per         month.
Along with the RadaScan         sensors, this is very good business for our company and we are grateful         your support."
Commercial benefits: The forerunner to this active target     design used multiple antennas and     amplifiers in a Van Atta array configuration in order to achieve     satisfactory operation.
The inherent     9-fold signal strength improvement of the new active target has convinced     Guidance Microwave     Ltd. to drop the Van Atta approach and use a simpler single-channel active     target configuration,     which actually confers improved performance: testing on mini-Radascan     performed by Guidance     Ltd in 2010 indicated a substantial improvement in operating range.
The impact of this adoption of new technology based on Brennan's research       is two-fold: firstly, by       reducing the signal processing burden it allows the cheaper and easier         production of (smaller)       active targets based on a single pair of antennas rather than multiple Van       Atta pairs and, in       particular, it reduces the signal processing and RF demands on the radar       system that interrogates       those targets; secondly, it provides better performance via a         substantially increased operating         range.
The ability to develop better products at a lower cost has       conferred a significant competitive       advantage upon Guidance Microwave Ltd, whose products now outperform those       of their       competitors despite the lower cost of their production.
Such products have       been very successful       for the company, and now 100% of their production has moved to the new         design proposed         by Brennan.
Guidance Microwave Ltd. began to deploy the new active       target in 2009, switching       over its entire product range before the end of 2010.
The fact that       Brennan's design allows for       cheaper and easier production also means that Guidance Microwave Ltd.       profits have been       impacted positively: mini-Radascan is now the most successful Guidance       product in terms of       sales, according to the Managing Director of Guidance Microwave Ltd,       generating sales of more         than &#163;3 million.
In 2010 and 2011 UK and US patent applications       were filed to protect the       technique.
Wider benefits to the shipping industry: The unrivalled       performance and efficient architecture       afforded by this technique has helped Guidance Microwave Ltd to become the       market leaders in       this area.
However, the technology has also benefitted the shipping       industry (which contributed       &#163;12.5bn to UK GDP in 2011) much more broadly &#8212; including major oil       companies &#8212; by providing a       short-range navigation solution with the best possible performance.
Guidance Microwave       Ltd. estimate that around 300 ships and oil rigs currently have the       technology installed.
