National implementation and validation of rapid access chest pain         clinics in hospitals across England and Wales     The rapid access chest pain clinic established and systematically       evaluated by Timmis et al in east London led to a radical change       in health policy when it became the service model for the Cardiovascular       National Service Framework in the early 1990s [7].
The next decade saw a       national roll-out of chest pain clinics which gradually became established       in almost every hospital in England and Wales.
Their prognostic validation       study, which has been cited 68 times (Google Scholar), informed the NICE       Guideline for Stable Angina (CG126) by providing reliable estimates of       angina mortality rates [8].
Rapid access chest pain clinics are now a central component of       cardiovascular healthcare delivery in the UK, and have been endorsed by       the Cardiac Tsar: "Across England, there is now a network of over 160         rapid-access clinics in which 96% of patients are seen within 2         weeks of referral.... Sekhri et al from the east London.... vindicate         the development of the rapid-access model beyond the delivery of         improved waiting times."

4b: Paradigm change in non-invasive investigation of chest pain     The exercise ECG had been the most widely used non-invasive test for       investigation of patients with suspected angina.
Timmis et al's BMJ       2008 study, however, was instrumental in the paradigm change reflected in       the NICE Guideline on Chest Pain of Recent Onset, which recommended that       the exercise ECG should no longer be used for diagnosing angina, there       being a newer generation of more effective diagnostic tests now available       [10].
In the NICE Guideline on Management of Stable Angina that followed       soon afterwards, the study informed further recommendations about use of       prognostic testing in patients with angina [8].
These findings received       extensive press coverage and generated considerable public interest [11].
4c: Restoring equity by gender and ethnicity to diagnosis and         management of angina     By reporting relations between typicality of symptoms and prognosis by       gender and ethnicity, the team's 2008 Canadian Medical Association         Journal paper [6] destroyed the longstanding myth that symptoms are       commonly "atypical" in women and south Asian patients with suspected       angina.
This myth has almost certainly played a damaging role in the       widely reported under-treatment of women and south Asian patients, which       in turn must have contributed to unnecessary morbidity and mortality.
Based on those findings, the 2010 NICE Guideline on Chest Pain of Recent       Onset now states: "Do not define typical and atypical features of         anginal and non-anginal chest pain differently in men and women (or) in         ethnic groups" [10].
The findings have received strong professional endorsement.
For example,       Tony Delamonthe, Deputy Editor of BMJ, said in response to the       team's 2008 BMJ paper: "in some cases, it's reasonable to         conclude, these inequalities kill" [12].

National recognition     Timmis' work in utilising electronic registry data for evaluating chest       pain clinics has resulted in:            2009 &#8212; Short-listed for the BMJ Group Award for Outstanding         Achievement in Evidence-Based Healthcare [13]       2009 &#8212; Chair NICE Guideline group for Investigation of Chest Pain [10]       2011 &#8212; Chair NICE Guideline group for Management of Stable Angina [8]          4e: International spread (examples)     Australia's first public rapid assessment clinic for chest       pain has reduced outpatient waiting times from months to days, the clinic       claims.
Based at MonashHeart, in south-east Melbourne, the clinic opened       in July 2012.
Director, Professor Ian Meredith, said more than 1,500       patients had been treated in the 12 months of its operation.
"There         are certainly instances where lives have unequivocally been saved and         heart attacks have been prevented,'' he said [14].

"Rapid assessment chest pain clinics... have         proven effective in expediting consultation with reduction in hospital         admissions for patients with atypical pain syndromes" [15].
