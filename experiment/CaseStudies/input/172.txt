     The impact is on the very shape and content of television production,       especially on the Series Producer and Director, whose testimony indicates       &#211; Ciardha's significant and growing effect on her TV series, Wolfland.
Without the findings from his research the programme would have taken very       different directions; but he was brought on board at an early point due to       the prior knowledge of his work for the commissioning TV stations.
The       essential narrative, which pinpoints the major landmarks in the       development of the wolf in Irish history, draws centrally on &#211; Ciardha's       work in order to drive the story-line.
The key evidence base was sourced       or verified by him.
&#211; Ciardha also provided the interpretative framework       through which the narrative is to be understood.
Specifically, the       programme was shaped by the following insights from &#211; Ciardha's research:            How Ireland's indigenous inhabitants lived side-by-side with the wolf         and how the country's ultimate predator etched itself into their         history, literature, mythology, nomenclature and psyche.
By the turn of the 16th century the country plunged into         increasing turmoil as English and Scottish settlers began to be planted         on vast swathes of the country.
For these new arrivals, the wolf became         a fearsome symbol of a wild and dangerous land.
How large-scale farming and deforestation saw the wolf lose its         hunting and breeding grounds.
How war, rebellion, massacre, famine and atrocity provided rich         pickings for this opportunist carnivore - preying on livestock and         scavenging on the military fallen.
As fighting escalated between the settlers and the Irish, the savage         wolf, the classic barometer of population pressures in early modern         Europe, became one of an unholy trinity, which included the rebel         Irishman (`Tory') and Catholic priest.
The Crown and         Commonwealth/Cromwellian administration would wage a relentless campaign         to rid Ireland of all three.
The Producer-Director's evidence (letter 22 October 2012) explains how       BBC and RT&#201; `were keen that we [the production company] approached Dr       &#201;amonn &#211; Ciardha for his expertise as a historical consultant for the       project due to his research and publications'.
Once the script was       prepared with his help, &#211; Ciardha was then crucial in `historical fact       checking' and in helping `mould the project into what it became.'
The       impact intensified and changed pitch during the early stages when the       script was being written, re-written and fine-tuned, since `&#211; Ciardha's       clear expertise in the area', as well as his abilities in both Irish and       English, additionally `resulted in him becoming the series narrator for       what will be a flagship historical documentary for both BBC and RT&#201;'       (letter, 22 October 2012, prior to airing).
In addition to shaping the script and presentation of the documentary       series, there is evidence of the reach of the impact.
The documentaries       were shown during prime-time TV slots (7.30pm and 9.00pm).
The viewing       figures for Northern Ireland for the two episodes were over 30,000 (BBC       Programme 1: 18,000; BBC Programme 2: 13,000), a significant proportion of       the Irish-speaking population of the region (which does not include       viewers from the Republic of Ireland).
Over 200,000 viewers tuned into the       two episodes in the Republic of Ireland (RTE Programme 1: 219,000 or       13.36%; RTE Programme 2: 208,000 or 12.75%) - a figure which represents       over 25% of the Irish-speaking population.
The Wolfland series was also the subject of a BBC Ulster, Irish-language       documentary, as well as receiving positive reviews in national and local       newspapers.
