     Following the research conducted at Bristol, the University spin-out       company Advanced Transport Systems Ltd was set up in 1995.
This company       (now called Ultra global PRT) designed and, since it opened in 2011, runs       the world's first fully operational PRT system at Heathrow Terminal 5.
The papers and conference presentations relating to this work inspired a       worldwide interest in potential applications of the system and led to       Advanced Transport Systems Ltd winning the DETR Innovative Transport       competition (contract value &#163;2.7M) in 2000, ahead of 15 other entrants,       including some major international companies.
This allowed a complete       prototype system, including vehicles, infrastructure and controls, to be       designed, built and tested over the period 2000-2003.
In addition, a grant       from NESTA supported the commercial development of the ideas.
Testing of this system, several elements of which were supported by       further University of Bristol research under EC and other contracts, gave       highly satisfactory results.
Transport decisions for cities have very long       timescales.
It was found that the ideas could provide immediate benefit in       airports [6].
This led to a decision by BAA to install ULTra at Heathrow       Airport to meet its transport connectivity demands.

The Heathrow pods, the first fully       operational PRT system, opened to the public in April 2011.
Heathrow pods 	         The Heathrow pods have received an extraordinarily positive response from       passengers and have attracted intense media interest around the world.
In       2011, John Holland Kaye, Commercial Director at BAA, stated:     "We've been listening carefully to our passengers as part of our plan         to make every journey better at Heathrow.
Passenger feedback has been         amazing and positive Twitter comments abound.
We love watching people's         reactions when they see the pods for the first time and then again when         they step off just five minutes later at their destination.
"The Heathrow pods offer a personal, comfortable and reliable ride         that is free of emissions.
That's why our excitement for this pioneering         British technology is being shared by town planners, architects, other         airports, business parks, campuses, retail and residential destinations         from the US, Europe, India, Mexico and the UK, who believe that this         system could revolutionise transport in urban environments" [b].
In addition, the system marks a significant advance in environmentally       friendly transport.
In a press release of 20 September 2011, BAA reported       that the Heathrow pods were expected to eliminate 50,000 bus journeys a       year (with over 100,000 passengers using the Pods since the service       started five months earlier) and that the pods use 50% less energy to       power than a bus [c].
Fraser Brown, Managing Director of Ultra global PRT,       said:     "We're very excited about the benefits that the Heathrow pod can offer         Heathrow's passengers.
Its service is predictable, reduces waiting time         and offers reduced journey times; it's also an environmentally         sustainable form of transport that ensures reduced emissions.
"There's an enormous sense of pride for all the staff who were         involved in turning this science fiction dream into a reality at         Heathrow and demonstrating the best of British innovation" [c].
More recently, following two years of full passenger operations the pods       had completed 1,007,000 miles of fully driverless operations [a].
The       system is already demonstrating extremely high reliability.
Availability       at 99.5% is higher than all of the long-standing traditional forms of       transport operating at Heathrow [a].
The Heathrow pod has the       highest satisfaction rating of any passenger service at Terminal 5, which       itself is rated as the best in the world (Skytrax world airport awards       2012 [d]).
The success of the system has led to Heathrow announcing its       plan to extend it to Terminals 2 and 3 [e].
In December 2012, the Rt Hon Alan Duncan MP, Minister of State for       International Development, said after riding a pod at Terminal 5, that "...this         is British engineering, design and execution at its best.
This is a         revolutionary, environmentally friendly transport system that's easy and         cost effective to install, pollution free and extremely fun to use.
It         highlights the UK's and Ultra global's ability in designing a world         first and world beating new form of transport, moving large numbers of         travellers, to exactly where and when they want to go.
This is exactly         the sort of innovative system that I'll be promoting on my forthcoming         Far East Trade Mission" [f].
Ultra global PRT has worldwide interest in applications of the system.
It       has been selected for a major urban transport project in Amritsar, India,       to convey pilgrims to the Sikh Golden Temple.
The system is designed to       take 35% of the daily visitors (or 100,000 passengers) to the Golden       Temple from bus and railway stations along a 4.8-mile elevated guideway       [g].
Other evidence of the success of the research includes numerous awards       won by the company.
These include:            The Worship Company of Carmen's Viva Award for Transport Innovation         (2009).
Previous winners include the Channel Tunnel, Toyota Prius and         McLaren Mercedes [h].
London Transport Awards, 2012, winner of Most Innovative Transport         Project [i].
Global AirRail Awards, 2012, winner of Innovation of the Year [j].
In addition, in 2009 the pod was selected by the Science Museum as the       equivalent of Stephenson's Rocket for the 21st century and in       2011 the ULTra prototype vehicle was taken by the Science Museum for the       UK national collection, to be retained "forever" for examination by       students, historians and interested parties [k].
The success of the ULTra system directly relates to the careful systems       engineering research done during the early stages of the project,       summarised in the published papers shown in section 2.
The company       continues to work with the University, supporting three researchers in       recent years.
