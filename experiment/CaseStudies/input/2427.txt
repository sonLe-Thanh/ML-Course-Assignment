     (i) Impact on policy     All three studies have had a direct influence on government policy.
Shared time/shared care: A key policy question has been whether to       amend the Children Act 1989 to include a statutory presumption of shared       time following parental separation.
Trinder was a key player in this       debate, making oral and written submissions to national-level policy       reviews based on her 2010 research.
Evidence of Trinder's impact on the       policy process starts with the Interim Report1,9 of the Family       Justice Review (FJR) a committee of inquiry set up by government.
The       Review recommended against a "substantially shared or equal time"       presumption, citing Trinder's CFLQ findings that the cooperation required       to make shared contact work in high conflict families could not be created       by statute "Trinder suggests that research indicates early or         pre-existing parent or family characteristics predict subsequent         pathways and outcomes.
[footnote to Trinder 2010a] Co-operative parents         tend to develop flexible shared care arrangements with positive         outcomes.
High conflict parents tend to develop rigid arrangements,         often through litigation, that are associated with poorer child         adjustment and lower levels of child satisfaction.
It appears that if         parents share parental care fully before separation, they are more         likely to do so successfully after separation.
The panel sees           that there are limits as to what legislation can achieve if         this approach to parenting is not taken prior to separation."
(at       para 5.73, emphasis added).
The Final Report2 of the FJR       reiterated the recommendation against a time-based presumption.
Trinder's CFLQ findings were summarised and directly cited again at para       4.19 alongside a verbatim excerpt from Trinder's written submission at       para 4.24.
Under pressure from fathers groups, the Government rejected the       FJR's recommendation against a new presumption.
However, whilst the       Government is still planning to introduce a presumption about continuing       parental "involvement", it accepted the arguments set out in the FJR       against a time-based presumption.
The influence of Trinder's work in       bringing to the attention of policy-makers the relevance of the Australian       experience and the importance of quality rather than quantity is evident       in para 62 of the Government's response to the FJR3 "The         Government is mindful of the lessons which must be learnt from the         Australian experience of legislating in this area, which were         highlighted by the Review and led them to urge caution.
We will         therefore consider very carefully how legislation can be framed to avoid         the pitfalls of the Australian experience, in particular that a         meaningful relationship is not about equal division of time, but the         quality of parenting received by the child".
PIPs: Trinder's evaluation study of PIPs has been highly       influential in shaping government policy on the availability and       content of these programmes.
The eight main recommendations of Trinder's       2011 study, including the need for voluntary self-referral, more effective       and systematic screening; clearer aims and more focus on skills       development and the need for a suite of programmes, were reproduced       verbatim in the Final Report2 of the FJR in November 2011       (paras 4.87-4.90).
The FJR report noted that the recommendations were       being considered by government (at para 4.88), but also added its own       strong endorsement "These recommendations warrant careful consideration         by government" at para 4.89.
The Government's Response3       to the FJR in February 2012 accepted all the Trinder/FJR recommendations       on PIP, quoting Trinder's evaluation as evidence for the use of PIP as a       pre-court or alternative to court option "Evaluation evidence suggests         that the programme enables parents to better understand and discuss the         issues they have; and that PIPs work best when parents participate early         in the dispute resolution process (rather than when proceedings have         progressed further in the courts).
PIPs are not currently available to         parents until their dispute reaches the court stage.
The Government will         consider how to make such programmes available to parents as part of         pre-court dispute resolution processes" (at p74).
The government       also accepted the FJR recommendation that judges should continue to be       able to refer parties to PIP, again quoting the Trinder evaluation in       support "The Government accepts this recommendation.
Research has shown         the Parenting Information Programmes have been valuable to parties to a         court case at all stages of their dispute and the Government agrees that         judges should retain the power to order parents to attend these courses         where the judge feels that it is appropriate" (at p74).
As a result       of these recommendations there have been a number of further developments:       (a) the PIP programme is now being made available to parents on a       self-referral basis rather than being restricted to litigants10;       (b) the number of court referrals to PIP has risen.
The 2011/12 Cafcass       Annual Report at p19 (http://bit.ly/1b1tlOu)       reports that 18,279 adults attended PIP in 2011-12 compared to 13,000 in       2010-11.
The cost was &#163;2.83 million; (c) Trinder's recommendations also       led to the development in four pilot areas of an expanded PIP known as PIP       Plus incorporating the 2011 evaluation recommendations for a more       behaviourally-informed programme and better integration between education       programme, mediation and court.
Trinder was commissioned by DfE to       evaluate the new programme with funding of &#163;99,000 for 2012/13.
Enforcement: Trinder's research has been instrumental in         diverting the government from introducing further punitive sanctions       and towards exploration of an enforcement-specific parent education       programme.
Trinder held two telephone briefings about the emerging       findings with the responsible MoJ civil servants4 between       November and February 2012.
Trinder emphasised that few cases appeared to       be classic implacably hostile parents requiring punitive sanctions, rather       courts needed more educational/therapeutic options to address conflict.
In       February 2013 the government dropped its proposal for further sanctions.5       On 13th April Trinder submitted an interim written briefing       paper to MoJ, at their request, based on analysis of nearly half the       target sample of cases.
The paper reiterated the findings on case type and       the need for educational/therapeutic rather than punitive interventions.
The briefing was cited as support for the government's new policy       direction by the Children's Minister during the House of Commons Committee       stage of the Children and Families Bill on 14th April "the         Government's decision not to introduce further new sanctions is         consistent with their interim findings on the enforcement work they have         researched.
They also conclude that the Government's proposal to develop         an enforcement-specific case assessment and intervention pathway is a         positive step forward.... they demonstrate that we have taken a mature         approach to resolving the problem of enforcement.
"6 MoJ       and Cafcass are now discussing an enforcement-specific parenting programme       or `e-PIP' as a direct response to Trinder's recommendations.4, 10     (ii) Impact on public debate     Trinder has been a leading figure in the national debate on the       shared care issue, arguing against amending the Children Act 1989.
In       February 2012, The Guardian published an article by Trinder       critical of the government's decision to reject the FJR's recommendation       for no new presumption (http://bit.ly/1b1cwDr);       the article generated 464 comments on The Guardian website.
Trinder debated the issue with the Children's Minister, Tim Loughton, on       Radio 4's Today programme on 13th June 2012 (http://bbc.in/1iIu7T1),       was guest contributor on Radio 5 Live's Your Call on the same day       and was quoted at length on the BBC website (http://bbc.in/1iIuixN).
(iii) Informing professional decision-making     Trinder has been an invited speaker at a series of meetings and       presentations involving researchers, policy-makers and practitioners.
She       was invited to present her research on shared care drawing on the 2010       CFLQ paper at the Judicial College on eight separate occasions between       November 2010 and February 2012 to audiences of 20-30 District and Circuit       judges each time.
The course evaluations included comments such as "Very         thought-provoking about effects of shared residence in practice.
Good         opportunity for discussion".
In February 2012 the Course Director       HHJ Sally Williams specifically directed family judges to Trinder's       presentation (uploaded on the Judicial College website) in an Editorial in       the Judicial College Family E-letter7.
The purpose of the       E-letter is to "alert family judges, both full-time and part-time, to       those cases and pieces of legislation that are relevant to everyday       practice and likely to affect what they do in court".
The E-letter is sent       to all family judges in England and Wales.
Trinder also presented her research on PIPs to the Judicial College on       two occasions, again to groups of 20-30 District and Circuit Judges.
Her       widely distributed briefing on enforcement (Trinder 2013) generated an       unsolicited email from a leading High Court Judge who commented that "It       is extremely interesting and immensely useful".8
