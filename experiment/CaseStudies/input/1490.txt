     Building on the two-way pathways to impact, Ruhs' team regularly works in       a co-productive manner with various external partners, and as such their       research has had significant influence on government policymaking and       debates relating to migration in the UK, US, and the Netherlands, as well       as for various UN agencies dealing with migration issues.
UK policy     Through Ruhs' team's collaborative work with the UK's Migration         Advisory Committee (MAC), the research on labour immigration and       public policy has directly informed and heavily impacted on the MAC's work       in drawing up a list of "shortage occupations" (where employers get easier       access to migrant workers), which helps regulate labour immigration from       outside the EU within "Tier 2" of the UK's points-based system for       immigration.
To include a job on this list, the MAC needs to agree that       the job is skilled, that there is a labour shortage and       that it is `sensible' to respond to the shortage with labour       immigration.
The research for Who needs migrant workers?
[R1]       (initially commissioned by the MAC, thereby involving them in the       co-productive research process) has developed the framework for addressing       the `sensible' question in all MAC analysis since 2008 [Section         5: C1, C2].
All the shortage occupation lists recommended by the MAC       since 2008 have been accepted by the Government, so there has been a       direct and clear policy impact of the research (via the analysis and       policy recommendations of the MAC).
According to David Metcalf, Chair of       the MAC: "Successive governments have accepted all six shortage occupation       lists produced by the MAC.
This is in large part down to the initial input       via the Ruhs' research."
[C1]     The insight that the UK's growing reliance on migrant workers is closely       related to a wide range of public policies that have encouraged employers       to recruit migrants over British workers [R1; C11], has had an       important impact on the development of a new approach to immigration by       the Labour Party [C3].
Ed Miliband's first major speech on       immigration [C4], given in June 2012, drew directly from the       research.
After a 45 minute discussion of the book with Ruhs in a private       meeting in early June 2012, Miliband argued in his speech a few days later       that there was a need for "a new approach to immigration based on building       a different kind of economy."
Miliband's Special Advisor commented: `Mr       Miliband's speech subsequently drew directly on the analysis in that book       and Mr Miliband has continued to make arguments that build from those       central insights i.e.
that in order to reduce low skilled immigration we       need to build a different type of economy, with better training,       enforcement of labour standards and more effective regulation of       recruitment agencies, including his last two conference speeches [...] In       a world in which the divide between academia and policy can often be very       wide, Martin is one of those whose work bridges the gap.'

The research on employer demand for migrant labour also impacted on media         and public policy debates in the UK.
Ruhs and Anderson produced a       policy primer based on the book [C11], and published on the       publicly accessible website of Oxford University's Migration Observatory       (over 3,000 unique hits since mid 2011).
The primer was cited in the       Financial Times and discussed in an interview with Mark Easton on the BBC       6:00 p.m. primetime news.
Ruhs and Anderson also published an opinion       piece in the print version of the Guardian.
Policy beyond the UK:     Outside the UK, the research has had considerable impact on debates         and legislation on immigration reform in the US [C5, C6].
Who         Needs Migrant Workers?
[R1] was launched at the Economic       Policy Institute, a major think-tank linked to trade unions, in Washington       DC in late 2010.
Martin and Ruhs drew on the book for an article on the       role of independent commissions in US immigration reform [R3]       which was discussed in meetings with officials at the Department of Labor,       the Department for Homeland Security, and with staffers working for the       Senate Judiciary Committee.
In early 2013, Ruhs and Martin's research on       independent commissions in labour immigration policy [R3] was       discussed at a hearing on comprehensive immigration reform by the Senate       Judiciary Committee, and in an op-ed in the Financial Times [C10].
In April 2013, a group of eight Senators published a major bipartisan bill       for comprehensive immigration reform [C6].
The bill proposes the       establishment of a "Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research" which       recommends the annual quota for a new work visa programme (W-Visa), and       identifies shortage occupations based on analysis of the issues discussed       in the research [R3].
The bill passed the Senate in May 2013, and       Congress is expected to vote on it in the autumn of 2013.
If it passes, it       will lead to the biggest reform of US immigration policy since the 1980s.
Ray Marshall, U.S. Secretary of Labor, 1977-1981, has played a central       role in policy debates about new immigration legislation in the US.
He       says that the research [R1] has "helped us enormously in gaining       broad political support for the Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market       Research that was included in the US Senate's 2013 comprehensive       immigration reform bill.
The Senate version needs revision to make it more       independent, but Martin's work will help us with these refinements."
[C5]     The research has also informed key individuals working on labour and         immigration across Europe.
In the Netherlands, a summary of [R1]       was translated into Dutch for a book chapter published by the Dutch       Scientific Council for Government Policy [C7] and discussed with       the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment who used the research,       especially Ruhs' insight that immigration is linked to a wide range of       public policies, to formulate the official Dutch cabinet's view on         labour migration [C7].
According to a senior member of the       scientific staff of the Scientific Council for Government Policy, "the       impact of Ruhs' work has been substantial [...] the Council used Ruhs'       contribution, based on the Who need migrant workers book [R1],       to draft a number of policy recommendations concerning the future of       labour migration in the European Union [...] in our opinion, Ruhs       convincingly argues that labour migration should be regarded in the wider       context of labour market policies and the structure of the Dutch labour       market."
[C7]     The research for The Price of Rights book [R2], which       analysed the tension between openness to admitting migrant workers and       migrant rights after admission, had a major impact on policy debates at       various UN agencies and international organisations, including the       International Labour Organisation, the United Nations High Commissioner       for Human Rights, the United Nations Development Programme, and the       International Organisation for Migration (IOM) [C8].
Specifically       at the IOM, the Director of Policy Research stated that: "Ruhs' research       [...] has encouraged more explicit debate among international agencies       about the potential tensions between access and rights in labour       immigration policy, and about the pros and cons of a core rights approach       to the global protection of migrant workers".
[C8]     Ruhs presented the research at all these agencies and held a series of       discussions with officials during 2009-13.
The UNDP's Human         Development Report 2009 was dedicated to migration, and included an       extensive discussion of the idea of a trade-off between openness and       rights in labour immigration policy.
The research [R2] also       informed the European Development Report 2013 for which Ruhs wrote       a background paper discussing the role of migration and migrant rights in       the post-MDG (Millennium Development Goals) international development       agenda.
