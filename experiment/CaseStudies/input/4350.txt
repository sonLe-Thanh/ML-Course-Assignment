     Groundwater directly supplies around 30% of the UK's water demand, and       significantly more through discharges to rivers.
Much effort is expended       by regulators and water companies in protecting this essential resource       from over-exploitation and pollution, thus protecting both water resources       and ecosystem support.
The University's research findings and related       expertise have made it possible for the Environment Agency, water       companies and their consultants to generate appropriately justified       management / development strategies for the Birmingham and Liverpool /       Manchester aquifer systems.
Neither the necessary data nor the theoretical       understanding would have been available without this research.
This work has: economic impact &#8212; without it, much more       conservative and hence costly strategies would have been implemented; public         policy impact &#8212; the management strategies developed protect the       public's access to water, especially in times of drought and changing       climatic patterns; and environmental impact &#8212; the strategies       developed also protect ecosystem services.
Birmingham Resilience Projects: Public Water Supply.
In 2009/10,       Severn Trent Water (STW) and their water engineering specialist consultant       MWH, in the absence of in-house computer models costing &gt;&#163;0.1M to       build, commissioned the UoB researchers to develop further and use their       Birmingham aquifer model to underpin STW's Birmingham Resilience Strategy       for development of public water supplies [s1].
This strategy is a key       aspect of their Aquifer Management Plan 5 (2009-15) for capital investment       and is a significant aspect of their 2015-20 Plan.
Three projects in the       STW plans to which the UoB research materially contributed, the additional       supply involved, and the specific UoB contribution are summarised in Table       1.
The cost of developing 1 Ml/day of public groundwater supply is ~&#163;1-3M,       valuing these three projects at a total of &#163;30-90M [s2, s3].
The significance of the UoB contribution to these three initiatives has       been confirmed in writing to the University by MWH, who have said: "The         University has had input into all of the above schemes [Resilience       Projects] with the University groundwater model, and more than 15 peer         review and MSc thesis publications being used throughout the feasibility         assessments".
For instance, as regards the new supply well in       Edgbaston, MWH said "The capture zones and their sensitivity simulated         by the University were then directly used by MWH to quantify risks of         contamination, shortfalls in water volume (achieving 10 Ml/d) and         adverse impacts of abstraction in determining the preferred site of the         new Edgbaston abstraction."
[s1].
The UoB's 2010 modelling report       was an appendix to MWH's `Edgbaston Boreholes Feasibility Report' to STW       [s3].
This was directly used in support of STW's application to the EA to       drill, test pump and license the Edgbaston well.

Re-licensing of a conjunctive use scheme to allow emergency             supply direct to Birmingham           10 Ml/d           UoB-determined capture zones were used to quantify             risk                             2.
Development of artificial recharge boreholes           10 Ml/d           Hydrogeology research (with STW, MWH) on arsenic occurrence, a key             scheme concern                             3.
Development of a new supply well in Edgbaston           10 Ml/d           Numerical modelling of capture zones for 3 alternative sites for             the Edgbaston well to determine interception of historical             contamination and derogation of other licensed wells and water             sensitive receptor [s2].
UoB's modelling and research was also used in various other MWH       Birmingham aquifer reports (2011-13) used to prepare the Sites' Drinking       Water Safety Plans for submission to the Drinking Water Inspectorate.
MWH       conclude that "The University's direct numerical modelling involvement         was hence a pivotal contribution to developing the Edgbaston supply that         will enhance the resilience of supply to Birmingham giving much needed         flexibility."

Birmingham Resilience Projects: Solvent Constraints.
Persistent       chlorinated solvent contamination may constrain public water supply       development from parts of the Birmingham aquifer {4}.
[s1] "MWH have         used the solvents data from Rivett's publications in all of the       [Resilience project] feasibility studies undertaken.
...
The         provision of this information supported ... the assessment of solvent         contamination risks ... to the three possible Edgbaston supply         site options and significantly assisted in the prioritisation of the         abstraction site selection process.
...
The ability to select         areas of the Birmingham Aquifer with the lowest risk of contamination         from historical land use records, and support that assessment with data         from local abstractions (both historical and recent) has been critical         in determining that some areas of the Birmingham aquifer will be viable         for supply with marginal treatment".
STW state that [s3]       "The historic and recent data provided by Rivett is nowadays cost         prohibitive to obtain", but confirm that "choosing the best         design/location for a supply well is of paramount importance as a poor         location may result in expensive and unforeseen water treatment costs...       or even well closure".
Agency resource management: new Birmingham model development.
UoB       collaboration with the EA to confirm the regional aquifer flow regime {4}       is recognised by the Agency to be important to them in [s4] "assessing         new licence applications, understanding of SSSI impacts, ... other         environmental risks, eg insufficient groundwater baseflows to rivers,         groundwater flooding of infrastructure as well as providing vital recent         calibration data to our ongoing 2012-13 regional aquifer model         construction.".
The latter illustrates a particularly significant       impact of the UoB research.
The new aquifer model facilitates the EA's       strategic water resource decision-making: in particular to deliver EU       Water Framework Directive requirements, to inform aquifer management       planning (&#163;400M/y) and to progress the EA's Restoring Sustainable       Abstraction Project [s4].
The EA commissioned the groundwater consultants ESI in 2012-13 to build a       new Birmingham aquifer model (~&#163;100k) with Rivett (UoB) retained as       external peer reviewer [s4].
The EA project manager notes [s4] "Dr         Rivett's contribution in relation to the understanding of urban recharge         processes, urban runoff removal, the geological framework and         interpretation and application of geochemical and information (sic)         has resulted in greater conceptual clarity.
In this role his input has         been invaluable".
He notes [s4], citing 10 key UoB papers since       1994: "The model construction has been heavily underpinned by research         work that the University has undertaken", indicating that the ESI       Conceptual Model Report (2013) to the EA is "dominated by citation of         the UoB research", particularly remarking on the use of "groundwater         quality and recharge estimations" in developing the conceptual model       and updating the numerical model of the aquifer.
The EA found UoB's model for Birmingham to be "an invaluable benchmark         to the new model development" and add "without the much improved         conceptual understanding of aquifer behaviour derived from this         background work, successful development of the new numerical model would         not have been possible."
[s4].
ESI endorsed this and said that without the historical data from the       University's research "the precision of the model would have been         compromised, significantly reducing the confidence with which it could         be used as a water management tool" [s2].
As the EA state [s4], the "modelling process has quantified water         resource availability, and has been used as the basis to update the         catchment abstraction management strategy for the aquifer."
These       are core to future aquifer safeguarding.
Liverpool/Manchester aquifer: During the 2008-2013 period,       the EA undertook a major review of the regional management of the       Liverpool / Manchester aquifer.
This aquifer has faced issues similar to       Birmingham: it also faces threats from estuary water intrusion into the       aquifer and brine movement, both induced by abstraction.
From before the       early 1990s, the aquifer was used extensively for research by the       Birmingham team (including 25 publications from 1993 onwards, e.g.
{5 -       6}) in close collaboration with the EA (e.g.
{6}), and this research       contributed significantly to the understanding of the flow and contaminant       movement in the region [s6, s7, s8].
Consultants ESI undertook the scoping study for the EA's regional review.
The University's previous groundwater models of the Liverpool / Manchester       aquifer were an important factor in ESI's recommendation that a major       groundwater modelling project should proceed, therefore supporting       investment of some &#163;200K of EA capital [s7].
Accordingly, the EA       commissioned a new groundwater flow model, to include testing against more       recent water level data and to take into account advances in understanding       resulting from intervening research work [s6].
ESI was again appointed,       with a steering group of staff from the EA, ESI, United Utilities Water       (UUW), and UoB.
In developing the model, "The research by Birmingham         University provided vital information and conceptual understanding of         how the aquifer behaves" [s7] [s5, 6, 8, 9]: the regional water       company, UUW, state that "The University of Birmingham's research has         been both substantial and vital to the development of the model, and         therefore ultimately to the protection of the groundwater resource.
An         indication of this is that over 30 University of Birmingham publications         have been cited in the final report for Phase 1 of the project alone"       [s8].
"[T]hese models were used to develop abstraction management         procedures for the aquifer ... to ensure compliance with the Water         Framework Directive as well as informing the [EA's] response to a wide         range of land use activities that have the potential to cause aquifer         [and thereby surface water] contamination" [s7].
For example, the       modelling work enabled policies to be changed to allow further abstraction       in the coastal part of the aquifer [s9, citing 16 publications, 8 from       UoB] and in a heavily industrialized part of Manchester [s6].
Modelling is also is vital for UUW planning: "Long-term security of         supplies is essential, and we rely on numerical modelling of our         groundwater resources to plan developments and support the management of         the resource.
In the case of the Liverpool / Manchester sandstones, we         have been involved actively in developing the current (2009) model on         which the [EA] bases its abstraction licensing policy.
This model is         heavily dependent on the work of the [UoB] [which] has been of         considerable value to United Utilities Water" [s8].
For more       specific studies, the model has also been used by ESI on behalf of UUW to       investigate likely climate change impacts and to "assist the         development of three new boreholes drilled in 2012/13" [s8].
Value Estimates: The annual value of the current public       abstractions in the Liverpool / Manchester aquifer, based on UUW tariffs       and including probable leakages, is approximately &#163;120M/year [s6].
ESI       estimate the replacement value of the resource to be between &#163;0.3 and       &#163;0.9bn [s7].
Using a similar basis, with potential Birmingham aquifer       resource data from [s2], the combined replacement value for the two       aquifers lies between &#163;0.4 and &#163;1.1 billion, with an annual value of       approximately &#163;140M.
