     The research has given rise to significant economic and environmental       impact, benefiting a significant percentage of the major (so-called "Tier       1") banks, the software industry that supports the banks, and reducing       significantly the energy consumption per Monte Carlo simulation performed       by financial institutions.
From research to impact     The largest investment banks in London each have thousands of servers       largely devoted to Monte Carlo simulations, and to quantify their risks       (the amount of money they could potentially lose due to uncertain and       unpredictable events) and satisfy regulatory demands they need to be able       to calculate huge numbers of sensitivities efficiently.
The "Smoking       adjoints" paper [2] was recognised immediately as a significant advance on       the state-of-the-art.
In January 2007 the paper was voted by the finance       industry readers of RISK as the best paper of 2006, with Mike       Giles and Paul Glasserman being jointly named "Quant of the Year" by the       magazine [A].
Quant of the Year is "the award practical quants most care       about", according to Laurie Carver of RISK magazine who leads the       survey of "authors, referees and other industry and academic quants" to       decide the winner each year.
This indicates the broad importance of this       work to the finance industry, as does the fact that Giles has been asked       to give a one-day course on "Adjoint Methods for Option Pricing" at Global       Derivatives Trading and Risk Management 2013, the leading international       conference for the industry.
Nature and extent of the impact     One bank, Credit Suisse, was very quick to adopt the approach and       published two papers on the subject.
One in RISK in 2011 entitled `Real       Time Counterparty Credit Risk Management in Monte Carlo' [B] builds on the       work of [2-6] and states "Adjoint algorithmic differentiation can be         used to implement efficiently the calculation of counterparty credit         risk.
We demonstrate how this powerful technique can be used to reduce         the computational cost by hundreds of times, thus opening the way         to real time risk management in Monte Carlo."
In 2008, Credit Suisse       filed a US patent application (pending) [C] "to protect our use of it"       and informed us that the adjoint technique is "very well appreciated         within the company because of its benefits to better risk management and         enhanced profitability through improved hedging" and a Director at       Credit Suisse Group states that [D] the impact is far reaching as "it's         clear that many banks are now using the methodology".
Support for       the broad impact of the "Smoking adjoints" paper [2] comes from the       Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG, http://www.nag.co.uk/),       a company which develops mathematical libraries and other software.
The       Vice-President of Sales at NAG talks extensively to the banks.
His       supporting letter [E] states that "possibly 20% of the Tier 1 banks are         using adjoints on a daily basis as part of their routine option pricing         processes, and most of the others have tested and are developing the         technology".
He further comments [E] that leading quants have stated       that "because of regulatory and internal risk management concerns, many         more Greeks are being required for a wide range of other pricing         applications as well, and this is driving the growth in the use of         adjoints, to minimise the computational costs of generating all of these".
NAG currently provide consultancy services to banks to help them generate       adjoint codes, and in response to requests from banks have also developed       adjoint versions of some of their key mathematical library routines using       their DCO software which was released in 2010.
The Vice-President of Sales       at NAG states [E] "We see this as a growth area for us and we plan         further investment next year."
Ingo Schneider, the head of financial engineering at Dekabank, wrote a       paper in RISK in 2009 with two academic collaborators on "Fast       Monte Carlo Bermudan Greeks" [F].
The abstract of the paper describes it       as extending "the pioneering work of Giles &amp; Glasserman (2006)".
The method was described in RISK's regular technical section [G]       and commented upon by an anonymous credit derivatives trader at a European       bank: "It means you can do far more simulations, for far more risk         parameters, with far less computational cost.
If you want to do it in         real time &#8212; and with the speed news travels now there's really no other         option &#8212; there's not really another way to do it."
Credit Suisse confirm that when used in credit valuation adjustment       (CVA), for example, the saving in computing costs is considerable.
"We're         talking orders of magnitude ... Something that would have taken hours or         overnight by bumping can be calculated hundreds of times quicker, and         you can manage the CVA intra-day, in real time."
[H].
As indicated by Credit Suisse, the computational benefits of the adjoint       approach can be very substantial.
For Correlation Greeks, and Greeks for       Fixed Income products which depend on a large set of future interest       rates, the savings can be up to a factor of 100 compared with the old       approach (known as `bumping') of simply perturbing each input parameter       individually and re-simulating to find the consequential change in the       value.
In practical terms, this means that banks can either reduce their       computing costs and energy consumption, or increase the number of       simulations they can afford to perform.
The scale of the calculations by the banking sector is indicated by the       table below which highlights 8 of the world's top 500 supercomputers [I]       that are in the UK and are likely to be performing financial Monte Carlo       simulations.

Note also that the computing facilities       of many banks are probably not included in this list.
The information is       provided by the IT vendors (banks are very secretive about their computing       facilities).
An indication of the power consumption of financial data centres is given       by a 2008 Guardian article (http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/may/29/energy.olympics2012)       on the negative impact that the Olympics would have on power provision for       the banks based in Canary Wharf.
What happened subsequently is that major       banks built new data centres around the M25 where power was available, or       used new data centres set up by IT providers.
This indicates the       computational power of the major financial institutions, and it is thought       that over half of this power is devoted to Monte Carlo simulations.
Given       that the costs of renting supercomputer time is upwards of thousands of       dollars per hour [J], in this context, even a factor 2 reduction in the       cost of computing Monte Carlo sensitivities equates to a major reduction       in cost as well as energy consumption, or enables many more calculations       giving improved modelling and mitigation of risk through considering many       more different risk scenarios.
