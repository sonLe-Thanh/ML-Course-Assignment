     Process from research to impact.
Research demonstrating the effectiveness and acceptability of school-based       counselling was presented at the Scottish Parliament Health and Sports       Committee (2009); to Paul Burstow (former Minister of State for Care       Services) (2012); and at the Stormont parliament in Northern Ireland       (2012).
It was also presented at a wide range of national conferences,       including the Psychological Therapies in the NHS conference (2012).
The       research was more widely disseminated to policy- makers and stakeholders       through published reports that were made widely available online, through       peer-reviewed journal papers, and through articles in professional       journals.
Professor Cooper collaborated with Dr Susan Pattison at the       University of Newcastle, who led on a 2007 report on school-based       counselling in Wales, and was a co-investigator on the 2010 RCT (reference       4).
He also collaborated with Dr Sheila Spong at the University of       Newport, who undertook the case study component of a 2012 evaluation of       school-based counselling in Wales.
Types of impact         Impact on policy makers, investment and services       Research reports demonstrating the effectiveness and acceptability of       school-based counselling were drawn on by policy makers in Northern       Ireland as support for the establishment of school- based counselling       services, which are now in existence across all secondary schools.
The       National Co-ordinator for the Northern Ireland Department of Education       Independent Counselling Service (Source 1) for Schools stated: "The         Research carried out by Strathclyde University has greatly influenced         and enhanced the manner in which the Independent Counselling Service for         Schools is delivered in every Post Primary School across the country.
Having such a strong research base from Strathclyde which shows the         effectiveness of school based counselling has given added confidence         that the service delivered in our schools is not only fit for purpose,         but always focuses on the paramountcy of the child or young person's         welfare."
The 2007 research report into services for children and young people in       Wales set ten recommendations that were wholly adopted by the Welsh       government, and became the basis for the provision and delivery of the       Welsh government's &#163;6.5M school-based counselling strategy in 2008.
The       subsequent 2011 evaluation of this Strategy, co-led by the University of       Strathclyde, supported the &#163;14.25M extension of the Strategy and its       subsequent establishment of school- based counselling as a constitutional       responsibility for local authorities under The School Standards and       Organisation (Wales) Bill (2013).
The co-ordinator for School-based       Counselling in Wales at the time of the research, stated in a presentation       at the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)       Research Conference (May 2013), "the evaluation was hugely         influential....
I don't think the additional money or the statutory         implementation would have happened without that hard evidence"       (Source 2).
By demonstrating the effectiveness of school-based counselling, the       research has also played an important role in the UK Coalition       Government's decision in 2012 to allocate approximately &#163;750k to the       development of e-learning resources for counsellors working with children       and young people (`Counselling MindEd', for which Professor Cooper acts as       Clinical Lead, Source 3), and the associated appointment of a National       Advisor for Counselling for Children and Young People (Professor Cooper).
The Chair of the BACP (Source 4), states: "Research from the University         of Strathclyde on the effectiveness of school-based counselling was         presented at a face-to-face meeting with Paul Burstow, former Minister         of State for Care Services, and played a significant role in the         subsequent allocation of approximately &#163;750k to the development of         e-training for counsellors working with children and young people."
This evidence base has also formed the basis for the development, in       2012-13, of UK-wide competences for counselling children and young people       by the BACP (co-chaired by Professor Cooper).
The Head of Research at BACP       (Source 5) said "RCT research from the University of Strathclyde on the         effectiveness of school-based counselling provided a key source in         determining the nature of the competences established for counsellors         working in the children and young people's field."
The evidence-based competences developed for counselling children and       young people and the Counselling MindEd e-learning programme will form the       basis for training and accreditation of all counsellors working with       children and young people in the UK &#8212; approximately 4,000 therapists &#8212;       with the intention that this will significantly improve the effectiveness       of their work.
Research demonstrating the effectiveness of systematic       feedback in school-based counselling has influenced the UK's largest       provider of counselling in the primary school sector, Place2Be, to trial       the use of this system from 2012.
The Research and Evaluation Manager for       Place2Be (Source 6) confirms that "research conducted at the University         of Strathclyde on the value of using systematic feedback in counselling         with primary school children has encouraged us to pilot this system         within 9 of our schools.
The data from this pilot is currently being         evaluated and will inform our future service delivery decisions'.
Professor Cooper has also promoted this systematic feedback work through         articles and conference presentations to a professional audience".
Impact on health and welfare of children and young people in the UK       Today, school-based counselling is primarily delivered to young people in       the 11-18 year old age range; although there is also some provision to       children in primary schools.
In this respect, the research which has       supported the enhancement of both the quantity and quality of school-based       counselling provision in the UK had made a significant contribution to the       health and welfare of young people and children in the UK.
Between 2008       and 2013, approximately 400,000 young people will have received       school-based counselling across the UK (Source 7).
The intervention is       normally delivered to pupils who experience psychological difficulties &#8212;       most commonly family problems, anger issues (particularly males),       bereavement and relationship problems &#8212; though it is normally made       accessible to any young person who expresses a wish to participate in it.
Approximately 60% of service users are female; and there is a mix of       ethnicities.
In Wales and Northern Ireland, school-based counselling is       delivered in all publicly-funded secondary schools; and in approximately       70% of schools in England and Scotland.
There is also delivery of school-       based counselling in the independent and special needs sectors in the UK       (Source 7).
Based on predicted recovery rates, approximately 180,000 of those young       people who attended school-based counselling between 2008 and 2013 will       have moved from clinical levels of psychological distress to non-clinical       levels; though 40,000 will also have moved from non-clinical levels to       clinical levels (Source 7).
The meta-analyses of RCT data also indicates       that, on average, school-based counselling brings about a reduction in       psychological distress of 0.82 standard deviations, and a 0.64 standard       deviation increase in attainment of personal goals.
Qualitative reports       from teachers and service users also suggest that approximately 80% of       young people who participate in school-based counselling (approximately       320,000 young people in the UK between 2008 and 2013) will experience       improvements in their capacities to engage with studying and learning,       particularly in terms of being able to concentrate more in class (Source       7).
The Senior Lead Advisor for Counselling Children and Young People for the       BACP stated (Source 8): "School-based counselling now reaches hundreds         of thousands of young people and children in the UK, and is leading to         measurable improvements in their wellbeing.
Research at the University         of Strathclyde has been highly influential in supporting the         establishment and dissemination of these services, and in these respects         contributing to the enhanced wellbeing of many young people in the UK."
