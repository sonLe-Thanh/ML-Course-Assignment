     Professor Smith's paper at the Philosophy and Wine conference has       had ongoing impact from       2004 to the present.
His work challenged the wine industry, and       subsequently the food and       drinks industries internationally, to develop their understanding of the       factors influencing how       people taste.
It led to his continuing collaboration with neuroscientist       Professor Charles Spence       who is Director of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory in Oxford.
This       strong specialist interest       has overflowed into public discourse where Professor Smith's research has       influenced the media       and publishers in the field of food and drink, leading to an increased       public understanding of       taste and smell, and of flavour and flavour perception.
Food and drinks industries     Evidence of the interest Smith's research has generated in the food and       drinks industries is       provided by the numerous invitations to speak and requests for advice and       consultancy that       Smith has received.
His research has provided new ways for such industries       to connect with       their clients and customers:            Smith has spoken at international science and industry conferences on         wine, including                the Wine Active Compounds conference for chemists and oenologists in           Beaune in           2008 and 2011 (Source 1)         the Italian Institute for Wine and Agriculture, in Florence, March           2012 and Treviso, Nov           2012         the Wines of Argentina's Cambalache (17-18 April 2013) (source 2)         the British Seafood Society's event, Cockles and Muscles at           the Museum of London at           Docklands (18 May 2013) (source 3).
Smith has been a sensory consultant for Courvoisier (since 2011),         Guinness (ongoing),         Diageo (2013, ongoing), Mumm and Perrier Jouet (2012), and Douwe Egberts         (2012).
For         Courvoisier, Smith contributed substantially to the development of a         short film and related         app, `Le Nez de Courvoisier', which `reveals' the user's personal taste         profiles and helps         people understand and choose wines knowledgably.
(Source 4)       The gourmet restaurant The Fat Duck approached Smith to conduct         sensory experiments         through CenSes.
Heston Blumenthal subsequently accepted an Honorary         Doctorate from the         School of Advanced Study (10 April 2013).
(Source 5)       The director of elite winemakers Domaine de la Romanee Conti in         Burgundy invited Smith to         contribute to a volume which formed part of the submission to UNESCO in         2010 to have Les         Climats de la Cote d'Or vineyards in France recognised as a UNESCO World         Heritage Site.
(Source 6)       He was commissioned to write an entry on `Wine and Philosophy' for The           Oxford Companion           to Wine (ed.
J. Robinson, 3rd edition, 2006).
Smith has been invited to contribute articles to a number of         specialist journals and books,         including the influential journal for wine enthusiasts, The World of           Fine Wine (Issue 21 2008).
His chapter from Questions of Taste (2007) was discussed in this         journal (Issue 26 2009),         and generated considerable discussion in subsequent issues (Issues 27,         28, 2009-10).
(Source 7)       Specialist food and drink consultant who established The Champagne         Assembly with a         prizewinning event in 2010, hosted by Mumm and Perrier-Jou&#235;t, invited         Professors Smith         and Spence to provide an authoritative philosophical and scientific         presentation on taste at         the second event in 2012.
(Source 8)          Media, publishing and public discourse     The initial interview by The Guardian's Malcolm Gluck on BBC       Radio 4's Today programme       ahead of the 2004 conference led to a review in the Financial Times       (11 Dec 2004).
The interest       subsequently generated in the industry and among specialists by Smith's       work has fed into       broad media interest, evidenced by several commissions and interviews in       the period from 2008:            Smith has written authoritative articles for a range of publications         for non-specialists, on the         interaction between the senses, including `The Sensory and the         Multisensory' for John         Brockman's Edge website, which is also published in This Will Make           You Smarter, ed.
John         Brockman (2011, Harper Perennial).
(Source 9)       Several of the food and drinks industry events at which Smith has         presented attracted a wide         public audience.
Over 700 people attended the Cockles and Mussels         event at Museum of         London (2013), and Professor Smith's talk was featured on BBC China.'
(Source 3)       Smith has been involved in presenting his research on a number of         widely listened to radio         programmes and on the BBC website, including:                a four-part radio series, The Mysteries of the Brain, for           BBC World Service in 2010,           which he was commissioned to write and present.
The first programme,           on language           and the senses, featured Heston Blumenthal and was on Radio 4's Pick             of the Week           (26 Sept 2010).
The series was hugely successful online with           unprecedented interest           for a documentary series, reaching BBC World Service's top two ratings           slots four           weeks in a row.
As a result, Smith was asked to talk about this           sensory work on Radio           4's Start the Week (4 Oct 2010).

This led a consultant from James Paget Hospital in Norwich which           runs the UK's           only Smell and Taste Clinic to contact Smith, and they now           collaborate.
And further articles on the BBC website (Sources 10d &amp; e)              Public interest in his work on the objectivity of taste is ongoing.
Smith was asked to present         his research at a press briefing for the British Science Festival in         Aberdeen (June 2012).
It         has featured in local, national and international media, including the         Daily Mail, the Daily and         Sunday Telegraph, the BBC World Service Newshour, the BBC website, BBC         Cambridgeshire's The Naked Scientists, Radio New Zealand, World         Radio Switzerland and         Newstalk Radio, Eire.
Francis Percival, chair of London Gastronomy Seminars, invited Smith         to help organise a         series of public meetings with experts in food and wine.
In March 2012,         they hosted the         launch of Flavour, a new BioMed Journal, and the event featured         chefs and scientists from         Noma in Copenhagen.
(Source 11)       Smith has done several podcast interviews including discussing the         impact of recent         discoveries in neuroscience on our understanding of the mind and our         senses, on the         popular website, Philosophy Bites (7 September 2008).
Under the auspices of CenSes, he has created the London Experimental         Oenology         Seminars for the public and wine professionals to learn about the latest         sensory and         chemical science affecting wine making.
These popular events, organised         approximately six         times a year since 2010, attract 20-30 people each time, including:         trainee oenologists from         England's wine school, Plumton College in Sussex; members of the wine         press; and         interested enthusiasts.
He was invited (with Professor Charles Spence) to organise a bespoke         session for paying         guests at the popular annual event, Cambalache for Wines of Argentina,         17-18 April 2013,         the organiser of which has written: `This incredible session was         informative, witty, erudite and         educational.
It really added weight to our event and was one of the most         talked about and         celebrated experiences of the evening by our guests.'
