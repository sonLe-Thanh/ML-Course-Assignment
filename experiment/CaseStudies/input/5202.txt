     Creating cultural capital, driving public engagement, shaping         discourse     Miah's research has inspired, informed and changed the working practices       of many art/science       festivals around the UK which, in turn, have created new exhibits and       innovative events based on       Miah's observations and philosophical questioning.
These creative       productions have consequently       stimulated public discourse on issues facing society, highlights of which       are:     a) Developing an international art/science festival     Since 2008, Miah has held a Fellowship at the Foundation for Art and       Creative Technology       (FACT) in Liverpool at which its CEO indicates Miah "made a         significant contribution to the         organisation" [A].
During his time, his research [2, 3, 4]       transformed an artist-led       programme called `Human Futures', which received &#163;20k investment in       design, resourcing,       and production.
Miah's research on human enhancement [2-5] influenced the       creation of       the Abandon Normal Devices festival, which received &#163;750,000 from the       Cultural Olympiad       from 2009-2012 (for which FACT was co-founding organisation).
It involved       75 partners,       reached 250,000 active audience members and 740,000 ambient audience       members [B].
Miah's research on bioethics and elite sport led the London 2012 Creative       Programmer for       the North West to develop a vision around this subject [C],       informed by Miah's publications       on bio-digital futures [2-4].
Miah curated exhibitions, identified new       work for commissions,       and programmed 12 public debates over 3 years of the festival.
The       festival Director states:       "Prof Andy Miah has been a central part of the programme development         since         2009....supporting the development of commissions and debates, which         have in turn made         it easier for the festival to attract a diverse mix of audiences....Andy         has also developed the         salon, debate strand, which have been a central public engagement         strategy pulling         together the festival research questions between 2009-2012."
[C]       The festival explores the       ethics of science and technology and attracted interest by many press       outlets, including       Wired, BBC, Vogue and Culture Show.
The evaluation report calculates an       economic       impact of over &#163;3 million [C].
b) Shaping major exhibitions     In 2012 Miah's research [1-2] led to collaboration with The Wellcome       Trust to develop its       `Superhuman' exhibition.
Miah's specially commissioned article featured       prominently in the       gallery guide (distributed to 10,000 visitors) and he was integrated into       the exhibition itself       (total footfall of 80,000), with over 90,000 web visits [D].
Evidence from visitor feedback       indicates how Miah's contribution influenced public opinion on the subject       of human       enhancement.
For example, one blogger wrote: "after reading Andy         Miah's essay in the         exhibition guide on enhancement in sport, I wonder if my stance is         coherent and consistent.
I haven't changed my mind, but I'm not feeling quite so sure-footed."
c) Co-producing interactive installations     Miah's research [1-2] also influenced the development of a physical,       interactive, touring       installation called `InMotion' [E] in the National Museum of       Scotland which engaged 30,000       participants within the Edinburgh International Science Festival over 17       days to explore       issues around elite sports.
Policy-making     During 2009-2010, Miah's research [3-4] influenced a European Parliament       inquiry on human       enhancement, following his participation on an earlier European Commission       FP6 Science and       Society Coordination Action project on the ethics of nanobiotechnology for       human enhancement.
Miah's research is cited in the report produced for the DG for Internal       Policies on Economic and       Scientific Policy, Science and Technology Options Assessment [F].
He is presently part of a select       research community on a European Commission project titled `Digital       Futures 2050' which is       `horizon scanning' to identify new policy issues arising from technologies       currently still under       development.
Public discourse &#8212; science and technology journalism     Miah's controversial perspective on the merit of human enhancement has       widely shaped public       debate, creating a significant media impact over 2008-2013, generating in       excess of 100 clippings       [G].
He has written for the Washington Post (2008) and holds       contributor roles with the Guardian       (2009-10), Huffington Post (2008-) and Metro Newspapers (2012-) and has       appeared on media in       over 25 countries.
Stimulating creative public engagement     Miah's wider influence on projects associated with his research output       include being selected as a       judge in the Debating Matters [H] national competition on ethical       issues, source materials of which       included Miah's research outputs [2].
Also in 2012, Miah's research [1-2,       4] provided advice for a       theatrical co-production called `Seeking Perfection' on ethics and human       enhancement.
This       partnership between universities, the Manchester Science Festival and       Contact Theatre was       inspired by Miah's explorations of human enhancement [2-3] This production       won a European       award for public engagement in 2011 [H].
Professor Miah also has       worked with bioartists and       biodesigners on developing new work [I].
