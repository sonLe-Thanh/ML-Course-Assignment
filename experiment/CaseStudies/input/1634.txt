     Callender's research informed the policy debate about financial support       for part-time undergraduates.
It fed into the policy-making process in two       stages.
In stage 1, she used it (refs.
1, 4) to raise awareness and       understanding about the case for reform, directly influencing the policy       agendas of government, think-tanks, HE stakeholders, HEIs and others, who       then endorsed and promoted changes to the financing of part-time study.
She modelled and disseminated policy options to policymakers, think-tanks,       and stakeholders.
In stage 2, once the government announced the       introduction of part-time student loans in 2010, Callender utilized her       research (refs.
2, 5) to recommend changes, leading directly to improved       provision.
Policymakers, HE stakeholders, HEIs and part-time students in       England have benefitted from this, with an estimated one-third of       part-time undergraduates (N=175,000), studying at about 120 English HEIs,       receiving the new loans, double the proportion awarded fee grants prior to       the reforms.
Stage 1: Putting part-time student funding issues on the policy agenda         and informing the case for reform     Professor Christine King (VC, Staffordshire University) consulted       Callender extensively and cited her research as part of John Denham's       (Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, Department       for Innovation, Universities and Skills, DIUS) review of the future of HE       (9/08).
David Lammy (Minister of State for HE and Intellectual Property)       invited Callender to meet to discuss flexibility in HE delivery and       improving the student experience (27/2/09).
Between autumn 2008 and the       2010 general election, Callender had six private meetings with David       Willetts (Shadow Minister for HE) and his Special Adviser about part-time       student funding, and she modelled policy options for them.
The Special       Adviser confirms `that the impact of her work was influential on the         Conservative Party... the resources of any opposition         party...that can be devoted to policymaking are necessarily relatively         small and, without the civil service to call upon, accessible academic         work can take on an additional importance' (source 1).
Callender advocated student funding changes and outlined policy choices in       a book for think-tank, IPPR (source 6), and in a pamphlet for       think-tank Policy Exchange (source 7).
Willetts used this in a       speech at the CBI's HE Summit (20/10/09) to argue for the inclusion of       part-time students in the Browne Review: `I have been struck by the         inability of part-time students to access fair funding for teaching and         maintenance.
A recent Policy Exchange report by Professor Claire         Callender of Birkbeck rightly described this as "One of the greatest and         most glossed-over injustices in the English higher education system."
And that's why we think part-time support should be considered in the         student finance review' (source 8).
There were concerns that the Independent Review of Higher Education       Funding and Student Finance, chaired by Lord Browne &#8212; set up in November       2009 to review fees policy and financial support &#8212; would focus exclusively       on full-time students.
Drawing on her research (refs.1, 4), Callender       responded personally to the Review's `call for evidence'       (7/12/09-31/1/10), and co-authored the Birkbeck-Open University joint       submission to the Review (source 9).
She was invited to brief       Universities UK, the 1994 Mission group, Million +, the National Union of       Students and Universities and Colleges Union.
She demonstrated the       limitations of the current financial arrangements, highlighting the need       for reform, and advised on policy options.
This had a direct impact on       these organisations' submissions to the Browne Review, all of which       expressed support for changes to part-time student funding (e.g.
sources         2 and 3).
Her research (refs.
1, 6) was the focus of a Times Higher       Education feature on part-time student funding, and she was frequently       cited in the national press (source 8).
The Deputy Director, Higher Education Analysis, at the Department for       Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) testifies that Callender's `evidence         contributed strongly to the case for reform of funding for part-time         students' (source 4).
Her expertise was sought by other UK       policymakers, including DIUS/BIS; HEFCE, the Treasury, and the CBI, as       well as by international policy advisers from the OECD, Japan and the       Netherlands.
She gave keynotes at numerous stakeholder conferences       including: the Association for University Administrators; British       Universities Finance Directors Group; Consumer Financial Education Body;       Guardian Summit on HE; National Association of Student Money Advisers;       National Institute of Adult Continuing Education; NUS; Parliamentary       Universities Group; Student Loans Company; and Universities Association       for Lifelong Learning.
Browne's overview of the first `call for evidence' echoed Callender's       arguments in confirming the Review's intention to recommend funding       changes, which had been the focus of her awareness raising activities, and       is testament to her research's impact.
Stage 2: Influencing and modifying the new funding arrangements and         loans for part-time undergraduates     Following the Browne Review's `call for proposals' for future funding       (15/3/10-14/5/10), Callender co-authored the Birkbeck-Open University       joint submission calling for grants and loans for part-time students, and       she submitted, in confidence, alternative costed policy options (source         9).
She was one of the few academics (as against HE stakeholders) to       give evidence at the Review's public hearings and had private meetings       with its secretariat.
A Review member says she was `a phenomenal         source of data, expertise and insight...Her evidence has shifted our         higher education system in the direction of flexibility, access and         choice for all' (source 5).
She was invited to advise the new Coalition government's HE Strategy       Group (Vince Cable, Secretary of State for BIS; David Willetts, Minister       for Universities and Science; and Departmental officials).
Willett's       Special Parliamentary Adviser verifies that Callender's research `was         influential throughout the Coalition's recent higher education         policy-making ... [A]mong those who do focus on higher education there         are a tiny handful whose work is fit for direct application to the         policymaking process.
Professor Callender is at the forefront of this         small group and the only one I am aware of who focuses above all on the         under-researched area of part-time study.
She has displayed a good         understanding of the policymaking process without ever veering from         academic excellence in the way that pure policymakers are often forced         to' (sources 1, 10).
When, in November 2010, the government announced its student funding       reforms including, for the first time, loans for part-time students to       cover increased tuition fees, Callender discussed with Willetts' Special       Parliamentary Adviser the limitations of these loans and proposed changes       to extend their eligibility criteria, including reducing students'       intensity of study from 33% of the full-time equivalent to 25%.
This       change was introduced on 8 December 2010.
She recommended to him and       Baroness Britton (who was leading a Lords debate) that part-time students       should start to repay their loans 4&#189; years instead of 3&#189; years after       commencing a course, so that fewer would make repayments while still       studying.
This change was introduced on 26 November 2011.
The Special       Parliamentary Adviser confirms Callender's role in bringing about these       policy changes saying, `After the initial announcement of extending         loans to part-time students, the details of the loans were         altered....Professor Callender was also influential in this partial         u-turn by Government' (source 1).
The impact of Callender's research is further substantiated by HE       stakeholders, such as the Assistant Policy Director of NUS who asserts: `Professor         Callender's research made a significant and lasting impact on the         development of public policy in this area by raising awareness of the         limitations of the existing student support offer for part-time         students.
...
I think I could count on the fingers of two hands the         people who genuinely "make waves" in the debate on part-time students...         and Professor Callender is one of them' (source 3).
The       Director of Policy, Universities UK, discussing the reach of Callender's       research, states `she promotes it to a very wide audience, including         UUK officers, UUK members, staff in UUK institutions and government         officials' (source 2).
Callender's research continues to contribute significantly to discussions       of part-time student funding (source 10).
Since HEFCE announced       (14/3/13) the fall in part-time enrolments following the 2012 reforms       (which Callender had predicted, source 8), she has met with:       Willetts and his Special Parliamentary Adviser (14/3/13; 17/7/13);       Universities UUK, HEFCE; OFFA; BIS officials; the Parliamentary       Universities Group and IPPR.
At these meetings she proposed further       changes to the restrictive loan eligibility criteria, in particular,       extending the availability of loans to part-time students who already hold       a degree in a different discipline.
Willetts has accepted this idea, but       he only announced the policy change after the REF impact deadline,       publically attributing it to Callender's influence at the launch of a UUK       report on part-time students (16/10/13) &#8212; a report which also draws       heavily on her research.
