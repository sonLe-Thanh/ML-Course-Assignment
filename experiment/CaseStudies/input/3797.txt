     Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output 2) lies at the heart of the       impact claimed here.
It is regularly consulted by museum staff, media       companies, artists, and historical re-enactors striving for accurate       identification and depiction of Roman military equipment.
The research       underlying that work has enabled Coulston to offer advice on these issues       to a large number of organisations.
More broadly, the research underlying       all five of the listed publications has allowed him to enhance public       understanding of the Roman army both nationally and internationally, for       example through his media consultations (including work for North American       magazine and television companies) and public lectures.
These influences       have been concentrated in three areas.
i.
Heritage management: improvement of museum displays     A number of UK museums have drawn on Coulston's research, by direct       consultation and by use of Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output 2), in       order to improve the classification and public display of their holdings.
Most importantly, in 2012, Coulston acted as advisor to a restructuring       project for Housesteads Museum on Hadrian's Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage       Site.
A senior curator for English Heritage writes (source 1): `[After         initial consultation in person] I commissioned a report [from him] on         the sculptural and epigraphic material from the site.
The project also         relied heavily on Coulston's earlier work on Roman military fittings         with Dr Mike Bishop.
Coulston's analysis was key to our selection of         artefacts for display, and in how we chose to interpret them.
Beyond the         rigour of academic description, his willingness to consider the         circumstances, mechanisms and personal aspects which may have inspired         the creation of the pieces provided a more personal and intimate         narrative though which our audiences now access meaning in the         collection... Dr Coulston's ability to make comparison with other         assemblages from along the Wall and elsewhere in Britain, and to then         distill the particular significances and narratives within the site         collection was essential in giving our interpretation depth, confidence         and clarity'.
Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output 2) has also       been used regularly by staff in the National Museum of Scotland during       2008-13 for informing new displays on Roman material, researching newly       excavated finds and answering public queries.
In addition, since 2009       Coulston has annually presented his study of Roman military equipment       finds on ancient battlefields at the Conflict Archaeology Short Course       held jointly by Cranfield University and The Joint Defence Academy of the       United Kingdom at Shrivenham, a public event attended by numerous heritage       industry professionals.
ii.
Contributing to the creative sector: consulting work for media         companies     Coulston regularly advises media companies seeking to meet the huge       public demand for material on Roman military and gladiatorial culture.
During 2008-13 he has helped a range of television and print media       companies to produce historically accurate representations and       interpretations.
That advice has been underpinned by decades of research       on the Roman army, and in particular by the five outputs listed above.
Examples include:     (a) Consultations and filmed interviews for television       documentaries on Roman military and gladiatorial subjects during       2008-2013. i) The Varian Disaster, series Perfect Storms,       EOne Entertainment, Toronto, for History TC Canada, UK Yesterday and       National Geographic Channel (filmed interviews, London, May 2012), where       his contribution focused both on military equipment and on the experience       of warfare in the forests of Germany, drawing esp.
on output 2 and         output 5. ii) Truth Behind the Film: Gladiator,       Blinkfilm for National Geographic Channel (filmed interviews, London, June       2010), where his contribution focused on gladiatorial experience and self-presentation, 	  and on the connections between soldiers and gladiators,       drawing esp.
on outputs 1 and 4. iii) Septimius         Severus, Lion TV Scotland (filmed interviews, Scotland, Oct. 2009),       putting Roman warfare in northern Britain into the context of the Roman       army and military equipment in the wider Roman world, drawing esp.
on outputs         1 and 2.
(b) Contributions to print media during 2008-2013. i) Ongoing       consultancy work for the archaeology correspondent of the Independent,       which has involved lengthy telephone conversations on average three or       four times per year during 2008-13.
Recent consultations have involved       discussion of new finds of Roman helmets at Hallaton Hill, Leics and       Crosby Garrett, Cumbria (the latter having been reconstructed and       auctioned controversially without proper archaeological consultation),       drawing on Dr Coulston's military equipment specialisation (esp.
output         2); and the Roman cemetery at York (where the evidence of skeletal       pathology suggests burial of gladiators), drawing on Dr Coulston's       expertise in gladiatorial culture (esp.
output 4).
The Independent's       archaeology correspondent writes (source 2): `My ability to         communicate new discoveries, new ideas and new thinking to the general         public is...utterly dependent on the quality of the information I         receive from the academic world.
In the field of Roman military         archaeology (essential to creating a public understanding of Roman         Britain and its long-term impact on modern Britain), Jonathan Coulston's         knowledge, published articles, commitment and advice have been essential         in enabling me to inform my readers'.
ii) Consultant on Roman       military and gladiatorial equipment for two pictorial reconstructions in National         Geographic Magazine, drawing especially on outputs 2 and 4       (`Roman Frontiers', Sept. 2012, 106-27; `New Old Libya', Feb. 2013,       28-59).
A representative of the magazine writes (source 3): `Dr         Jon Coulston has been instrumental in helping us to create and refine         artwork developed in conjunction with two...stories... His in-depth         knowledge of the time period, numerous publications (Roman Military       Equipment in particular), and keen eye for detail have been invaluable         to our research staff, editors, and artists.
His expertise helped us to         achieve the standard of excellence and journalistic integrity our         readers have come to expect from the magazine.'
iii) Popular       magazine interview on aspects of Roman army training, equipment and battle       by Ben Beaumont-Thomas, `Could you have survived as a Roman soldier?
', FHM,       April 2011, 94-102, drawing esp.
on outputs 2, 3 and 5.       iv) Authored article, `Late Roman Military Equipment: Culture, Arms and       the Man during the Dominate', Ancient Warfare, Dec. 16, 2012,       14-19, including collaboration with a commissioned artist to produce a       historically accurate depiction of Roman military equipment and dress,       drawing esp.
on output 2.
(c) Production of online material.
He has contributed to the BBC       website The Roman Army with a series of own-copyright images and       supporting texts which focus on Roman military equipment and iconography 	  (http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/romanarmy_gallery.shtml),       drawing especially on outputs 1, 2 and 3, and providing       images for public engagement which would otherwise be difficult to access       (last updated in 2011).
iii.
Cultural life: enriching the experience of our cultural heritage     In addition to influencing heritage managers and media companies, the       research underlying the listed publications has made a major difference to       wider public understanding of the Roman army.
Particularly striking is Coulston's influence on Roman army re-enactors,       modellers, illustrators and amateur historians.
Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output         2) is heavily used by these groups to inform their reconstructions       of costumes and equipment.
The Chair of the late Roman reconstruction       group Comitatus and of the organisation `Historical       Interpretations', which provides activity days for school children, writes       (source 4): `Via "Historical Interpretations" Roman days, Jon's         ideas on the Roman military are taught to roughly 2,000 children each         year.
Comitatus relies heavily on Jon's work... With 50 active members         Comitatus performs to around 24,000 members of the public each year.
While the military displays are visually stimulating, the scripted     commentary carefully describes the equipment on display and the nature         of the late Roman army.
Much of this can be traced to Jon's         publications... His views on Roman archery and especially the use of         strung bow cases caused a new approach to be taken within Comitatus, and         he is the touchstone against which new items of equipment are         introduced...
It is fair to say every re-enactment group uses Jon's work         to improve their presentation, and this in turn has an impact on the         heritage industry.
Archaeological sites hire Roman re-enactment groups         to help boost visitor numbers, while cities with a strong Roman         connection such as Chester and York use costumed guides dressed to help         tourism.
The standard of such off-the-shelf Roman equipment has         noticeably improved over the past twenty years in part due to Roman       Military Equipment.
Computer and figure war gamers use Jon's work to         develop figurines and models, while military illustrators base their own         reconstructions on Jon's work'.
One member of the Ermine St Guard       (Britain's first Roman re-enactment society) writes (source 5): `it         is fairly safe to say that Bishop and Coulston rank alongside Carol van         Driel-Murray, Simon James and Mark Hassal as the chief influences on the         society'.
Coulston's work has also had sustained influence on       authors for the popular history-of-warfare Osprey series (it is cited in       11 volumes from that series).
Graham Sumner, a leading reconstruction       artist, describes Coulston's influence on his work as an illustrator and       author for the Osprey series and other popular-history publications (with       reference among others to Sumner (2008) Roman Military Dress,       D'Amato (2009) Arms and Armour, and various titles in the `Roman       Conquest' series for Pen and Sword Books: 4 volumes in 2009-13) (source         5): `Whenever I am working on a painting dealing with a         re-construction of a Roman soldier I always as a matter of course refer         to one if not all of these publications [i.e.
Bishop and Coulston 2006,         and earlier editions] first'.
See also source 6 for online       description of engagement with Bishop and Coulston 2006 in reconstructing       Roman caligae (boots).
Coulston is also a regular contributor to       the internet forum Roman Army Talk (RAT), an international online       community of 6,500 Roman army enthusiasts, and regularly draws on his       research to answer enquiries from non-academic members.
He delivered a       paper (`Arming the Late Roman soldier') at the annual RAT       conference 2011, in York (audience of 30).
In addition, Coulston's work has helped to improve understanding of the       Roman army for members of the wider public with no specialist interest.
His museum consultations continue to influence the experience of thousands       of visitors.
Housesteads has more than 100,000 visitors per year;       Segedunum Roman Fort Baths and Museum (where displays on which Coulston       advised before 2008, helping especially with interpretation of monumental       sculpture fragments from the site, are still in place, and so have       continued to have an impact on the experience of visitors during 2008-13)       has approximately 50,000 visitors per year.
The contributions to       television and print media listed above under 4(ii) have reached a       wide non-specialist audience.
In addition to the consultations listed,       Coulston made contributions to a number of other television projects       before 2008 which continue to be syndicated worldwide and to reach a wide       audience: e.g.
Gladiator Graveyard (filmed interviews, London;       script editor for final cut; originally aired on BBC, Oct. 2007) and The         Roman Way of War (filmed interviews, London; script editor for final       cut; originally aired on BBC 1998).
National Geographic has a       global circulation of 8 million, and an estimated monthly readership of 60       million; FHM had circulation of more than 150,000 in 2011; Ancient         Warfare has circulation of approximately 10,000.
He has also given a       large number of public talks in museums and schools exploring the place of       the army in Roman society (underpinned by all five of the outputs in 3       above), e.g.
: i) `A Century of Archaeology in Rome', Kirkcaldy Museum and       Art Gallery (15 Sept, 2008) (audience of 60); ii) `Trajan's Column: Window       on the Roman Army?'
(44th Annual Roman Army Conference, Durham,       5 April, 2009) (40); iii) `Augustus, Mussolini and the City of Rome',       Fettes College, Edinburgh (6 Oct, 2009) (30); iv) `Reconstructing the       Roman Army in North Britain', Perth Museum and Art Gallery (14       Oct., 2009) (40); v) `Art and Service: the presentation of Roman soldiers       on Figural Gravestones', Museum of Archaeology, Warsaw (13 May, 2011)       (60); vi) `Gladiators in Fact and Fiction', St Leonards School, St Andrews       (10 May, 2012) (25).
