     Usage has grown from about 1.38 million hits in 2008 to over 3.8 million       per year in 2012-13 and by July 2013 was rising by about 16% p.a.
[S6].
In       addition to the sheer number of hits achieved by the website, and       first-hand knowledge of how the Dictionary is used in       universities, there is plentiful evidence of how the site serves a wide       variety of people across the world, and of its importance for their       research, whether for work or leisure.
Family historians find it invaluable for investigating individual houses       and estates and their architects.
Such enquiries may be made purely for       personal interest or in connection with proposed alterations or the sale       of properties, as reported by professional archivists who deal with public       requests of this nature and a researcher for a national firm of estate       agents, who says `I frequently find information that the owners are         unaware of' [S3].
Legal questions about the copyright of drawings in       archives are also easily settled by the reliable biographical data offered       by the Dictionary.
Architects and planners use the website as a quick way to research       project sites and one respondent from a major Edinburgh firm comments that       the value of the Dictionary becomes especially evident when they       work on English commissions: `I can readily recall projects elsewhere         that have taken several hours to get to the same level of understanding         that would take less than five minutes for a similar project in Scotland'       [S4].
This firm estimates the financial savings to itself and its clients       as approximately &#163;5000 per annum and the economic benefits of this across       the country &#8212; for individuals and the industry &#8212; are clear.
A particular       strength of the Dictionary is that it provides an `amazing         depth and range of information by not limiting itself to the better         known and therefore better valued and publicised architects and         buildings', as noted by Docomomo, an international campaign group       that champions the often-unfashionable cause of 20th-century architecture       and prepares evidence in relation to listing, alteration or demolition       proposals [S5].
The importance of free access out of office hours is noted       by this entirely volunteer-run body, which also uses the Dictionary       to prepare outreach events such as lectures, walking tours and       exhibitions.
Educational use is also described by a teacher based in a primary school       which celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2012.
Production of an eBook and       blogspot was a small part of the festivities, but the Deputy Head Teacher       was delighted to find easily accessible information about the history of       the building and to be given permission to incorporate it into the eBook       [S1].
In 2007 the day-to-day management of the database and employment of the       senior researcher were taken on by Historic Scotland (HS).
As the       government body responsible for listing buildings and a major user of the       information, HS was eager to house the website, proof of its value as a       resource for the protection of Scotland's historic architecture.
A direct       link is given on the HS web pages [S7].
Local interest is shown by the       fact that Yvonne Hillyard, one of the original researchers and now Manager       of the project based in HS, has published eight magazine articles since       2008 (in addition to a scholarly article, `George Mathewson: A       Far-travelled Dundee Architect', Architectural Heritage, XXII,       2012, 53-75) and given five talks to Scottish societies in the same       period.
International usage of the Dictionary is attested by the       Archivist at the British School at Athens [S2], who uses it particularly       to research the School's Byzantine Research Fund Archive, and by website       statistics and links from specialist information sites and related       databases, such as one devoted to the South African built environment       [S9-10].
The organiser of this and the Canadian equivalent use the Dictionary       for fact-checking and appreciate the opportunity to contribute new       material to it when found.
This is a theme running through the feedback       and indicates a strong sense of ownership of the Dictionary by its       users.
Because it is a record of people, more than of buildings, it has a       personal following that includes retired architects interested in tracing       old colleagues or students and keen to add to the record about projects       currently attributed to a firm or local government team.
The pleasure       users experience from the website is evident in the feedback: `The only         criticism I have of the site is that it is addictive' [S3].
National coverage was given to the website on its launch, including in The         Times [S8].
The international impact of the Dictionary and       Professor Walker's work was recognised in 2008 by his appointment as       Honorary Patron of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great       Britain and in 2009 of a European         Heritage Award Medal of Honour by Europa Nostra for `Dedicated       Service', as recorded in the 2009 Awards Magazine [S11].
