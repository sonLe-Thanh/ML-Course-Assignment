     IMPACTS ON HEALTH AND WELFARE:     New clinical intervention is being trialled       The basic research carried out by Prof Colledge identified a completely       new molecule involved in     activating the reproductive axis at puberty.
The knowledge gained from       this research allowed the       development of a new clinical intervention which has been trialled         with patients:     IVF treatment     A Phase II clinical trial was started by Dr Waljit S Dhillo, Imperial       College London, in 2012 at       Hammersmith Hospital London, to investigate whether administration of       kisspeptin to women can       result in oocyte maturation (NCT01667406; Ref 1, Section 5).
The       significant expected advantage       (to be demonstrated through this trial) of kisspeptin over current       treatments to stimulate ovulation       during IVF treatment (ie administering human chorionic gonadotrophin       (hCG)) is a more       physiological increase in reproductive hormones and oocyte maturation       during IVF treatment.
So       far, early results in 30 women who have participated showed kisspeptin       could be used to stimulate       egg release in a gentler, more physiological way, without leading to       ovarian hyperstimulation       syndrome.
Kisspeptin stimulated egg release in 29 of the 30 women, and 28       of the women were       then able to use their eggs to attempt IVF (Ref 7 (BBC news 18/6/2013),       Section 5).
Reproductive disorders     The research identifying kisspeptin as an activator of the reproductive       axis has opened the       possibility to use kisspeptin analogues as tools for characterizing       certain reproductive disorders.
Four Phase I clinical trials of a truncated form of kisspeptin       (kisspeptin112-121), in combination       with GnRH (NCT00914823; Ref 2, Section 5), or on its own (NCT01438073,       NCT01438034,       NCT01862094; Refs 3-5, Section 5) are being conducted at Massachusetts       General Hospital or at       the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human       Development (NICHD) in       the US, for conditions including Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism and Delayed       Puberty.
Completion dates range from Dec 2013 to March 2015.
In addition, pilot studies carried out at Imperial College London, led by       Dr Waljit S Dhillo, have       identified that a single kisspeptin-54 injection acutely stimulates the       release of reproductive       hormones in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA), a commonly occurring       condition       characterized by absence of menstruation.
Women with HA who were treated       with twice-weekly       KP-54 injections had significantly elevated levels of reproductive       hormones after 8 weeks as       compared with treatment with saline.
No adverse effects were observed (Ref       6, Section 5).
Outcomes for patients or related groups have improved     The trial started in June 2012, and by July 2013 one baby &#8212; a healthy         boy called Heath &#8212; has been       born.
"Heath's mother, Suzie Kidd who is 34 and from Hitchen, says she is       ecstatic that she was       chosen to take part in the trial.
[..] "We are so, so grateful.""
(Ref 7       (BBC news 18/6/2013), Section       5).
Women enrolled in this clinical trial have expressed what an improvement         in quality of life the       hope of successful treatment is giving them through a blog that was       started on 6/5/13; by 31/7/13       the blog had 900 entries (Ref 8, Section 5; quotes: "This is an amazing       opportunity for us" Entry       #7, 9/3/13; "I had my EC today and we have 11 eggs!!!!!!!
We are so       pleased."
Entry #32, 21/3/13;       "Just had a call from the hospital and we have 9 embryo's!!!
Very happy"       Entry #34, 22/3/13).
IMPACTS ON SOCIETY, CULTURE AND CREATIVITY:     Prof Colledge has discussed his work on the role of kisspeptin in       reproduction from 2008 to 2011       at the Science Festival in Cambridge, reaching 1600 members of the public       overall.
The       breakthroughs of the Phase I and II clinical trials of kisspeptin in IVF       treatment have been       showcased on the BBC News, on BBC Radio 4 Women's Hour, in articles in the       Guardian, the       Telegraph, the Daily Mail, and a plethora of international online health       information/news sites,       women's / family magazines, specialist fertility publications, science /       research news sites and       blogs (examples are given in Refs 7-10, Section 5).
Through the coverage       in the Guardian,       Telegraph and Daily Mail alone (based on their traffic figures) an       estimated 3 million people have       been informed of the importance of kisspeptin, millions more through the       BBC programmes and       online media, and the blogs provide evidence of debate that has been       stimulated.
