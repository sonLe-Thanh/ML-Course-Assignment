     The research carried out by David Solkin and his curatorial team (Simpson       and Warrell principally) directly informed the selection of specific works       for the Turner and the Masters exhibition and the nature of their       display.
Solkin devised the concept and played the lead role throughout &#8212;       as guest curator of the show, as editor and co-author of the catalogue,       and as supervisor of Simpson's PhD &#8212; while Simpson did much of the       archival work (into early nineteenth-century British collections and       exhibitions), and Warrell lent his expertise as a Turner specialist of       many years' standing.
This was a collaborative scholarly project,       combining the fruits of original and secondary research, which was given       concrete form through the public presentation of more than fifty pictures       by Turner shown in pairs or larger groupings alongside a similar number of       works by other masters whom he strove to rival, emulate, or on occasion       outdo.
Following a methodology first developed by Solkin for his pioneering       exhibition Art on The Line: The Royal Academy Exhibitions at Somerset         House 1780-1836 (Courtauld Institute Gallery, 2001-2), Turner         and the Masters made most of its scholarly points visually: to       encourage visitors to draw their own conclusions, the Tate show reduced       the standard length of its wall texts (introductory panels and labels) to       an absolute minimum, whilst offering those who wished for more guidance       the option of renting an audio-guide featuring the voices of Solkin and       his co-curators: 41,302 viewers each paid &#163;3 for this opportunity.
Mid-way       through the run, the first edition of the catalogue sold out, prompting a       second printing; all 20,000 copies of both editions have now been sold.
But the dissemination of the research, via the exhibition itself and       online, was on a far larger scale: the show attracted more than 850,000       visitors to its three venues (221,146 in London; 455,322 in Paris; and       170,847 in Madrid).
The economic effects of this success were       far-reaching, not just as a stimulus to tourism: in addition to the more       than &#163;500,000 realised from catalogue sales, visitors to Tate Britain       spent &#163;85,115 on exhibition-related merchandise.
The average daily       attendance of 5,303 at the Grand Palais was the largest for any springtime       show in its history; during the same period, its auditorium welcomed       14,615 visitors to accompanying films, conferences, and lectures, while       3,685 schoolchildren attended on 173 organised tours.
In the UK, Google       analytics reports indicate a total of 280,000 `views' of the Turner         and the Masters pages between September 2009 and January 2010, while       during the same period the videos produced to accompany the exhibition       were seen by more than 22,000 viewers on YouTube alone.
Over 30,000 people       participated in an online survey, hosted on Tate Britain's website, in       which they were asked to score Turner's achievements against those of his       `rivals' &#8212; thus engaging the active engagement of the general public in       scholarly and critical debate to an exceptional degree.
In Britain the issues raised by the exhibition were further       debated and disseminated by an extensive and enthusiastic press coverage,       in the form of photographic features, illustrated reviews and extended       articles which appeared in the Times, Sunday Times, Independent, Daily         Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph, Guardian, Financial Times, Metro, Daily         Mirror, Express, Sunday Express, Time Out and elsewhere.
Television       coverage included a feature on Newsnight Review (BBC1), on BBC       Wales, and a half-hour programme on Sky Arts, while there were radio       reports on The Today Programme, Front Row (both Radio 4), and The         Strand (BBC World Service).
But the single largest audience       consisted of the 3.24 million who watched the final of University         Challenge on BBC2 on 4 April 2011, where a `starter for ten' and       three follow-up questions presented the contestants with pairs of works       from Turner and the Masters, and asked them to identify the       `masters' .
This attested and contributed to the exhibition's success in       enhancing the understanding of a huge popular audience of: Turner's       achievements; the history of British art in its European context; how       cultural transmission works; and how the culture of the past can be given       new life through the actions of any modern artist.
Arguably, too, the many       hundreds of thousands who experienced Turner and the Masters       either directly or indirectly came away with a stronger sense of       connection to, and therefore a greater enjoyment of, the art that they       encountered.
Turner and the Masters has also had an impact on the       research on and teaching of British art history.
On 11-12 January 2010 the       Tate hosted a workshop for an invited international group of twenty-four       art-historians, curators, and doctoral students, who participated in a       series of discussions in front of the pictures themselves, with a view to       articulating the lessons to be learned from the unique opportunities       offered by the exhibition.
The event not only provided a framework for       networks to be built in future, but also was significant in moving       high-level art-historical debate out of the classroom into the exhibition       space, helping to ensure the longer-term impact of the project in the       field of Turner studies and nineteenth-century art history.
Early       indications of that impact can be found in the recent National Gallery       exhibition, Turner Inspired: In the Light of Claude (14 March-       5June 2012), curated by Ian Warrell (one of Solkin's team), which expanded       on one of the key relationships presented in Turner and the Masters.
The catalogue and the January workshop also fed directly into an important       book-length study, JMW Turner and the Subject of History (Ashgate,       2012) by one of the workshop participants, Dr Leo Costello.
