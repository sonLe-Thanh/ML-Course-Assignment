     Throughout this research, extensive dissemination of the research       findings has taken place via publications, presentations, conferences and       workshops, and to distinct stakeholder groups.
Impact on the (then) Scottish Executive:       The evaluation derived from the Strathclyde research influenced the       subsequent development of the Scottish Union Learning Fund.
SULF Round 7       (2008-11) highlights how successfully ULL engages with non-traditional       learners (reflecting the main conclusion of the evaluation): "Unions have       a crucial part to play in developing the skills of their members too &#8212;       especially when it comes to reaching out to those people who employers       struggle to reach" (Fiona Hislop, Cabinet Secretary for Education and       Lifelong Learning, 2008).
The SULF 7 funding call implemented the       evaluation's key recommendations "....
In this Round there will be a         focus on sustainability, new bidding unions and projects based in the         Highlands and Islands" (Sources 1 and 6).
As Grahame Smith of the       STUC (Source 1) notes, "The prospectus for SULF 7 ... included a         specific requirement, arising from the SULF 1-5 Evaluation         recommendations, that the union learning funds would prioritise activity         by unions not previously involved, would focus on sustainability, and on         activity in the Highlands and Islands.....[the research] has         given ... the Scottish Government but also colleges and employers, the         confidence that the investment in both the union learning infrastructure         and in the knowledge and skills of workers has had a significant impact."
Impact on STUC       The evaluation was complemented by the learning demand research which in       turn supported STUC in making an effective case for government funding to       establish SUL in 2008.
This funding, along with additional learning       project funding, amounted to &#163;2.4M over 3 years.
This benefitted STUC by       delivering a dedicated learning organisation comprising 10 staff to       support STUC's ambition to become a major player in Scotland's skills and       learning policy.
As SUL's website (Source 10) notes, the Scottish       Government's substantial investment in establishing SUL is recognition of       the contribution that unions have made to improve the quality and quantity       of learning available at Scottish workplaces.
The research discussed here       quantified and analysed the quantity and quality of that learning and was       important in establishing a case for SU: "[The research] fundamentally         influenced the strategic direction of union learning in Scotland.
It         provided confirmation of the effectiveness of the Fund and led to a         significant adjustment in our strategic approach.
[It] directly resulted         in the creation of a dedicated and coordinated resources within the STUC         (the STUC Skills and Lifelong Learning Team ... ) to complement the         existing union infrastructure, principally workplace Union Learning         Representatives, and to the development of a discrete and union managed         fund to support learning provision" (Source 1).
The learning demand       research enhanced the impact of the earlier SULF evaluation and " ... provided         for the first time an assessment of the level of demand for learning in         unionised workplaces in Scotland and the type of learning demanded.
This         research was crucial in persuading the Scottish Government to invest in         the STUC's leaning infrastructure (the STUC Skills and Lifelong Learning         Team/Scottish Union Learning) and provided the evidence that underpinned         the criteria for the SUL Learning Fund created in 2010 and funded         through the European Social Fund."
(Source 1).
Impact on SUL:       The SULF evaluation and subsequent research highlighted the need for       sustainability in union learning activities.
To support such       sustainability, the aforementioned KTP project aimed to build a knowledge       management system to support the strategic development of union-led       learning in Scotland.
The purpose of this partnership was to underpin a       step change in union learning activity and brought with it consequent       funding and reputational benefits.
As Sylvia O'Grady, SUL manager has       reported, "the KTP project enabled STUC and SUL to optimise, store and         access tacit knowledge and use it in order to respond to the demands of         unions and government, particularly in making cases for funding and         learning activity" (Source 2).
She states that the KTP also helped       in "successfully effecting organisational change, and allowed STUC/SUL         to establish the business case for continued government funding and         enhanced the range of activities delivered" (Source 2).
More       importantly, in her view, the KTP project enabled STUC/SUL to be the       leading organisation in Scotland involved in improving the way skills are       used in the workplace.
Impact on support for non-traditional learners:       The original research provided evidence that unions were particularly       successful in attracting non- traditional learners back into learning.
The       unions' distinctive contribution in engaging those otherwise excluded from       learning in later life (many of whom had negative experiences of learning       earlier in life) has been accepted by government and has been important in       securing on-going government support for union-led learning.
"The         evidence base provided by the research has determined the priorities we         have set for the application of learning funds, both by directing         funding towards the longer-term sustainability of union led learning         across Scotland, and benefitting adult and particularly non-traditional         adult learners".
(Source 1)     Impact on unions and members:       The evaluation indicated that ULL was only sustainable if all key       stakeholder groups benefitted from it and that unions needed to benefit       directly as institutions as well as indirectly through benefits to their       members.
The evaluation recommended `mainstreaming' of learning activities       in unions and that unions should make learning more sustainable in the       short to medium term.
The evaluation also encouraged unions to link       learning with organising strategies.
Both of these recommendations have       been taken on board by many unions: "A considerable challenge for         unions has been integrating (or `mainstreaming') union-led learning into         their `core business'.
The finding of the research that union-led         learning is only sustainable if unions acquire benefit directly as         institutions as well as indirectly through benefits to their members,         has been key to encouraging many unions to amend their strategic         priorities to make learning more sustainable in the short to medium term         and to link learning with organising strategies".
(Source 1).
Impact on employers:       The learning evaluation and subsequent learning and skills deployment       research focussed on how unions, employers and employees might enhance       skills utilisation.
In action research cases, the researchers worked with       employers, employees and unions to effect changes in working practice and       provide business and employee benefits through development of e.g.
new HR       practice and new business activity (Source 3).
The former has enhanced HR       development and improved employee access to new work areas.
The latter has       produced direct cost savings (through reusing white goods) and indirect       savings on landfill costs (Source 3).
Beyond the clear benefits to the       case companies, dissemination over 2011 and 2012 through reports, a DVD, a       conference, presentations and workshop materials engaged union and       employer interest, resulting in greater emphasis on using skills       effectively in bids to SUL/Scottish Government for funding in 2012 (Source       9).
As Susan Cassidy of Communitas points out (Source 5): "The         legacy...has been in the strategic development of the work Community and         Communitas do around learning and skills in Scotland.
In particular, our         experience in engaging with RSBi, forming a Joint Learning Committee and         organising workplace learning with a skills utilisation objective, has         been invaluable in the evolution of our learning strategy in Scotland.
A         practical example is the work we are currently undertaking within Tata         Steel ... around skills utilisation regarding the use of digital         technology within two major steel plants.
This initiative will cover the         entire workforce, within two steel plants in Lanarkshire.
Without our         previous experience with Professor Findlay, undertaking this initiative         within Tata Steel would have been significantly more challenging...it         also had a major contribution in developing a future strategy in terms         of working with employers in an innovative and progressive way."
Impact on policy community:       In 2012, the issue of effective skills utilisation became a prominent       policy concern in Scotland, and this research has made a significant       contribution to the debate through the production of a Paper on Skills       Utilisation for Skills in Focus Series (with Warhurst) and a presentation       to high level policy, public agency and workplace stakeholders at an       invitation-only Skills Committee seminar in that year.
The value of this       work to employers, employees and the policy community has been       acknowledged by Paul McKelvie OBE, Chair of the Joint Skills Committee and       SDS board member (source 7), and has been endorsed in SDS's submissions to       the Scottish Funding Council (source 8).
Impact on rUK:       The evaluation framework (SPICE) used in this research impacted on the       conduct of evaluations of union-led learning elsewhere in the UK and       became the template for the evaluation of the Union Learning fund in       England and Wales in 2010, which incorporated the SULF SPICE framework.
As       Bert Clough of Unionlearn explains: "The evaluation of the Union         Learning Fund (ULF) Rounds 8 - 11 and Unionlearn undertaken in 2010 was         underpinned by the framework which built on the five-level SPICE ...         framework developed for the Scottish Union Learning Fund (SULF)....
Although SULF is smaller scale than ULF, the TUC felt that given the         robustness of the evaluation the framework would act as an appropriate         and effective assessment of the additionality and the contribution ULF         made to union-led learning in England......
The inclusion of these         dimensions ... led to a comprehensive evaluation of ULF.
The evaluation         provided evidence of significant added value which led to the         continuance of the level of ULF funding by the Coalition Government at a         time when the further education budget was cut by 25 %."
