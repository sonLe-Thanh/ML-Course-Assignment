     Research insights have had direct impacts on policy makers in central         government, virtually all of which occurred after 2007.
However,       brief reference should be made of one key contextual development: the 2007       DCLG Select Committee on Coastal Towns.
In its report, http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/351.pdf       that Committee made 13 references to the evidence base in 'The Seaside         Economy' (Ref 4, G3), the key output from the ESRC funded       research on Seaside Towns.
The DCLG Select Committee made two       recommendations which informed post 2007 impact.
First, the Committee recommended 'that the Government conducts an         immediate study on coastal tourism,' (p47 par 8) because "seaside         towns are the least understood of Britain's problem areas".
In       response to this recommendation, in 2008 via its Neighbourhoods, Cities       and Regions Expert Panel, DCLG (S1) commissioned Fothergill to draft, 'England's         Coastal Towns: a short review of the issues, evidence base and research         needs'.
That paper suggested various topics for further research.
Two of these, a statistical `benchmarking' study (G5, S1, S9), and a       report on tourism (G8, S2, S9), were subsequently commissioned from Beatty       and Fothergill.
A further piece of research suggested by Fothergill's 2008       report, was undertaken by DWP in 2009.
This involved an analysis of trends       in incapacity claimants in seaside towns, an exercise facilitated by the       use of the CRESR-developed ward-based definition of seaside towns (output       from G3, Refs 4,5) which Beatty and Fothergill licenced to DCLG for use       across all Government departments (S1).
Second, the 2007 Select Committee argued that Government needed to       appreciate the diverse needs of seaside towns.
This recommendation       resulted in the 2008 commissioning by DCLG of a benchmarking study (G5,       S1), findings from which were presented (29/7/08) to the Whitehall cross-government 	  Coastal Towns Working Group comprising senior civil servants       with lead responsibility for coastal issues (S1,S6 par 7-9)).
This led to       Beatty and Fothergill being commissioned to provide an evidence base on       smaller seaside towns (G7, S1, S6 par 61-63).
Two further presentations       were made to the Coastal Towns Working Group (24/11/09) (G7,S6) and in       2010 (G8).
Similarly two presentations were made to the Regional       Development Agencies' Coastal Areas Network on coastal communities       (26/6/08) (G7), and (7/7/10) (G8) and also to Welsh Government officials       (10/6/10) (G6).
In turn the March 2010 CLG Update Note on Coastal         Towns (extract below from S6) documented the impact of the Beatty       and Fothergill Benchmarking study (G5, S1, S3, S4) and the subsequent       commissioning of G7:            England's Seaside Towns &#8212; A 'Benchmarking' Study published by CLG           in 2008 has been well received.
The study helped to fill the evidence           gap that existed on seaside towns.
It reveals that the nature and           extent of the challenges faced by seaside towns vary considerably from           one location to another.........
The study is helpful to local           authorities covered in the report, as evidence for developing their           community plans and priorities.
A benchmarking study of smaller coastal towns (below 10,000           population) funded jointly by CLG, Defra and the Commission for Rural           Communities has been commissioned.
It will report in Spring 2010.'
The DCLG press release (S7) (4/3/11) accompanying the launch of the       subsequent smaller seaside towns research (Par 63 S5 above,G7, S1)       included a statement from Secretary of State, Eric Pickles MP:     'A new report by Sheffield Hallam University on small seaside towns,         paints a compelling picture of economic and social challenges,         enterprise and resilience over the last decade.'
'Mr Pickles         believes today's report underlines the need for a new approach to         coastal resorts, which have growth potential that needs to be harnessed         locally.'
The Secretary of State was also quoted in the press release:     "Today's report paints a picture of resilience and enterprise in rural         seaside towns, despite missing out on the London centric growth and         prosperity of the past decade."
"Small coastal resorts have shown they         can build stronger, more diverse economies when given the chance."
Informed by evidence developed by Beatty and Fothergill, the Coalition       Government's new approach to seaside towns, was announced on 22/7/11 with       the creation of a Coastal Communities Fund, worth approximately &#163;25m a       year.
Fothergill was subsequently invited to a ministerial seminar on       coastal towns (11/7/12), at which the CRESR studies were the only academic       studies alluded to by the Secretary of State in his opening remarks (S1).
Moreover, Government Policy Statements supporting economic development       projects in coastal and seaside areas (23/8/13) (S8) used the 2008 Beatty       and Fothergill benchmarking study (G5) as background evidence supporting       the policy decision to develop the Coastal Communities Fund.
Paralleling this impact on government policy, research insights have also       informed and benefited broader political debate (S9) by providing       evidence on the needs of seaside towns.
The tourism report (G8, Ref 6) was       quoted by several MPs including John Penrose MP for Weston-Super-Mare       (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Culture, Olympics, Media and       Sport) (S9) (25/6/10).
Subsequently, Fothergill was invited by Mark       Simmonds, MP for Boston and Skegness, to address MPs in the Conservative       Coastal Towns Group (7/7/10) with regard to evidence on seaside towns       (G5-8).
In addition, the tourism, (G8) and the benchmarking, studies       (G5,G7), were quoted extensively by five different MPs - including the       minister responding on behalf of government - in the Parliament       Adjournment Debate on Coastal Towns (S9) (20/7/10).
Media coverage       resulting from G9 also focused on the finding that some seaside towns had       been particularly badly hit by welfare reforms, with research findings       also eliciting a response from the Prime Minister (S10).
Finally, research insights have had an impact on policy development         within seaside towns.
Since 2008, presentations have been given at       four Annual Conferences of British Destinations (formerly BRADA) (S2)       representing local authorities (S3) and trade bodies in seaside towns,       Coastnet (2009), and the Local Government Association tourism and leisure       network (2010).
The Coastal Regeneration Handbook, published in       2010 by the Coastal Communities Alliance (S3), which lobbies on behalf of       seaside towns, gives 14 references to this CRESR research programme.
The       research team was also commissioned by the South East Local Enterprise       Partnership (S5) to provide an evidence base for SE coastal communities       which was disseminated at a seminar (12/9/12) attended by thirty       representatives from local authorities around the SE coast.
This       culminated in further research in 2013 setting out ten priorities for the       region's coastal communities (S5).
