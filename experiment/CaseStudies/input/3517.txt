     The adoption of guidelines based on our research was stimulated by the       publication by the EU       Commission of the Physical Agents Directive 2004/40/EC in 2004.
The aim of       this Directive was to       harmonise European legislation and establish a formal legal framework for       electromagnetic field       (EMF) exposure of workers, which would have been based on the guidelines       issued by the       International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in       1998 [Health Physics       74 (4):494 522; 1998].
The Exposure Limit Value (a current density of 10       mA m-2) relating to       exposure to magnetic fields in the frequency range 0-100 kHz, which was       proposed in the-       Directive, would have rendered many common MRI procedures illegal in       Europe (as detailed in a       report by the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) [A]).
The Directive       would consequently have       had a severe, negative impact on patients, health professionals, and       scanner manufacturers.
However, this Exposure Limit Value was based on the extrapolation of old       or very limited data.
Through the programme of research described above, we produced a body of       work which updated,       and/or contradicted, the data on which the proposed EU limits were based.
Our research thus       provided a platform for a lobbying process (described below, and in the       Institute of Physics report       "MRI and the Physical Agents (EMF) Directive", November 2008).
In 2009,       this lobbying resulted in       the relaxation of the ICNIRP static field exposure guidelines for MRI       (described in a draft report of       which Gowland is a co-author) and later produced a derogation of       MRI from the scope of the 2004       EU directive.
The Nottingham group used their research to influence the UK government       to lobby for changes in       the proposed EU guidelines.
A letter sent by Nottingham MRI physicists Gowland       and Morris (with       four other leading members of the UK MRI community) to Dr. Strather of the       National Radiological       Protection Board (NPRB) in June 2003 [B] drew attention to the       unreliability of the, then, ICNIRP       guidelines, and the impact on MRI of adopting the guidelines proposed by       the EU.
Subsequently,       the lobbying was channelled through the Institute of Physics and       Engineering in Medicine (IPEM)       with Prof. Stephen Keevil (now IPEM President) playing a central role in       publicising the issue       through the national media (article in the Guardian [C]) with support from       Sense about Science, an       independent charitable trust.
These activities led to a meeting with Lord       Hunt (2005, then Minister       of State at the Department for Work and Pensions) and an inquiry by the       House of Commons       Science and Technology Committee (to which Keevil, Gowland and       others provided evidence [D]).
This committee produced a report in June 2006 [D], which was critical of       the HSE, the UK Health       Protection Agency (HPA), ICNIRP and the European Commission.
In 2007, the       Alliance for MRI       was formed and presented an HSE-commissioned report [A], which draws upon       our research [6],       in Brussels.
Subsequently, a new Directive 2008/46/EC was adopted (23rd       April 2008).
This       postponed the transposition deadline of Directive 2004/40/EC to 30th       April 2012.
ICNIRP then re-       evaluated the relevant underlying science, drawing extensively on our work       [1-5], and introduced       new guidelines.
On the 29th June 2013 Directive 2004/40/EC was       repealed and a new directive       2013/35/EU, based on guidelines from ICNIRP, in turn based on our       research, became official EU       law.
4.1 Evidence for the Impact of our research     4.1.1 Impact on Public Policy: Changing Underpinning Legal Frameworks            The recommended action limits for low frequency magnetic field         exposure in our published         work [1,4], have been incorporated into guidelines by: ICNIRP (2009)         [E]; the HPA (2008) [F];         and the British Standards Institute and International Electrotechnical         Commission (2008) [G].
These recommended limits have global reach since ICNIRP is formally         recognised by the         World Health Organisation.
In addition, Gowland was invited to         join (March 2013) the ICNIRP         Scientific Expert Group (SEG), contributing her expertise in MRI.
The ICNIRP guidelines, based in part on our research, have been         incorporated within the legal         framework for EMF exposure in Europe (population circa 500M).
Workers in         the EU who may         be exposed to high magnetic fields will thus benefit from a more robust         understanding of the         effects of occupational electromagnetic field exposure.
The role and importance of Nottingham research in providing the         scientific basis for lobbying         UK and EU government organisations is confirmed by IPEM President-elect,         Prof. Stephen         Keevil who states, [H]          `The work of the Nottingham group has made a tremendous contribution         to the body of         science underpinning negotiations about the EU EMF Directive, and         particularly has helped         MRI practitioners in their attempts to mitigate the adverse impact of         this legislation on MRI         in clinical practice and research.
In an area where there are         significant gaps in the         literature, leading to assumptions and suppositions with little evidence         to support them, this         work has been very significant in our negotiations with the European         Commission and has         also had a major influence on the International Commission on         Non-Ionising Radiation         Protection (ICNIRP).
It is of lasting significance to the MRI community         in Europe and         beyond.'

4.1.2 Impact on Health and Economy     The revision of the original guidelines in the EU 2004/40/EC Directive       based on the Nottingham       work has mitigated a number of effects.
The beneficiaries of these are:            Patients undergoing MRI: if the Directive had proceeded as originally         planned, high-field (&#8805;3T)         MRI would have ceased until major and costly scanner redesigns could         have been         implemented, and the use of 1.5T MRI would have been limited [I].
This         would have had         particular impact on: patients suffering from neurological disease,         cancer and other serious         conditions where MRI is the leading, and sometimes only, relevant         non-invasive diagnostic         technique; patients requiring constant monitoring by staff during         scanning &#8212; this includes         patients under anaesthesia and paediatric patients for whom alternative         modalities, such as X-         ray Computed Tomography (CT), have clear associated risks (there are 500         lifetime deaths         associated with the 600,000 paediatric CT scans performed annually in         the UK); patients for         whom interventional MRI has replaced more invasive alternative         procedures.
Overall the         European population has retained the full health benefits of mid- and         high-field MRI as a         consequence of the relaxation of the original EU directive, a process in         which our research and         lobbying played a critical role.
The National Health Service (NHS): in 2011 the NHS had 304 MRI         scanners with an average         cost of &#163;895k per scanner [National Audit Office, "Managing High Value         Capital Equipment in         the NHS" (2011)].
The EU Directive would have either introduced major         constraints on the use         of this equipment, or significant modification costs to make their use         legal.
Estimating the         resulting financial cost is problematic, but the overall scale of         investment in MRI by the NHS is         ~&#163;270M (see above) so that modification costs, or reduced use, even in         the range of 5-10%         would have had a significant impact on health budgets and/or delivery of         healthcare.
European Manufacturers of MRI scanners: the Directive would have         required radical         modifications to equipment and working practice to avoid exposure of         workers involved in the         manufacture, operation and servicing of equipment for no scientific or         clinical benefit.
In 2007         the UK MRI industry supported ~ 4000 jobs and a value-added contribution         to GDP of &#163;195M         [J].
Since companies outside Europe, notably those in the USA, would not         have been governed         by the guidelines, this would have endangered the viability of European         industry and reduced         global competition.
