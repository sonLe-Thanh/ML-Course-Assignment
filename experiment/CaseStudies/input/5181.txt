     [a] Overseas Development Assistance     Cartwright's work brought her to the attention of a number of bodies       concerned with policy (and       with the right ways for evidence to impact on policy) in the US as well as       in the UK.
For example, a       study was commissioned in 2011 by the DFID (Department for International       Development) into       `Broadening the Range of Designs and Methods for Impact Evaluations' [6]       with the particular       impact at issue here being that of aid initiatives.
Cartwright was       extensively consulted as an       advisor to the study team headed by Elliot Stern.
The Study Group       published their DFID Report in       2012.
Stern [7] wrote to Cartwright on publication: `I am grateful for       your inputs both active (in your       very helpful comments) and indirectly by informing us through your       writings.'
There are 14       references to Cartwright's work (often leading into extensive       presentations of her views) in the       Report [6] especially to her [1] and [2]]; the Appendix, characterised as       a `Background Paper' to       the Report and with the title `Models of Causality and Causal Inference`       draws almost entirely and       in detail on her approach; section 3.62 entitled `The `strength' of causal       influence' draws on her       distinction between `clinchers' and `vouchers' [Cartwright [1])]; and       section 4.5 is entitled `Impact       Evaluation Question 4: Will the Intervention Work Elsewhere?'
which is the       central question that       Cartwright is addressing in her work.
Donor agencies (including the World       Bank, OECD, and       country donors such as DFID) have organised conferences discussing the       report's findings and       have used its findings in staff training.
Stern co-produced a report for       the Research Program on       Aquatic Agricultural systems (part of the Collaborative Group on       International Agricultural       Research), which explicitly cites Cartwright and draws on her analysis of       causation and evidence       (see [8]).
Through the DFID report, Michael Woolcock, Lead Social       Development Specialist at the       World Bank's Development Research Group, has become influenced by       Cartwright's views &#8212; a       recent working paper [9] makes much of Cartwright and Hardie's book.
And       Cartwright's ideas are       influencing researchers at the World Bank more generally (see, e.g.,       [10]).
[b] Mental Health Care Provision     The New Savoy Partnership is a grouping of organisations &#8212; including the       Royal College of       Psychiatrists, the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), Mind       and several others &#8212;       aimed at improving mental health care provision in the UK.
It had noted       that concerns had been       raised by a Health Select Committee Inquiry in 2007 about the evaluation       methodology used by       NICE (the National Institute for Clinical Excellence) for `talking       therapies'.
The Partnership       determined in 2011 to return to this issue with a view to affecting NICE       procedures directly.
A       working party was set up with Cartwright as a member.
This led to a       roundtable discussion which       produced a series of questions to be raised at a Keynote Panel discussion       at the       Partnership's Conference in September 2011 &#8212; this panel was chaired by Sir       Michael Rawlins,       then Head of NICE and included Cartwright (see [11]).
The views of the working party were published in a report by UKCP [12].
In line with Cartwright's       views, this report suggests `that an over-reliance on RCT evidence is       likely to impair and distort       guideline recommendations for psychological therapies'.
It points out       ([12], p.5) that `what works in       a particular place [may be] less good at predicting whether something       would work for other people       in other places; and suggests that `studies need to focus much more on how       treatments work       (mechanisms of change) and the factors that support or hinder them in       different ... contexts' (pp.
5-6).
These points are at the core of Cartwright's work.
The group subsequently       agreed a       `consensus statement on evidence' [13] submitted to NICE as a proposed       `starting point for NICE       to review its approach'.
Cartwright was one of 9 initial signatories of       this statement.
This in turn       informed the submission made by UKCP to the Health Select Committee       Inquiry into NICE in       Autumn 2012 which called, inter alia, for a `more pluralistic approach to       the evidence base around       effective treatments in relation to mental health'.
At that 2012 Health       Select Committee Inquiry the       incoming head of NICE, Professor David Haslam, committed himself to a       review of the way NICE       assesses the effectiveness of psychological therapies &#8212; discussions with       NICE are on-going and       changes to their Public Health Guidelines in line with UKCP's proposals       are expected ([14]).
[c] The Munro Report     Professor Eileen Munro from the LSE's Social Policy Department became       interested in       Cartwright's work on causes and evidence, and was one of the researchers       on the project       `Evidence for Use' led by Cartwright and housed at the LSE's CPNSS.
The       two did research       together leading to a joint paper in 2010 ([15]).
This paper shows the       extent to which Munro's       views on evidence for the effectiveness of intervention were shaped by       Cartwright's.
It considers       the case of multisystemic therapy, `an internationally adopted       intervention to try to diminish       antisocial behaviour in young people'.
It argues, following Cartwright's       general line, that evidence       for the effectiveness of this therapy has incorrectly been sought in terms       of RCTs and the like,       whereas the issue of whether the therapy will work in practice requires a       much more subtle view of       the evidence &#8212; essentially looking to build up evidence for the existence       of a stable capacity.
([15],       pp.260-3)     At the time that this joint research was published (2010), Munro was       asked by the Secretary of       State for Education to review the UK child protection system in the wake       of `Baby P' and other       cases.
She produced her final Report in 2011 ([16]).
Unsurprisingly the approach to evidence that       Munro took in producing that Report reflects Cartwright's       influence.
According to Munro ([17]),       Cartwright's work, `helped form ... the whole approach [taken in the Report]       to the real role of       research findings in [the] area and especially to the role of expertise       and expert reasoning'.
And       she further attests (ibid.
):     The Report, in particular chapter 6, and even more especially       sections 6.31 to 6.39 bear the       direct hallmarks of Cartwright's analysis.
It would have been very       different without her impact       that helped me clarify my thinking on the role and limitations of research       findings and to have       confidence to challenge the dominant version of evidence-based practice.
These sections       have the title `Using Evidence' and then cover a range of types of       evidence.
Without       Cartwright's influence on my work, I would have gone along with the       dominant usage where       `evidence' is being equated with "empirical research findings".
The Report made 15 recommendations, all of which were accepted by       the Government ([18]), thus       producing major changes in the education of social workers involved in       child care, the appraisal of       their work and impact, and the child care system in general ([19], [20]).
The Report has also had       impact beyond the UK.
For example, Munro was asked to give evidence to two       state government       reviews of child care in Australia and a charity in Queensland is running       a campaign to persuade       the state government to learn from her work.
