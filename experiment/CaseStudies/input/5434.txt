       Process from research to impact         The fact that the intrapulse spectroscopy technique allows         interference-free operation to be achieved in multi-pass optical cells         was patented by Langford, Duxbury and Normand in 2003.
The patent was         assigned to Cascade Technologies, a company started by Normand in 2003.
The transfer of intellectual property developed in the Physics         Department to Cascade Technologies has allowed the company to build         systems that have been applied to many different gas sensing scenarios.
The company has negotiated licence agreements with industry, leading to         the application of the technology in a variety of fields       Types of impact         The initial impact of the research was in the formation of a company         that brought economic benefit to the UK and in the growth of a highly         skilled international workforce.
Over the period from 2008 to 2013 the         company workforce has continued to expand from 25 to 50 employees (eight         possess PhD degrees and nine have BSc / BEng degrees).
The benefits are         now more wide ranging, as the instrumentation solutions sold by Cascade         Technologies are used in the monitoring of pollution (both marine and         automotive), detection of leaks in aerosol systems, and the detection of         minute traces of explosives.
The sensors developed by Cascade         Technologies are used to ensure that the companies that have purchased         the instrumentation meet the strict emission guidelines set out by EU         and USA regulatory bodies.
Reach and Significance         Economic benefits in UK         Cascade Technologies was the first supplier of quantum cascade laser         based spectrometers capable of making trace gas measurements.
Over the         period 2008 to 2013 Cascade Technologies' turnover has increased         year-on-year from just under &#163;1 million to &#163;6 million, as shown in         Figure 1.
In the financial year 2012/13 Cascade Technologies sold instrumentation         solutions all over the world and the breakdown of sales was: Far East         46%; Europe 32%; USA 17%; Australasia 5%.
Cascade Technologies core         markets are in supporting the automotive industry (44% of sales),         process monitoring (31% of sales) pollution monitoring (24% of sales)         and other markets took up the final 2% of sales (Source C1).
Figure 1: Annual turnover over the REF period              In the year 2011/12 Cascade Technologies was recognised as one of the         100 fastest growing privately owned technology companies by Panoramic         Growth Equity (Source C3) and in 2012 Cascade Technologies was ranked 94th         in the annual league table of Britain's fastest-growing private         technology companies compiled by Fast Track in association with The         Sunday Times.
The impact of the Strathclyde research has continued to expand as         illustrated by the following examples:       Environmental process monitoring &#8212; The intrapulse spectroscopy         technique is a key feature of an aerosol leak detection system that was         released in by Cascade Technologies in 2010.
The CT2210 Micro Leak         Detector offers a simple cost-effective approach to detecting defective         aerosol cans when compared with the existing approaches of monitoring         bubbles in water baths, using acoustic sensors or flame ionisation         detectors.
It can operate on production lines running at up to 500 cans         per minute compared with the 150-200 cans per minute limitation for         conventional systems (Source C4).
The system satisfies the leak         detection performance requirements as specified by the F&#233;d&#233;ration         Europ&#233;enne des A&#233;rosols (FEA) in its FEA Waterbath Alternative         Guidelines and has been certified to comply with EU transport         regulations.
To date (June 2013), 50 of the CT2210 units have been sold         worldwide, from the UK to Argentina.
The effectiveness of the         instrumentation for process control was recognised by the British         Aerosol Manufacturers Association through the award of the         "Environmental Benefits" Award in 2012 (Source C5).
Global Pollution monitoring &#8212; In 2008, Cascade Technologies         agreed a technology licensing agreement with BP to supply emissions         monitoring systems for use in the marine industry.
Following trials of         the instrumentation (CT2100) the technology licensing agreement was         extended in 2008 for a further five years to 2013 (Source C6), and the         instrumentation is currently being installed on the commercial fleets of         a number of shipping companies both in Europe and the US to monitor         emissions and check that these emissions meet EU defined levels.
These         fleets include both cargo ships and cruise liners.
The American Bureau         of Shipping has issued the CT2100 a confirmation of Product Type         Approval (Source C7).
The Cascade Technologies system is also the basis         of the MEXA-1400QL-NX measurement system supplied by Horiba         International to the auto-motive industry for the detection of NO, N2O,         NO2 and NH3 from car engines (Sources C8, C9).
Defence and security at a major international airport &#8212; The         potential of the intrapulse technique to detect explosives was         demonstrated in 2005 and in 2009 Cascade entered a partnership with         Morpho a division of the Sarfan group to develop a system for detecting         the pre-cursors of improvised explosive devices (Source C10).
A         walk-through portal containing an intrapulse spectrometer was installed         at Glasgow International Airport in 2010 (Source C10).
Over the period         of the trial approximately 12 million people were scanned by the device.
There are on-going discussions between Cascade, Morpho and civil         aviation authorities regarding the implementation of the Cascade         Technologies sensor system and these are subject to confidentiality         agreements.
