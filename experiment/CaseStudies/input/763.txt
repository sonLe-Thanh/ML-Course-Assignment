     (1) Research carried out by the group led directly to the introduction of       the technique into the Sculpture Conservation department of the pioneering       Conservation Centre at National Museums Liverpool and to the development       of the UK's first commercially available laser cleaning system for       conservation in the `Phoenix Classic' Q-switched Nd:YAG system       manufactured by Lynton Lasers Ltd [5.1].
Lynton Lasers remains the       UK's leading supplier of laser cleaning systems to the heritage field,       having sold around 40 systems in the past 15 years to customers in the UK,       USA, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Australia, Singapore, South Korea and       Kuwait [5.1].
We note that laser cleaning has not replaced other       techniques, rather it extended the range of tools available to the       conservator [5.1].
The impact of this work is substantive as it       was disruptive to the discipline.
(2) preservation and restoration of world           heritage sites and of works of art.
Loughborough University PhD graduate Dr Martin Cooper, former head of       Conservation Technologies at National Museums Liverpool, applied the laser       cleaning technologies he helped develop at Loughborough University       (including work on the gargoyles of Lincoln Cathedral) to collections that       range from ancient Egyptian and Greek artefacts, the Liverpool           Eros as well as Nelson and King Edward VII Monuments, Liverpool and           Manchester Cenotaphs, Peter Pan by Sir George Frampton       in Sefton Park, Southport's Queen Victoria monument [5.1]       through to modernist artistic works by Henry Moore       and Jacob Epstein.
One of the other key researchers on this project, Dr. Pouli Paraskevi       completed her PhD "Laser cleaning studies on stonework and polychromed         surfaces" at Loughborough University in 2000.
She is now at the       Foundation for Research and Technology &#8212; Hellas (FORTH) Institute of       Electronic Structure &amp; Laser at the Heraklion in Crete, Greece.
Extending her research at Loughborough University, she is responsible for       laser-cleaning projects on the Athens Acropolis sculptures       including the Parthenon West Frieze and the Caryatids       of the Erechtheion [5.2].
She has coordinated and/or       participated in many other laser cleaning projects at national, bilateral       and EU level (such as Cultural Heritage Advanced Research Infrastructures       [CHARISMA] an FP7 Capacities Specific Programme Research Infrastructures).
This activity also included collaborating internationally with the British       Museum between 2006 and 2009.
She has since gone on to publish A Nevin, P.       Pouli, S. Georgiou &amp; C. Fotakis, Laser conservation of art, Nature       Materials 6, 320 - 322 (2007) and R. Radvan, J.F.

We also note that popular reports on these activities contribute to promoting           public understanding and appreciation of the       accomplishments of the conservation profession [see, for       example, 5.3].
The first figure of this section shows "The         laser cleaning of the Acropolis monument sculptures is taking place         since 2002 within the framework of a collaborative project between         IESL-FORTH, the Acropolis Restoration Service, the 1st Ephorate of         Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities and the Acropolis Museum."

(3) Recent innovation in the use of laser cleaning has seen the       restoration of artefacts in an open museum, improved public           services as the museum does not need to withdraw artefacts       during the restoration process, and also enhances the visitor experience changing           awareness and promoting public understanding of, and           engagement with, the appreciation of the accomplishments of the           conservation process as the general public is directly exposed       to the live restoration of artefacts [5.2].
The figures above       right show laser cleaning in an open museum (The Acropolis) and were taken       from [http://www.marblesreunited.org.uk/news/acropolis-museum-wins-2012-keck-award-its-conservation-works].
This work at the Acropolis, enabled by laser cleaning, won the 2012 Keck       award for "most towards promoting public understanding and         appreciation of the accomplishments of the conservation profession"       [5.2].
(4) Toxic chemicals used in conventional cleaning techniques can       be harmful either directly to the conservationist working on a particular       piece or the environment (for example, through the release of greenhouse       gasses or other environmentally harmful chemicals).
The adoption of laser       cleaning, which avoids the need to use these substances, in the       conservation process has therefore been of benefit to both health       and the environment [see, for example, [5.4] which       also makes reference to the Montreal protocol and cites the Loughborough       University group M.I.
Cooper, D.C. Emmony, and J.H.
Larson (1992) The         use of laser energy to clean polluted stone sculpture.
J Photogr Sci       40:55]     (5) Impact on conservation practitioners: Loughborough University       PhD graduate Dr Martin Cooper and former Head of Conservation Technologies       at National Museums Liverpool ran professional training where over           two hundred conservators from around the world attended the       laser cleaning course in Liverpool [5.1].
Dissemination activities       including workshops, conferences, publications and training courses       organised by NML (largely through the efforts of staff from the       Loughborough University group) led to acceptance of the technique           within the conservation profession [5.1].
Within the       UK, most major museums now have their own laser cleaning system and a       number of conservators trained in its use.
These institutions include: The       British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum,       Birmingham Museum, Manchester Museum, National Museums Liverpool and       Historic Scotland [5.1].
Members of the group have been on the       Permanent Scientific Committee of the Lasers in the Conservation of       Artworks conference series since its inception in 1995.
LACONA is now held       every two years and is attended by 150-200 delegates from around the world       [5.1].
Dr Cooper published the first book to be written on this       subject (with John Larson) entitled, Laser Cleaning in Conservation: An       Introduction (Conservation and Museology), Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann       (1998) ISBN-13:978-0750631174 (also translated into Italian ISBN-13:       978-8470904172).
This book has 197 citations on google scholar and reviews       include: 'This is a useful book and should be on every conservator's and       cleaning company's shelves &#8212; and it should be taken off the shelves every       now and then too.
', Natural Stone Specialist; 'It deserves a wide       circulation.
', Journal of Architectural Conservation and 'This important       new book is the first general study of the uses of lasers for cleaning art       objects by conservators and will be of interest to the whole conservation       community.
', International Journal of Heritage Studies.
Moreover, this       title is valued by both scientists and professional practitioners in the       field [5.2].
As such, changes to professional training and           practice have been informed by Loughborough University's research on           laser cleaning.
