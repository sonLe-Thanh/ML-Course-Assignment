     Overview     The primary impact of the Newcastle PARP project is the development of       the anticancer drug       Rucaparib.
In addition, the Newcastle research has stimulated PARP       research worldwide, which       has led to further potent inhibitors.
PARP research now embraces the       global pharmaceutical       industry (over 10 companies), with 33 cancer trials involving PARP       inhibitors completed and an       additional 52 trials currently open.
Through these trials (50 Phase I, 33       Phase II and 2 Phase III)       more than 7000 patients exhibiting 8 types of cancer have been treated       with a PARP-1 inhibitor so       far, including more than 200 patients who have received Rucaparib.
The       successful exploitation of       PARP has established:             Structure-based drug design (SBDD) as a major tool in cancer         drug discovery.
DNA damage repair as a viable target.
Beneficiaries     The research has had a significant impact on the global pharmaceutical       industry, with companies       such as AstraZeneca, Clovis, Sanofi-Aventis, Abbott, Merck, Biomarin,       Eisai, Cephalon and       Genentech having invested heavily in clinical trials and clinical PARP       inhibitor programmes [E1].
Since the initial clinical trials in Newcastle in which patients were       treated with a PARP inhibitor for       the first time, there has been a twenty-fold increase in the commencement       of trials testing PARP       inhibitors [data extracted from E1].
Since the initial Phase 1 trial in 2003, more than 7000 cancer patients       (approximately 750 of which       have been recruited to more than one phase) have entered clinical trials       involving PARP inhibitors       [E1].
Five thousand six-hundred of these patients were enrolled       since 2008.
These trials include       patients with ovarian cancer (incidence rate in the UK: 21 cases for every       100,000 women), breast       cancer (157 new breast cancer cases for every 100,000 women and 1 for       every 100,000 males in       the UK) and prostate cancer (134 new prostate cancer cases for every       100,000 males in the UK;       [E2]).
Thirty-three cancer trials involving PARP inhibitors have       been completed with an additional       52 trials currently open, totalling 50 Phase I, 33 Phase II and 2 Phase       III trials [E1].
In 2011 the       average per patient cost associated with a Phase I, II and III trial in       Oncology were reported to be       $21,883, $73,303 and $65,900 respectively [E3].
Therefore, an       estimated $385 million US dollars       has been invested into PARP inhibitor trials in the period 2008-2013.
In the earliest clinical trials of Rucaparib (2003 and 2005), although       some patients had a life       expectancy of only a few months, two treated in 2003 in the first clinical       trial and five from a 2005       Phase II study with one exception are still alive and cancer-free [E4].
In one Phase II trial,       treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib has significantly reduced the       size of tumours in 38 % of       breast cancer patients (9 of 24 patients) [E5].
Similarly, a Phase       II trial showed that this drug was       well tolerated in ovarian cancer patients with hereditary breast-ovarian       cancer syndrome, with 33%       (11 of 33 patients) showing reduced tumour size [E6].
As a consequence of Newcastle's PARP research, several other DNA damage       and repair targets       are now being explored and Newcastle is involved in many of these, e.g.
ATM, ATR, CHK1/2 and       DNA PK.
Timeline for the Impact of the Newcastle PARP Inhibitor Programme     1995 - 2000 &#8212; Discovery of potent small molecule PARP inhibitors and       initiation of a pre-clinical       collaboration with Agouron Pharmaceuticals resulting in the identification       of the first-in-class PARP       inhibitor for clinical evaluation in cancer patients.
2000 - 2005 &#8212; Initiation of the first clinical trials of a PARP inhibitor       in cancer in conjunction with       Cancer Research UK and multiple UK clinical centres (Belfast, Oxford,       Glasgow, Manchester,       Birmingham), and Pfizer.
2005 - 2010 &#8212; Demonstration of the synthetic lethal interaction of PARP       inhibition and BRCA       deficiency, and the initiation of clinical trials in defined at risk       patient groups in collaboration with       Cancer Research UK and Pfizer.
