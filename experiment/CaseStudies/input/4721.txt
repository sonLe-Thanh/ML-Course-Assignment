     i) Conserving, presenting, and developing awareness of cultural         heritage; changing         knowledge of and attitudes towards archaeology       &#199;alt&#305;lar village has a population of approximately 400 people, which       dwindles to about 100 in the       winter months because of its climate (the village is at an altitude of       1250m).
This is a very rural       area: the main activities are agriculture and animal husbandry.
The       village has two sawmills (each       employing about 6 people), two small caf&#233;s, two small stores selling       household goods, and two       eateries.
According to recent census reports, 10% of the village is       illiterate, and most of those who       are illiterate are women.
Of those who are literate, many attained       education only at primary school       level.
Before our activities described below, many of the villagers had       never attended educational       talks, seen exhibitions, or handled archaeological materials.
Between 2008       and 2012, Momigliano       organised 3 public meetings, interviews, and a poster exhibition in the       village to explain the nature       of &#199;AP's work, share preliminary results, and answer questions.
Approximately 80 people       (including many women and children) attended each of the public meetings       (2008, 2009, 2012),       and the exhibition attracted over 150 visitors between 2 and 11 August       2012 [a].
In addition,       interviews were held in &#199;alt&#305;lar in 2010 and 2012 with individuals and       various focus groups (ca.
50       people were involved in this activity) to gather information about the       villagers' attitudes to their local       heritage and the impact of the &#199;AP's activities on those attitudes [b].
These interviews       demonstrated that villagers have acquired much new knowledge about their       local history and also       changed their perceptions of archaeology: they now take more pride in       their local history and,       instead of simply destroying archaeological finds through agricultural       activities without further ado,       are more likely to report their existence to archaeologists, as indeed the       &#199;AP's team were able to       experience at first hand.
For example, a 32-year old female remarked that       her visit to the visitor       centre was her first exposure to a museum or archaeological exhibition of       any kind.
A 60-year old       male farmer highlighted how &#199;AP had developed his awareness of his       cultural heritage, which       prompted him to ask specifically that the archaeological finds remain in       Turkey [b].
ii) Influencing design and delivery of education in museums/schools       Momigliano achieved this through 1) advising local museum officials; 2)       creating a visitor centre       and other facilities at &#199;alt&#305;lar; and 3) producing information and       materials to be used in teaching by       museum staff in local schools [c, d].
More specifically, &#199;AP was       instrumental in the successful       joint application to the EU by the Fethiye Museum and Liverpool Victoria       Gallery and Museum for       their `Illuminating the Land of Light' educational project (ILL) in 2012,       as confirmed by the Fethiye       Museum director [c].
This project, funded by the EU-Turkish       Intercultural Dialogue Museum       Donation Programme aims to increase public awareness of cultural heritage       through educational       activities for 2,000 students in primary education and 500 students in       secondary education from       schools both in Fethiye and near significant historical sites, as Kamil       &#214;zer, the Mu&#287;la Director of       Culture and Tourism, explained in a local newspaper [j].
Momigliano was engaged in the early       stages of this project's design and, because of &#199;AP's research, &#199;alt&#305;lar       is the only pre-Classical       site that has been included in this educational programme [d].
Momigliano also started renovations       of two abandoned schools in &#199;alt&#305;lar village for research and educational       purposes, after being       granted permission by the local authorities in September 2009.
The       renovation of one school as a       visitor centre and the restoration of a traditional Lycian wooden granary       (ambar) were completed in       2012, and these facilities have been made available to other       projects/institutions (including the ILL       project), together with other materials (photos, posters from the       aforementioned exhibition, and       publications), so that thousands of schoolchildren in the whole of the       Fethiye district will obtain a       deeper understanding of their local history, now extending to the       Chalcolithic and Bronze Age       periods thanks to &#199;AP's discoveries [c, d].
The Fethiye Museum       Director commented that &#199;AP       `has made a most valuable contribution to our own educational programme       [ILL project] ...[whilst       the] restoration of the schools and of the ambar has already made an       impact on the local       community level, and will continue to make a practical and substantial       difference for years to       come.'
[c].
iii) Contributing to personal and professional development       Students from other UK and Turkish universities were trained in a variety       of archaeological       activities including: artefact drawing and photography; use of computer       programmes (excel and       access databases); use of electronic equipment for topographical survey       and geophysics;       systematic artefact surface collection.
In addition, they had to develop       teamwork skills, as required       by most of the project's activities.
Some of these Turkish students have       now obtained bursaries to       conduct postgraduate studies in Turkey and in the UK (acknowledging the       importance of their       experience at &#199;alt&#305;lar) [e] whilst a former Bristol student       (employed by Suffolk County Council       Archaeological Services since 2009) has used materials from &#199;AP to compete       successfully in a       world-wide photography competition (www.world-archaeology.com/news/photo-competition/).
iv) Providing temporary employment and economic benefits to local         people       &#199;AP contributed to the local and regional economic growth by providing       employment for up to 8       local people during the field-seasons and through other expenditure       supporting archaeological       work (such as car and house rental, etc.)
amounting to several thousands       of GBP each season [f].
&#199;AP has also had an impact on the village's infrastructure through the       aforementioned restorations       (schools and granary), which involved the employment of builders,       plumbers, electricians,       ironmongers, and carpenters.
Expenses for these restorations alone so far       have amounted to       about &#163;9000.
For comparative purposes, a typical worker's monthly salary       in this part of Turkey is       about &#163;300.     v) Developing stimuli to tourism and contributing to the quality of         the tourist experience.
&#199;AP's research activities have attracted visitors who would not have       normally come to this rural       area of SW Turkey.
For example, in 2009 a small group of Bristol       University Alumni (9 people) and,       in 2012, various politicians (a group of 20), journalists, and TV       reporters (4) visited &#199;alt&#305;lar.
After       the politicians', journalists', and TV reporters' visits, reports appeared       in local and national       newspapers, and TV programmes, including Sabah (a national daily       newspaper), which has a       circulation of more than 300,000 and TRT the national public broadcaster       of Turkey [g, h, i].
One       online version of the TRT television programme has been watched 186,340       times (as of 1       November 2013) [i].
This was the first time that &#199;alt&#305;lar had ever       appeared in national newspapers       and on TV programmes, as a direct result of &#199;AP's activities, and this was       considered a source of       pride and potential economic benefit by &#199;alt&#305;lar's villagers themselves [b]       because, thanks to this       publicity, more people are now aware of this village and will visit it in       the future.
The visitor centre       and poster exhibition contributed to the quality of the tourist       experience, offering intellectual       stimulation.
The poster exhibition was also shown in October 2012 at the       cultural festival of       &#214;l&#252;deniz (near Fethiye), one of the most famous tourist resorts in Turkey       (tourists come to Fethiye       and its beach resorts throughout the year, and from all over the world,       but mostly from the UK,       Russia, Germany, and Turkey).
About 150 people attended this opening,       which was also reported       in the local press [h].
Another exhibition of these posters is       planned in Fethiye in the winter of       2013/14 by a local tourist agency in collaboration with the local Rotary       Club, providing further       contribution to the quality of the tourist experience.
