     The period 2008-2013 has seen a growth of activity in CWRS and the       expansion of the WBIS       programme.
This has resulted directly from the earlier research work       (detailed in section 2) which       laid the foundations for such development.
The number of learners       undertaking negotiated WBL       through the WBIS programme across the University has grown to circa 1500       (2013).
WBL not only       has a significant impact on personal and professional development but the       work-learning       combination brings about significant and positive change within       businesses.
Building on the       experience of WBIS, CWRS designed and validated (2009), a Doctor of       Professional Studies award       and is now working with professionals who are using this route of academic       study to undertake       major projects in the workplace that will have significant impact on the       businesses and       organisations in which they work.
The following four examples illustrate the impact CWRS and the WBIS       framework have had in the       period 2008-2013.
Department of Work &amp; Pensions (DWP), Pensions, Disability &amp;         Carers Service (PDCS).
CWRS was awarded a contract in 2005 (renewed in 2008) to work with the         PDCS of the         DWP to provide consultancy and to work with PDCS trainers to design,         develop and deliver         a new programme of staff development aiming to raise the quality of         decision making of         client claims.
This large scale project (1400 Decision Makers) resulted         in better and more         informed decisions being made.
This improved organisational performance,         and brought         about a professionalization of the role.
This intervention changed the         way decisions are         made through the adoption of new processes and a programme of education         focusing on         critical thinking and critical reflection.
The work of CWRS at the DWP         attracted the interest         of HEFCE who requested a publication (HEFCE funded) outlining the scope         and progress of         the project.
In turn, the project leader at DWP gave a key-note lecture         at the annual UVAC         conference.
This contract ended in 2012.
Evidence from a senior manager         in the DWP (see         section 5) speaks of "improvements in quality of decisions and the         beneficial impact on both         staff and claimants"       Wirral University Hospital at Arrowe Park.
CWRS has provided         non-medical education         through the WBIS programme at Arrowe Park throughout 2008-2013.
Professional         development through WBL engages managers, administrators, nurses,         midwives and         doctors with each on an individually negotiated study pathway with many         opting to take         modules designed in partnership with the employer to address specific         business needs.
Engagement with WBL impacts positively in personal and professional         contexts and enables         the hospital to introduce courses to help with the management of change         and to bring about         improvements to service delivery while enhancing its standing as a         learning organisation.
The introduction of a Post Graduate Certificate in Work Based Learning         Facilitation         (PGCWBLF, 2008).
The programme deals with theoretical and practical         issues concerning         WBL including a module on the specific skills involved in learning         facilitation.
This is a dual-accredited         programme offering also Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy.
While         the impact is directly on the development of the capabilities of the FE         lecturers, in-house         company trainers and independent consultants who work with the CWRS,         indirectly the         impact is much greater in terms of the dozens of businesses and many         hundreds of         individual employees they work with.
In 2011 the programme was opened up         to academic         staff from other universities to share expertise and to build the WBL         capacity of the HE         sector generally.
Three UK universities have registered members of their         academic staff on         the programme and currently CWRS is in negotiations with two European         universities who         wish to develop WBL provision.
Significant impact on staff, students and         professional         practice have been reported (as evidenced in section 5, letter from         University of Greenwich)         in terms of "great influence on the University" and "leading to the         development of our own         post graduate programmes" using Chester as a model.
The Forum of Mobility Centres began working in collaboration with CWRS         in 2011 to         develop a programme of WBL to address the educational and professional         development         needs of its staff which represent a wide diversity of professional         backgrounds.
Students         have not only enhanced their professional skills and knowledge, but have         also begun a         process of critical review of current professional practice across the         mobility sector.
Through         this process of knowledge development and critical review, there is         emergence of improving         professional practice and a stronger recognition of, and reliance upon,         practitioner research         and evidenced based practices that will facilitate higher levels of         service provision.
The         impact on the organization has been reported as "a significant change of         organisational         culture" and "an emerging expectation and ambition of practitioners to         develop enhanced         workplace practices through research focussed professional development".
(See section 5         corroborative letter from The Forum of Mobility Centres).
As a result of the growing reputation of CWRS further significant       business opportunities involving       hundreds of learners are opening up including a number at international       level.
