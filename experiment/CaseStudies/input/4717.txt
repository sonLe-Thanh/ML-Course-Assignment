     Background     Between the publication of the British Museum's report on Lindow Man in       1986 and the       commencement of Hutton's research project in 2003, Lindow Man was used       repeatedly as almost       certain evidence for human sacrifice in Iron Age Britain.
Lindow Man       featured as such in the work       of leading experts in British history such as Sir Barry Cunliffe, Miranda       Aldhouse-Green, Timothy       Taylor, Mike Parker Pearson and Ralph Merrifield, and in a popular book by       the pioneer of       research into Iron Age religion, Anne Ross, and Don Robins.
Hutton had       himself repeated this       reading of the body as orthodoxy in a textbook published in 1991.
Furthermore, it was employed as       an argument against the toleration of modern spiritual traditions which       claimed the name of Druid,       by both fundamentalist Christian enterprises such as the Mayflower press       and secular-minded       journalists such as Jonathan Jones [a].
As such, it functioned in part as       a rallying point for religious       intolerance: its symbolic significance in national life went far beyond       the scholarly.
Professor Hutton was conscious by the late 1990s that rumours existed       with regard to the       unreliability of the traditional interpretation.
When he reviewed the       evidence in detail as part of his       project, he found these rumours to be well-founded.
He accordingly issued       a formal challenge to       the official story in the Times Literary Supplement (TLS) in 2004       [1], which led to a public exchange       of views with the British Museum curator responsible for the body, J. D.       Hill, who initially defended       the existing display.
Hutton urged that the body could, in fact, be viewed       plausibly as a victim of       sacrificial killing, but also as an executed criminal or a murder victim,       and that the last two       explanations were, given the dating, a little more likely.
He therefore       advocated an open-minded       official interpretation of the exhibit.
The labelling of the body was not       altered as a result, even when       the gallery which included it was refurbished in 2007 and even though       Hutton developed his case       in a book published that year [2].
Changing the display of the Lindow Man exhibition: the Manchester         Museum temporary         exhibition     In 2008, Lindow Man was loaned to the Manchester Museum, which exhibited       it in a manner that       invited a pluralist interpretation of its significance (as Hutton had       suggested), described by the       Head of Human Cultures at the Manchester Museum in an article as follows:     Acknowledging alternative interpretations of Lindow Man's death, and         changing attitudes towards         human remains in society, the Museum adopted a polyvocal approach to the         exhibition.
Eight         specially-selected contributors shared their personal thoughts and         theories about the dead man.
These included a forensic scientist, peat diggers involved in the         discovery, a landscape         archaeologist, a member of the local community, a Pagan and museum         curators from both the         British Museum and the Manchester Museum.
Personal items belonging to         each of the contributors         appeared alongside more conventional museum exhibits in order to explore         the different meanings         that Lindow Man has for different people.
[b]     The article indicates Hutton's role in this pluralist interpretation,       noting his questioning of the       orthodox position and his part in proposing a new interpretation, whilst       specifically referring to the       TLS article [2].
The museum also held a conference to mark the event, at       which Hutton was invited       to deliver the keynote address.
The British Museum was represented at that       by Hill's successor as       curator of the gallery which normally held the display, Jody Joy.
The       Lindow Man Temporary       Exhibition was significant for the Museum of Manchester in a number of       ways.
The exhibition was       visited by 133,413 people [c].
A survey by Morris Hargreaves McIntyre       indicates that in the July to       September 2008 period, total visits to the Manchester Museum increased by       23% compared to the       same period the previous year, and that half of those visitors came to see       Lindow Man.
The survey       also notes a significantly higher proportion of visitors coming from       outside Manchester [c].
A case       study for the University Museums Group, produced by the Manchester Museum,       offered further       measures of the exhibition's success:     Visitor figures were high.
There were over 26,000 hits on the Lindow         Man website.
The project won         two awards:- the Design Week 2009 Award for Best Temporary Exhibition         and the British         Archaeological Award for Best Innovation for its engagement of the         general public about the issue         of human remains.
Over 12,500 visitor comments cards were filled-in.
[d]     The effect on the Manchester Museum went beyond attracting new visitors       to the museum and       changed the way in which they curated exhibitions and used media to engage       new audiences:     This was the first time a high-profile project had been delivered by a         team of curators and staff         from different sections of the Museum, each contributing their own         experience and expertise.
A         project team gave strategic direction whilst a content team developed         the interpretative approach         and the exhibits.
This new way of working, different in style from         traditional curator-led exhibitions,         helped to develop team-working skills in the Museum.
...
The project         developed a model of         exhibition making that integrated displays with education, marketing and         public programmes.
Rather than simply using the exhibition as a vehicle for communicating         knowledge, the Museum         was able to explore with audiences different aspects of Lindow Man         through a range of media as         appropriate.
The use of up-to-date media such as Blogs, YouTube and         Flickr helped to promote         discussion and disseminate coverage about the exhibition in a         stimulating way that engaged a new         computer-literate audience.
This has now become embedded in the Museum's         practice.
[d]     The Manchester exhibition went on to be displayed at the Great Northern       Museum, Newcastle, in       2009.
In an interview in September 2009, the Museum Manager of the Great       Northern Museum       described the continuation of the pluralist interpretation:     ... this exhibition is all about as presenting the visitors with the         evidence that we've got and asking         them to make up their own minds about how he died.
We've even got some         cutting edge         technology which was developed by Newcastle University's Culture lab         department and which is a         multi use of touch table and you can investigate in details some of the         forensic data that was         collected at the time: x-rays, CT scans.
You can even run simulations to         see particular weapons in         action so can decide for yourself what might have killed him.
And         really, because we don't know,         we're throwing it open to our visitors to say here's the data, you         decide.
You make your         interpretation, which is just as valid as those of the archaeologist and         the forensic scientists.
[e]     Return to the British Museum: encouraging tolerance     In 2009, when a larger book by Hutton developed the argument for       pluralism yet further [3], Dr Joy       authored a pamphlet, published by the British Museum, which wholly       accepted it and offered the       public different choices.
Joy specifically describes how "The       interpretation that Lindow Man was       killed as a sacrifice to the gods was questioned by the historian Ronald       Hutton in 2004.
Hutton       demonstrated that alternative theories to sacrifice cannot be excluded       using the evidence currently       available".
[f] Joy explicitly states that the evidence is not       conclusive and that, as a result, various       interpretations are possible:     From the physical evidence it is possible to establish the sequence of         events that led to Lindow         Man's death [...].
However, this evidence does not on its own explain         why he was killed.
Combined         with archaeological and textual evidence, it has led to different         interpretations explaining why         Lindow Man died.[...]
He may have been a willing or hesitant human         sacrifice or offering made to         the gods; an executed criminal; the victim of a violent crime; [f]     When the body returned to the British Museum in 2011, a new format was       provided for its display.
This employed the new approach, as Joy explained:     The display of Lindow Man was changed in 2011 after he returned from         exhibition at the         Manchester and Great North Museums.
Some of the changes were as a result         of a debate in the         Times Literary Supplement between the then curator of the Iron Age         collections, Dr JD Hill, and         Prof Hutton.
This took place in 2004 and uncovered some errors in the         old display as well as         highlighting the possibility of alternative interpretations concerning         how Lindow Man died.
The British Museum received over 5.575 million visitors in 2011/2012 and       was the most popular       cultural attraction in the UK for the sixth year running.
One in four       overseas visitors to London and       one in ten overseas visitors to the UK now visit the British Museum as       part of their trip.
[g]     Even now, some long-established experts in the Iron Age, such as       Professors Cunliffe and       Aldhouse-Green, still restate the former official interpretation of Lindow       Man, as if no questions had       ever been raised about it.
Nor have all Internet references to the body       been updated.
However, the       reformed official display, and the booklet associated with it, have       together embraced a very       different approach.
As a result, the body has ceased to feature as a       weapon in hostile reactions to       religious diversity; the evidence for which is the apparent total lack of       references to it in that context       since the change.
There are wider implications in this story for the way       in which ancient evidence is       interpreted and presented to the public, suggesting as it does that an       acknowledgement of the       difficulty of reading archaeological data, and an invitation to viewers to       draw different, equally       possible conclusions from it, may not merely be more honest in scholarly       terms but may also help       to build a genuinely multi-cultural, multi-faith, diverse and tolerant       society.
