     Jones was responsible for the design and delivery of the ULMS LEAD       programme to four cohorts (total 102) of owner-managers based in Greater       Merseyside in 2009-2010.
The LEAD programme was the mechanism by which the       owner-managers benefitted from original research undertaken at Liverpool.
Funding (&#163;450k) for the ULMS LEAD programme was successfully obtained from       the North West Regional Development Agency (NWDA) for a major programme       aimed at the owner- managers of small firms wanting to improve business       performance.
After compiling a data-base of eligible small firms within       Merseyside, 351 owner-managers were contacted by phone to explain the       principles and benefits of participating in LEAD.
Subsequently, 122       attended four-hour `taster' sessions at ULMS and 104 of these       owner-managers were enrolled onto one of four LEAD         cohorts.
Research-Informed Programme     Lancaster University Management School provided the systematic framework       for LEAD.
ULMS became a flagship provider of the         programme by basing the content on research described in Section 3.
There was a deliberate strategy by the ULMS team to mobilize insights from       various strands of their research through engagement with the Merseyside       small business community.
A Future           North West report in 2010 had highlighted that skills,       employment and enterprise in the region was among the lowest in the UK,       and advocated a priority focus on the development of "the enterprise       capabilities of our people through education and skills".
Given the       importance of high growth smaller businesses to the recovery of the UK       economy and the need to develop leadership and management skills, it is       right that the programme is delivered to support business growth within       the Liverpool City Region; it has been designed to use leadership as       stimulus for growth, job creation and improved productivity in the       Liverpool City Region.
The ULMS LEAD programme encouraged owner-managers       to adopt appropriate leadership skills to promote organizational learning       as a basis for improving firm performance including turnover and profit.
For example, participants were expected to explain to their       action-learning sets how they improved communications about their       objectives for the firm with all employees and to demonstrate that they       had delegated some operational responsibility providing more time to       consider the firm's overall direction (strategic space).
This followed       directly from research which identified activities which shift the focus       of learning from the individual (owner-manager) to the organization       (employees).
Based on research (outlined in Section 3, 3), owner-managers       were required to work in action- learning sets for the duration of the       programme to share knowledge and experience, as well as building trust       between participants, and forced to reflect on their practices by building       `reflection days' into the LEAD programme.
Three reflection days during       the 10-month programme were designed to ensure the participants embedded       the changes in their organizational routines.
Evidence of changes in the       behaviour of participants is demonstrated by a number of illustrative       quotes (Section 5.2-5).
Relevance to Business Needs     The ULMS LEAD programme met practitioner needs.
The value/impact of LEAD       is demonstrated by the fact that 102 (out of 104), who had not previously       engaged with the Management School, completed the 10-month programme.
This       level of commitment from the small firm community demonstrates the direct       relevance to their business needs.
Attendance involved 31 days/half-days.
This was considered essential in ensuring that owner-managers' behavioural       changes became embedded in the day-to-day routines of the business.
A       further indicator of LEAD's impact on the businesses was the 98% attendance         at the four `graduation' events on completion of the programme.
Overall, the impact was felt at the level of a community of small firms       which participated in LEAD (Section 5.8).
Impact took place between April       2010 and May 2012.
Impact on Management Practices and Processes             Organisational Learning.
The research-informed programme         changed the awareness, behaviour and activity of those responsible for         managing small firms.
Changed behaviours meant that owner-managers         shifted the focus of learning from the individual level to the         organizational level by developing the appropriate mechanisms for         knowledge creation and sharing (Section 5.2-4).
Knowledge Sharing.
All owner-managers engaged actively in the         sharing of knowledge in small (six or seven participants)         action-learning sets which met every month for the duration of the         programme (Section 5.5).
Strategic Space.
Owner-managers set up formal structures for         internal knowledge-sharing as well as creating `strategic space'         (virtual and physical) in which they could reflect on how the changes         were benefitting their firms (Sections 5.2-6).
Employee Relationships.
Owner-managers changed the ways in         which they interacted with their employees as the basis for improving         firm performance in terms of turnover and profitability (Sections         5.2/.5/.6).
Impact on Firm Performance     Importantly, there is evidence of significant improvement in financial       performance of the smaller firms concerned (which constitute almost just       over 13% of Merseyside smaller firms).
Average turnover on entering the       programme was &#163;1,024,840 (NWDA `base-line' questionnaire, Section 5, 1).
Twelve months after completion all participants were surveyed by ULMS       staff about the benefits they had gained as a result of the LEAD programme       (Section 5, 7).
We obtained detailed responses from 39 of the       participating businesses and, on average, turnover had increased by 21%       which equates to &#163;320,000 per firm and a total of &#163;12 million for these 39       businesses (Section 5.6).
Sustained Business Involvement     On completion of LEAD, delegates were invited to continue their       involvement with ULMS via a series of eight       Master-classes/networking events between October 2011 and September       2012.Thirty-six owner-managers participated in the follow-on programme       (cost &#163;400) to enhance the impact of LEAD by further developing leadership       skills amongst the participants.
The impact of the master-classes included       creating a business plan, developing positive relationships, problem-       solving, developing the business (Section 5.7).
