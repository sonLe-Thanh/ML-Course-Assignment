     An outcome of Maclusky's and Cox's research was their co-authored book       designed for use in       primary schools, Teaching Creative Writing in the Primary School.
Delight, Entice, Inspire!
in 2011       (see section 3 above), which provides teachers and tutors with       `alternative' methods through which       pupils can engage in writing and improve their enjoyment of it, and       schools, thereby, can improve       attainment levels in both reading and writing.
Following publication, the       researchers went on to       discuss their work at a variety of conferences involving a mix of academic       educators, teachers and       professionals in the field of education.
From this initial dissemination,       by means of which       Maclusky's and Cox's approaches were promulgated, Maclusky received       further invitations and       opportunities to share her approaches with existing and future teachers of       writing and literacy in       primary schools &#8212; by means of which the impact of the research upon       approaches to teaching and       learning within primary education was achieved in the REF period:            At the invitation of Pamela Hodson, Principal Lecturer, Primary         Education, Kingston University         (who had read Maclusky's and Cox's book), Maclusky was invited to lead         two workshops for         two groups of Kingston Primary PGCE students (60 in total) on May 10th         2012.
The         workshops were intended to support students in developing their own         classroom practice.
Hodson introduced Maclusky's and Cox's book as a set text for Kingston's         PGCE in Primary         Education, graduates of which go on to teach in primary schools         throughout south east         England.
At the invitation of Dr Jean Ashfield, Principal Lecturer in the         School of Education at Kingston,         MacLusky was invited to give a presentation `Creative Writing: a driver         for change and         progress' to academics of the School with responsibility for teacher         training.
(Impact can         therefore be seen to have extended beyond the academic context of the         paper's delivery).
At the invitation of Worcestershire County Council's Learning and         Teaching Adviser, Ruth Sale         (who had been present at Cox's and MacLusky's presentation as part of         the 47th UKLA         conference in Chester &#8212; see above), MacLusky devised a workshop for some         30 `lead literacy         teachers' for primary schools in Worcestershire, which took place on 11th         October 2011.
She         subsequently worked with Sale to devise a demonstration workshop now         being marketed to all         of Worcestershire's 200 plus primary schools for delivery, in school, in         the academic year         2013/14.
In addition, Sale invited her, in the REF period, to devise a         course for teachers to         improve writing attainment for years 5 and 6 pupils and, following         publication of the new draft         National Curriculum for primary English in September 2013, to discuss         ways in which she         might support Worcestershire Schools' meeting the new targets.
Kate Wolstenholme, Learning Manager for east London's Discover Story         Centre, and lead for         its Catching Words literacy project (http://www.community-links.org/earlyaction/success-stories/discover-childrens-centre-catching-words-project) invited         MacKlusky to visit the Centre         on 9th December 2012 to discuss ways in which her research         findings might inform the work of         the Centre.
In May 2012, MacLusky was invited to make a presentation on her         teaching methods to         Philippa Watt, Director of Kip McGrath Education Centres in Balerno,         Edinburgh South and         Livingston, and Watt subsequently deployed Maclusky's and Cox's book         (and the methodology         and exercises that it proposes) in all three Centres.
Success led to         Watt inviting MacLusky to         provide workshops for her tutors, with the aim of introducing her         writing programme to tutoring         centres throughout Scotland.
Also in response to publication of the book, Maclusky gave invited       workshops to:            Four classes of 30 year 5 and 6 pupils, their teachers and classroom         assistants at St         Barnabas Primary School, Barnetby, Lincolnshire (at the invitation of         Head Teacher Mrs         Murray), July 2011       Four classes of 30 year 5 and 6 pupils, their teachers and classroom         assistants at Saltergate         Junior School, Harrogate (at the invitation of Head Teacher Mr Taylor),         July 2013          She has also accepted an invitation, made within the REF period, and as a       result of word-of-mouth       recommendation from Christine Gryzbowki, Head of Literacy, Saltergate       Junior School, to provide       a workshop for pupils and teachers of Hookstone Primary School, Harrogate,       in autumn 2013.
An additional outcome of MacLusky's promulgated approach to working with       primary school-aged       children was the interest that it also generated amongst secondary school       teachers, who identified       the potential of some of her methods for adaptation to working with older       students in the context of       the new English Literature, Language and Creative Writing A/AS-level       curricula.
As a result, Maclusky delivered a workshop at Worcester Sixth Form       College, to 30 English       Language and Literature students who had recently completed their AS-level       study and were       progressing to A2 study.
The session took place at the invitation of the       Head of English &amp; Media       and was also attended by the Course Leader for AS English Literature.
The       success of the       workshop led to an invitation to Maclusky, within the REF period, to       conduct a second workshop (to       take place in September 2013).
Also within the REF period, Droitwich Spa       High School's Co-ordinator       of Extra-curricular Activities in English invited Maclusky to deliver a       half day session to       AS-level English Language and Literature students (to take place on 19th       September 2013).
Public/professional engagement with the issues that Maclusky's and Cox's       research raised about       the teaching of literacy, and awareness of the research, was achieved       through the following media       features/interviews/discussions/mentions:     BBC TV Midlands Today (16/7/2010)       Times Higher Education Supplement (15/7/2010)       http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/university-of-worcester-writing-all-wrong/412459.article     BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester, interview feature with Tony Fisher       (12/7/2010)     BBC Radio Hereford &amp; Worcester news bulletins (12/7/2010)     Radio Wyvern FM (2/7/2010)     Worcester News, interview feature `Are Classroom Targets Stifling       Creativity?'
