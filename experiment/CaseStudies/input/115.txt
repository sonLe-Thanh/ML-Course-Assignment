       Historically, medication was considered the only viable intervention         for treating patients with psychosis.
The ground-breaking research         carried out by UEA, in association with the London-East Anglia group,         demonstrated that talking therapies and in particular, CBTp, are         effective in alleviating psychotic symptoms and reducing social         disability.
Key pieces of research (outputs 2, 3) have informed         the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines,         formerly known as the National Institute of Health and Clinical         Excellence, on the treatment and management of schizophrenia, 2010 [source           1].
Additionally, the methodology described in the therapy manual         (output 1) was adopted in subsequent national and international         trials of CBTp (e.g.
UK, Italy and Australia) that provided the evidence         base for the NICE guidelines [source 1].
UEA CBTp research has         continued to influence mental health policy-making strategies both         nationally [sources 4-7] and internationally [source 3].
The US guidelines for schizophrenia [source 3] refer to the NICE         guidelines [source 1], as a `companion document', in which         Fowler's research at UEA is integral, appearing five times directly, and         five times indirectly, via the included RCTs that used the treatment         manual (output 1).
The guidelines in the UK and US recommend that everyone diagnosed with         psychosis be offered psychological therapies.
CBTp is effective in         helping people recover by reducing symptoms, reducing relapse and         enabling self-management.
The recent schizophrenia commission report         found that 43% of service users and their families rated CBTp as one of         the most valuable and well-tolerated interventions [source 5,         p.33].
Moreover, the economic analysis, referenced in source 1,         showed that commissioning CBTp is likely to be a cost-saving         intervention overall.
Any additional costs in providing the intervention         are offset by savings, as a result of fewer hospital admissions.
The         overall net saving per person with schizophrenia was valued to be         between &#163;557- &#163;2,277 (for a mean duration of hospitalisation of 110.6         days) [source 1, p.272].
Since 2003 EIP has been a major foundation of government policy in         mental health.
Source 7 states that EIP services, "achieve         higher levels of engagement and improved outcomes compared to Community         Mental Health Teams" (p.5).
The success of EIP compared to standard         Community Mental Health Teams (CMHT) is succinctly summarised in a         speech by Professor Appleby (Mental Health Tsar, 2009).
EIP is, "the         jewel in the crown of the NHS mental health reform because: service         users like it; people get better; and it saves money" [source 4,         p.7].
Work carried out by researchers at UEA in collaboration with the         Norfolk and Waveney Mental Health Foundation Trust has made an important         contribution to defining the strategies of psychological intervention in         EIP (output 5).
The findings indicated that only 24% of         individuals made a full or partial functional recovery at two years         under the CMHT model compared to 52% of the cases who were under the         care of a comprehensive EIP service.
A further benefit of the         specialised EIP service was noted in a large reduction in inpatient         admissions.
The findings highlighted that treatment in the early phase         of the illness requires a multi-disciplinary approach, otherwise         effectiveness is significantly reduced.
The results of this trial have         informed guidelines formulated by the Initiative to Reduce the Impact of         Schizophrenia (IRIS) [sources 4, 7], instigated by the         Rethink mental health charity.
In addition, the findings from output           5 have influenced NHS briefings on commissioning EIP services [source           6].
Within this report the results of the UEA trial are referred         to as, "compelling evidence for the benefit of the service model" (p.6).
This in turn has contributed to the multi-disciplinary model of         bio-psycho-social care in EIP services that is recommended         internationally, e.g.
Australia (EPPIC), Canada (PEPP), Norway (TIPS).
The most recent work by Fowler and Hodgekins at UEA has focussed on         youth mental health.
UEA research has promoted early detection for         psychosis (output 6), targeting intervention at social         disability, as well as highlighting the influences of negative cognition         in maintaining psychotic mental states (output 4).
These two         pieces of research have informed the most recent NICE guidelines for         psychosis in young people, 2013 [source 2].
The Clinical Audit         Tool that accompanies this guideline [source 10] stipulates that         CBTp must follow a treatment manual with evidence of efficacy, with no         exceptions.
Output 1 is an example of a treatment manual with         evidence of efficacy from clinical trials.
Similarly, the therapy manual (output 1) is regarded as a key         resource by the International Society for Psychological and Societal         Approaches to Psychosis [source 9], which currently has over 1300         members.
Moreover, the manual is currently used by therapists and for         training purposes within mental health clinics [source 8].
It is         a major source for describing the competencies required for therapists         to deliver high quality, evidence based practice for treating people         with psychosis.
