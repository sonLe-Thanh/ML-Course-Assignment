     Leftwich's `thinking and working politically' framework, encompassing       leadership, coalitions and political economy analysis, has had a       significant impact on the developing thinking, policy and practice of 1)       DfID, 2) AusAID and 3) the NGO development community.
1) A former DfID senior governance adviser regards Leftwich as `probably       one of the two or three most influential political scientists in the UK on       DfID and through that ministry on the international development       community'.
DfID is a key player in international development policy,       being the world's third largest bilateral donor with an overall aid budget       in 2011 of &#163;4.2 billion.
Leftwich prompted a paradigm shift in the       agency's approach to the governance agenda, from a narrow technocratic       focus on administrative capacity (formal structures and rules) to a much       broader conceptualisation of governance as a political process.
In 2006,       he was commissioned by DfID to work on the DoC programme.
The DoC was       launched in 2002 with the twin objectives of identifying `the long-term       structural and institutional factors which enable or constrain reform in       different countries' and `to improve policy-making and programming by       identifying short and medium-term opportunities to support strategic       change'.
Leftwich's role was to produce `a robust conceptual framework       with a clear methodology' to enable DoC `to make a greater impact in       DfID's programming and policy-making' (DfID contract).
Leftwich produced       three papers for the DoC project published during 2006 and presented his       findings at two DfID seminars: `Thinking Politically: It's The Politics,       Stupid' (7 December 2006) and `Understanding Politics &#8212; A New Framework       for Analysis' (30 January 2007).
This commissioned work, alongside Leftwich's prior academic research,       provided the conceptual foundations for a series of policy papers produced       subsequently by DfID between 2008 and 2010.
Political Economy How To         Note: A Practice Paper (DfID 2008), for example, clearly shows       Leftwich's imprint on DfID's change of approach: `This represents a           major step change from past practice, when development       agencies frequently saw their role primarily in terms of the provision of       financial and technical assistance to promote particular agendas around       governance, growth or service delivery.
The tendency was to dispense       advice on what "should" be done, without considering adequately the       constraints and opportunities created by the political environment.
Political economy analysis, in contrast, encourages donors to think not         only about what to support, but also about how to provide support,         taking political feasibility into account' (DfID 2008: 5).
The paper       proceeds to set out a `Politics of Development Approach', designed `to       help DfID staff carry out political analysis...to help us to think       systematically about how political decisions are made.'
(DfID       2008: 10).
Leftwich's ideas also informed DfID's 2009 White Paper, which       looked at the political challenges associated with promoting       state-building and development in conflict-affected and fragile states,       emphasising the political dynamics of security, justice and economic       growth.
To quote the former DfID senior governance adviser once more,       `Adrian's research and writings had a deep influence on the political       economy analysis of DfID, and through DfID with the OECD Development       Assistance Committee membership.
Adrian's influence was in highlighting       not only the complexity of politics but also its centrality to development       which had hitherto tried to pretend to be apolitical.
His thinking gave       DfID a focus on power, and attention to the importance of leadership.
This       fed through into DfID and OECD operational guidance on undertaking       analysis on `political will' behind development, thinking about fragile       states, and guidance notes on state-building, which in turn was reflected       in the DfID 2009 White Paper.
Thanks in no small part to Adrian,       these topics, almost anathema a decade ago, are now very much part of the       regular development discourse'.
2) Leftwich's impact on AusAID has been considerable, particularly after       his appointment as Research Director of the DLP in 2010.
As with DfID,       AusAID has since this time increasingly emphasised the importance of       political analysis in its development thinking, policies and programmes.
Effective         Governance (AusAID 2011a), for example, embodies Leftwich's approach       in emphasising the importance of understanding local institutional       contexts via sound `political economy analysis' (p.15), working with       `civil society, local developmental leaders and coalitions for change'       (p.16) and employing a definition of leadership as `a political process       involving the skills of mobilising people and resources in pursuit of a       set of shared and negotiated goals'.
Similarly, AusAID's (2011b) Framework         for Working in Fragile and Conflict-affected States recognises that       development challenges are `inherently complex, political and contested'       (p.9) and that agency programs `are developed based on an understanding of       local needs and a realistic diagnosis of local capacities' (p.25).
A       senior AusAID official observes that Leftwich's work on politics and       leadership, particularly through the DLP, `has contributed significantly       to both UK and Australian development thinking, policies and programs, and       his impact can be seen elsewhere, for example with stakeholders such as       the International Development Assistance Committee... Across the board,       international aid agencies now recognise and better understand the       centrality and complexity of politics in development, the political       dynamics of economic growth and the role of local power and leaderships in       legitimate institutional change.
Adrian's work contributed to these       achievements in no small measure.
Few individuals can lay claim to such a       contribution' (Principal Director, Pacific Operations Group, AusAID).
AusAID is the major donor to the South Pacific accounting for more than       60 per cent of all bilateral aid flows to the region.
AusAID programmes       shaped explicitly by Leftwich and the DLP include:            The Pacific Leadership Program, which supports influential Pacific         leaders to shape and lead developmental change, emphasises the         importance of working within coalitions and networks of elite leaders         (e.g.
setting up the Tongan National Leadership Development Forum) and         it uses political economic analysis to identify opportunities and         critical junctures that might enable or constrain reform (Regional         Director, Pacific Leadership Program, AusAID).
In Vanuatu, AusAID adopted a political approach to national         development by working closely with the National Council of Chiefs         through the Vanuatu Kastom Governance Partnership.
AusAID's         understanding of the `contribution of Kastom leadership to change and         development processes' (AusAID, 2011b: 53) is influenced directly         by Leftwich's work on leadership and development.
In Papua New Guinea, AusAID supported the National Economic and Fiscal         Commission (NEFC), set up to reform the way that funding is distributed         to provincial areas.
The success of NEFC is attributed to the         `combination of a strong, well-led agency, targeted donor support based         on analysis, local ownership and a participative reform process that         struck a balance between technical and political concerns' (AusAID 2010,         p.4).
In short, the hallmarks of Leftwich's politically informed         approach to development.
3) Leftwich's framework has also been taken up by key development NGOs.
The Asia Foundation (TAF), a major international developmental NGO that       disbursed over US$97m globally in programme support in 2011, provides       three examples of his influence:            TAF applied the `working politically' framework to an evaluation of         its `Civil Society Initiative Against Poverty (CSIAP)' programme in         Indonesia (funded by DfID).
It found that where mass-based Islamic civil         society organisations engaged in budget advocacy they could `tip the         balance' politically in achieving pro-poor budget allocations at the         decentralised level.
Leftwich's framework informed important recommendations for         developmental planning by DfID and other bilateral donors in Indonesia,         such as the need to supplement technical budget solutions with political         positioning and lobbying and that support for local actors to carry out         political-economy analysis and expand their political capital is `an         effective development investment' (Deputy Country Representative:         Indonesia, TAF).
TAF pioneered the use of Leftwich's political approach to the         governance agenda in the context of the environment.
The framework was         used to develop a DfID funded programme on environmental governance in         Indonesia, the findings of which contributed to the design of an ongoing         &#163;7.6 million programme on `Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry in         Indonesia'.
This programme specifically draws on the Leftwich's         framework and methodology to collect data for informing TAF partner         political strategies (e.g.
by mapping elites and identifying the         coalitions they need to mobilise) required to achieve environmental         policy change at the local level (Deputy Country Representative:         Indonesia, TAF).
