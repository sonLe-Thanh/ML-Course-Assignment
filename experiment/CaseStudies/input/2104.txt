     A founder member of the Chinese Film         Forum UK and a member of the board of trustees of Cornerhouse,       Willis worked in partnership with Perks (Cornerhouse) to curate and tour       this UK-first season of new films.
Including a retrospective of the       post-2000 films of award winning director Ann Hui, the season offered       three other main strands:             `This Darling Life' represented recent documentary work, such         as `Secondary School' (Tammy Cheung, 2003), `Traces of a Dragon: Jackie         Chan and His Lost Family' (Mabel Cheung, 2003), `The Decameron' (Yan Yan         Mak, 2009), and `This Darling Life' (Angie Chen, 2009);       The films in the `Floating Landscapes' section focused on new         directors and debut features and included serious drama as well as more         commercially oriented pieces such as `High Noon' (Heiward Mak, 2008),         `Ming Ming' (Susie Au, 2007) and `Wonder Women' (Barbara Wong,2007);         and,       `Hong Kong Snapshots' comprised three programmes of short and         experimental work programmed for Visible Secrets by Teresa Kwong         of the Hong Kong Independent Short Film and Video Awards and the Hong         Kong Arts Centre.
The programme introduced new directors to UK audiences and comprised         of 18 features, all previously unreleased theatrically in the UK, so         prints of each had to be imported from Hong Kong especially for the         season.
The season offered a response to the under representation of         women in the film industry, as well as to the lack of films addressing         feminist issues and the fact that the representation of women on screen         in Hong Kong cinema is often narrow and stereotypical.
Following its residency at Cornerhouse during October and early         November 2009, the Visible Secrets UK tour launched at a gala         screening at the Curzon Cinema, Mayfair, London.
Films from Visible           Secrets toured to eleven other UK venues facilitated by the         Independent Cinema Office.
These included: Edinburgh Filmhouse,         Watershed Bristol, Broadway Nottingham, Dundee Contemporary Arts,         Chichester Cinema at New Park, Derby QUAD, Eden Court Inverness,         Northampton Forum Cinema, Sheffield Showroom and London Riverside         Studios.
The inclusion of a tour in the project was important in         ensuring that audiences across the country had the opportunity to see         examples of the kinds of Hong Kong cinema that rarely reach regional UK         screens.
Visible Secrets was a successful partnership between various         interested organisations with a commitment to new curatorial approaches         to Hong Kong cinema and, as such, it provides a useful model for future         collaboration between academic and arts-based institutions operating         within the field of film exhibition.
As both these sectors are         increasingly working within tightening financial constraints, other         collaborators for Visible Secrets were sought at an early stage         including the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO), which         provided substantial financial support for the event through the         Cornerhouse, whilst crucially leaving control of the programmes' content         to the curators.
Other enthusiastic supporters included the Confucius         Institute and the Chinese Arts Centre in Manchester.
The success of the collaboration suggests new ways in which academics         can have an impact on wider film culture.
Mark Cosgrove, Head of         Programming at the Watershed Media Centre, Bristol, suggests that         academics can bring "a deeper more historically and critically           engaged perspective' to such initiatives.
There's a mutual benefit in           that such initiatives would result in the industry-facing side of the           partnership having more academic weight &#8212; and analysis &#8212; and the           academy having a better grounding in, and understanding of, the           immediate issues facing the industry.
The business of film culture has           never fully maximized the impact that can result from a connection           between the study of cinema in both institutional and aesthetic terms           and film exhibition."
Three of the directors featured in the season (Angie Chen, Tsang Tsui         Shan and Ivy Ho) visited Manchester to discuss their work and women's         place in the Hong Kong film industry with Cornerhouse audiences.
Further         supporting and contextualising materials for the season were made         available via the Cornerhouse website and included a series of podcasts,         including interviews with Chen, Tsang and Ho, online film reviews and a         special interview with Ann Hui.
Stephen Teo, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and Author of         the landmark Hong Kong Cinema: The Extra Dimensions (BFI         Publishing) endorsed the season, stating that: "The programme is an           excellent one and offers a good and rare opportunity for people in the           UK to see work by Hong Kong women filmmakers.
The films are very well           chosen and they cover a comprehensive range of recent output.
I           congratulate the programmers for organizing the season and highly           recommend it to film buffs and filmgoers in general who see film as a           window on society and as a mirror of one's soul."
Visible Secrets was the catalyst for the creation of the Chinese Film         Forum UK and Willis presented a paper focused on the Visible Secrets         projects at the New Forms of Cinema Exhibition conference at the         launch symposium of the Chinese Film           Forum UK at the Chinese Arts Centre, Manchester in February 2010.
Both Willis (representing University of Salford) and Perks are founding         members and the Hong Kong directors Angie Chen and Jessey Tsang who were         guests at Visible Secrets, returned to Manchester to introduce         UK premieres of their next works: Big             Blue Lake (Jessey Tsang, Hong Kong 2011) + Q&amp;A, 6 July         2012 and One             Tree, Three Lives (Angie Chen) + Q&amp;A, 22         October 2012.
