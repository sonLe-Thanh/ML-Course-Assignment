     The work undertaken by the IAU has been important in the integration of       socio-economic impacts into the assessment and decision making process for       the development of major energy projects in the UK, recently in relation       to the proposed new nuclear build (NNB) programme (2008&#8212;2013).
Examples of       the nature, extent and key beneficiaries of the impacts include:     (1) Learning from the research on the local socio-economic impacts           of building Sizewell B and other power station developments &#8212;now             underpinning much of the NNB research       The IAU studies undertaken to monitor the actual impacts of building       Sizewell B (1988-1996) have proved invaluable in the contemporary       (2008&#8212;2013) research for the NNB programme, in addition to helping to       manage mitigation and enhancement measures better in the Suffolk community       at the time of the construction of Sizewell B (SZB).
Since 2008, the IAU has been working with first British Energy, and       subsequently EDF, to assess the potential socio-economic impacts of the       NNB programme.
Major detailed socio-economic impact studies have been       undertaken for the EDF proposals to build two new twin-reactor (nuclear)       power stations, each 3.2 megawatt (MW) capacity, at Hinkley Point C (HPC)       and Sizewell C (SZC).
Each project has estimated construction costs of       c&#163;14bn.
The HPC project was the first to go through the PINS examination       process and was successful in gaining development consent in March 2013;       socio-economic impacts were an important consideration in the decision       making process (see references in Section 2 above) Sizewell C is running       approximately 2 years behind Hinkley and the IAU is currently (2013)       researching the socio-economic impacts of the SZC proposed development,       now also building on the recent work done on HPC.
(2) Improving the process of           predicting and managing impacts for NNB       Achieved through:            Leading many stakeholder socio-economic workshops over the two years         pre-application period to explore the range of potential local impacts         of both HPC and SZC;       Writing key research documents (some noted in section 2 above) which         provided the basis for the socio-economic input in the application to         build HPC submitted to PINS by EDF;       Exploring in depth with relevant local agencies the potential impacts         on the local area economic base, accommodation market, and other local         services and facilities (especially health, policing, education);       The development of models of various impacts, for example on the key         mix of the local/non-local workforce (estimated at 34/66 split for HPC),         leading to the agreement of `Statements of Common Ground' between the         developer and local authorities under the PINS procedures;       Developing approaches to auditing the effectiveness of the assessment         process in predicting the likely socio-economic impacts of future major         developments, leading to a process of adaptive impact assessment,         ensuring the monitoring and managing of project impacts through the life         of the project are in the interests of all key stakeholders.
(3) Improving specific mitigation and enhancement policies       for the NNB programme       Examples of effective mitigation of negative impacts of the       project include:            The impacts on the local housing market were minimised at SZB by the         provision of a 1000-bed site hostel.
This has been developed for HPC         with plans for 3 worker site campuses (1500 bed spaces).
A substantial rise in crime coinciding with the building of SZB was         highlighted by the monitoring process at an early stage, and very         effective mitigation measures were quickly put in place.
HPC has learnt         from this in terms of appropriate developer policies and early planning         with the local police.
Examples of socio-economic impact enhancement policies include:            Developing local labour/economy policies including improving the skill         base of the local population through training programmes and developing         local business supply chain opportunities.
&#8212;Provision of a local legacy         of affordable housing from construction accommodation facilities.
(4) Summary of key beneficiaries of           the applied research (as noted above, see also section 5)            Major energy project developers and developers of other major         infrastructure projects which need socio-economic impact assessment         (e.g.
: appointment of John Glasson to advise the Nuclear Decommissioning         Authority (NDA), see Section3)       Key government agencies (central and local), and other agencies       The local communities, and associated stakeholders, hosting such major         developments.
Impact assessment practitioners.
The socio-economic input to the assessment of major projects, especially       energy projects, has grown fast over the last decade.
IAU work,       disseminated in articles, books and via the major Sizewell B Monitoring       Studies, has contributed to this growth&#8212;recently reflected in the demand       by consultancies, developers and government departments for copies of the       Sizewell B Monitoring Studies in relation to the NNB programme.
