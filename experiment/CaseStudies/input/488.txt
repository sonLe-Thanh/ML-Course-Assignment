     Strand A       In the 1980s and 1990s, UK HEIs were challenged by external trends       including government       pressure for accountability and research excellence, and the introduction       of corporate structures       led by managers rather than academics.
They were also constrained by their       own insularity,       insufficient responsiveness to the needs of their markets, and resistance       to corporate management       even when it was enabling rather than authoritarian.
Ian McNay developed a       heuristic model of       organisational cultures that enabled discussion of the strengths and       weaknesses, opportunities       and threats of each one in order to best manage change and achieve       organisational goals.
The       model showed that each culture &#8212; of collegium, bureaucracy, corporation       and enterprise &#8212; was       needed but that internal and external forces could corrupt values and       jeopardise the necessary       balance and tension between them.
McNay's research showed that the best       institutions have a       strong sense of identity/mission and a `collegial enterprise',       market-facing culture.
The model is       used by HE professionals across the world to evaluate leadership,       management and service       provision, and introduce change.
This strand has contributed to policy on institutional change, including:            Informing decisions on appropriate cultures for a merger in Wales         [Drowley, 2013]       Supporting decisions on optimal approaches to student engagement at         the University of         Bath.
Corporate bureaucracies did not provide a good `fit' with student         preferences for         collegial relationships, though with some enterprise elements emerging         after recent         changes in fee level.
"The collegium and the enterprise culture allow         for a more direct         involvement with students...it seems much more effective to work with         one's Students'         Union in partnership [collegium] or as a fellow stakeholder         [enterprise], either directly or         through localised, empowered representation."
[Van der Verden, 2012]       The head of a devolved campus at the University of Southern         Queensland, influenced by         the model, set out to establish enterprise [with some collegiality] as         defining the campus         culture.
Work at the University of Cape Town on e-learning innovation concluded         that "there is a         crucial relationship between policy and use but organisational culture         is fundamental to how         that relationship is played out" and advocated a collegial culture in         e-learning development         because it led to more, and more varied use &#8212; "the corporate culture may         not facilitate staff         level innovation and variety in use".
[Czerniewicz and Brown, 2009]       Yong-Tao Gan [2008] claims that in the analysis of the impact of         external factors on internal         governance and decision-making, there is "inspiration in this model to         promote the         reformation and development of higher education in China".
Impact is enhanced by work with end users through consultancy and CPD.
For example, City       University Business School's official history records the effect of a       commissioned CPD programme       in changing the strategic focus and processes of the school, and enhancing       quality.
David       Sweeney, HEFCE Director of Research, Innovation and Skills, claimed of his       participation in CPD       programme `Preparing for Strategic Leadership': "It changed my career       direction; it is a major       reason why I am in my present role."
His predecessor was also a       participant in several       programmes.
Strand B       McNay's first review of the impact of the RAE following unification of HE       systems in 1992,       published by HEFCE in 1997, had an immediate impact on policy in       Australia: the Bourke Report       [1997] recommended against imitation of the UK model.
That decision has       been in place       throughout the period since, despite several attempts to institute UK       practice.
In the UK, McNay was a significant voice arguing for reform of the RAE in       order to recognise and       support research diversity, and research applied to the needs of society       and integrated with       teaching, and to discourage conservative, convergent conformity.
The       impact of his work within       HEFCE was acknowledged by the then Chief Executive in a speech to an SRHE       conference       [Fender, 1997].
The critique of definitions used in gradings and the voice       given to those       researching smaller, applied projects in partnership with users, formed       part of the pressure to       change, eventually, to profiling output, and to strengthening relevance as       an integral part of quality.
Oancea [2010] copied the methodology in her review of impact of the 2008       RAE on Education       research, to which McNay was an advisor.
The decision by the Institute for Learning and Teaching to establish a       group to review the       teaching/learning nexus, led by Professor Roger Brown, was influenced by       McNay's findings on       the impact of the RAE on teaching.
His findings continued to be validated       by later work.
In recent years, the work has been cited in government policy papers in       Canada and Germany.
It       underpinned an invited paper to UNESCO on possible policy initiatives.
