     The impact of the DAC Solution Centre research follows a process of       dissemination and adoption by practitioners and policymakers.
This section       on impact is organised by different users and beneficiaries:             2007-onwards: Landeskriminalamt Niedersachsen (Federal           Police of Lower Saxony), Germany: For the EU-funded         research project PLuS (www.plus-eu.net), Wootton &amp; Davey developed         the Crime Prevention Capability Maturity Model (CPCMM)&#8212;a means         of analysing and classifying approaches to crime prevention in order to         improve implementation capability.
The CPCMM was presented at the 2013         German Police Crime Prevention Day (Deutsche Pr&#228;ventionstag &#8212;         www.praeventionstag.de), where of 55 presentations evaluated, it was         rated as the third highest for interest and practical use.
The success         of PLuS led to German government-funded research (TRANSIT:         Trans-disciplinary Security Strategies for Police, Local Authorities and         Housing Industry &#8212; www.transit-online.info) to further improve crime         prevention policy and practice in Germany.
2007-2012: Manchester Crime and Disorder Reduction           Partnership (CDRP): Wootton and Davey developed the action         research project City Centre Crime at the request of Manchester         CDRP.
Research revealed causal factors underpinning crime 'hotspots' in         the city centre and identified that problematic GIS crime data analysis         was wasting police resources in targeting false hotspots.
Recommendations for 20 practical design interventions in policing, urban         management and the physical environment were provided and incorporated         into Manchester CDRP's service delivery plans.
The suggested targeted         pedestrianisation of the 'gay village' area of the city on weekend         nights to reduce violent crime and road accidents was trialled in 2009         and fully implemented in 2012.
2007-2010: Greater Manchester Police, Manchester planners           and architects: Wootton &amp; Davey were commissioned to evaluate         the police Architectural Liaison service which provides crime prevention         advice to architects and planners in Greater Manchester.
The research         resulted in a significant service redesign to be more user-oriented, and         supported the development of the Crime Impact Statement (CIS) as         a vehicle to provide crime prevention design advice at an early-stage in         the development process.
Wootton &amp; Davey rebranded the GMP         Architectural Liaison Unit to become Design for Security         (http://www.designforsecurity.org), adopting a professional consultancy         model for delivering crime prevention advice to the development         industry, and for which GMP are able to charge a fee.
The Design for           Security service (http://www.designforsecurity.org) is unique in         UK policing, becoming known as the "Manchester model".
In 2010, Design           for Security and the Solution Centre were awarded the ACPO Secured         by Design Innovation Award.
2008-2010: Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO),           Home Office and police forces in England &amp; Wales: Wootton and         Davey were commissioned to research crime prevention delivery across         England and Wales, and the potential for a improved, nationally         coordinated service&#8212;a National Police Crime Prevention Service         (NPCPS).
Research into 42 police forces revealed fragmentation, uneven         coverage and ad hoc implementation of the Secured by Design         accreditation scheme.
A proposal for national implementation of a         professionalised NPCPS based on the "Manchester model" was developed by         Wootton and Davey, in collaboration with ACPO and Price Waterhouse         Coopers.
Endorsed by ACPO cabinet, the foreword to the National Police         Crime Prevention Service report (www.npcps.org)         was provided by Rod Jarman, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the         Metropolitan Police and ACPO Lead for Crime Prevention.
2009-onwards: Young people`s charity Catch 22 and young           people at risk of offending: Developed in partnership with UK         charity Catch 22, the Youth Design Against Crime (YDAC) programme has         engaged more than 200 young people identified as 'at risk of offending',         of which most were excluded from school.
YDAC has provided participants         the opportunity to gain an ASDAN Wider Skills Level 2 problem-solving         qualification, and has improved their confidence and sense of agency.
The assumptions of police officer mentors were positively challenged, as         well of those of planners, local councillors, and senior police officers         involved in judging proposed design solutions.
A number of solutions         have been implemented by local authorities.
In 2011, the Solution Centre         and Catch 22 were awarded the Manchester Beacons for Public           Engagement Recognition Award for the YDAC programme.
YDAC has         delivered five projects across the UK, including: Greater Manchester         YDAC (2009); the London borough of Southwark YDAC (2010); the London         borough of Lambeth YDAC (2011); Salford YDAC (2011) and Bolton YDAC         (2012) and is attracting interest from a range of international         agencies.
2012-onwards: Danish Crime Prevention Council (DKR), Danish           Planners and Danish planning policy: The DKR commissioned Wootton         &amp; Davey to organise an event to share knowledge about practices         developed in Manchester for implementing CPTED, as part of the project Tryghed           via byplanl&#230;gning (Urban Planning for a Safer Environment).
Fifteen planners from five Danish local authorities visited the Solution         Centre at MediaCityUK, where Davey &amp; Wootton, with GMP and         Manchester City Council planners, presented work undertaken to         incorporate crime prevention within urban planning.
The DKR project is         using this knowledge to incorporate CPTED within planning and         administrative systems of five Danish local authorities.
The intention         is to incorporate CPTED into planning policy in all 98 local authorities         across Denmark.
2012-onwards: EU academics, practitioners and policymakers           in planning, architecture and crime prevention: Wootton represents         the UK on the Management Committee of EU COST Action TU1203 Crime           Prevention through Urban Design &amp; Planning, and Dr Davey leads         Working Group 3 of the Action.
COST is an intergovernmental framework         for European Cooperation in Science &amp; Technology, coordinating         nationally-funded research on a European level.
COST Action TU1203 is         transferring knowledge on crime prevention in urban design and planning         from advanced states to those just beginning to tackle the issue.
