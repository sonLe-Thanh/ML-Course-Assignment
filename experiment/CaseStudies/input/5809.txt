     By 2012, the algorithms developed in IPAM based on the fundamental       research described above,       provided a time-resolved estimation of the directed interactions between       brain structures [2, 3].
In a       preclinical application, analysing data that had been obtained by       Professor Bettina Platt at the       Institute for Medical Sciences (IMS) in Aberdeen, we could clearly       demonstrate in [2, 3 and further       unpublished results] the implications of our novel approach to dementia       research and, potentially to       early diagnosis.
Transitions between sleep stages (see above), which are       critical in dementia,       could be defined with a much higher temporal precision than before.
Standard approaches had       been allowing a resolution of around 4 seconds, whereas our new data-based       modelling approach       yields a resolution of typically 5ms.
Additionally, we demonstrated       through a pilot study that our       theory and the corresponding algorithms outperform standard EEG based       spectral analyses       (unpublished results, [1]).
Between 2012 and early 2013, the promising findings of our pilot study       led IPAM, under the lead of       Thiel and Schelter, to build the mathematical algorithm       into a software package which was       integrated as part of in an online platform marketed commercially by       BrainMarker BV in May 2013.
BrainMarker is a Dutch company whose vision is to "provide the gold         standard in mental healthcare         by implementing an easy to use decision support and quality management         system in clinical         practice" [c1].
They aim to bridge the gap between scientific       knowledge and clinical practice "for all         lines of mental healthcare by implementing quantitative EEG (qEEG)         measurements in a very         user-friendly way into practices.
This allows a swift knowledge transfer         from the scientific         community into the clinical practice" [c1].
The software package developed by IPAM fits well into the vision and       mission of BrainMarker.
Via       our joint collaboration partner Professor Platt, we began to discuss the       potential exploitation of our       algorithm through the BrainMarker Platform in 2012.
This resulted in a       sustained and fruitful       collaboration between researchers of the IPAM and IMS on the one side, and       the management       and computer engineers of the company BrainMarker on the other.
Parallel to the development of the software package, extensive       beta-testing of the software was       carried out in applications to clinical data obtained by groups at the IMS       at Aberdeen [2, 3], the       Xi'an Jiaotong University (China), and a Neurologist Practitioner in       Freiburg, Germany.
In the beta-testing,       our algorithm was applied by the team of medical specialists at X'ian       Jiaotong to study       various cognitive deficits [c2].
The Director of the Institute of       Biomedical Engineering, Xi'an       Jiaotong University, states "We can confirm that this novel technique         presents a milestone in data-based         modelling and model-based data analysis" and "The new insights we         gained by this         technique that would have been impossible before enabled us to prepare a         manuscript to publish         our results in a high ranked international journal" [c2].
The       Practitioner in Freiburgh has applied it to       research in Parkinson's disease [c3], and has stated: "Based on my         experience as a neurologist, I         can confirm that the results I have obtained using this unique technique         and looked at so far are         very promising; I truly believe that this technique has the potential to         provide the means for an         early diagnosis of diseases like dementia" [c3].
Given these facts, BrainMarker decided in early 2013 to offer       practitioners access to the algorithm       developed by IPAM, via their subscription-based online platform programmed       in LabVIEW       (National Instruments, http://uk.ni.com).
According to the Managing Director of BrainMarker, "the         system has already been used in over 35 practices in the Netherlands,         Germany, and Belgium and         continues to grow.
Among their users are hospitals and research         institutions that have enabled         them to expand their database of human EEGs in various pathologies"       [c4].
The revenue created       through the IPAM research is substantial.
Access to the pay-per-click       software platform of       BrainMarker, of which Thiel and Schelter's algorithm is       one part, "costs &#8364;250 per month       (hardware, software, technical support) and &#8364;5 per measurement for a       clinic" [c4].
The service provides different environments for researchers and for       practitioners who upload their       EEG files and receive an analysis report of the data.
The advantage of       this approach is that it       delivers new and sophisticated health-care methods to practitioners       without requiring them to buy       expensive hardware.
Also any updates to the software, including       improvement of algorithms, are       immediately available to customers.
It is an ideal platform for an       optimised knowledge transfer       between academia and the health industry.
The Managing Director of BrainMarker BV considers Aberdeen's contribution       to have been "a very         valuable component of [their] portfolio" and that it adds "considerably         to its functionality" [c4].
In       summary, the software framework developed by IPAM became in 2013 one of       the key components       in BrainMarker's platform to tackle dementia in Europe.
Its impact is both       commercial, and will       potentially change procedures carried out by clinical practitioners.
There       is also strong potential for       growth globally as the relationship with Brainmarker continues.
BrainMarker anticipates that "[this]         highly competitive online system provides a novel approach to health         care not only in Europe" [c4].
Other companies have also become aware of the software tool.
Companies       such as AbbVie       expressed their interest in continuing "the previously started common         efforts on pharmaco-EEG         analysis together with Aberdeen University".
This particularly       includes our novel data-based       modelling approaches [c5].
