     During the latest REF cycle the research has prompted engagement with a       range of individuals       and groups interested in terrorism and political violence.
The research       has been presented to       members of all branches of the British military, the MOD, UK Defence       Academy, DTSL, NGO's       such as the Tim Parry and Jonathan Ball Foundation for Peace.
Members of       the research team       have also been consulted by the Commander of Psychological Operations for       the British Army, and       members of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, Department for       International Development       (DIFID) and the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) on issues arising       directly from the       research findings on routes in and out of terror organizations, and the       changes individual go       through during their involvement in terror related activities.
The research has reached a range of beneficiaries, from victims of       political conflict and terrorism in       the UK, to government officials from within and beyond the UK, and has       been well received.
For       example, we have presented the research to a range of policy makers and       victims of violence       through work with the Tim Parry and Jonathan Ball Foundation for Peace       and, as well as       enlightening policy makers from across Europe, it was well received from       the victims which the       charity aims to serve.
In particular, feedback demonstrated that the       former British soldiers and       victims of UK terror attacks found my research "very positive and people       found the opportunity to       talk about the conflict and recent events a really valuable opportunity.
People especially       appreciated the chance to hear about often unreported peacebuilding       initiatives happening in       Northern Ireland"4.
Our research led to an invitation to Dr Burgess to address senior       officers enrolled in Master's       programmes at the UK Defence Academy from 2011 to 2014 (which was rated       the best and most       useful presentation of the 2011 programme) and an invitation by the       Commander of Psychological       Operations to liaise over research and possible strategies for       counter-insurgency in Helmand       Province, Afghanistan, while Prof Ferguson also liaised with the FCO and       DFID in 2007 about       issues related to UK activity in Helmand.
During 2008 our research was       published as part of the       NATO Science for Peace and Security Series (SPS Reference 982906), based       on a NATO       advanced workshop held in Ankara in September 2007 which explored issues       around youth and       terrorism.
The workshop brought together academics, security forces,       government officials and       diplomats from both sides of the Atlantic to contribute to NATO's core       goals and priorties5.
The research has also contributed to NGO consultations on political       violence and peace building;       in 2010 Prof Ferguson was invited to a consultation on Effective and       Sustainable Reconciliation       held at St Georges House, in Windsor Castle.
The consultation aimed to       evaluate different       practical approaches to build sustainable peace and brought 30 religious       leaders together with       academics and practitioners to find "action-focused solutions to problems       that effect change for the       better in our society"3.
In 2011 the research team were       approached by the North West Counter       Terrorism Unit to advise on issues related to the rise of dissident       republican terrorism and the use       of Liverpool as a potential base for striking London in future attacks2.
The research team have also been invited to present their research to a       wider international       audience, which has included members of other military and policing       organizations from across the       globe.
For example: in Barcelona (2011) Prof Ferguson was invited to speak       to an audience of       counter terrorism police officers and members of the Spanish government at       the Institut Barcelona       d'Estudis Internacionals as part of a an international event to explore       how to diminish terrorism; in       Chicago (2011 &amp; 2013) members of the research team were invited to       speak at the Inter University       Seminar on Armed Forces and Society; the presentation was attend by US       military personnel from       all arms, government officials and policy makers from Washington, D.C.,       the paper received       exceptional feedback and drew follow-up interest from the Centre for       Complex Operations at the       NDU at Fort Lesley McNair in Washington, D.C.; Prof Ferguson was involved       in a symposium at       Portsdown West organized by DSTL (2013) which explored historical analysis       to improve future       defence planning, the symposium involved a range of UK, Canadian and US       military personnel;       there have been repeated invitations to lecture on the Chevening Senior       Fellows Programme       (2006-2010), which is an FCO programme which selects participants based on       their existing and       potential contributions to peace and development in their respective       countries, and are all civil       society leaders, senior civil servants or senior military officers.
