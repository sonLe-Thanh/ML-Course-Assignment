     As well as supporting the Imperial research and attracting substantial       funding from industry, the new test methods have also been commercialised       by a spin-out company, now known as PCS Instruments Ltd, (www.pcs-instruments.com).
Over the period 2008-13 (6 yr) it had a turnover of &#163;39.8M (&#163;7.63M in       2012-13), with 80% overseas sales, and now employs five Imperial Tribology       PhD graduates, one of whom was recruited since 2008.
There are a total of       11 permanent staff in the company.
All the manufacturing added value       associated with the company is in the UK; thus the company supports a       range of subcontractors.
The main test rigs sold by PCS that were developed as a result of       Imperial research are:            Elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication ("EHL" or "Ultra") rig, (Ultra-thin         lubricant film thickness measurement to 1 nm [2])       High frequency reciprocating rig, HFRR (friction and wear tester,         additive development, international standard for fuel lubricity [8, 9])       EHL Spacer layer interferometry rig, SLIM (Film thickness distribution         to 5 nm) [1]       Mini-traction machine, MTM (Friction in rolling-sliding contact, basis         of low efficiency oil formulation [4])       Micro-pitting rig, MPR (Micro-pitting, fatigue, durability and         friction at high pressure) [6]          The total number of rigs sold is 1300, of which 764 were sold between Jan       2008 and July 2013, as confirmed by the CEO of PCS Instruments Ltd [C].
The development and commercialisation of these test methods has made an       impact in two significant areas: (a) their almost universal application in       the global lubricants industry where they have become essential tools for       the development of lubricant formulations and where they form the basis of       a number of international standards [7-9] and (b) the widespread adoption       of the techniques in the research community.
The most significant beneficiary has been the global lubricants industry       and its customers.
This includes lubricant manufacturers (major       oil companies such as BP, ExxonMobil [10, 11], Shell, Petronas, Sinopec;       and specialist suppliers such as Valvoline [12] and Syntech, together with       global additive suppliers such as Lubrizol, Evonik [13], Infineum       [14], Afton and Chevron Oronite.
Around 38.5M (2006) tons of lubricants       are manufactured annually and the global market has been estimated to have       a value of nearly $50bn in 2012 [17].
Vice President Global Commercial       Technology [A] for Shell says: "... lubricant test machines from         PCS-Instruments have become the tools of choice for lubricant         development in almost all oil and additive companies around the world,         including my own."
Senior Vice-President of Research and Development [B] , Valvoline,       confirms this view: "In the last decade, the new generation of         lubricant test equipment developed by PCS Instruments (MTM, HFRR, EHL         film thickness etc.)
has led to a striking change in the way that we         design and test lubricants.
We now depend on PCS test equipment to         develop formulations for our automotive engine and drivetrain lubricants         at Valvoline and we consider them to be an essential tool for early         assessment of lubricant parameters governing efficiency and durability.
We currently have four PCS test rigs (one EHL, one HFRR, and two MTMs)         in our New Product Development Centre in Lexington, Kentucky."
In the period 2008-2012, MTM and HFRR test rigs were cited in 380 US       patent applications and in 113 granted US patents, highlighting its       importance in specifying these new materials.
PCS test rigs have also been       sold to 41 University research groups world-wide, making them one of the       most widely-used categories of equipment in tribology research       laboratories.
The technical literature in experimental tribology is       dominated by work on PCS rigs, especially the MTM [14-16].
The value of the techniques developed and their impact has been greatly       enhanced by the growing concern by the public and by governments worldwide       to protect the environment.
This has led to changes in lubricant design,       primarily to reduce friction and thus reduce fuel consumption and hence CO2       emissions, but also to provide engine lubricants that maintain durability       and are compatible with vehicle exhaust after-treatment systems.
Examples include [10], which patents the addition of high viscosity       esters to hydrocarbon oils to increase low speed film thickness and reduce       friction.
It used the "Ultra" technique and is based directly on [2].
Another is [13], one of many such patents by Evonik concerning the use of       functionalised polymers to produce low friction engine/transmission oils.
This work is based on the MTM test method and is a consequence of the       research described in [3].
The best passenger car engine lubricants are currently about 4-5% more       efficient than their early 1990s counterparts as a result of lubricant       development based to a large degree on Imperial/PCS test methods.
This       increase in efficiency corresponds to an annual reduction of nearly 4&#215;41010       kg (about 0.1%) of global man-made CO2 emissions.
(600M cars,       10k km/yr, 150 g/km CO2, 4% reduction, 2010 total 30.6       Gtonnes.)
