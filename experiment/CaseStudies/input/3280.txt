     Williams combined engagements with media and policy users and formal       advisory roles to       establish a powerful profile conducive to achieving impact.
Through these       efforts, he informed       policy and public debate throughout the REF period.
Williams frequently       served as an analytical       source for major international news outlets, appearing on CNN, BBC, Al       Jazeera, and Sky News.
He published 27 articles in The Guardian in the period and served       as a panellist on CNN       International's `Connect the World with Becky Anderson'.
Williams is also       a founding member and       frequent contributor to Atlantic-Community.org, the world's first and       pre-eminent open foreign       policy think tank, established in 2007 to engage the public, students,       academic researchers and       policymakers in an open and transparent discussion of international       affairs.
Williams has taken on       these roles as a way to influence the wider public debate on various       issues related to his research       expertise by providing counterpoints and information not readily available       to the public.
His       rationale is that in a democracy the public has ultimate oversight of       policy through elections and       the pressure it can bring to bear on elected policymakers, so that the       role of the research expert is       to facilitate discussion helpful to a democratic society.
Williams's       efforts produced an emergent       dynamic, where, for example, his Guardian writings led to       invitations for television appearances,       and his presence in public debate attracted the attention of policymakers       who requested his       involvement in their deliberations with invitations, for example, to       provide parliamentary testimony       and to engage in policy discussions with party officials.
Williams's research and expertise led to his inclusion in international       policy-planning exercises and       consultative assignments with the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs       and International Trade,       NATO Allied Command Transformation, the US Joint Forces Command, the UK       Foreign and       Commonwealth Office, the UK Ministry of Defence and the House of Commons       Defence Select       Committee.
He was selected three times as a `transatlantic opinion leader'       by NATO, and taken on       select trips in 2006, 2008 and 2012 to the mission in Afghanistan.
Williams was selected because       of the influence of his research and media work on NATO policy, and the       trips were designed to       allow NATO policymakers to garner external analysis and to `red team' NATO       operations.
The       visits also facilitated Williams's research by putting him in contact with       key officials on the ground,       and allowed him to feed back further recommendations to NATO HQ.
Williams       was also named to       the Media Advisory Group of the Ministry of Defence in recognition of the       impact of his analysis for       international news outlets on public opinion.
He provided briefings for       the senior leadership of the       Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour Parties.
His work has been       requested for official       parliamentary inquiries and was subsequently published by Parliament.
Williams served as a       foreign policy advisor Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, specifically advising       on NATO's role in       Afghanistan.
He co-authored the campaign's official policy paper on       Afghanistan with Barney       Rubin (NYU) and Seth Jones (RAND).
Williams's research has had particular impact on three users during the       REF period.
UK Labour Party defence policy.
Williams made specific         contributions to the official         Opposition's Shadow Defence Review from 2012 to 2013, whose work will         feed into a 2014         White Paper on Labour's defence and security strategy that will underpin         its 2015 manifesto         stance.
He attended three roundtable discussions and advised the Labour         team on issues         including the UK's nuclear posture, the regional sources of likely         future threats, the principles         that should shape UK counter-terror strategies overseas and future force         structure.
The         Shadow Secretary of State for Defence recognised the important ways in         which Williams's         close collaboration with practitioners and officials in both the West         and in Afghanistan         informed his research, noting that he `has a breadth of knowledge which         is vital and valuable         for our work and in each discussion he has provided the group with         specific insights from his         work overseas, in particular from his knowledge of US policy-making in         the security field'.
The         Shadow Secretary further confirmed: `The impact of Mike's contribution         has been to identify         the areas which the Shadow Defence Team must consider and research in         detail in order to         produce a meaningful White Paper, and to provide specific policy ideas         which we will reflect         on as we develop our platform'.
He also highlighted specific policy         ideas Williams helped         Labour assess, including `how to define UK strategic interests overseas,         a key element of our         consultation paper, and...how the UK should respond to the threat of         militancy in North and         West Africa, which has helped Labour to develop a position which is         distinct from that of the         UK Government'.
He affirmed that Williams's work on defence and         restructuring `will feed in         to our White Paper'.
Williams also edited the final version the Shadow         Secretary's speech to         the Henry Jackson Society (10 July 2012) that discussed the ethics and         norms of         international humanitarian intervention undertaken by NATO and other         organisations.
German Parliamentary State Secretary for Defence and Cassidian           (Airbus Military).
Through his Bosch Fellowship, Williams worked on a series of projects in         the German         Ministry of Defence, advising the Parliamentary State Secretary on         Afghan National Army         (ANA) developments and producing a report identifying ways that Germany         can influence         better European defence coordination despite the pressures of European         austerity measures.
He carried out a briefing on the strategic situation in Afghanistan for         the Secretary, providing         him with information to question the German High Representative for         Afghanistan on his         presentation of the situation on the ground.
The Bosch Fellowship also         gave Williams the         opportunity to work for Cassidian in their Future Concepts Division,         providing strategic insight         and recommendations to the CEO and Board of Directors on issues relevant         to the         organisation's future business plans.
Williams advised on whether         Cassidian should pursue         transatlantic versus European-only projects.
The company was at the time         focussed on         mainly transatlantic relations.
Williams supported continuing this but         advised that a         dedicated focus on joint European projects was also needed.
Cassidian is         now in the process         of restructuring to focus on increasing in-house capacity so as not be         as reliant on US         manufacturers (and therefore also US politicians).
NATO Policy Makers &#8212; Emerging Security Challenges and Operations.
Williams' work         was utilised extensively by NATO HQ in Brussels and NATO Allied Command         Transformation         in Norfolk, VA. His research on civil-military relations in Afghanistan         provided NATO with         critical analysis of current operations and influenced the development         of future NATO         doctrine and policy.
NATO has undertaken a process of developing a new         strategic concept         and new operational framework, and Williams has been involved since 2006         in the         discussions and deliberations of this process.
He was originally         contracted by NATO Allied         Command Transformation in Norfolk in 2006 (with US Joint Forces         Command), 2007 and         2008 to conduct various studies on security environment, on the impact         of emerging security         challenges on the organisation and on alliance cohesion.
He has         subsequently continued to         work with the Office of the Secretary General, Office of Policy Planning         and Office of         Emerging Security Challenges to help frame the debate and provide         foundation documents         for review by allied states to assist in their development of a new         strategic concept.
The 2012         trip to Afghanistan was in relation to this work.
The Press Officer for         the Public Diplomacy         Division of NATO HQ said of Williams's tours of Afghanistan and his         subsequent advice that         he `provided highly valuable insight and analysis on a wide range of         issues, ranging from the         tactical aspects of counter-insurgency operations, the Afghan-Pakistani         interplay, the         development of civil-military relations, NATO's cooperation with other         international         organizations within the comprehensive approach construct and the         Atlantic         Alliance's partnerships with Central Asian Republics and Russia'.
The         Press Officer also         noted Williams's role in a number of important outreach initiatives         based on the findings of         the tours.
The NATO Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security         Challenges confirms         that the work of the Carnegie Corporation funded project to which         Williams contributed had a         direct impact on NATO discussions and thinking on future civil-military         policy.
He also         affirmed the value of the feedback Williams provided from his three         trips to Afghanistan and         that Williams's `work on the interface between military forces, civilian         diplomats and civilian         non-governmental workers, has helped develop a better common         understanding of the         mutual interests and different operating procedures of these         organizations' and `provided         insight into how NATO policy-makers should think about these challenges         and how the         Alliance might respond to similar challenges in the future'.
The         Assistant Secretary General         further maintained that `Michael Williams's work has certainly been         beneficial and influential         to [NATO's] thinking'.
