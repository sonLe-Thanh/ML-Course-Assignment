     The digital dance projects have started the development of technological       innovation that allows for dynamic exploration of archives in digital       format.
The DDA project has begun to make a contribution to methods of       digital presentation of archives within the performing arts sector, where       expert advice is being sought from artists, companies, other archives, and       other user groups.
Evidence at this stage indicates that the system is fostering wider       public engagement with archive resources, as well as providing easily       available online resources for use in education (see access analysis below       which shows that DDA resources are beginning to be used in dance       education).
Furthermore, the innovative dynamic technology that has emerged from the       project will be further exploited in a Heritage Lottery-funded project       "Black Dance Archives" (http://blackdancearchives.co.uk),       in conjunction with Somerset-based State of Emergency production company.
The archive aims to record and share the contribution of British black       dancers to the wider dance ecology and to Britain's cultural life and will       continue to exploit the technology and digital infrastructure created by       the Digital Dance projects so far.
The DDA not only ensures that cultural heritage is preserved, but also       offers the unique opportunity to explore and search across a variety of       archive collections, with the resultant website acting as a portal to       explore the integrated collections.
Visitors to the website are able to explore the digital archive       materials; select and compile items into personally created virtual       scrapbooks; tag and share content; play and annotate video.
An example of       the participation is shown below; November 2013:                                Unique visitors           5,204                             Total visits           8,218                             Demographics           There are 220 registered users in 21 countries; visitors have come             from 97 countries around the world, including countries in Europe,             South America, the Middle East, Africa, the Indian continent, the             Far East, and Australasia.
The users typically exploring the archive             are from a range of sources.
For example, by November 2013 the             make-up of the registered users was academia (49%), school teachers             (7%), Companies/Organisations (12%), and unknown (32%).
User testimony includes:     The former artistic director of Extemporary Dance Theatre stated:     "This is a fabulous resource for researchers, students and for the         artists themselves, allowing us to explore dance archives in many         imaginative ways."
Dance UK's Information and Communications Officer commented that the       project is     "... really inspiring and holds incredible implications for dance         research and widening access to the art form."
A dance lecturer from University Campus Suffolk, commented:     "It has been particularly useful to see early footage of Laban when         introducing his movement analysis.
Incredible to be able to watch the         experiments."
http://www.surrey.ac.uk/library/nrcd/projects/dda/     The projects created significant impact for the non-academic project       partners in the digital industries, in particular the web design agency       Bullet Creative, based in South London.
Bullet worked on several of the       stated digital dance projects and continues to work on ongoing projects       with the School.
They were contracted for the DDA development and have       continued to work on the CCC-EED project and are also involved in future       developments around the DDA website.
The agency, established in 2000, benefited through the specific       engagement with dance and subject-related artistic and academic       perspectives which they gained and extended from the project.
The       involvement in the projects allowed its staff to increase their knowledge       capacity in producing enhanced web design through the engagement with       Surrey.
They were able to increase their subject knowledge in order to       intensify and expand their commercial portfolio of clients in the dance       sector.
Bullet Creative Ltd.'s Creative Director offered the following       feedback;     "Working on Digital Dance Archives has helped Bullet Creative expand in 4       key ways: Technical Knowledge, Academia, Dance, and Creativity.
Technically we have learnt new skills and, being able to work alongside       staff from University of Surrey, it has been really interesting to see       bleeding edge technologies being put to practical use.
From an academic       point of view, we have found it rewarding to see how research staff work       in the National Resource Centre for Dance and the Department of Dance.
In       terms of dance itself, working on DDA has crossed over with our work with       Siobhan Davies Dance and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance.
We have found crossovers       from our commercial work and the DDA project.
As artists ourselves, Bullet       are interested in creativity in all forms of art, we have found DDA itself       to be a great inspiration ranging from Laban sketches through to more       dance modern works."
