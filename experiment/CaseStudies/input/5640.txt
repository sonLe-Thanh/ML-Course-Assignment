     The impact has taken two main forms:             Appointment as special advisor in public policy debates and         activities to enhance public         awareness of important policy initiatives at national, subregional and         wider regional i.e.
the         EU) levels.
This was based on the recognition that Dangerfield's         research had clearly         made relevant contributions to knowledge and understanding of         subregional cooperation         processes in terms of the nature of specific subregional organizations,         the role of         subregional cooperation in different parts of post-communist Europe and         at specific points         in time, and the relationship between subregional cooperation and the         bigger 'game' of EU         integration.
The work on the VG, especially its role and limitations as         an agent for         supporting the European integration of former Soviet states has been         particularly relevant         for the impact as defined, while the broader body of work both in the         pre-accession and         post-accession contexts, and also the relevance of subregional         cooperation processes to         EU level schemes, namely the Macro-Regional Strategy.
The latter         has been in         development since 2009 and in many ways resembling and potentially         duplicating the role         and agendas of pre-existing subregional organizations.
The original         emailed invitation to         Dangerfield (copy on file at University of Wolverhampton) included the         words `We         particularly value your expertise in the field of regional and         sub-regional integration, and the         dynamic interplay between various levels of governance' (15/09/2009).

This concerned both the EU macro-regional strategy and         the relevance         of VG cooperation as a foreign policy instrument vis-a-vis the EU's         eastern neighbours.
The 'sites' of Dangerfield's impact as defined have been as follows:            Senior expert participant at the 6th Atelier of the Committee         of the Regions of the European         Union on EU Macro-Regional Strategies and European Governance held at         the Jacques Delors         Building, rue Belliard, Brussels on 26/11/2009.
