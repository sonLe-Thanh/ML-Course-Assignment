     In line with global changes, the UK auditing regulatory system was       significantly transformed from the mid-2000s onwards with an increased       role for audit committees and independent inspection of audit firms.
University of Glasgow research into the high-level financial reporting       interactions between UK companies and external auditors has:            formed the basis of evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on         Economic Affairs, influencing the policy debate and prompting several of         the Committee's recommendations;       consequently influenced an ongoing Competition Commission         investigation into the market concentration of audit companies; and       shaped audit industry working practices on a global level.
The House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs     In October 2011, Beattie and Fearnley gave oral evidence to the House of       Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs at the first of 11 evidence       sessions that scrutinised auditors.
They provided detailed written       evidence in advance of the oral session and supplementary evidence       afterwards.
In her opening statement to the Select Committee, Beattie       explained how their research had demonstrated:     ... strong concern amongst expert preparers in the UK, by which I mean         finance directors, audit committee chairs and auditors of listed         companies.
They are concerned about the accounting model; they are         concerned that we have lost the true and fair view and these principles         of substance over form and prudence, that we have moved to a         compliance-driven tick box kind of process where judgment has been lost;         they are concerned about the excessive length and complexity of         financial statements nowadays; and are concerned that, under IFRS, there         are a number of quite dysfunctional outcomes [1].
Beattie's evidence directly informed and influenced the extensive policy       discussion and was quoted in the Select Committee report, `Auditors Market       Concentration and their Role' (published March 2011).
The House of Lords       made the following recommendations as a direct result of Beattie's       evidence:             The IFRS should not be extended beyond large, listed companies in           the UK, where it is mandatory [2]     Beattie, Fearnley and Hine's research findings suggested that many       respondents were critical of the impact of International Financial       Reporting Standards (IFRS) and `fair value' on the integrity of financial       reporting.
According to the research, expert preparers did not believe       that IFRS had improved UK financial reporting.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) should initiate an investigation           into the audit market [3]     The OFT referred the audit market to the Competition Commission, the       investigation being justified by Beattie's and her colleagues' research       findings.
Specifically, the research based evidence provided by Beattie       underlined that the audit market, currently dominated by four main firms,       risked a monopoly if the number ever decreased to two or three firms.
The Competition Commission - Statutory Investigation     On the basis of Beattie's evidence to the House of Lords Select       Committee, she was approached by the Competition Commission in early 2012       to undertake a literature review as part of their statutory investigation       [4].
The literature review was a central feature of the provisional       findings report issued by the Commission in February 2013, acting as part       of an evidence-base from which it could draw [5].
Beattie's review was one       of only two pieces of research commissioned by the Competition Commission       during its investigation.
The Commission further utilised the research by       eliciting comments from accounting and auditing stakeholders which were       considered as part of the investigation.
Shaped audit industry working practices on a global level     Notwithstanding the impact of the research on the regulators, it has also       influenced the working practices of some of the UK's leading companies in       the field.

Deloitte UK is one of the Big Four global audit firms, with         tens of thousands of professionals in independent firms throughout the         world who collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory,         risk management and tax services to selected clients.
It employs around         169,000 people and conducts around 20,000 audits annually in the UK.
In         January 2010, the National Audit Technical Partner at Deloitte UK wrote         to inform Professor Beattie that the research `had more impact upon         [their] auditing processes than any other research in almost twenty         years'.
In his letter, the Deloitte Partner goes on to explain that the research       provided a rare `light-bulb moment' for the company in terms of its audit       behaviour, prompting it to adapt not only the timing of its audit       practices but to alter the nature of its interaction with clients [7].
