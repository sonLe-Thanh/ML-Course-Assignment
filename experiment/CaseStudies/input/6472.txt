     Verrall's research on stochastic claims reserving has had a profound and       lasting influence on the teaching and conduct of professional actuaries in       the UK and overseas.
Over a 15 year period, he has completed eight       research projects for the Institute of Actuaries, providing its members       with cutting-edge knowledge attuned to the realities of their working       lives [1].
Verrall also advises the Institute's curriculum team, has       written course handbooks and provides research-led CPD courses while his       seminal research with England is core reading for the General Insurance       examination and essential reading for anyone involved with claims       reserving [1b].
The influence of his research is far-reaching as the       Institute of Actuaries is one of only two professional bodies representing       actuaries in the UK and has a membership of 15,700.
Verrall's work has also influenced the body of knowledge taught to       actuaries in the USA where his name receives over 400 `hits' on the       website of the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) and his seminal papers are       core reading for professional examination 7 on Insurance Company Valuation       [2].
In 2009 the CAS, the professional body of actuaries in the USA       involved in general insurance, awarded him the Variance Prize for showing       how expert opinion can be inserted into a stochastic framework for loss       reserving [2b].
The CAS has over 5,600 full members making it the       country's second largest actuarial body.
The CAS former President Roger M       Hayne said: "To say that the work of Professor Verrall's and others at         the Cass Business School in the area of assessing and understanding the         uncertainty or volatility in one of the most common loss estimation         techniques is seminal might just be an understatement.
More than mere         citations in academic papers, that work has formed the basis of         techniques used by a fairly large number of insurers and consultants to         approach this very critical issue...A very large majority of consultants         and a substantial proportion of insurers use bootstrap techniques         stemming from the work of Professor Verrall in their practical work in         understanding and quantifying uncertainty in liability estimates"       [3].
Verrall's research has influenced thinking on how claims liabilities are       treated on the balance sheets of general insurance companies, benefiting       issuers, auditors and users of financial information.
In particular, his       work has influenced how the existing accounting treatment of the reserving       risk account has deficiencies because of the common use of deterministic       approaches to claims liability and how this might be improved through new       (stochastic) methods of estimation [4].
Given that non-life insurance       accounts for 5% of UK gross national product and the claims reserve is,       perhaps, the single most important number on the balance sheet, it is not       surprising that this research has caught the attention of the financial       regulators.
Paul Sharma of the former Financial Services Authority (FSA)       said of Verrall and England's research: "The FSA would like to see the         latest techniques available to, and applied by, all general insurance         actuaries.
The FSA regards stochastic models as fundamental to the         accounting reforms that the International Accounting Standards Board is         currently developing.
The FSA would also like to see stochastic models         become fundamental in regulations both in the UK and in Europe... and         would like to see the models introduced in the paper as a first stage in         producing standard stochastic techniques for regulatory purposes"       [5].
In 2008, a major collaboration began between Verrall and Nielsen and RSA       Group.
Research and its application for practical purposes gave the global       non-life insurance giant a better understanding of, and improvements in,       their claims reserving model [6].
Cass researchers immersed themselves       among RSA Group's personnel and systems in order to use expert industry       knowledge within the framework of sound statistical approaches.
The impact       of this collaboration was enhanced by long-term knowledge sharing between       RSA Group and Cass researchers, a process which continues.
Following the       success of the research collaboration, the RSA team responsible for claims       reserving seized the opportunity to embed the research into the training       offered to its graduate trainees.
Malcolm Cleugh, Reserving Actuary at RSA       Group, commented that RSA had been working with Professor Nielsen for nine       years, applying his reserving research in a summer internship programme       with final year students from the University of Oxford.
The interns apply       the research to real life RSA reserving data and assess the validity of       the methodologies developed [7].
Reserve model validation is a requirement       under Pillar One of Solvency II, the EU Directive which sets the amount of       capital an insurer should hold, due to come into effect in 2014.
The strategy of the RSA Group is to ensure it creates leading positions       in its chosen markets.
This has required RSA to explore the latest       developments in actuarial science and statistics that could improve the       management of its business.
The close collaborative work with Nielsen and       Verrall has convinced RSA Group of the advantages of the double chain       ladder method and RSA implements it in its daily operations.
This has       provided RSA Group with a scientific understanding and a means to validate       its work through well-established principles of mathematical statistics       [8].
An indication of the scale and reach of the work is evidenced by the       fact that RSA is active in 130 countries and in 2011 received &#163;8,138M of       net written insurance premiums, &#163;3,701M of which were in the UK and       Western Europe [9].
In late 2012, ACTUARIS International, a leading actuarial software       company, seeing the potential benefits to their clients of the Reversible       Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, proposed by Verrall and W&#252;thrich in       2012, adopted it into their new generation of reserving software, IBNRS.
In a communication to clients and subscribers ACTUARIS said: "This         research underlined the strong added value of RJMCMC to actuaries: and         this is the reason why ACTUARIS International's teams then decided to         implement this method in its reserving software IBNRS."
In order to       prove how efficient and useful the method is, ACTUARIS International, in       association with BNB (Belgium supervisor), led a real case study on the       method, using anonymous data from the Belgian market.
The conclusion was       that the method gives results quite similar to those provided by classical       chain ladder without requiring as many manual inputs and leads to       generally lower standard deviation and VaR (Value at Risk), which lead to       lower capital cost [10].
Once again, the benefits underpinned by the       research are felt far and wide.
ACTUARIS International provides software       to over 200 insurance companies worldwide, including AXA Insurance Group,       which has favourably appraised the IBNRS software [11].
The research insights of Verrall's seminal work on stochastic claims       reserving and bootstrapping combined with Nielsen's expertise in applying       these methods in real settings have enabled the researchers to influence       the general insurance industry on an international scale by producing       numerical estimates to show that their theory works and through their       ability to interpret real world phenomenon as examples of a general class       of events that the core theory might be used to examine.
Dix Roberts,       Chief Actuary at RSA Group, said: "The work of Verrall was of         fundamental influence and is used by us on a daily basis in a number of         different applications.
We have since then worked with Nielsen on         business-driven issues that have led to further academic research papers         by Nielsen and Verrall and their co-authors.
This whole body of work         that is accessible and easy to use through their free software is now of         growing importance for our business as well as for other non-life         insurance companies around the globe" [12].
