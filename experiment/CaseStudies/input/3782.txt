     The impact of underpinning MECACS research has reached across the       social and cultural elites of the Middle East and Central Asia and the       Western policymaking leaders, and its significance is exemplified by three       key beneficiaries: (i) Governments in the region who are formulating new       foreign and security policies; (ii) the social and cultural elites who are       playing a role in representing violence and conflict with a view to       fostering greater dialogue about past, present and future political       transformation; and (iii) individuals and institutions in higher education       in the Caucasus and Central Asia that have faced momentous reform from a       previous Soviet communist system.
The research has encouraged diverse       benefits to Western policy-makers and to the region's own societies,       cultures and individuals.
a) Benefits to the policy making community both in the West and the         MECAC region itself by stimulating policy debate verbally or in written         form     MECACS underpinning research has provided a particular brand of       research increasingly used by the policy-making community.
Unusually,       therefore, MECACS research holds significance for Western       policy-makers and for those involved in policy in the region itself.
Western think-tanks, government and intermediary organizations have       deliberately sought out MECACS expertise to self-criticize, better       inform and contextualize one-size-fits-all perspectives that often do not       speak to the recipients of aid or intervention.
- RH has been regularly consulted by governments (Intelligence Council       2012) and Japan Cabinet Office on the peace process and engagement with       Syria.
His paper, What Does Syria Want (2006), was disseminated to       US policy makers, stimulating a 2008 visit to St Andrews by intelligence       analysts (R1, C1, C6).
- The Centre for Syrian Studies assembled an international conference of       young scholars to discuss the Syrian Uprising (R1), with representatives       of the UK and German foreign offices participating and thereafter       influencing policy-makers (C2).
According to the former UK acting head of       mission in Damascus, the conference showed how "the academic and         policy worlds benefit from two-way conversation."
In a 2008 Damascus       Conference of over 50 participants the Centre brought together Syrian       officials and researchers, publishing the results in St Andrews Papers       (2012).
According to the foreign affairs spokesman of the Syrian National       Council, "the Centre's work is instrumental in informing the Syria         debate."
C2)     - RF was invited, on the basis of ongoing research on South Caucasus       conflicts since the 1990s (exemplified by R1 and R2), to write in 2012 the       synthesis of meetings of all the parties run by the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office and Georgian MFA which was then distributed to       conflict parties and to numerous European and North American governments       and became of crucial importance for the next step of British engagement       in a country that has seen the most intractable post-Soviet conflicts       (Abkhazia and South Ossetia) (C5)     - RF made invited presentations and briefings at the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office and the House of Commons, and served as the rapporteur       for a high-level Georgian Foreign Ministry &amp; FCO/Wilton Park-hosted       international conference on the Caucasus conflicts in March 2012 and       December 2013 (C5).
- Based on previous work (e.g.
R3 and R4), Fawn was engaged as the       international expert for a UK Conflict Pool-funded study of security and       social conditions in Abkhazia since the Russian-Georgian war (2012).
The       completed report was presented to the international community in Georgia       and to the authorities in Abkhazia and is serving as the basis for       reconsideration of international aid and development programmes.
(C5)     - SNC's 2005 research on elites and state building has led to her being       regularly consulted by the policy making and practitioner community on       policy toward Central Asia, e.g.
for the EU Commission (2008), US State       Department (2009), large corporate actors (2010), Bertelsmann Stiftung       (from 2008 annually) and UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office/Development       Office (from 2008 intermittently).
The Royal Institute of International       Affairs in November 2012 invited forty-five policy-makers, IO       representatives, leading scholars, embassy representatives, international       business representatives to discuss the findings of SNC's book, Understanding         Central Asia, partly to discuss how findings of such a book can best       be translated into workable documents for policy-makers on the region,       with a follow-up meeting in September 2013 (C4).
b) Benefits to constituents that observe or are party to conflicts or         intercommunal violence with impacts on creativity, culture and society     MECACS underpinning research has benefitted those making policy       and those striving to bring greater understanding between different       factions involved in violence.
RF's UK Conflict Pool-funded analysis of       living conditions in Abkhazia after the 2008 war is a critical example: it       identified gaps in provisions by intergovernmental and INGO assistance and       societal needs and provided the definitive basis for changing actual       practice at the communal level.
As a different mechanism, RF, with SNC,       assembled in St Andrews MECACS seminars high-ranking       representatives from countries across the Caucasus lacking diplomatic       relations that were publically recorded (such as on embassy websites), for       dialogue especially on another intractable conflict, Nagorno-Karabakh       (C5).
In 2009 SNC was invited to become a Director of the Kyrgyz-British         Society (KBS), a not-for-profit organization where she regularly       participates in cultural events that gather academics, policy-makers, NGOs       and interested parties also raising money to benefit charitable       organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic: in January 2012 the KBS raised       &#163;1,500 for an orphanage in Bishkek.
SNC's research on identity and       politics (R5) has led to the production of cultural artefacts (a 2008       documentary film, Silent Witnesses, produced by SNC) plus the       enhancement of cultural presentation (an exhibition of visual art).
It has       proven useful also to cultural entrepreneurs and civil society       organizations who are working to overcome inter-communal violence and       poverty.
Stakeholders involved in formulating cultural policy in the       Kyrgyz Republic &#8212; Ministry of Culture, artists and local communities &#8212;       invited SNC in 2008 and 2009 to hold several showings of Silent         Witnesses and provide a neutral platform for discussion of sensitive       political issues.
The May 2013 London exhibition, Ketsin!
Art and         Revolution in the Kyrgyz Republic, that SNC curated and which ran       over 4 days, benefits the artistic community whose output can be used both       to increase in the West the overall profile and understanding of a small       resource-poor state, the Kyrgyz Republic, and to serve the broader       audience consumers who as a result more openly discuss pivotal political       events, particularly after Kyrgyzstan 2010 inter-communal violence which       left hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.
c) Benefits to individuals and institutions in the region's higher         education sector     Finally, the underpinning MECACS research described in section 2       has influenced and abetted institution- and capacity-building in the MECAC       region.
SNC and RF participate multiple times a year in two of the Open       Society Foundation's flagship programmes, Central Asia Research and       Training Initiative (CARTI) and the Academic Fellowship programme (AFP),       an involvement which began about 10 years ago.
CARTI creates exceptional       and transformational opportunities for individual researchers from the       region; AFP engages in sustainable reform of academic departments across       the region.
In 2008 SNC produced an edited book (R6) as part of the AFP       programme that for the first time exposed scholars in the Kyrgyz       Republic's leading University (AUCA) to a rigorous peer-review process.
A       new research sabbatical scheme was adopted, and CARTI and AFP have       overhauled entire curricula and introduced good academic practice among       leading institutions of the country, navigating a difficult path from       communism to post-communism.
For example, SNC was asked to present to the       AUCA's Acadamic Management Board a peer review teaching system,       subsequently adopted.
The Open Society's regional director (C3) writes       (2011): `Dr Cummings' input has been central in building up our         flagship research development program in the social sciences and the         humanities for the region of Central Asia and South Caucasus...she         brings sincere interest, deep commitment and profound human connection         to the colleagues in the region and their daily life and work         experiences.'
The above measures constitute sustained and ongoing       change to the fates of individuals and institutions.
