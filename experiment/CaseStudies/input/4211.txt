     Direct impacts of our underpinning research are threefold: one,       direct influence on local and government treatment of late medieval and       early modern sites to foster a shared sense of heritage; two,       sustained public participation bridging the sectarian divide combined with       a proactive media strategy that has brought the dialogue to millions, and       three, empowerment of community partners in attaining research       funds for investigating their shared heritage.
The GAP approach to       archaeology as a means of conflict resolution is globally relevant,       founded on the principle that enhanced knowledge of the complexities of       the past overturns perceptions of sites belonging exclusively to one or       another tradition, fostering mutual respect.
Responses from public       participants are indicative of archaeology's transformative capacity: `we           need to re-visit our understanding (pre-conceived ideas) about           the whole process of the plantation'; `by involving archaeologists           they can exert such influence,' while community relations       staff engaging with GAP archaeology note impacts: `gave me ideas           for use in my training on cultural issues &amp; heritage'(Evidence         file 7)            Influence on non-HEI practice (selected examples).
GAP research led to a NIEA-funded multi-year programme of work on         Ulster Plantation sites (2009-2013).
QUB-led projects pioneered a public         engagement strategy which is now a condition of the archaeological         licensing procedure.
NIEA has also used GAP plantation research as `an             impetus of change in its presentation of sites' and         described relationship with GAP as `a very productive             collaboration... providing high class scholarly research to inform             our heritage decisions and actions'.

GAP and Time Team investigation of Castle Hill in Dungannon led to         Dungannon Council attaining &#163;5,500,000 from HLF to develop Castle Hill         (renamed "The Hill of O'Neill") and nearby Ranfurly House as an arts and         heritage centre, while the Channel 4 programme presented the Gaelic and         Plantation histories to a UK audience of over 1.2 million in 2008.
In         opening the new Centre in October 2012 NI's Deputy First Minister         (Martin McGuinness, S&#237;nn Fein) specifically welcomed the `coming             together of the Planter and the Gael' demonstrated by our         investigation of the shared history of the site (Evidence file 6).
Research and excavation at Struell Wells, former site of Catholic         pilgrimage with continuity of use traced back to St Patrick in the 8th         century (McCormick in Proceedings of the Royal Society of           Antiquaries 2009), directly influenced the Catholic Church to         perform Mass at the site after two centuries of disuse.
Its inclusion in         the NI Tourism-funded St Patrick's trail/ Christian Heritage initiative,         with investment in enhanced signage and conservation, highlights shared         heritage value and according to MP Margaret Ritchie (letter) was         `invaluable' and `greatly added to our local             tourism product', as part of Lecale regional economic and         social regeneration (Evidence files 4 and 6).
GAP consultation with Belfast City Council, Coleraine Borough Council,         Derry City Council and Limavady Borough Council led to collaborative         cross-community archaeological education activities in 2013         commemorating 1613 town charters.
Belfast City Council (BCC) notes: `Our           ability to access best and latest research is vital in impacting on             good relations,' and describes `archaeology as a             vital tool because it exemplifies shared history... impacts on and             challenges the facile dichotomies which dominate popular             understanding ... a case study of the relevance of the             academy in a civic context.'
(Evidence file 3 plus two           books commissioned by BCC).
Changing public understandings of plantation through engagement                 66 schools (27 controlled majority Protestant, 32 maintained majority         Catholic, 7 integrated) engaged with 24 GAP plantation-period projects,         enabling children to work on site with students from other schools         across the sectarian divide.
Participating teachers report being         empowered to incorporate plantation educational material in the         classroom: "instilled confidence in me as a teacher to             bring history to life and to use our local heritage resources to             enhance children's learning experiences... inspired to             develop this aspect of my teaching in the future and will             encourage other practitioners to do the same."
(Evidence           file 10).
A proactive media strategy made the contested history of the period a         subject for wider public dialogue.
In addition to the Time Team         at Dungannon, BBC Northern Ireland undertook site interviews with         Ballyahagan and Dunnalong participants for BBC Radio Ulster's Your           Place and Mine and Evening Extra and a television         programme entitled Under the Radar; the Belfast excavation was         broadcast throughout the UK on ITV's Daybreak programme; and the         Televisionary program Ulster Unearthed featured QUB research and         community practice at Dunluce, Dunnalong, Carrickfergus, and Drumreagh (Evidence           file 10).
Feedback from 100s of adult participants in excavations highlight the         life-changing nature of their experience as individuals forged         non-sectarian alliances through engaging in a shared process of         discovery about a shared past, eg Ballintoy Archaeological and         Historical Society, working with GAP, `the knowledge we gained of             the complicated nature of the Plantation period challenged             our previously held views.
Members ... from different             backgrounds are now more willing to discuss the impact of             the Plantation... willing to reconsider their own identities             in light of what they have learnt through engaging with professional           archaeologists....it gave us the confidence to tackle sensitive             issues ...helping to improve community relations and assist             conflict resolution'.
The Dunnalong excavation brought         together NI groups with groups from the Republic of Ireland while the         2011 Castlecaulfield excavation engaged the cross-community Killeeshil         and Clonaneese Historical Society in County Tyrone `since 2011 we             have been experiencing a `Golden Age' in local history and             culture' with cross community membership expanding.
In         Belfast, the Ballyaghagan Belfast Hills community excavation captured         local interest, with Facebook and Twitter sites         recording over 600 daily hits and 12,385 impressions on site posts.
A         follow-on project in May 2013 built upon the enhanced cross-community         cooperation developed in the first project (Evidence files 5, 7, 9).
Facilitation of non-HEI partners in attaining funding for shared             heritage (selected)                 Causeway Museum Service received European Union Peace III moneys for a         programme of plantation tours building on an experimental programme         featuring GAP research sites and co- led by Horning.
These `public             interface programmes... that your plantation research enabled,             supported cross community civic plans to mark the 400th             anniversaries of the Royal town charters granted to             Coleraine and Limavady in an inclusive manner, (letter           from Coleraine Borough Council).
&#163;205,000 (Evidence file 2)       Ballintoy Archaeological &amp; Historical Society, Bushmills         Historical Society, Millstrand Integrated Primary School and Tayvallich         Primary School, partnering with GAP and Univ.
Ulster archaeologists in         an AHRC-funded Connected Communities project on the shared late medieval         heritage of the Isles, submitted successful applications to All our         Stories, HLF.
&#163;40,000.
AHRC Follow on funding (&#163;68,000) from the         Connected Communities project led to capacity building project with the         Colonsay and Oronsay Heritage Trust: "Our relationship with the             research team has given everyone so much more confidence;             confidence in the value of our heritage and confidence in             our own achievements; a belief that what we are doing is worthwhile"         (Evidence file 8)       Direct facilitation from Donnelly led to establishment of the         cross-community Killeeshil and Clonaneese Historical Society in Co.         Tyrone.
GAP archaeologists continue to work with the society, whose name         references the local Catholic and Presbyterian parishes, to explore the         late medieval through plantation-period history of their locale.
The         Society successfully attained EU Peace III funding, &#163;5,000.
