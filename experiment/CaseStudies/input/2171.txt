     The underpinning research delivered the first concrete and specific       insights into service organisation, content and provision for pwP.
Crucially, the research has been able to directly influence and inform       government and professional body aims, policies and guidelines, as well as       contributing to the education and training of professionals.
The research       has also informed resources for pwP and their carers.
The research has       therefore contributed to the wellbeing of pwP in the UK and across Europe.
Influencing and Informing Government and Professional Body Aims,         Policies and Guidelines     Drawing on research findings, the lead researcher Miller has presented       evidence to parliamentary enquires and committees.
For example, as a       result of giving evidence to the All Party      Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Parkinson's Disease, the research was       cited multiple times in the final report on Parkinson's Disease services.
This report identified significant barriers and inequalities in service       access and made a number of key recommendations.
Research insights were       used to provide evidence in relation to palliative and end of life care,       inadequacies in the experience and expertise of key professionals,       including training issues, and inequalities in access to speech and       language therapy provision.
For example, the report states "Dr Nick         Miller provided evidence about the importance of seeing patients from         the point of diagnosis to prevent, or delay, many serious complications         that may be experienced by people in the later stages of Parkinson's         disease, such as swallowing problems and malnutrition, as well as speech         problems.
However his research findings highlighted major shortfalls in         preventative interventions" (pp8-9) (IMP1).
As a result of the research, Miller has been invited and appointed to       join key committees.
For example, in 2009 Miller was invited to join a       committee to oversee the implementation of National Institute for Health       and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Guidelines for Parkinson's UK (PUK) (a       national patient advocacy organisation).
He was also invited onto a       further audit steering committee that was set up to implement, in       cooperation with professional bodies (e.g.
Royal College of Speech and       Language Therapists (RCSLT); British Geriatric Society), an annual       national audit of services of the management of pwP to monitor change in       services.
The annual audits help healthcare organisations measure their       services against NICE guidelines and aids them in improving and developing       their services for pwP, as part of the wider improvement agenda.
Miller       had direct input into the audit tools for medical services, which drew       directly from the underpinning research process.
Leading figures from PUK       confirmed that "We were able to draw directly on Nick Miller's research         and input to achieve this.
This tool has in the meantime been fully         implemented across the NHS and is delivering valuable data for         Parkinson's UK in driving up standards of services for people with         Parkinson's and has been praised by users as a tool that directly         facilitates review and improvement of their clinical services" (IMP2).
Following the success of the above tool, Miller was also selected as       specific lead for the speech-language therapy tool and "his research         work in already conducting national surveys of service user and provider         issues for people with Parkinson's was invaluable in this respect".
The SLT tool "has received very positive feedback as a method to         benchmark and improve services" (IMP2).
Findings from the research have been incorporated into guidelines       nationally and internationally.
The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines       Network (SIGN), which develops evidence-based clinical practice guidelines       for NHS Scotland, cited the research in its national clinical guideline       (2010) in the sections on Communication and Non-Motor Symptoms (IMP3).
The Dutch ParkinsonNet (Dutch patient advocacy organisation) guidelines,       which are highly regarded internationally, draw on the research to provide       support for everyday clinical practice.
Citing the research findings, the       guidelines highlight the need for more in-depth assessments beyond the       sole use of checklists, as Parkinson's can have an impact on swallowing       and communication behaviour even if the patient looks like they are doing       satisfactorily on the surface (IMP4).
The relevance of the       research to clinical practice is also reflected in Miller's role as       national advisor to the RCSLT.
RCSLT's Head of Professional Development       confirmed that: "[Miller] has supported the work of the RCSLT over many         years and his research work continues to have an impact on clinical         practice.
He made a significant contribution to 'Communicating Quality         3' (the RCSLT's professional standards publication) by         authoring/co-authoring three chapters.
Whilst published in 2006 this         continues to support the practice of the SLT profession [...]         Through his role as national adviser for acquired neurological disorders         (in particular motor speech disorders), he regularly provides up to         date, evidence based information to our members.
This information         supports clinical decision making in practice.
Professor Miller is         contacted regularly on behalf of our members due to his in-depth         knowledge and expertise in his field" (IMP5).
Contributing to Education and Training of Professionals and Informing         Resources for pwP     Insights from the research have been used to inform education, training,       clinical practice and resources for pwP.
For example, Miller used the       research to contribute to the British Medical Journal Continuing Medical       Education Programme, BMJ Learning, on the module `Common Speech       and Language Disorders in Adults: an Overview'.
This module is taken by a       wide range of medical professionals and is accredited by Professional       Bodies worldwide, for example, the Austrian Academy of Physicians and the       Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (IMP6).
An       Erasmus project has used research findings as recommendations for teaching       programme content and benchmarks in Speech Language Therapy courses in       Europe, such as a post-qualifying specialisation course, `European       Clinical Specialisation in Motor Speech Disorders' (IMP7).
Drawing       directly on the research, Miller has delivered webcasts and podcasts.
For       example, his video podcast for healthcare professionals on the Special       Interest Group Neurology section of the GlaxoSmithKline website offers an       overview of the types and extent of changes in communication associated       with Parkinson's and outlines some issues and practices in intervention to       support people with Parkinson's who experience such changes (IMP8).
Miller has also been invited to address/train colleagues on the issues at       workshops in many countries.
The research has informed the content of publications and services to       support both professionals and pwP.
Several PUK information sheets which       focus on swallowing, saliva control, communication, speech, voice and       language, drew on the research and are available in hard copy for clinics       and online for professionals and service users worldwide (IMP2,9).
Pre-eminence of the work and Miller's international expertise in this       field was also acknowledged in late 2010 when he was chosen to be the       `resident' expert on the PUK web-based `ask the expert' site where people       from around the world can write in with their questions about any aspects       of the field (IMP2,10).
Miller has also been involved in several       radio and TV broadcasts in the UK and other countries around the topic of       communication and swallowing changes.
