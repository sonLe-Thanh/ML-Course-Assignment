     Impact was facilitated: (i) methodologically through DWR,       building knowledge exchange into research design (See Rickinson, Sebba and       Edwards (2011) Improving Educational Research through User Engagement,       London: Routledge); (ii) presentationally through reports for       practitioners and local leaders, for UK policy makers, and for European       policy communities; (iii) interactionally though membership of       national advisory boards e.g.
the CWDC research advisory group (2008-9),       the LGA's expert groups on research and policy (2009 and 2013),       Oxfordshire's task groups on workforce development and evaluation of       preventative services (2010-2012); and (iv) pedagogically through       workshops with practitioner and trainer groups from Cheshire to Osaka, and       presentations e.g.
to Directors of Children's Services, DfES conferences       and to the European Commission in Brussels.
These methods led to the following types and geographical scales of       impact:     Local &#8212; In Oxfordshire, the DIW project [S6] informed the       configuration of the seven Hubs for co-located preventative services       established in 2011.
A senior manager in Oxfordshire Children's Services       explains the impact of the ideas such as relational expertise, resourceful       practice, and rule bending [R2-4, 6], on all of their Children's       Services: `The research team worked with all the key players in children's       services in the authority, helping us shape the services that are now       available to all children, young people and families in Oxfordshire.
The       ideas from their research [...] helped us enormously in planning our       innovative approach to prevention.
I have subsequently been in regular       contact with Anne Edwards and Maria Evangelou, who have given       research-based support [S10] to the development of       inter-professional working in the Hubs.'
[C1].
Edwards has also       run research-based workshops for local authorities on inter-professional       work (Cheshire, Oxford, SE England, SE Wales, NCSL).
National &#8212; The NECF [S1][R1] analyses of workforce       learning through interagency working in the Children's Fund informed       systemic service integration and third sector involvement in preventative       services.
The emphasis on what the childcare workforce needed to learn was       also evident in ELPP [S4][R4].
These evaluations identified       resourceful relational practice, making it visible and accessible to local       and national policy communities and to service providers.
The TLRP study (LIW) [S2][R2] was selected as one of six high       impact studies for an in-depth profile in the 2nd phase       evaluation of the TLRP demonstrating impact on practice and policy [C2,         pp.
2 and 52].
One example of impact was the LGA (DIW) study [S6],       which took the TLRP LIW findings to local authority networks through       practical long-term interventions in three authorities to inform and       support change processes.
It identified and scrutinised the knowledge that       was mobilised locally to improve interagency collaboration, focusing on       the systemic implications of rule-bending and the need to build relational       expertise for interagency collaborations [R4].
DIW also created a       LGA tool kit based on DWR, for UK children's services to use in developing       services.
The positive impact of this work is attested by a Lead Analyst       from the LGA: `The intervention work was timely as it was undertaken when       most authorities were grappling with achieving the reconfiguring of       services for children and families and engaging the whole workforce.
The       intervention helped senior teams in local authorities conceptualise the       changes and the challenges and provided new intellectual resources for the       LGA.'
[C3]     Also at national level, findings from the ESRC-funded PSE study [S3][R5]       on lack of training for school-based welfare workers, again emphasised in       ELPP [S4][R4], led to two internal reports for CWDC [S5]       to inform the social work remodelling exercise.
A senior officer at CWDC,       and later at the DfE, explains the impact of this research: `Anne's work       for the Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC) brought her       programme of research on inter-professional working to the group of people       best placed to use it to inform both policy and practice in the       development inter-professional preventative work.
As the social work       remodelling project gathered pace the strategic team found ideas in the       two commissioned reports and in Anne's wider programme of research to be       very useful and integrated them into our thinking.'
[C4]     Concepts such as resourceful practice, rule-bending, relational expertise       and common knowledge [R2, 4, 6] informed between them The         Resourceful Leader (2011) and Leading for Learning (2012)       reports for the NCSL.
The Resourceful Leader [S7, 8] was       sent to all local authorities, was the basis of a 360&#176; evaluation tool       used with almost 2,000 senior and middle leaders in the sector, and has       informed work on systems leadership by the professional development arm of       the Association of Directors of Children's Services, the Virtual Staff       College.
Leading for Learning expanded on The Resourceful         Leader to show how seeing leadership as promoting learning helped       DCSs use the human resources at their disposal to their best advantage.
It       too was distributed to all local authorities, and is used in leadership       training for DCSs.
A 'leading for learning' audit tool was produced by the       VSC which drew heavily on the report and was published in the VSC Leadership         in Practice series [C5].
Both reports are widely read by       DCSs and have made important contributions to sector development, as a       Senior Officer at the VCS explains: `[These reports have] been extremely       influential in shaping thinking about the kind of leadership required in       the complex world of children's services in which professional leadership       is always shared with politicians and a range of other stakeholders and       partners [...They are] regularly cited by DCSs as a significant influence       on the way in which they have approached the challenge of leadership in       the current financial crisis.'
[C6]     International &#8212; References to Edwards' concepts of relational       agency [R3, 4] and the development of professional practice are       found in a New Zealand government study of early education [C7];       the creation of resources for the education of nurses and teachers in       Denmark [C8]; and recommendations for developing collaboration in       Victorian (Australia) early years centres [C9].
Relational agency       is identified in the latter as an enabler of collaborative practice on a       par with `leadership and communication' and `structures and processes' [C9].
Edwards is a member of the Network of Experts on Social Aspects of       Education and Training (NESET), which commissioned her report Alliances         for Inclusion, for the European Commission (EC), to inform       children's service integration across Europe [S9].
Written for       policy-makers and launched in Brussels in May 2013, it `improves our       knowledge base' for the implementation of the EC `social investment       package' for children [C10].
It was sent to relevant ministries       across Europe and 700 hard copies have been requested or distributed at       conferences by the Commission.
There have been 1,249 views of the web       version on the EC website and 263 downloads (18.10.13).
Edwards has also       summarised it as a 1.5k word contribution to the UK National Children's       Bureau's autumn publication to inform pre-election party manifestos on       policies for children.
