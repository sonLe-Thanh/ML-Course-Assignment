     Armed forces, security and intelligence services are traditionally closed       domains resistant to       external influence.
In spite of this, the extensive reach of these impacts       can be seen in the fact that       they have significantly affected the standards endorsed by the UN and COE,       as well as the world's       largest security organisation (the OSCE), UK government, and the UK       Intelligence and Security       Committee.
The research impact has arisen through direct engagement with       senior policy-makers       and parliamentarians in several countries (eg Albania, Azerbaijan,       Georgia, Kosovo and the UK) as       well as with the COE, OSCE and UN.
The significance of the impact lies in       the changes in       international security sector policy and law reform on security and       intelligence, as evidenced by       legislative change in the UK and reforms relating to the human rights of       armed forces personnel in       the OSCE, COE and their member states.

Influencing the UN in the field of human rights protection:       Durham University's research on       intelligence governance (outputs 4 and 6) were `the most       influential secondary sources in shaping       the focus of the UN's Compilation of good practices on legal and         institutional frameworks and         measures that ensure respect for human rights by intelligence agencies         while countering terrorism,         including on their oversight report submitted by the Special       Rapporteur on countering terrorism       while respecting human rights to the UN Human Rights Council (source         1).
According to the       report's co-author, a Project Coordinator for DCAF, the UN Report is `the       first set of international       principles on the regulation and oversight of intelligence services' (source         1).
It was released in       2010 and has since been `translated into all UN official languages ...       presented throughout the       world and cited by a number of leading national intelligence oversight       bodies' (source 1).
He continues `more than half of the good practices presented to the UN       Human Rights Council       were directly influenced' by outputs 4 and 6 (source 1).
Of the 35 `good practices' identified 29       are either wholly or substantially the same as (19), or partially based on       (10), those elaborated in       output 4.
The report follows output 4 by (a) closely       following its substantive content in the       practices endorsed and (b) adopting a best practice approach to       intelligence oversight standards       based on a survey of legislation.
The report's co-author describes the       analysis in output 4 as       having been `invaluable in shaping' the sections dealing with human rights       protection (source 2         [27-33]), information collection (source 2 [34-46]) and the       use of personal data (source 2 [37-40])       and that `the framework for intelligence governance pioneered in [output         1] ... underpins the       approach taken in the UN compilation' (source 1).
The endorsed       good practices include ensuring       a clear mandate and legal basis for security and intelligence agencies,       oversight institutions,       complaints processes and effective remedies, principles of responsibility       and accountability for       state institutions and individual officials.
As recommended in output         1, the practices also endorse       working principles of impartiality, non-discrimination and professionalism       in, among other things,       intelligence collection and the use of powers of arrest and detention, and       intelligence-sharing and       cooperation (source 2, good practices 1-13, 15-26, 31-33 &amp; 35).

Influencing the UK Intelligence and Security Committee and           Justice and Security Act           2013: In November 2010, Leigh presented options for reform of       intelligence oversight at a high-level       policy conference supported by the Cabinet Office at the Royal United       Services Institute,       timed to coincide with the Government's Strategic Defence and Security       Review and the then-planned       Counter-Terrorism Legislation Review (launched in October 2011).
Following       this, Leigh       was one of two academics invited to brief the Chair of the ISC in writing       on reform options (source         3).
Drawing on outputs 2, 4-6, Leigh (with Gill, Honorary       Fellow, University of Liverpool)       advocated enhanced democratic oversight of the intelligence and security       services by reforming       the remit, status and powers of the ISC and introducing an independent       fact-finding process       (source 3).
These recommendations were subsequently discussed at a       meeting of the ISC and       shaped its own submission to the Government's review (source 3).
In that submission the ISC       proposed that it should become a Committee of Parliament, have an extended       remit to cover the       entire intelligence community in the UK, have the power to compel the       provision of information       (subject to a ministerial veto), and have greater investigative and       research resources (source 4,         section 7).
A number of these proposals were considered in the Justice and         Security Green Paper (source         5, [3.16]) and were subsequently enacted in the Justice and Security       Act 2013.
The legislation       reflects Leigh's briefing to the ISC and the underlying research (outputs         2, 4-6) by extending       oversight to the whole intelligence community and by enhancing       parliamentary ownership of       oversight through parliamentary appointment of ISC members, provision to       those members of       security of tenure and control over Chair selection.
The Act also gives       the ISC powers to obtain       `operational' information and greater autonomy over the content and timing       of reports to Parliament       (see respectively, output 4, chs.
16, 18 &amp; 19 and       Justice and Security Act 2013, sections 1(3),       1(6), 2(3), 3(1) and 3(6) and sched.

Influencing standards for rights protection of Armed Forces           personnel in the Council of           Europe (COE): In 2010 the Council of Ministers of the COE       formally adopted a series of principles       for protecting the human rights of armed forced personnel based       substantially on output 3 (source         6).
Durham University's research is the sole non-treaty source       referred to in this resolution.
Of the       85 principles in the resolution, 37 correspond directly to best practices       advocated in output 3.
(See       those concerning torture and inhuman and degrading punishment (COE 10-12;       output 3 chs.
16 &amp;         20), military discipline (COE 21, and 33; output 3, ch.
21),       trial of criminal charges (COE 29-31;       output 3, ch.
21), respect for private and family life (COE 36, 38-9; output         3 chs.
14 &amp; 17),       freedom of religion and conscientious objection (COE 40-41 and 44-46; output         3, chs.11 &amp; 10),       freedom of expression (COE 47-48; output 3, ch.
8), the right to       access to relevant information       (COE 49; output 3 ch.
15), the right of peaceful assembly and       association (COE 53-57; output 3,         chs.
8 &amp; 9), the right to vote and stand for election (COE 58       and 59; output 3, ch.
8), the right to       fair remuneration and a retirement pension (COE 63-65; output 3, chs.
13, 17 &amp; 18), dignity at       work and non-discrimination (COE 66, 70-74,75 and 77; output 3, chs.
11-14 &amp; 17), the treatment       of young recruits (COE 79-80 and 82-84; output 3 ch.
15), human       rights training (COE 83-85;       output 3 ch.
19), and the right o complain to an independent body       (COE 85; output 3 chs.
16 &amp;         22).
The resolution recommends that member states give effect to       these principles in national       legislation and through military training, practice and dissemination.
Although not formally binding,       this resolution provides an international impetus for legislative and       practical reform at domestic       level across the 47 member states of the COE, with the principles       providing rights-based       benchmarks for that process.

Promoting Rights Protection for Armed Forces Personnel in OSCE           Countries: The findings       of output 3 have been extensively used by the OSCE to raise       awareness in participating states of       the rights of armed forces personnel and to advocate policy change at the       national level.
The       OSCE has funded presentations and translations of output 3 in over       12 countries and distributed it       to ministries of defence in all 56 OSCE countries.
It was officially       launched, in May 2008, by       DCAF/OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights at an       international conference       focussing on the recommendations concerning the role of military ombudsmen       in protecting human       rights of armed forces personnel and subsequently presented at the UN       Human Rights Council       and at the Congress of the European Organisation of Military Associations       (Euromil) (source 7).
These activities have resulted in concrete changes in a number of member       states.
For example, in       Bosnia-Herzegovina the Handbook has prompted discussion in the       Parliamentary Defence       Committee of the introduction of a military ombudsman's office (as       advocated in chapter 22 of         output 3) and an agreement `to increase efforts to ensure gender       equality in the armed forces' and       `to look again at existing legislation on freedom of association, which is       currently restricted for       armed forces personnel' as advocated in chapter 9 (source 8, p 35).
Similarly, in 2009 the       Armenian government and OSCE agreed to revitalise NGO oversight over the       security sector and       to set up a training programme on human rights for Armenian armed forces       personnel as       advocated in chapter 19 of output 3 (source 8, p. 35).
Output         3 has also been used by the       Armenian Ministry of Defence for training the staff of army units and       military educational institutions       (source 9, [4]).
In 2010, Albania also committed to including the       Handbook (output 3) in the       curriculum of its military academy (source 10, p 41).
