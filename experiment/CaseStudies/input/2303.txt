     Knowledge exchange (KE) has been integral to the work of Jackson's       research group, built in from the earliest project design phase and       supported by core funding as well as through specific funding for KE.
The       research has impacted on public understanding, changing school curricula,       influencing food manufacturers and retailers, and informing national food       safety policy.
Enhancing public understanding: The public impact of Jackson's       research is on-going and has included the Food Glorious Food       exhibition (in Sheffield and London) and the Food Stories       educational website (hosted by the British Library).
Inspired by our Changing         Families, Changing Food research, the Food Glorious Food       exhibition was held at Weston Park Museum in Sheffield (March-November       2010), later transferring to the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood in Bethnal       Green.
The exhibition included extracts from Jackson's oral history       research, facilitated by a &#163;9k grant from HEIF's Knowledge Transfer       Opportunities Fund.
At Weston Park, the exhibition received &gt;150,000       visitors &#8212; the museum's most popular exhibition to date.
At the Museum of       Childhood, the exhibition received &gt;125,000 visitors.
In their formal       evaluation [S1], Museums-Sheffield reported that over half of the visitors       felt that it had given them a new understanding of food and 61% said         that they intended to make lifestyle changes as a result of attending       (cooking more often, eating more fruit and vegetables, thinking more       carefully about what they eat).
The report described the exhibition's       success in strengthening Museums-Sheffield's relationship with the       University, the NHS and the V&amp;A, enhancing their reputation for       delivering high quality, popular exhibitions.
The Food Stories website was developed in partnership with the       British Library, drawing directly on Jackson's AHRC-ESRC research.
It       includes testimony from business leaders about the development of the       `cold chain' (which made fresh chicken widely available to UK consumers),       reflections on the moral geographies of sugar production, and commentaries       on food and multiculturalism.
The research has also made an enduring       contribution to the Library's collections (especially the National Life       Stories' Food: from source to salespoint archive) where the life       history interviews (including recordings, transcripts and summaries) are       available for public use.
The group's work has received extensive media coverage in BBC News       Online, The Times, The Guardian, The Economist and the         Yorkshire Post and on radio and in the trade press.
It was the       subject of a double-page spread in the Times Higher and was       included in the Academy of Social Sciences' Health and Wellbeing       brochure (making the case for the social sciences).
Changing school curricula: The Food Stories website has       been widely used in UK secondary schools as part of the KS3-4 National       Curriculum in Geography and Citizenship.
The website was promoted through       presentations at the Geographical Association (GA) annual conference and       through a paper in Teaching Geography (2008).
A CD of 27 interview       extracts was produced and distributed without charge at conferences and       other public events (including ESRC's Festival of Social Science).
The       website attracts &gt;10,000 unique visitors a year (30,000 since January       2011) and was nominated for an award by The Guild of Food Writers [S2].
Writing in the GA's flagship journal Geography (2010) a London       school-teacher described the website's value in teaching about food and       multiculturalism, motivating students to develop their understanding of       cultural pluralism and social integration [S3].
Assessing its wider       educational significance, the GA's former Chief Executive writes that       Jackson's work has had `significant impact ... on the way geography in         schools is conceptualized', also confirming that `his clear         articulation of the relational understanding that thinking         geographically can bring is an acknowledged influence in the GA's         proposals to government with respect to the current national curriculum         review' (letter dated 8 June 2012) [S4].
Influencing commercial strategies: The impact of the Food         Stories research on commercial strategy has been endorsed by a       leading UK retailer.
Marks &amp; Spencer's former Director of Technology       confirms how `The research programme ... brought home the challenges         that were faced ... in the factory, in transport and in store display         along with the "positive hygiene" required to clean up factory processes         and reduce microbiological contamination [enabling] fresh prepared         chicken to be sold chilled rather than frozen'.
He concludes that       the project enabled M&amp;S to `relearn the lessons from the past and         reapply them for the future ... revisiting innovation strategies and         starting again with the challenge of what we want to achieve and how we         apply science and technology to achieve this' [S5].
This work is       being taken forward in Jackson's current ERC-funded Proof of Concept work,       providing customised advice to food manufacturers and retailers and to       food-related NGOs in the UK and Sweden.
Informing national food safety policy: Jackson also contributes to       the development of national food safety policy in his role as Chair of the       Food Standards Agency's Social Science Research Committee [S6].
Specific       contributions (reflecting his recent research on families and food)       include a co-authored report on the rise of Listeria monocytogenes       among the over 60s which led the FSA to commission new research on       domestic food safety practices (on which Jackson was an advisor).
Jackson       also serves on ESRC's expert group on Energy, Environment and Food       Security and was a member of the synthesis group for DEFRA's Green Food       Project.
