     In the period January 2008-July 2013, Moran's Queuing for Beginners       sold 5801 copies in       paperback and On Roads sold 6619 copies in hardback and 5518 in       paperback.
On Roads was       extracted in the Daily Express (6.6.09), featured as a book of the       year selection in the Financial         Times, Sunday Times and Sunday Herald, and was       favourably reviewed in 16 national       newspapers and magazines, being described as `a beautifully written, quiet       masterpiece' (Sunday         Times), `a beautiful little book' (Mail on Sunday), a `richly       enjoyable read' (The Times) and a       `superb cultural history' (Independent).
It was longlisted for the       2010 BBC Samuel Johnson Prize       for Non-Fiction.
On Roads was used by architects, planners and traffic experts to       address topics such as road       safety and the aesthetics and environmental impact of roadbuilding.
Theresa Villiers, Shadow       Secretary of State for Transport, referenced it in a speech at the New       Civil Engineer's Road       Summit (20.1.10); Hamilton-Baillie Associates, influential advocates of       `shared space', included       Moran's article, `Crossing the Road in Britain', on their website; and the       bestselling author Tom       Vanderbilt discussed Moran's work on his `How We Drive' blog and in an       article in The Times       (29.8.09).
Moran's research was cited in BBC News Magazine Online,       the Sunday Telegraph, the       Guardian, The Times, the Daily Mail and the Daily         Express.
Moran's media appearances to discuss On Roads included Radio 5       Live's Simon Mayo Show       (10.6.09), Radio 4's M1 Magic (28.10.09), BBC1's BBC Breakfast         Live (10.6.09), which had       1,211,000 viewers, and Radio 4's Today (8.6.09), which averaged       6.6 million listeners a week in       this period.
According to its presenter Laurie Taylor, Moran's appearance       on Radio 4's Thinking         Allowed on 22.7.09 prompted `unexpected hymns of praise for such       previously unconsidered and       unsung stretches of tarmac' from listeners, one writing that `my drive       along the M27 was made       much more interesting' (Thinking Allowed, 29.7.09).
Moran published over 100 newspaper and magazine articles on the history       and politics of daily life       in this period, writing regularly for the Guardian and       occasionally for the New Statesman, the       Financial Times, the Observer, The Times, History         Today and BBC News Magazine Online.
He       was also a regular columnist for both BBC History Magazine (June       2007-June 2008) and FT         Weekend magazine (August 2008-September 2010), writing about       everyday phenomena and       `defining moments' in recent history respectively.
Moran's new book, Armchair         Nation, was also       extracted in the Radio Times ahead of publication (1-7 June 2013,       14-17).
These publications all       had national reach and large readerships.
At the end of the impact case       study period, for example,       the Guardian had an estimated readership per issue of 935,000       (print) and monthly online traffic of       84,326,205 (unique browsers).
Moran's most read Guardian article       online had 25,090 page views.
On the Guardian site, his articles frequently generated several       hundred comments.
Moran also       received many emails and letters, including from people who remembered       driving on the early       motorways or worked as engineers on them, thanking him for reviving and       concretising their       memories.
Moran's work inspired visual artists such as Edward Chell, who in his       exhibition `Gran Tourismo'       (held at the Little Chef restaurant, Ings in April/May 2011) combined       images of roadside       environments with table mats incorporating quotes from On Roads;       the photographer Sam Mellish,       for whom Moran wrote the preface to his book Roadside Britain; and       the artist Simon Faithfull, for       whom Moran wrote the introduction to the book about his public artwork, Liverpool         to Liverpool,       which is engraved into the paving on the new concourse around Liverpool       Lime Street Station.
The       artist Felicity Ford interviewed Moran for her soundscape documentary Around         the A404,       broadcast on BBC Radio Oxford (26.12.10).
He also gave a public lecture on       `Travelling Concepts'       as part of the Liverpool Biennial (7.11.12).
Moran appeared at the Bath Festival of Literature (2.3.10); at the       Kenilworth Festival (15.5.10); in a       panel on `how to write non-fiction' with Geoff Dyer and Andrea Gillies at       London's Foyles Bookshop       (12.9.10); and at the Sheffield Off the Shelf Festival with Jonathan Coe,       at Coe's invitation       (23.10.10).
He was an invited speaker at Boring 2010 at London's Dominion       Theatre (11.12.10), a       widely publicised conference bringing together writers and thinkers on the       everyday.
He ran two       `Conversation Dinners' on Georges Perec for the School of Life in London       (15.2.11, 7.12.11),       aimed at making this writer better known to a British audience.
Moran also       maintained a blog from       January 2009 (joemoransblog.blogspot.co.uk/) which he used to communicate       informally with       readers and publicised through his Twitter feed (@joemoransblog, 2000+       followers).
It had over       230,000 hits up to July 2013 and generated many comments, such as `your       observations on the       quotidian ... make this a regular haunt ... One of the best word mills in       the web world.'
