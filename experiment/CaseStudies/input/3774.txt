     Our data zones are now the core geography for Scottish Neighbourhood       Statistics (SNS) and the       common spatial framework for mapping and analysis of almost all small-area       data in Scotland.
"We had no `standard' small area geography, and very few government         statistics were produced         for areas other than local authority areas.
Now, data zones are         certainly the standard which is         extremely widely used by a very wide range of users.
There has been an         enormous increase in         the statistics made available.
It is very easy to compare different         statistics, and to compare         different areas and changes over time.
The benefits of this have been         huge" [S1] The Head of       Household Estimates and Projections at National Records for Scotland.
Examples of their impact are outlined below:     (1) Policy deliberations     DZs are employed by Westminster and Scottish Governments, as well as       every local authority in       Scotland, for monitoring and planning economic, social and infrastructural       investments, and for       targeting resources.
In Fife Council, data zone design "has had a         significant impact on the         availability of small area data, which has given us better information         to use for better decision-making and better community involvement"       [S2], while the senior planning analyst noted that, "In         Glasgow City Council we make extensive use of data zones.
... My Housing         colleagues have         defined a set of neighbourhoods (amalgamations of data zones), which         allows us to consider         demographic change at a sub-City level" [S3].
The detailed,       localised information provided at DZ       level was pivotal to work carried out by an Economist for Highlands and       Islands Enterprise, and       stressed its use both "to inform decision making and resource         allocation and in wider research and         briefings."
[S4]     National         Records of Scotland (NRS) publishes official population estimates       for DZs, which are       used by government for planning purposes (Graham served on the Small Area       Population       Estimates working group).
DZs have also been used by Scottish Government       to report on Long-Distance Commuting and HMRC to monitor the distribution       of child benefit claimants [S6], the       House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee in their Report           on Poverty in Scotland, NHS-Scotland for analytical work in       health and health services, Scottish Funding Council to monitor HE       participation rates [S7], and by Transport Scotland to develop a new       national transport model [S8].
The policy impact of DZs is confirmed in Scottish Government publications:       All           Our Futures: Planning for a Scotland with an Ageing Population       and Caring           Together: The Carers Strategy for Scotland 2010 &#8212; 2015.
Additionally, DZs have been used in survey sampling, as in the DWP survey       of disabled people,       and in evaluating the success of urban regeneration measures.
The Scottish       NHS Information       Services Division (ISD) uses DZs to analyse and display data on health       indicators, mortality and       hospitalisation rates, healthy life expectancy estimates, and in applying       the NHS Scotland       Resource Allocation formula.
A Principal Information Analyst within       Information Services Division       (of the NHS in Scotland) recognised DZs as `fundamental' to their work.
[S5]     (2) Open government     DZs play a pivotal role in promoting Open-Scottish Government, from       providing the geography for       reporting summary statistical data to supporting the delivery of       interactive mapping.
Many local       authorities communicate with their electorate using DZ-based data (see       Argyll and Bute Council       Quick Facts and Figures, Moray Council's report to the Community       Engagement Group, and       Aberdeenshire Council's December 2012 Report on findings from the Scottish       Index of Multiple       Deprivation).
Communication is enhanced by visual analytics and       interactive mapping, and web-based organisations like `Geocommons' provide       access to mapped data which is dependent on the       DZs developed by the St Andrews team.
(3) Resource allocation     Data zones have been used in evaluating the success of urban regeneration       measures.
Regeneration areas are defined as the most deprived 15% of data zones in       Scotland, according to       the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD 2004, 2006, 2009).
For       financial years 2008/09 to       2010/11, &#163;145 million per year has been allocated to target regeneration       in these areas.
Along       with the update of SIMD, the movement of data zones in and out of the most       deprived 15% is       consistently monitored by central and local government in evaluating the       impact of the       regeneration programme [S10].
(4) Use by health and private sector organisations     DZs have further indirect impact through underpinning policy-relevant       research (326 hits on Google       Scholar) by organisations such as Public         Health Observatories and local authorities [S9].
Moreover, private consultancy firms use the DZ.
In the case of Cogentsi       they used DZ for their       economic modelling of the Cairngorms         National park.
So they were "able to make a much better       approximation of the actual Park boundaries, using an area defined by       statistical datazones, which       much more closely approximates the actual designated boundaries" .
In summary DZs have widely adopted by many different organisations       throughout Scotland       (including policy agencies, local authorities and the general public).
This has allowed many new       and important analyses which would not otherwise have been feasible and       decisions made and       enacted on those analyses.
