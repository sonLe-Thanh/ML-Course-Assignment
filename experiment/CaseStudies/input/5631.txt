     Through his cross-cultural analysis of the fundamentals of skills       transfer in craftsmanship, Marchand has come to engage directly with the       crafts community, greatly informing its understanding, and that of the       wider public, of the nature of apprenticeship and the importance of       learning and preserving manual skills.
Marchand's efforts to promote       skills transfer are rendered more significant by the UK government's       recent decision to remove `crafts' from its list of creative industries,       thereby devaluing their contribution not only to the UK economy, but to       its social and cultural life.
Multiple closures of notable craft courses       at higher education institutions have occurred in the UK in the past       twenty years, while the number of children studying art and other creative       subjects at GCSE has decreased sharply since 2010.
In this context, voices       such as Marchand's are of increasing importance.
Based on his research into mud masons in Mali, Marchand curated an       important exhibition in May 2010 entitled Djenn&#233;: African City of Mud,       held at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in London.
The       exhibition was created in collaboration with RIBA and was sponsored by       SOAS, the ESRC, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), and the Dutch       embassy.
It explored the relationship between design and construction       practices, architectural heritage and cultural identity and, as part of       the wider `The Art of Mud Building: Heritage and Sustainability' project,       was accompanied by a series of public lectures and events at RIBA, SOAS       and the Ismaili Centre (1, below).
Approximately 4,000 people attended the       exhibition, while around 300 attended Marchand's public lecture (2).
The       exhibition was favourably received in The Architectural Review,       which noted its emphasis on the craftsmanship involved in its maintenance:       `The real discovery of the exhibition lies not with the architecture, but       in the story of the community which maintains the site.'
(3)     Marchand has been particularly proactive in his engagement with the FE       sector, demonstrating the importance of skills transfer to young people       undertaking craft-related courses.
In 2013, Marchand returned to the       Building Crafts College, London (where he conducted fieldwork as part of       his ESRC fellowship), to deliver a lecture on his research into the       development of hand skills and how they relate to the brain.
He has contributed to the Making Futures project, hosted by Plymouth       College of Art (an FE institution), which aims at improving understanding       of how the contemporary crafts are practiced in relation to global       environmental and sustainability issues (4, 5).
At its biennial conference       in 2011 attended by practitioners, curators, historians, theorists,       campaigners, activists, and representatives of public and private       agencies, he presented a lecture discussing what he had learnt from       working with minaret builders in Yemen, mud masons in Mali and furniture       maker trainees in East London.
The organiser of Making Futures, Malcolm Ferris, has characterised the       contributions to the crafts community of Marchand's research and       participation in the project as follows (6):     "Trevor is developing an important set of perspectives on, and         understandings of, craft that are helping the community to critically         appraise and situate the value of practice within a broader set of         epistemological and cultural-developmental concerns.
He has made an         important contribution to emergent debates around `craft' that are         concerned with shifting the critical focus away from the object and onto         the lived experiences of the practitioner and the contexts of practice.
This has enabled the community to meet on shared ground with other         disciplines and given them a means (other than practice) by which to         communicate the value of craft to constituencies beyond the practitioner         community.
These developments are pivotal in terms of the current         re-evaluation and understanding of craft thinking and making going on in         society.
In this respect his work not only addresses practitioners, but         also audiences and agencies beyond the immediate crafts community,         including those that view creative making as a vital component in the         effort to connect communities."
His impact on one prominent attendee of Making Futures, Rosy Greenlees,       Executive Director of the UK Crafts Council, was described as follows (7):     "I have never heard an academic talk so persuasively about the value         of making things.
His talk validated how the craft community works, and         the arguments we put to the government regarding the value of         apprenticeships and the transfer of skills".
Further, Greenlees confirms that Marchand's work has helped her to       provide a robust evidence base supporting representations to government,       without which she believes ministers would not take her and her       organisation's arguments seriously.
In 2013, Marchand convened a two-day workshop in collaboration with the       Plymouth College of Art on `craftwork as problem solving', related to his       research on the brain, hands, and tool use.
This brought together       designer-makers, architects, and researchers of crafts to present short       papers and engage in an exchange of ideas and perspectives.
In 2012, Marchand was one of three keynote speakers at the Museum of       Skills Conference hosted by the British Council London, and the result of       a collaboration between Norske Kunsth&#229;ndverkere The Norwegian Association       for Arts and Crafts), Artquest and ArtProjects and Solutions (8).
( Funded       by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Royal Norwegian Embassy and       the Norwegian Association for Arts and Crafts, the conference brought       together thinkers and practitioners to discuss what skills the arts sector       will need in the future and how they can be used.
Marchand's talk was well received and has since been posted on the       internet by numerous organisations and individuals, thereby increasing its       impact.
Specifically, it was posted on the blog of Robin Wood, a tableware       craftsman who has produced work for the Tower of London and the film       director Ridley Scott (9).
In his comments on the lecture, Wood stated:     "Lots of folk understand handwork and there are a few academics who         study it and write about it but I think Trevor is perhaps unique in his         depth of understanding of both worlds.
This is great as it stretches my         thoughts about what I do in the workshop and it also gives those of us         who work with our hands more credibility.
The level of intelligence that         is required to be really good is not often understood from the outside."
In January 2011, Curator for Africa at the Smithsonian Institution's       National Museum for Natural History in Washington D.C. invited Marchand to       co-curate an exhibition grounded in his ongoing research in Djenn&#233;.
Marchand produced and directed four new short documentary films to be       exhibited alongside his photographs, which together document the       livelihoods, expertise, and the masons' struggles to sustain their       traditional craft in a rapidly-changing world.
The year-long exhibition, Mud         Masons of Mali, opened in the Smithsonian African Voices focus       gallery on 30 August 2013 and will run for one year (10).
Output c serves       as the exhibition catalogue.
