     References to corroborating evidence in section 5 are indicated in       [square parentheses].
The wide-ranging impact of CCY's research within a       broad, international shift towards the involvement of children and young       people in decision-making is evidenced by: Citation of CCY research         and evidence-based guidance in operational documents of international,         national and regional agencies which work with children and young         people.
For example, project 1 continues to be widely employed in       diverse international contexts:            the Welsh Assembly Government's (2008) guidance on Children and           Young People's Participation in Wales cites Matthews' research as         central evidence for positive outcomes of participation for young         people's emotional well-being.
DfID's (2009) terms of reference on Youth Exclusion, Violence and           Fragile States uses exemplars from Matthews' work to recommend         youth participation as a strategy in international post-conflict         contexts.
a 2009 report by the US Agency for International Development employs         Matthews' concepts, data and guidance to recommend youth participation         as a strategy for development and aid-delivery in developing world         contexts [see section 5 &#8212; source 1a].
UNICEF's (2009) Inter-Agency Working Group on Children's Participation         recommends Matthew's work as a key resource for stakeholders         implementing a programme to promote children's civil rights in East Asia         and the Pacific.
The project led directly to the formation of four Local Authority youth       forums, which have engaged 100 young people per year in local democratic       processes since 1999, and evidence, guidance and training materials from       project 1 are routinely-cited as good practice in foundational and       operational documents of Local Authority youth councils in every region of       the UK [source 1b].
Recognition of CCY's role in transforming the ethos of voluntary/third         sector organisations which work with children and young people.
For       example, the Duke of Edinburgh's Award recognise that CCY's research       steered medium term strategic changes to the organisation's ethos and       operational practices [source 4].
Based on our evidence-based       recommendations, DofE constituted an international `impact action group',       charged with disseminating and implementing recommendations made in our       good practice guides, to delivery partners in 132 countries.
A national       working group to foster young people's participation in decision-making       around the Award was subsequently constituted in each country.
A range of       changes to governance and consultative practice within the Award were also       informed by the research.
Briefing notes for providers of youth       volunteering activities and policy-makers were disseminated widely by the       Pears Foundation, and directly led other major youth organisations (e.g.
Girlguiding, Art Award) to commission national participatory research       projects.
Recognition of CCY research as critical in changing the approach of UK         national, regional and local policy-makers to children and young people.
The following case studies evidence the multi-scalar impacts of CCY       research upon policy-making &#8212; and particularly the transformation of         spaces designed/built for children and young people &#8212; in educational       and urban planning contexts, via projects 2, 3 and 5.
Pupil participation in school (re)design.
Within individual         schools and architectural practices, there is evidence that         participation in project 5 was important in facilitating more effective         and participatory decision-making, and more broadly shaping an ethos of         inclusion/participation, in school refurbishment projects [source           3a].
During the project, Horton was interviewed by the think tank         Demos, and key messages about youth participation in         design/architecture, drawing directly upon project findings, were         incorporated into their major Seen and Heard: Reclaiming the Public           Realm report (2008).
The good practice guides produced in project         5 were disseminated to every Local Authority in England and Wales, and         published online.
To give one example of how these were used by         organisations beyond those involved in the original research, contact         from senior officers in Leicester City Council evidences that the guides         were used by the Council's Youth Engagement team to conduct a city-wide         consultation of 450 school pupils in 2009, which informed the         refurbishment of 16 secondary schools, producing a range of positive         documented outcomes for pupils, staff and stakeholders [source 3b].
The guides have subsequently been recommended as good practice by         Architecture and Design Scotland, Pupil Voice Wales and the US National         Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities.
Enhancing outdoor playspaces.
Data from project 2 were         disseminated to Redbridge Borough Council via workshops/presentations.
These activities directly underpinned the Borough's Play Strategy           2007-12 which instigated a Borough-wide programme of improvements         to outdoor playspaces.
Between 2008-11, the strategy ringfenced &#163;150,000         for playspace improvements, and &#163;850,000 for adjacent traffic calming         measures [source 2a].
Enhancements were thus made at 12         playgrounds, 3 parks, 2 country parks and 5 school grounds, and new         minimum standards regarding play provision were introduced in the         Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance and area regeneration         strategies.
During 2007-09, Horton was invited to act as expert advisor         when senior officers of the Local Authority developed plans/actions         relating to children services.
Project 2 was thus explicitly cited as         core evidence in the shaping and benchmarking of 14 Borough-wide         policies between 2008-12, including the Borough's new Children and           Young People's Plans (2007-11 and 2011-14), Children's           Services Capital Programme (2008-09), Safer Redbridge Plan         (2009) and Safeguarding Action Plan (2010).
CCY's         recommendations were also cited in children and young people's plans in         4 London Boroughs (e.g.
Dagenham) and 3 Local Authorities (e.g.
Hertfordshire) not involved in the original research.
In the current REF         period, the research also impacted upon national play policy in England         and Wales: (i) findings about play needs of young Muslim females were         key evidence in DCSF's (2008) feasibility study for the Play           Pathfinders Scheme, which subsequently invested &#163;60million in         playspace refurbishment in 30 deprived communities [source 2b];         (ii) CCY's evidence/recommendations were included in Play for a           Change (2008) &#8212; a major NCB/Play England review and good practice         guide about the state of UK playspaces.
Planning newbuild housing developments.
Throughout project 5,         the project team worked closely with Local Authorities, planning         agencies, housing associations and service-providers to ensure that         project outputs were impact-full and user-friendly.
Four workshops         engaged regional planners and policy-makers in activities with children         and young people.
Feedback indicates that these events prompted a         greater degree of collaborative, multigenerational practice, by `acting         as a bridge' between local communities, young people, policy-makers, and         planning agencies: as evidenced in the development of `strong,         persuasive' consultative bids for funding for play equipment, with `hard         evidence' drawn directly from project 5 [source 5a].
The project         also provided briefing papers and expert guidance, and facilitated         consultations with young people, for Senior Planners within North         Northamptonshire Development Company (NNDC), contributing directly to         the North Northamptonshire Infrastructure Plan for the next three         decades, producing cost savings and skills development for NNDC, and         ensuring provision of community participation opportunities within the         development of the region over this timescale.
Feedback from Senior         Planners &#8212; and revisions to the Infrastructure Plan &#8212; testify that the         project has thus `added value to and impacted significantly on'         infrastructure planning in this region (which has 300,000+ residents),         principally by fostering a culture of multigenerational community         consultation [source 5b].
Five good practice guides for         planners, policy-makers and architects have been produced and         disseminated to Senior Planners via the Housing Supply and Markets         Division of DCLG.
Evidence from the project has also been submitted to:         Sustainable Development Commission review of outcomes for young people;         Big Lottery Fund call for evidence about priorities in provision for         young people; and the DCLG Farrell Review of architecture and the built         environment.
Impact and dissemination activities are continuing and         Hadfield-Hill and Horton's collaboration around the ESRC Future Research         Leader award on Young People and New Urbanisms in India (see section 2)         will continue to extend and internationalise these impacts into the next         REF period.
