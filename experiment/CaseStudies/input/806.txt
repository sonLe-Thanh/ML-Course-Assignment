     Public policy and services     CKAT is the only available system that can provide an objective       assessment of manual control within classroom settings &#8212; as indexed by the       granting of a patent [A].
CKAT is impactful because it screens       manual motor control in large populations of children (in classroom       settings), with far more detail than previous assessment tools have       allowed, thereby facilitating objective identification of children with       difficulties for timely treatment/support.
This innovation has, in terms       of public policy, resulted in a regulatory authority changing its       practices by adopting a new method (i.e.
services) for screening       educational difficulties within school settings [B].
Children in       Bradford are now screened for motor deficits and provided with an       intervention if problems are detected.
Specifically, since 2012 the City       of Bradford Metropolitan District Council's Education Department is       offering primary schools within its area the opportunity to participate in       the `Starting School' screening programme.
This programme includes       assessing every participating child during their first year of school on       CKAT.
Results of individual children's CKAT assessments are provided to       participating schools and teachers then use this information to guide       additional investigation and support children identified as being at risk       of motor deficit.
The local educational authority view this initiative as       being of great benefit as CKAT is:     "...giving our teachers the ability to augment their professional         judgements with detailed objective assessments that allow them to make         properly informed judgements about how best to support their students.
Results are also aggregated and given to schools that work together in a         Local Area Partnerships (LAPs), helping us in our strategic planning as         well."

Practitioners and children's health &amp; welfare     In 2012/13, 43 schools participated in the first year of the programme       (~2,500 children), with 88 schools (~4,000 children) committed for this       current year (i.e.
2012-13).
This represents approximately 70% of the 125       schools in the city of Bradford.
This widespread screening of children for       motor deficits has in turn affected practitioners, influencing practices       and the level of support provided in school for children with motor       difficulties.
Evidence of impact comes from:            Teachers receiving new training:          "In response to the CKAT assessments we have run Continuing         Professional Development (CPD) sessions for teachers to provide them         with information and ideas on what to do to help children with motor         learning difficulties in their classrooms...This has led to teachers         adopting certain lesson plans to include motor learning as an embedded         element within them...the assessments have raised awareness of the         importance of motor learning as a foundation for other aspects of         learning."

Children identified as needing evaluation for a statement of special         educational needs:          " ... these assessments have confirmed teacher's professional         judgements and led to further more detailed assessments being conducted,         as we attempt to ascertain the specific challenges each child faces."
Advisor, Bradford Schools Linking Network [C].
Schools providing additional in-school support to children identified         as having difficulties:          " ... assessments have also prompted us to seek innovative ways of         intervening to support motor-learning.
For example, we are using school         resources to develop an after-school club designed to support children         with movement problems."
Advisor, Bradford Schools Linking Network [C]     " ... provided clarity to teachers about the children who need         particularly focussed support.
The value of having objective measures         like this to support teacher's professional judgement is considerable...
In certain cases, we have been able to put in place additional support         for those that need it most.
In such instances the assessments have         guided us in how we tailor our support to the individual student's         needs."

In summary, Bradford Educational Services are using CKAT to identify       children with problems in order to provide additional support - i.e.
the       Regulatory Authority has been convinced to change practice [B].
CKAT also has direct impact on health and welfare benefits for children,       enabling them to gain more timely and effective access to the support they       need.
It increases the efficiency with which the referral system operates       in identifying children requiring additional support and treatment for       movement problems, ensuring their difficulties are mitigated as early as       possible:s     "CKAT assessments have focussed our attention on an important issue         which can be overlooked in mainstream education (i.e.
the development of         fine motor skills) and given us the detailed objective tools we need to         monitor motor skill development in our students and then act to have an         impact for the students that need it most."
Advisor, Bradford       Schools Linking Network [C].
"These snapshots of children's initial ability levels provide us in         the Education sector with crucial early indicators of which children may         require additional support and in what specific areas...and help         identify at an early age which children might usefully benefit from         referral for additional support."

For these reasons, CKAT is being used in the US (Indiana) to identify       children with motor problems so they can receive robotic therapy for       handwriting problems.
Research has shown that children with motor problems       can improve their performance with robot therapy and CKAT allows       identification of those children who benefit from this intervention [D].
Moreover, CKAT is being used as the clinical trial outcome measure within       a National Institutes of Health (NIH) $800,000 funded project [E]       investigating the efficacy of the robotic treatment and has been       implemented by clinicians at the University of California, Los Angeles       (UCLA), USA to measure post-surgical motor outcomes for people following       neural surgery.
For example, the UCLA team has recently evaluated manual       dexterity before and after cervical spinal injection for pain in over 30       of their patients [F].
Impact on commerce     CKAT has been commercialised via a licensing agreement [G], which       the UoL and the University of Aberdeen signed with Mulraney Group in 2012.
Royalties are split based on Aberdeen's revenue-share model (Leeds is       entitled to a 39% share of overall royalties).
This license demonstrates       commercial impact, as evidenced by job creation and revenue generation by       Mulraney Group in 2013:     "The Mulraney group have identified CKAT as a significant commercial         opportunity.
The development of this system has generated jobs within         our company and enhanced our financial prospects.
We anticipate further         job creation (FTE = 20) and an increased turnover of &#163;3,000,000.
Moreover, the Mulraney Group believe that we are now in a position to         further capitalise on the investment..." Chief Executive, Mulraney       Group [H].
