     BU's practice development approach is now widely used in England (R1)       with further evidence of       use in Australia (R2).
This helps health and social care practitioners to       use the best available       evidence to develop their practice and ensure their care is effective and       person focused.Through       the practice development process and accreditation teams work towards       developing a culture of       excellence by becoming person-centred and introducing evidence-based       practice through       effective culture change and teamwork.
Teams are encouraged to question       and challenge current       practice and, by using evidence, improve services.
Each PDU must       demonstrate:     - An understanding of the service user needs and clear mechanisms for       communicating and       listening to users and carers.
- How developments are researched, evidence-based, evaluated and       disseminated to       demonstrate best practice and to contribute to the local, national and       international       evidence base.
- A clear action plan that outlines the aims for development of services       and team members       that has links to national and local host organisation's priorities.
- A leadership structure that supports the delivery and development of       multi-agency inter-       professional care in line with the action plan.
- A defined communication structure to ensure the collaboration of team       members and the       provision of effective inter-professional care.
- A clear understanding of the user journey and understanding of the team       member's       contribution to the success of the user experience.
- How services have been developed taking a `whole systems' approach,       ensuring the entire       user journey is improved.
- Clear partnerships with an academic department and other agencies       required to support       research and the dissemination of best practice.
This explicit set of standards is then assessed by a panel of external       experts from practice and       academia who examine a portfolio of evidence and visit the unit to observe       and speak to service       users, carers and staff.
Units are reaccredited on a three-yearly basis to       ensure high standards are       maintained.
Since 2008, BU researchers have facilitated the set-up and accreditation       of 47 PDUs and       reaccreditation of 35 (Fig.
1), working with 82 units in total.
This       covers 6 counties in the UK (Fig.
2), including 8 NHS Trusts serving a resident population of over 3.5       million (R3).
Units accredited       and reaccredited include social services departments, dementia services       and children's units (R4).
The overarching impact of BU's practice development process is a change       in culture, leadership       and team creation.
There is an extensive list of NHS and social care unit       contacts that can       corroborate this, demonstrating an effective move to evidence-based       practice, improved       communication between staff and service users and consistently improved       inter-agency working.
These include the following testimonials:     "Developments through practice development include pioneering work in       helping young people       with chronic conditions make the difficult transition from children's to       adult services; making       improvements to cleanliness; working with the public and patients to       revise visiting times and       protect patient privacy and dignity; introducing matron ward rounds and       reducing waiting times for       echo-cardiograms."

"Implementation of a new pain pathway through practice development after       total knee replacement       led to reduced pain and 0.5 day reduction in length of stay."

Organisations reap the benefits of multi-disciplinary teams and a       multi-agency approach, as well as       new leadership roles.
Some further specific and measurable impacts       include:     - The North Essex NHS Foundation Trust `Patient Pathway', introduced       through BU's       practice development process in February 2010.
This was achieved by       establishing working       groups who introduced training, amended recruitment criteria and       implemented essence of       care benchmarking for communication skills and continence management.
One       year later,       there was an overall change in occupancy days since the pathway was       introduced.
In one       ward the bed days reduced by 599 days overall, a 50 % reduction in length       of stay of       patients.
This in turn reduces waiting lists and increases cost effective       for the NHS.
- The PDU at Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust led to streamlined       allergy testing in       2011, through the simplification of referral and appointment cancellation       mechanisms.
This       resulted in appointment waiting times reduced from 13 weeks to 2 weeks.
Other reported benefits of practice development include a reduction in       pain through pain       management pathways, improvements to cleanliness, more patient-friendly       visiting times and       protection of patient privacy and dignity.
Benefits on practice include       better communication       between staff and carers, a reduction in `inappropriate admissions', more       effective team       organisation and increased funding from service commissioners.
These benefits make a significant difference to treatment of patients and       working lives of staff in       Trusts serving a collective resident population of over 3.5 million.
The       changes are also       contributing to a wider cultural change, which is necessary to improve       care.
The continuing impact       of this research is evident through the development of PDU master classes       in Australia, formed       from the basis of BU programmes (R2).
