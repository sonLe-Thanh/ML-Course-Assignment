     Cultural Diplomacy and Soft Power     Holden's latest publication, Influence and Attraction, prompted       comment from William Hague, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: `I         strongly welcome this report...It makes an important and timely         contribution to the debate about how Britain can make the most of its         cultural power and influence in the world...we in Government will study         this report closely' (foreword to report [7]).
The direct political       impact of the report is further evidenced by Lord Howell, the Chairman of       the House of Lords Committee on Soft Power, who said at the Committee's       meeting on 15th July 2013: `The excellent paper that comes         from the British Council...states, which I rather like, that "soft power         involves the things that make people love a country rather than fear it.
"[8]     Influence and Attraction had additional impact in promoting public       comment and debate about soft power.
The Financial Times [9]       devoted an article to a discussion of the report, saying that "Governments         are waking up to soft power".
Dorian Lynskey's article about the       report on The Guardian website garnered 226 comments [10].
The       report was also covered by the Huffington Post [11] and by       London's Evening Standard [12].
The most direct financial impact of Holden's work on Cultural Diplomacy       can be seen in the creation of the World Collections Programme (WCP) which       provided a grant of &#163;3M between 2008 and 2011 to enable the British       Library, British Museum, Natural History Museum, Royal Botanic Gardens       Kew, Tate and the V&amp;A to undertake work in the priority areas of the       Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Melissa Nisbett of King's College London       wrote [13]: "There was a general consensus [that the] research was a         catalyst for the WCP grant being awarded to the cultural organisations:         (1) It heightened the realisation among politicians of the importance of         culture in the formation of international relations... (Senior Policy         Adviser); (2) That was the trigger that unlocked the World Collections         money...(Senior Strategist)...".
In turn, Jonathan Williams, Deputy       Director of the British Museum, has confirmed the impact of the WCP not       only on the partner institutions, but in terms of public benefit: "The         partners in the World Collections Programme were established not just to         be great London institutions, but to put their collections to work for         worldwide public benefit.
The WCP brought these organisations together         as never before and enabled them to deliver their international         programmes in a concerted fashion, working together to enable these six         great world collections really to belong to the world."
[14] Holden       has given public speeches about cultural diplomacy internationally: in       Tokyo at the invitation of the Japan Foundation (2010) (covered on TV and       in the press), in Barcelona (2009) and in Berlin (2009).
Cultural Value     Holden's papers dealing with cultural value and published by Demos have       had a wide impact and have been well-received.
The Chair of the Arts       Council of Wales wrote `I warmed, as I would have expected, immediately         to your wise and determined pamphlet (Democratic Culture).
[5] I         have nothing but praise' and wrote separately that `Arts Council         Wales has relied heavily on the research intelligence conducted and         published in recent years by John Holden.'
[15]     Between 2008 and July 2013 Holden gave speeches and presentations on       cultural value and associated issues to 46 non-academic audiences, 21 in       the UK and 25 overseas.
Some were at international gatherings of       politicians and administrators, such as the Cyprus and Czech EU Presidency       cultural conferences (2012 and 2009 respectively) and the Singapore Global       Arts exchange (2010).
Through these talks Holden has had an impact on that       constituency, as witnessed by a comment in a letter from Japan's Kanagawa       Foundation (2012): `The following remarks are just a small selection of         the many glowing comments we received about your talk from attendees:         "As someone who works in government and management, the talk helped me         to understand the importance of explaining the role of culture"'.
Some of the speeches have been in professional fora such as keynotes for       the Arts Marketing Association (AMA) annual conference in 2008 and 2009.
The Executive Director of the AMA wrote: "Feedback from delegates for         his presentation was exceptionally high; ... Presenting a coherent and         thought-provoking session raising real practical issues."
Another       practitioner, the Chief Executive of the Historic Royal Palaces, wrote "John         has a pre-eminent reputation as a creative thinker, provocative writer         and great communicator about cultural policy."
[17]     Holden has also given public lectures, including at the Sydney Opera       House (2011), Adelaide (2009) and Edmonton (2008).
The conference: `Future         of the City: The Arts Symposium' (June 2011), organised by The       Cultural Policy Center and the Office of Civic Engagement at The       University of Chicago and the National Endowment for the Arts, attracted a       high-level mixed audience that included the editor of the Chicago         Tribune and the writer of The Wire.
The organisers later       emailed: "Thank you for your excellent introductory talk framing our         symposium conversations on June 7.
Everyone I have talked with since the         event has specifically mentioned how thoughtful and illuminating your         talk was.
Thanks so much for starting the day out in a way that framed         the issues so effectively for a very eclectic audience."
Public impact has also been achieved through media appearances in the UK,       where Holden has appeared on the Today Programme, Front Row       and You and Yours; and in Australia, Canada, Malta, the Czech       Republic, Hong Kong and Japan.
There are at least 8 videos of Holden's       speeches and presentations posted on YouTube and Vimeo, with 4,807 hits.
[19]     Politicians and practitioners have sought direct meetings to discuss       cultural value.
For example, the Overview and Scrutiny Committee at       Maidstone Borough Council, whose members were undertaking an "in-depth       review of the value of leisure and culture" wrote to Holden as they were       "... extremely keen to discuss with you your work on valuing culture."
The impact is also international.
As Calgary Arts wrote: `Holden...was         invaluable in assisting Calgary's leaders in gaining a clear         understanding of the valuable role that culture plays for a city and its         citizens.'
[21] 		Holden has had a major impact on cultural       leadership.
Together with the British cultural historian Robert Hewison,       he advised the philanthropist Dame Vivien Duffield on the creation of the       Clore Leadership Programme.
As a result she has invested &#163;1M in the       Programme each year since 2003 with 253 cultural leaders awarded       Fellowships to date.
The scheme has, according to Arts Professional, been       `widely praised'.
In the Daily Telegraph of 25th       September 2009, Rupert Christiansen wrote that: `A major agency of         improvement has been the Clore Leadership Programme...devised by John         Holden and Robert Hewison.'
[22]     Beneficiaries of the activities listed here include government ministers       and senior policy-makers shaping cultural policy at governmental level;       cultural policy administrators working at international, national and       metropolitan levels; cultural and creative industry practitioners;       journalists and broadcasters and academics in other institutions.
