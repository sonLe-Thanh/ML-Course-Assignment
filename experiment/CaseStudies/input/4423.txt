     Impact has been achieved through six, two-day mini-conferences organised       and coordinated by researchers at the University of Birmingham, and       located at one of the partner institutions (Birmingham May 2009, Florence       February 2010, Zurich June 2010, Lund November 2010, Oslo February 2011       and Abo May 2011).
Each of these consisted of (1) open meetings attended       by interested parties (including journalists, civil society and community       representatives), and (2) closed meetings (under Chatham House rules to       facilitate as much frank and open exchange of views as possible) between       networks of ethicists and human rights lawyers, representatives from NGOs,       technology developers and companies and their end users in counter       terrorism police and intelligence services.
Where feasible, there was       substantial overlap between participants at the open and closed meetings.
The aim of the open meetings was to promote public discussion of specific       themes of the project &#8212; for example profiling and data mining at the       meeting in Zurich, and law and ethics of border security in Abo.
They       included presentations from Privacy International, the Royal United       Services Institute, a Norwegian Public Prosecutor, a former head of GCHQ       (British Military Intelligence) and the serving head of SAPO (Swedish       Security Service).
The aim of the closed meetings was to provide       technology developers, counter-terrorism police and intelligence with       direct feedback from lawyers and ethicists on the viability and ethics of       their work (informed by current developments and research in the field).
At the closed meetings, participants included:            technology developers (representatives from private technology         producing companies)       end users from counter terrorism policing and intelligence       representatives from NGOs and European Human Rights organisations       academics from the research projects also funded by the same European         Commission Framework 7 programme       policy makers from European institutions (representatives from         FRONTEX, the European Union External Borders Agency and the Office of         the European Data Protection Supervisor).
University of Birmingham research fed directly into these meetings.
Specifically:            research carried out for `The Moral Risks of Preventive Policing'         (which eventuated in the paper for Criminal justice Ethics') contributed         to the advice given in the 5 meetings which took place after July 2009;       research resulting in `The Moral Risks of Detection Technology'         contributed to the four meetings which took place after May 2010;       research carried out for `Taking Moral Risks given Analysis of What's         Wrong with Terrorism' contributed to the two meetings which took place         after January 2011.
Reports of each of these meetings have been written up as deliverables       for the Commission by University of Birmingham researchers, and all       deliverables have been publicised via the DETECTER blog, uploaded to the       public website and since March 2011 they have also been sent to the       DETECTER mailing list consisting of more than 60 technology developers,       academics and policy makers.
Stakeholders were particularly receptive to University of Birmingham       recommendations about the ethical use of counter-terrorism and       border-control technologies (justified in outputs R1 and R3 and detailed       in the Lesson Learned document) due to the recent implementation of the       Lisbon Treaty which made the respect of human rights legally binding for       EU institutions.
By raising awareness about the ethical issues emerging in       these contexts and providing clear recommendations, University of       Birmingham research (see R2-R4 above) contributed to:             the creation of ethically informed and ethically sound professional           codes of conduct for the use of counter-terrorism and         border-control technology (e.g., in the case of FRONTEX see source 2         below);        knowledge of possible infringement of human rights that police         officers require when using such technology and reviewing and         authorising surveillance applications (source 2).
As a result of the closed meetings described above, organised and       coordinated by the University of Birmingham, the project promoted exchange       of ideas between different users, and significantly enhanced the         participants' understanding and appreciation of the ethics of       counter-terrorism technology and measures (sources 1-4).
The long-term       impact of the research, however, is likely to be much broader.
University       of Birmingham research not only has informed the use and review of existing       counter-terrorism technologies, but will also inform the design of new         technologies.
At the meetings, technology developers were able to       obtain direct feedback on their products from end users (the       counter-terrorism professionals) and from researchers, and the suggestions         made contributed to the implementation of privacy solutions in         developers' products.
For instance, one attendee attests: `this       forum did contribute to the evolution of our privacy solution during the       further development of our... product' (source 4).
It is also hoped       therefore, that future products will be more likely to respond to the       needs of users without compromising the rights of targets in       counter-terrorism units.
The final project conference organised by the University of Birmingham       was held in Brussels in September 2011.
The research findings were shared       more widely than in the user groups, to representatives from EU member       states, IBM and GCHQ and MEPs (70 participants).
At the conference a       series of policy recommendations were made by DETECTER regarding, for       instance, thresholds for authorising surveillance, reliance on automated       profiles and the use of watch-lists.
Participants were able to debate and       provide feedback on these recommendations &#8212; such feedback was taken into       account before the recommendations were published following the       conference.
Research by DETECTER is specifically mentioned in the current       FP7 Security Call as work that future proposals should take account of       (source 5).
