     This seminal research and its successful technological transfer via the       spin-out ApaTech&#8482; has delivered products that have achieved very       significant impact with major global reach from 2008 onwards.
The       successful use of the ApaPore&#8482;, Actifuse&#8482; (and most recently       Inductigraft&#8482;) series of products has delivered impact on health and       welfare for over 370,000 patients in over 30 countries.
By 2012, the       ApaTech&#8482; products had attained a 10% share of the global SBG market,       estimated to be around US$510 million, demonstrating major economic and       commercial impact.
New safe, reliable and high-performance SBGs        In response to the demand for safe reliable SBGs the ApaPore&#8482;, Actifuse&#8482;       and Inductigraft&#8482; produced by ApaTech&#8482; and based on QMUL research have       delivered significant health and economic impact by outperforming many of       the SBGs previously available for use in bone defect, joint revision,       trauma or spinal surgery.
Significantly Actifuse&#8482; has been clinically       demonstrated to be equivalent to the `gold standard' autograft in highly       challenging applications such as posterior lumbar fusion spinal surgery,       where its use resulted in 76.5% fusion rates at 24 months, while clinical       outcomes established significant pain improvement as compared with other       SBGs [Section 5, source 1].
Moreover, when used alone, fusion rates as       high as 90% at 12 months have been reported and equivalence in performance       has even been established between Actifuse&#8482; and rhBMP-2 based growth       factor treatments (e.g.
Infuse&#8482;) [Section 5, sources 2,3].
Furthermore,       the development of Inductigraft&#8482;, a synthetic bone graft with proven       ability to stimulate stem cells, has the potential to be even more       reliable and rapidly support bone regeneration with both improved safety       and cost effectiveness compared to treatment with autograft or growth       factors.
Enhancing patient well-being        In terms of patient outcomes, the use of Actifuse&#8482; and Inductigraft&#8482;, as       more effective and/or reliable SBGs, has a dual impact on patient       well-being.
First, the patient is not subjected to a second operative       procedure to remove autograft bone from the iliac crest, a procedure which       increases the chances of infection (there being two operative sites rather       than one) and results in post-operative pain at the graft donor site in up       to 38% of patients and reported to last for two years or longer in up to       18% of patients (4,600 annually in the UK).
Second, a patient treated with       Actifuse&#8482; which has equivalent performance to autograft, has a greater       chance of avoiding reoperation or revision surgery, due to increased       reliability.
Further, patients are typically released from hospital two to       three days earlier, impacting positively on both the patient's quality of       life and that of their family, friends and work colleagues.
Given that 38%       of the 80,000 bone grafting procedures performed in the UK in 2012 used       autograft, adoption of Actifuse&#8482; or Inductigraft&#8482; could positively affect       30,000 patients on an annual basis in the UK alone.
Improving health economics        From the perspective of heath economics use of Actifuse&#8482; or Inductigraft&#8482;       rather than autograft has an immediate impact through reduction in both       theatre time and hospital stay.
Using a typical fusion procedure in the UK       as an example, use of Actifuse&#8482; typically reduces surgery time by 40       minutes saving an estimated &#163;800 per operation (where a fusion procedure       costs between &#163;7,000-&#163;10,000).
Patients not subjected to donor surgery are       usually released from hospital two to three days earlier saving &#163;225 per       day.
Considering just these two factors results in a potential saving to       healthcare budgets of &#163;45 million per annum in the UK alone [Section 5,       source 4].
Furthermore, health economics also benefit from a procedure       with reduced infection risks and equivalent (to autograft) or increased       (to non-optimised SBGs) success rates.
About 5% of spinal cases require       revision surgery and surgeons are beginning to report lower revision rates       with use of Actifuse&#8482; (where revision surgery costs &#163;4,000-&#163;6,000 in the       UK).
When considering the benefits of Actifuse&#8482; or Inductigraft&#8482; vs       treatment with rhBMP-2 based growth factor treatments (e.g.
Infuse&#8482;),       aside from the concerns regarding the safety and efficacy, a benefit to       healthcare economics results from the significantly reduced average       product costs of Actifuse&#8482; (&#163;650) and Inductigraft&#8482; (&#163;970), which are       typically &#163;2,500 for growth factor treatments (e.g.
Infuse&#8482;).
Changing surgical practice: impressive take up of ApaTech products        The reach of the research in terms of numbers of patients treated and       rising surgeon awareness of the importance of SBG performance to surgical       outcomes and benefits to using optimised SBGs is demonstrated by the       impressive rate of ApaTech&#8482; market penetration.
In 2009 ApaTech&#8482; had a       five-year sales growth rate of 8.3% (Deloitte: Europe, Middle East and       Africa report) resulting in the sale of ApaTech&#8482; to Baxter International       in 2010.
At this point ApaTech&#8482; had 4% of the US SBG market, an annual       revenue of $20 million, a quarterly growth rate of 20%, employed 160       people in nine countries (including 84 people who continue to be employed       at the manufacturing facility in Elstree, UK) and had treated &gt;120,000       patients worldwide.
The ApaTech&#8482; range of products were regularly used by       680 surgeons in the USA with a net surgeon uptake of 15 surgeons per       month.
By 2012, the ApaTech&#8482; share of the SBG market had doubled to 9.6%       in the US (~20,000 procedures annually), increased to 12% in the UK (2,400       procedures annually) and 10% globally [Section 5, source 4] equating to       world-wide treatment rates of 125,000 patients annually.
To date in excess       of 370,000 patients in over 30 countries have been treated with ApaTech&#8482;       products.
Within London (including the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital and the       National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery) Actifuse&#8482; is used in       20-25% of spinal cases that use an SBG.
This reach should increase given       that the global bone grafting market is predicted to increase at an annual       rate of 4% [Section 5, source 4], and surgeon awareness of the economic       and healthcare benefits of using the ApaTech&#8482; range of products will       continue to grow following publication of key clinical papers [Section 5,       sources 1-3].
Recognition of research impact and stimulating public interest        This research and its successful technological transfer has also been       recognised through a number of prestigious awards to the founding       scientists Bonfield, Best and Hing for their outstanding contribution to       the field, including awards from the Royal Academy of Engineering; the       Royal Society of Armourers and Brasiers; the Institute of Materials,       Minerals and Mining; and the UK, European and Japanese Societies for       Biomaterials.
The importance of this research to society was also recently       demonstrated by a piece featuring Dr Hing on the development and use of       Actifuse&#8482; bone grafts during an episode of `Bang Goes the Theory'       (Broadcast, BBC1 7.30pm Mon, 4 Mar 2013 and BBC2, 7.00pm Tue, 5 Mar 2013)       with an audience of 4 million [Section 5, sources 5-6].
More recently, the       research was the focus of a short film produced as part of a series of       films showcasing QMUL research available to the public via the QMUL       YouTube channel as part of the College's on-going commitment to knowledge       dissemination and pubic engagement.
