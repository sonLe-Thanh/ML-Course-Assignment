     The research has had impact in three main ways:     First, the research has played a role in framing policy and setting         the operational agenda for security sector reform [1] [2] [8].
SSR       has come to be an important policy tool used by a variety of international       organisations and western nations in conflict, post-conflict and       authoritarian environments.
It has been particularly prominent in the       western Balkans, sub-Saharan Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, and more recently       the countries of the `Arab Spring'.
The UK Department for International       Development (DfID) and Ministry of Defence (MoD), NATO (including the       International Security Assistance Force, ISAF), EU and other national       governments all have formal SSR assistance programmes.
Increasingly, SSR       has gained prominence in US policy too, both in Iraq and Afghanistan, but       also more widely through a new programme of the US Institute for Peace       (USIP).
The impact of the research is apparent in the policy frameworks       used by international and local actors in implementing SSR initiatives in       practice, which apply explicitly or implicitly the first and second         generation SSR framework developed in the research [1] [2] [8].
The       UN Development Programme's 2002 Human Development Report, which       first brought SSR issues onto the UN agenda (where they remain) drew on       and cited Edmunds' work (pp.
91-92).
Currently, the most influential       framing documents in this area are the 2007 and 2008 OECD (Organisation       for Economic Cooperation and Development) DAC (Development Assistance         Co-operation Directorate) Handbooks on SSR.
These also draw on and       cite and Edmunds' work on first and second generation SSR [1] [2]       [8], including civilian capacity building in SSR in distinguishing between       executive control, parliamentary oversight and civil society oversight and       on the balance (and tensions) between effectiveness, oversight and       efficiency in the security sector [h].
Since then, the research has       informed many major contemporary SSR initiatives, shaping legislative,       institutional and organisation reforms in many post-conflict and       post-authoritarian societies.
It has benefited international SSR       practitioners, and contributed to increasing inclusion of SSR capacity       building across the globe [h] [j].
The themes developed in the research are apparent in the SSR doctrine of       a range of different organisations and actors, including the UN, OECD, EU,       NATO's Partnership for Peace and ISAF, the Geneva Centre for the       Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) and national governments such as       that of the UK [see, for example, j].
These initiatives all employ       concepts and formulations developed in Edmunds' work, including first         and second generation SSR issues and the normative nature of the         reform process [1] [2] [4] [7] [8] [9].
Indeed, most international       SSR initiatives now explicitly recognise the importance of securing `local       ownership' if they are to be successful, and the need to tailor reform       programmes to local context [h, esp.
Section 5; j, pp.
3, 11, 13, 19].
Edmunds has advised the USIP (on lessons from postcommunist Europe for SSR       in the MENA region, with an impact on USIP SSR training programmes in       those countries), the Folke Bernadotte Academy of the Swedish Foreign       Ministry (as a member of the SSR working group feeding into the       Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee for Swedish government SSR       initiatives, including training and capacity-building programmes in       Afghanistan, DRC, Liberia and elsewhere), and the Geneva Centre for the       Democratic Control of Armed Forces (on first and second Generation SSR,       providing training programmes and advice for policy makers and       practitioners worldwide).
Edmunds was invited to be one of two academic       instructors for an SSR training course for Afghan parliamentarians,       civil-servants, police and armed forces, run by NATO in February 2013.
He       is author of the `security sector reform' chapter in the Routledge Handbook         of Civil- Military Relations (2012), a `primer' aimed at introducing       policy makers and practitioners to the key principles of SSR.
The research       has also formed the main conceptual basis for a major project on internal       roles for European Armed Forces for DCAF, which has run from 2010 to date       [c].
The impact of the work can be seen in the regulatory frameworks for       civil-security sector relations developed in countries undergoing SSR, in       legislation governing parliamentary oversight of the military, police and       intelligence agencies, and in SSR training programmes which emphasise the       engagement of civilian as well as security sector personnel.
Second, the research has had a direct influence on the substance of         security and defence reforms in parts of the post-communist and western         Balkan regions.
The framework developed in Edmunds 2004, 2007 and       2008 [1] [2] [4] continues to inform the substance of defence reviews in       many of these countries and in Serbia particularly [f].
This is especially       the case in terms of the way in which these documents have drawn (either       implicitly or explicitly) on the first and second generation framework       in distinguishing between civilian and democratic control of armed forces,       and structured their discussions and arrangements for civil-military       relations on this basis.
The research has benefited Ministries of Defence,       armed forces and security sector reform practitioners in postcommunist       Europe and the Western Balkans.
It has contributed to strengthened       democratic control of the armed forces in these countries, including the       engagement of civil society actors in arrangements for oversight and       civil-military relations.
It has also helped shape the frameworks used to       define expected outcomes and evaluate such reforms as they have taken       place [a].
The impact of the research has been explicitly recognised by       defence policy makers in the region [a] and has led to Edmunds'       appointment to the Advisory Board of the Belgrade Centre for Security       Policy, a local expert group with a direct role in drafting and reviewing       Serbian defence and security legislation.
Finally, the research has had a significant impact on the evolution of         British defence policy and armed forces since 2006.
On publication,       Edmunds and Forster 2007 [3], which applied lessons from Edmunds' research       on SSR to the UK defence reform process, received widespread attention and       analysis in all major UK newspapers and media outlets and led to questions       in both Houses of Parliament.
It is widely viewed as providing the first       systematic analysis of the structural tensions within British defence and       civil-military relations and has been called `the single most important       think tank publication on defence' [i].
The arguments of the paper &#8212;       particularly with regard to the discrepancy between ambitious policy goals       and procurement objectives and the practical constraints of operations and       defence planning, as well as the changing relationship of soldier to the       armed forces and military covenant; all of which are manifestations of the       `local ownership' critique developed in [1] [2] [4] [7] [8] [9] &#8212;       set the agenda for a subsequent proliferation of academic and policy work       in this area [g].
Edmunds 2010 [5] &#8212; drafts of which were circulated in       policy-making circles in Whitehall &#8212; developed these themes and coalesced       the argument in terms which were closely reflected in the government's       defence green paper of 2010 [e, pp.
12-16] and subsequently in the       Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) of the same year.
This was       the first document of its type for many years to take seriously the gap       between defence policy commitments and available resources, reflecting one       of the key finding of Edmunds' research.
The research at [3] called for a       wholesale review of the UK defence establishment and MoD, a call that was       finally recognised in the Levene Report on Defence Reform of 2011.
The formalisation of an armed forces covenant was adopted in the       Conservative Party's 2010 General Election manifesto and passed into       legislation in 2011, with direct impact on the level of support offered to       armed forces personnel and their families [d].
Edmunds 2012 [6] has been included on the UK Chief of the Defence Staff's       `Recommended Reading List' [b], indicating the purchase of the research       amongst strategic planners at the highest level of the MoD and armed       forces.
The research [3] [5] [6] has been included on the curriculum for       the Advanced Command and Staff Course MA programme at the UK Joint       Services Command and Staff College (JSCSC), the most important UK       educational programme for military officers preparing for senior command.
Edmunds is a member of working groups that are shaping aspects of UK and       NATO defence transformation [10].
These include the UK MoD's Defence       Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) working group on strategic       futures, which is developing new strategic planning methodologies to be       used in the forthcoming UK National Security Strategy and SDSR of 2015;       and a NATO working group on developing common professional military       education standards across the Alliance (having been nominated to join the       group by the Director of the UK Defence Academy and the Commandant of the       Joint Services Command and Staff College).
In September 2013, he was       elected to the national executive of the Council of Military Education       Committees of the UK (COMEC) the primary contact point between UK       universities and the MoD.
