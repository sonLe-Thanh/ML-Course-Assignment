             Developed new networks and initiatives among stakeholders: JK's         (2010) review paper (publication 3.1 above) initiated dialogue between         medical and legal experts and the subsequent Wellcome Trust funded         symposium she organised brought 18 key stakeholders together for         intensive (over two days) and Chatham House rule discussion.
(For public         record of symposium see           http://bit.ly/1gUFEmJ).
Subsequent initiatives prompted by this         included two participants who met via the symposium working together to         pilot the use of `patient advocates' in intensive care (Lee, Mental         Capacity Advocate Expert and Chatfield, Clinical Research Sister,         Critical Care) and two others becoming involved in an ESRC seminar         series to look at the role of advance decisions (Clements, Solicitor/Law         professor and Bell, consultant in intensive care).
Another participant,         Ethics Manager at the British Medical Association (BMA), blogged about         the symposium and went on to organise an event for doctors to debate the         issues raised (after the `M' court case in Autumn 2011 - the first ever         court case considering the potential withdrawal of artificial nutrition         and hydration from a `minimally conscious' patient).
Informed debate and guideline development: The research was         recognised early on as having great potential to inform debate and         guideline development.
For example, a barrister emailed in response to         the circulation of a draft paper: `This article is really           extraordinary.
I am absolutely certain that it must be put before any           judge who looks at an MCS [minimally conscious] case in the future.
When it is published, please would you send me the citation so that I           can send it to the Official Solicitor and other barristers and           solicitors who work in this area' (Butler-Cole, leading barrister         - see `Sources to corroborate' 5.8).
A clinician and member of The         European Task Force on Disorders of Consciousness wrote: `we start           where others stop (neurologist).
And we have to face with families the           consequences of early decisions.
So I use your work.
It's part of           every presentation in and outside the Netherlands.
And part of ethical           debates we have in nursing homes who care for patients' (see 5.9).
The research was used in drawing up new nursing home guidelines         developed by the British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine (BSRM) and         JK was invited onto the core editorial group of the Royal College of           Physicians' Working Party on the vegetative state (rewriting         guidelines which are the touchstone for good practice and for the         courts).
She was also asked to join the Nuffield Council on           Bioethics investigation into `novel interventions into the brain'         - leading to the development of guidelines for journalists/press         officers/scientists.
Documentary evidence of impact includes citations         of Project 2 in the Nuffield Report; Project 3 in the BSRM guidelines         and Project 4 in the RCP guidelines - see Section 5,         corroborating documents 3, 5 and 1.
Contributed to new support/training resources: The research         informed the drafting of a `best interest' decision pro-forma for         clinicians developed with a neuro-rehab specialist and JK was asked to         advise on a piece of educational theatre about family experiences         performed at the 2012 `Medical Ethics and Law' conference (which         was filmed and made available as an on-line teaching/debating tool by         the BMA).
She also advised on a leaflet produced by Headway (the brain         injury support charity) on `Supporting People to Make Decisions'         (document 5.4) and wrote a booklet about the experience of families in         decision-making for vegetative patients which was adopted as an official         supplement to the new Royal College of Physicians' guidelines (document         5.2).
She is now working on an ESRC-funded initiative (with         the DIPEx charity and University of York and Oxford) to build a         multi-media internet resource for families and professional training         (launch in 2014) (http://bit.ly/1a9F0rK).
Prompted reflection and change among health practitioners: The         research was presented, by invitation, to a wide range of practitioners         e.g.
a `Masterclass' at the Institute of Medical Ethics [IME]         Annual Conference and talks to the Brighton and Sussex Medical School         and the Yale School of Medicine (as part of professional development         accredited courses).
Presentations between 2010 (when the first research         began) and July 2013 (the REF impact cut-off) directly reached over 500         practitioners (e.g.
GPs and intensive care, neurosurgery, rehabilitation         and palliative care specialists).
Feedback surveys by event organisers         demonstrated impact on clinicians both professionally and personally.
Comments included: `Very thought provoking - interesting,           emotionally and intellectually challenging and I need/want to go away           and reflect deeply on my view of the MCA [Mental Capacity Act] and its           application because I believe my opinion may have altered slightly'         and `Really brought the Mental Capacity Act and communication           between medics and families into the real world.
Definitely going to           go home and make an advance decision' (BMA evaluation report about         JK's session at the IME conference).
Practitioners were also influenced         by an exhibition developed as part of the research that involved family         members writing short messages and selecting images (chosen or         drawn/photographed) to represent their experiences.
The resulting         `Postcard' exhibition has been displayed at over two dozen venues and         events (e.g.
requested twice for display at the BMA's London         headquarters).
Feedback from event organisers, and comments in the guest         book (e.g.
`haunting', `learned a lot', `unforgettable') suggest that         the exhibition ensured that the voice of families directly affected now         has a presence at key meetings where professionals debate relevant         issues.
Enriched public representation/debate: In addition to working         with stakeholders as outlined above, JK has been consulted by         journalists/documentary makers and engaged in debate with them.
For         example, she co-authored a critical analysis of a Panorama programme         about the vegetative state that was published as an editorial in the         British Medical Journal (www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8045).
She has also been consulted by fiction writers (e.g.
influencing the         representation of a coma ward in the detective novel `Rubberneck')         and served on the advisory board of a Wellcome Trust funded `Theatre           of Debate' play about neurotechnologies (which won a `Science Goes         to the Movies' award from the British Science Association).
The research         led to the creation of a set of sonnets through a collaboration with a         poet to transform interview material into poetry (see www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqA-vjB1OvQ/).
It was also presented to a general public via a series of 6 community         events as part of a festival organised by JK - the evaluation of which         identified clear impact on attendees e.g.
93% indicated that attending         had impacted on their thoughts or feelings, and 79% reported they would         share the information gained in their professional or personal lives (http://bit.ly/16ruO0K).
JK was         commissioned to produce and present a half-hour programme about the         research for BBC Radio Wales (produced in July 2013, broadcast August         2013), has been shortlisted to create a feature for Radio 3 on         translating research into creative cultural outputs and is currently in         discussion with BBC's `Casualty' about a potential storyline         about the minimally conscious state.
This research has impacted upon a wide range of stakeholders involved in       the care/representation of severely brain injured patients and has led to       the establishment of a new cross-University Research Centre (Cardiff-York)       involving a collaboration of diverse practitioners and disciplines       (including literature, cultural studies, history and philosophy).
Although targeted at addressing the socio-cultural context of the UK, the       research has had an effect internationally.
This is evidenced by requests       to translate executive summaries of the research for practitioners, the       use of the research to inform guidelines in the US (see `Factual       Statement' from source 5.7) and the Rockefeller Foundation's production of       a video-interview about part of the research under their `Innovative         Ideas with Global Impact' insignia       (youtube.com/watch?v=kS1yZzrKSNg&amp;feature=youtu.be).
