     The MDS provides an accurate picture of SPC national services.
The       revised MDS informs policy, including revising SPC service configuration.
It enables local, regional, national benchmarking and quality standards       comparisons and supports the development of SPC Funding Review data       collection methodology.
MDS captures the SPC data from over 65% of       services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that completed the return       for the year 2011/12 (covered over 38,264 in-patients, 24,981 day care       patients, Home care 81,454, Hospice at Home 12,413 patients).
Claim 1: Using the revised MDS enables a more accurate picture of SPC         service composition and activity.
This enables local/national audit       and benchmarking and activity can be used to assess how far national       policy drivers are being implemented (Factual Statements 1 and 2).
1.1) Accurate audit and benchmarking from the revised MDS is evidenced         by:            The use of the MDS by services as part of national benchmarking of         standards of service provision in the sector.
Cited in 34 hospices'         Annual Quality Accounts, in compliance with the Health Act 2009:         2012/13, for example used by the flagship hospice St Christopher's,         London.
Use of the MDS was advocated by a Help the Hospices Workshop in         conjunction with the Department of Health on Quality Accounts (May 2010)         (Factual Statement 3).
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence National Quality         Standards (NICE) for SPC refer to using the MDS for monitoring purposes         to assess for best practice.
The Quality Standards also include SPC         services providing both telephone advice and access to spiritual care;         both now recorded on the revised MDS.1        MDS data are being used by the Cancer Networks as part of the National         Cancer Peer Review Programme.
This supports quality assurance of cancer         services by local cancer networks organisations to ensure that national         standards are met: for example the monitoring of telephone support and         seven day week service, which are now reflected in part of the national         Quality Standards for end of life care for adults.2           1.2) SPC services are benefitting because the MDS allows them to         demonstrate supporting the DH End of Life Care Strategy of promoting         dying at home:            MDS now records the SPC teams service interventions (including         clinical interventions e.g.
blood transfusion, hospice at home         services).This suggests the positive impact of SPC contributing to         supporting dying at home.3,4 Midhurst Macmillan SPC Service         used these data to evidence a reduction in hospital admissions by 79%.5           1.3) MDS demonstrates the increasing access to SPC services for         non-malignant disease including neurological, cardiovascular and         respiratory diseases (a national policy driver) Previously this data       was not captured            Evidence used by the National Council on Palliative Care to respond to         the All Parliamentary Group on Heart Disease, Stroke, Kidney and         Diabetes Inquiry recommending Key Priorities for the Cardiovascular         Disease Outcomes Strategy, that include access to SPC services.
Additionally, MDS data are cited in NHS Outcome Strategy for COPD and         Asthma (May 2012), regarding these patients accessing SPC.
(Factual           Statement 1)          Claim 2 Improving management information through accurate data         collection and monitoring (Factual Statements 1 and 2)     2.1) The MDS provides accurate data for service managers, informing         planning and funding of local services, captures accurate service costs         and appropriate staffing composition to meet local demand.
Consequently, it readily identified the hidden aspects of palliative care       interventions to ensure that they are being accurately monitored and can       be costed:            Telephone support is now reported in the MDS 2011/12: day care         services provided over 88,240 consultations (p575).
In bereavement         support services 37.6% of telephone contacts lasted over 10 minutes         (21,874 contacts).5        Service use and trends are reviewed including MDT composition and         usage of each professional thereby informing staffing composition needs.
For example there has been an increase in: pastoral spiritual care         telephone consultations in day care has increased and trebled over the         last three years4.
Thus demonstrating the implementation of         the Quality Standards For End of Life Care that SPC services had         designated access to spiritual service as part of the MDT1.
A         further 7% rise was reported in 2011/2.5        Similarly in Day Care, in 2011/12 there were over 285,342 face to face         consultations previously not correctly monitored, as did not capture all         MDT activity.5        Data can be used to inform workforce planning and service development:         for example the PCT Lead Nurse West Midlands "used the NCPC Minimum Data         Set to argue with local Commissioners of the need for two more         specialist palliative care nurses, which made a major contribution to a         small team"5        The data are used to inform the business plan to gain increased         staffing with the development of seven day SPC day services.
(Factual           Statement 2)          2.2) Providing accurate data to inform the development of the data         sets to be used for the SPC Funding Review 2011 (Factual           Statement 4)            The MDS is key to the Independent Funding Review.
The independent         review for the Secretary of State for Health 2011 quoted "the only         consistent data set for adult services collected at the moment is the         Hospice specialist palliative care minimum data set" (pg 73) (Factual           Statement 4).
Subsequently the MDS has been used to inform the         development of the costing methodologies, for the data sets for the         pilot sites for the Independent Palliative Care Funding Review drawing         upon the categories included in the revised MDS.
