     By providing some of the highest quality and strongest evidence for the       efficacy for any psycho-social intervention, the programme of clinical       trials into the efficacy of the NFPP conducted at Southampton, has (i)       made a major contribution to fundamentally changing guideline           recommendations in relation to ADHD clinical practice by       demonstrating the value of non-pharmacological interventions, and (ii) led           many practitioners more specifically to use the NFPP to improve the           lives of ADHD children and their families.
The development of       the NFPP was a breakthrough in ADHD treatments transforming the ability of       parents in the UK and overseas to manage and modify the behaviour, and       improve the underlying self-regulation of children with ADHD, an illness       that affects one in 20 five-to- 15-year-olds &#8212; or around 400,000 children       in the UK.
Participation in the NFPP enables a decrease in core ADHD       features without the use of medication and its unwanted side-effects.
Reducing children's levels of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity       has benefits for their educational attainment and social adjustment and       for their psychological development more generally.
In addition to the       direct advantages for children with ADHD, reducing their disruptive       behaviour also benefits their families, teachers and associates.
More       specifically, evidence from the first RCT suggests the NFPP can improve       mothers' mental health.
First, the programme has informed clinical guidelines for practitioners       treating children with ADHD, as well as leading to its widespread use in       the UK and abroad, directly benefiting children living with ADHD and their       families, increasing parental understanding of the disorder and       strengthening parent-child relationships.
Although emphasis has been       placed on the treatment of children with early-onset ADHD, the NFPP is       being used clinically up to the age of 12 and parents can apply the       principles of the programme in caring for their children through their       teenage years.
The 2001 NFPP trial was identified in the National       Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) 2008 guidance on       ADHD &#8212; guideline CG072 &#8212; as one of the few methodologically sophisticated       trials of parent training in the literature [5.1].
This       contributed towards NICE's subsequent recommendation that parent training       be made available as a frontline treatment for ADHD [5.1].
Professor Tim Kendall, chair of the ADHD guidelines committee has written       "Sonuga-Barke and colleagues' work was instrumental in leading to           the NICE guideline recommendations that the parents of all children           with ADHD, and those pre-school with these behaviours, should have           access to parent training/education programmes.
Combined with similar           guidance for the provision of parent training for the parents of           children with conduct disorders, Sonuga-Barke' s work has also lead to           a major national implementation programme in which the number of such           parent training programmes has increased very substantially across           England and Wales" [5.8].
Following on from this, the NFPP was validated by the National Academy       for Parenting Practitioners, making it one of 10 Academy programmes       registered as an evidence-based treatment [5.2; 5.3].
The NFPP       forms the basis of an ADHD training website sponsored by the Welsh       Assembly that provides online training and support for general       practitioners, GPs with special interests, community paediatricians and       Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services staff [5.4; see also 5.5].
The NFPP was highly rated by the UK Department of Education [5.6].
The NFPP trials were also cited in the 2011 American Academy of       Paediatrics' revised guidelines for the treatment of ADHD, extending the       programme's reach to the United States [5.7].
The NFPP is now widely used across the UK and increasingly in Europe and       the US.
2,500 parents have purchased a NFPP self-help manual           published less than 2 years ago (Laver-Bradbury et al., 2010).
Thompson and Laver-Bradbury have coordinated a training programme in the       UK, Europe and the US.
This has resulted in over 250 clinicians           being trained to use the techniques over the last 3 years           alone with courses run in Southampton, Portsmouth, London,       North Wales, Sheffield, Leicester, Bromley, Dundee, and Guernsey.
These       meetings have been attended by practitioners from many parts of the UK and       Denmark, USA, Japan, Italy, Spain.
Workshops have taken place at       international meetings in Turkey and Spain attended by staff from all over       Europe and South America.
Based on the notion that each of these       clinicians used NFPP with 10 ADHD patients a year, we estimate           that at least 7,500 patients and their families have benefitted from           this work.
The perceived importance of the NFPP by public bodies is further       demonstrated by the funding of major trials by overseas governments.
For       instance, a multi-centre NIHR trial in the UK is evaluating the efficacy       of a version of the NFPP adapted for treatment resistant families (i.e.,       PEDIA), while a trial in New York funded by the National Institute of       Mental Health (NIMH) at a cost of $2.3m, has compared the revised NFPP to       a generic intervention for conduct problems.
The results of this trial       will be published in 2014.
There is also a national study on-going in       Denmark with firm plans for studies in Japan, Hong Kong, Sweden and       Brazil.
Discussions are currently underway regarding major initiatives in       Spain, Japan, Brazil, Hong Kong and the Middle East.
