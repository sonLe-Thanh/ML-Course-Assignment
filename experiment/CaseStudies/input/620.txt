     The UK success of Destino (in part by showcasing new work by       leading choreographers like Benjamin, Maliphant and Hofesh Schechter) led       to a similar project in Ethiopia.
While the programme at Sadler's Wells       featured a large-scale intergenerational community piece including groups       of hard-to-reach young people, it did not include performers with physical       disabilities.
Its counterpart in Addis Ababa, Wekt (Four Seasons)       - made as part of Destino in Ethiopia and staged alongside A         Holding Space - was performed by a mixed ability cast of 50       including the Potentials dancers (10 with post-polio paralysis and one in       a wheelchair with severe cerebral palsy).
Wekt was choreographed       by Sendi and Demissie, who says that working with Benjamin and Maliphant       on A Holding Space significantly helped to refine their own skills       in co- choreography.
According to Dance United's Evaluation Report, Destino in       Ethiopia secured large enthusiastic audiences (2700 people over 2 days at       the National Theatre), gave disadvantaged individuals hope and       self-respect, enabled Sendi and Demise to become future cultural leaders,       and precipitated change for the better within Ethiopian communities.
It       quoted one member of the audience as saying that "three thousand people         ... will leave the auditorium with a completely different picture about         the role of the disabled ... Those messages will be passed on."
Since 2009, Sendi and Denissie have separately choreographed three       different integrated pieces that have toured to venues across Ethiopia as       well as Tanzania, Ghana, and South Africa.
They say that Benjamin "helped         in making us into experts" and that he continues to remind them of       the importance of detail, depth and the role of improvisation, through       which one discovers "how [a dancer's] body works... where you can give         weight" (Sendi, 2013), in choreographing for integrated companies.
In 2010, Sendi and Demissie became co-directors of Adugna.
Now also a       judge on Ethiopian Idol, Sendi says that this means "I need to       ensure the development of contemporary dance in my country".
This is       clearly an inclusive vision; to mark the "re-creation of the company" he       choreographed an integrated piece called Adwa with the Potentials.
The aim is for the Potentials to consistently participate in all three       elements of Adugna's mission: contemporary dance performances "from the         community, to the community", outreach, and international       performances.
The company website states that "The impact of the         expanding community outreach work with other young disabled people and         [the Potentials'] performances cannot be underestimated."
In March 2013, building on the momentum of A Holding Space,       Benjamin returned to Ethiopia to research the second edition of Making         an Entrance and to run a choreographic lab, mentoring Sendi and       Demissie during the development of new integrated performances using       improvisatory strategies.
In interviews with nine members of Adugna who       had worked with Benjamin both between 2000-2003 and in 2013, all mention       the personal motivation of changing Ethiopian attitudes toward disabled       people.
For able-bodied members, this is modeled on their own experiences       of working with disabled dancers for the first time, and for those with       disabilities, it is tied to their increasing sense of self-esteem,       standard of living and professional expectations.
All speak of Benjamin's       role in helping to create these personal opportunities.
Yitsadel says that, "when I was a child, I couldn't go to school, I         couldn't find the work.
I couldn't do things, I couldn't go on the         transportation so I felt like I was living other people's lives...
I         want those things to change [for others]."
Andualem Kebede says that       "when I move in the space I feel free; I feel very proud... in the         street, when people are watching me I [think it is] because they         probably saw me on TV dancing.
So, I don't think they are watching me         because I'm disabled."
Tilahun Jemaneh competed as a powerlifter in       the 2004 Paralympics and now is a sports teacher.
He believes that the       only way to change negative attitudes toward disability in Ethiopia is by       showing strength and capability "in action".
He says Adugna gave him the       confidence, strength and performance skills (including `a sense of       audience') to compete on a national and international stage and that he       earns more than his other disabled colleagues because of this experience       and expertise.
Terefwork Negussie, who is unable to move or to talk, says       that she "learned how to express what she feels inside through         movement" and that she wants to become a choreographer.
Benjamin has       put her in contact with Lisa Simpson, a profoundly disabled dancer in the       UK with whom he developed `the Simpson Board'.
This allows people with no       speech and limited voluntary control over their muscles to communicate       ideas about movement in a studio.
Opportunities for funding via NGOs have been cut severely in Ethiopia;       Adugna is currently on the verge of losing its studio due to       redevelopment.
The Potentials were unable to train and perform together       during 2012 because there wasn't enough money to pay allowances (to       replace other income) or transportation expenses to rehearsals.
Benjamin's       choreographic lab had a galvanising effect; the company was able to work       together daily for 2 weeks to create new performances to act as `calling       cards' in their renewed fight for visibility and funding.
His visit also       enabled connections to be made with Addis Ababa University for the first       time, presenting work-in-progress to a large group of postgraduate       students, and opening opportunities to use the University's resources to       help sustain the company.
