     Introduction of pharmacogenetic information to warfarin dosing advice     Several groups around the world made contributions to the body of       evidence about the role of genetics in determining the warfarin       sensitivity of patients, however it was the work published by Daly, Kamali       and others in Newcastle that has been recognised as being fundamental.
The       Medical Director of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Anticoagulation Service       (who is also Professor of Medicine at Washington University, St Louis,       USA) has said, `The seminal paper published by Ann Daly at Newcastle         University in 1999 [R1] ignited the field of         pharmacogenetic-based therapy' (Ev a).
The importance of the 2005       study [R2] has also been acknowledged, with the University of Illinois       Hospital and Health Services Centre confirming that it `formed a         significant part of the evidence base that ultimately led to         international clinical trials of gene-guided dosing of anticoagulants         (including warfarin) being carried out' (Ev b).
Official guidance: By late 2007 (and so having an impact on       practice from 2008 onwards) the US Food and Drug Administration had judged       that the evidence on warfarin pharmacogenetics was sufficiently strong to       warrant a change to the approved medication guide of warfarin (marketed as       Coumadin).
Since approximately one third of the population carries at       least one genetic polymorphism that slows the breakdown of warfarin, there       was a significant opportunity to apply the research findings and protect       patient health by avoiding overdose.
The regulator issued a safety alert       that stated:     `FDA approved updated labeling to include pharmacogenomics information         to the CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION         sections of the prescribing information for the widely used         blood-thinning drug, Coumadin.
This new information explains that         people's genetic makeup may influence how they respond to the drug.
Specifically, people with variations in two genes may need lower         warfarin doses than people without these genetic variations.
The two         genes are called CYP2C9 and VKORC1' (Ev c)     In 2010 a substantial change was made to the drug medication guide that       is included in the drug packaging when, at the request of the US Food and       Drug Administration, a table displaying three ranges of warfarin doses       based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information was added (Ev d and Ev e).
Assisting practitioners: In 2009 the international standard       algorithm for warfarin dosing was published in the New England Journal         of Medicine (Ev f).
The algorithm was a product of the work of the       International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium.
Newcastle University       researchers Daly, Kamali and Sconce all contributed data to the paper that       outlined the algorithm.
Sources at centres in Chicago and Seattle have       confirmed that the international standard algorithm was `significantly         underpinned' (Ev b) by Newcastle research (R2) and that the       Newcastle researchers had published `the first algorithm on CYP2C9 and         VKORC1 gene-guided dosing of warfarin' (Ev g).
Application in the clinic     Interest in the pharmacogenetic approach to warfarin prescribing is       increasing in clinics across the US, with large academic medical centres       leading implementation.
Since autumn 2010 the Vanderbilt University       Medical Center in the US has been running the PREDICT programme, which       aims to embed pharmacogenetic information in its approach to healthcare.
So far the programme `has included &gt;12,500 subjects and         warfarin-CYP2C9/VKORC1 is one of five drug-gene interactions currently       [being] targeted.
'(Ev h)     The University of Illinois at Chicago has also provided a statement       concerning practice at its medical centre:     `beginning in August 2012, all patients newly starting warfarin during         hospitalization at our medical center are automatically genotyped for         clinical care to assist with warfarin dosing.
Nearly 300 patients have         been genotyped to date.'
(Ev b)     Large-scale clinical trials     Clinical trials of gene-based dosing of warfarin, together involving       thousands of people in the US and Europe, are currently in progress.
Daly       and Kamali contributed to the major European trial, EU-PACT (R6), which       involved 455 patients.
In the US, two large studies are ongoing: the       WARFARIN study (approximately 3,800 patients, started August 2011) and the       COAG study (around 1,020 patients, started September 2009) (Ev i).
The US Food and Drug Administration has estimated that gene-based dosing       of warfarin will prevent 85,000 serious bleeding events and 17,000 strokes       a year in the US (Ev j).
