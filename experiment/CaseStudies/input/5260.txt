     Cruise's work has had three broad areas of impact: a) public cultural       life, b) commerce and the art market, and c) pedagogy and public education       and understanding.
a) Impact is evident in the reception and wide use made of Cruise's       research outputs.
The range of periodicals reviewing the Pre-Raphaelite       Drawing project was strikingly wide: from Grazia to The         Burlington Magazine, from World of Interiors to The         Financial Times.
On his activities as a curator, a letter from the       Fine Art Curator at BMAG makes the general impact clear: "Both of Cruise's       exhibitions ... had a demonstrable and substantial impact on the public       awareness of BMAG's outstanding collections of works by the Pre-Raphaelite       Brotherhood, their associates and followers."
She continues that The         Poetry of Drawing "made new and illuminating connections both       between the works themselves and between our collections and objects on       loan from elsewhere..." [5.2]     The final visitor numbers for The Poetry of Drawing were in       excess of 18,000 in Birmingham and almost 25,000 in Sydney &#8212; both of which       exceeded the institutional expectations for paying exhibitions especially       of works on paper.
[5.2, 5.3] In Sydney the exhibition "had a positive       influence on our institution by drawing attention to the British Victorian       collections", according to the Curator of European Prints, Drawings and       Watercolours, who saw the exhibition as illuminating their permanent       collection.
[5.3] The healthy worldwide sales figures for the book Pre-Raphaelite         Drawing were well above normal sales of art books &#8212; around 5,700       copies in the USA and 4,500 copies in the rest of the world have been sold       by the publisher, figures that do not include sales at the exhibition       venues &#8212; reveals the popular and commercial success of the project [5.4]     In designing exhibitions Cruise has presented an individual curatorial       vision that has been noted in reviews both in the press and in visitors'       blogs; for example: "The most wonderful thing about this exhibition, was       ... its remarkable curation ... With all the pieces displayed at no higher       than eye-level, these choices of display combined to give a completely       unprecedented and immersive access to ... cherished works of art."
[5.8].
The Spectator reviewer remarked on the "extraordinary array of       work", wrote that the exhibition was "a joy to visit" because of the       "almost prodigal spaciousness."
[5.9] while the Daily Telegraph       described it as "magisterial" and the installation as "crisp and clear".
[5.10]     b) Cruise's research has had a specific impact on the art market       including his documentation and assessment of the works of Simeon Solomon.
Cruise has been asked to authenticate or advise on works by Solomon by       Christies, the Maas Gallery, Abbott and Holder, and Campbell Wilson, among       other auction houses and dealers.
The Director of the Maas Gallery       observes that Cruise "helped in dating and identifying three Simeon       Solomon drawings that belonged to the Forbes sisters, establishing and       describing their provenance in a most illuminating way... the drawings       were sold to a Birmingham couple that were turned on to Pre-Raphaelite       drawings in general and Solomon in particular by the two exhibitions       curated by Colin Cruise at Birmingham."
[5.5] The Head of Christie's       International Department (Prints &amp; Drawings) makes a connection       between Cruise's scholarship and the art market: " It has been enormously       helpful to obtain [Cruise's] views on attributions and on art historical       importance when cataloguing and valuing important works of art.
...
Most       recently Cruise sent me an enlightening article about Love Among the         Ruins, the masterpiece by Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones that we sold       in July and which realised a new world record both for the artist and any       Pre-Raphaelite Work of Art.
The Tate now intend an exhibition around Burne-Jones         and The Symbolists with this painting as their centre-piece."
[5.1]     c) Cruise's research and curatorial practices have had wider and more       practical, often pedagogic, impact: his advice and experience has been       published by the AAH in Don't Ask for the Mona Lisa (2011), as       well as in a presentation at the Barber Institute: `The Crisis in Regional       Curatorship', (November 2012) [5.6] and an invitation to co-host (with       Prof. Shearer West), a session on the `state of the discipline' at BAVS       Glasgow (3/9/2011).
He was invited to join the advisory board for the       award-winning, JISC-funded digitisation project at BMAG.
He was also an       advisor to The Cult of Beauty exhibition/catalogue (V&amp;A/San       Francisco, 2011-12).
His work features in undergraduate and postgraduate       teaching programmes, as shown, for example, in bibliographies for the       Graduate School, Art Institute of Chicago and the University of Iowa among       others [5.7].
Cruise has continued to extend his scholarly research activities through       conference organisation, keynote addresses, gallery and other public talks       and broadcasting.
As a participating expert he has appeared in The         Return of the King (BBC Radio 4; first broadcast 14th       April 2004), Flowers in Art Series Episode: `Lilies' (BBC4/BBC2;       first screening 18th May 2004), and Botticelli Primavera:         The Life of a Masterpiece, (BBC2/ Fulmar Productions; first       screening 23rd February 2004).
Largely as a result of the       interdisciplinary nature of his research Cruise has been in demand as a       speaker at public events and has frequently been invited to address forums       where literary, religious and social historical ideas are debated as well       as, and along with, art historical ones.
Thus, he delivered the annual       McDougall Lecture in the History of Watercolour at the Courtauld Institute       , London (December 2012) [5.11] and has spoken at academic and public       talks at CRASSH (Cambridge University, 2013), the Courtauld Institute       (2013), Rylands Library, Manchester (2013), Oxford University `Bible in       Music Art &amp; Literature' seminars (2012), Bristol University (2012),       Bournemouth Institute (2011) and frequently at the Tate and the National       Gallery of Scotland and other museums, and for the Art Fund and various       Adult and Continuing Education organisations (e.g.
2005, 2006, 2012).
