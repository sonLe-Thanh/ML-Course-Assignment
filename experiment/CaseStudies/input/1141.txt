     Research carried out by the psychology department at Durham University       has led to significant       improvements in the quality of life of patients suffering with visual       field defects such as hemianopia.
Hemianopia is an eye condition which affects more than 4,000 people in the       UK each year, and is       characterised by individuals losing half their visual field due to stroke       or other brain injury.
Patients who       took part in the research (~150 individuals) saw significant improvements       in their visual abilities and       general quality of life, with an average improvement of approximately 20%       in everyday activities like       reading.
The primary impact from the latter two projects carried out by       researchers from the psychology       department at Durham University (Lane et al., 2010; Aimola et al., in       press) comes from the       development of the Durham Reading and Exploration (DREX) training       programme &#8212; a computer based,       self-adjusting tool that allows people to treat themselves in their own       home [3].
The tool, available for       free to interested parties, promotes more efficient eye-movements and       increased visual awareness.
More than 50 CDs have been sent directly to patients across the globe,       including those based in       Belgium, Australia, Spain and Chile.
Copies have also been sent to       practitioners to trial with their own       patients, both nationally and internationally, with instruction as       appropriate [4].
A neuropsychologist in       Denmark began using the technique in June 2012, with three patients so far       experiencing significant       benefits in their condition [4].
In the UK some 150 patients took part in the three clinical trials       underpinning the research, benefitting       from improvements in their self-confidence, independence, self-esteem and       general comfort.
Many       patients restrict their activities, become withdrawn and dependent, and       can suffer from depression as a       consequence of their visual impairment.
Any improvement in their ability       to perform simple tasks like       reading or self-care can therefore have a positive impact on their quality       of life.
Patient testimonials [5]       include:             "I now find using a dictionary ... and the Telephone Directory much           easier and also continue to           enjoy my general reading, tapestry, and knitting, and I certainly pay           more particular attention to           my environment when I am out".
(MH)        "I went for a week on a canal boat last week so I was able to steer           the boat and implement my           new visual awareness skills".
(MS)        "The research has helped me greatly, it has made me concentrate           much more ...
I find I read a           lot more now, because I find it easier and more comfortable".
(GS)        "There is no doubt in my mind that I have learned to cope much           better visually with the help of           the training programme.
I can read and write much better ... the           programme has taught me           patience, given me confidence and raised my self-esteem in such a way           as to enable me to           take challenges in my stride".
(SS)          Further impact came from the wide dissemination of the research in the       media (both locally and       internationally) [2], with interested parties contacting the research team       directly to request the toolkit       after it was publicised on television and radio [6].
A website has been       developed by the researchers to       further promote the DREX training (www.durham.ac.uk/psychology/research/drex/),       and to make it       easier to for interested individuals to find out more details as well as       gain more direct access to the       training programme.
The research team collaborated with NHS trusts to gain participants for       the studies, leading to       increased awareness within the clinical community of the possibility of       this rehabilitation being made       available.
The team has worked with professionals from numerous       specialities including neurosciences,       ophthalmology and stroke units.
The work has been disseminated at fifteen       educational seminars and       workshops attended by NHS staff [7], improving rates of assessment for       visual field defects at the       bedside and improving the quality of information available to patients in       the acute setting [8].
The       charity Action for Blind People, which became aware of the project during       a presentation, also used the       training and found patients were able to read more efficiently [9].
The high quality of the toolkit was commented on by experts in the field.
The research team was       approached by the Foundation for Assistive Technology (FAST) &#8212; the primary       source of information       about developments in assistive technology in the UK &#8212; who included the       training details in an online       database [10].
Also an occupational therapist at Newcastle Primary Care       Trust said the research was       hugely beneficial:             "I have referred approximately 31 patients to Durham University           Psychology Department for           compensatory training since the research began.
...
I do think that           research has offered hope to           those who may not have received any specialist compensatory training           in the community.
... We           would be keen to be involved with any further research in the future."
