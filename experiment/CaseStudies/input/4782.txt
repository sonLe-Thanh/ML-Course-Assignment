     Professor Paul Preston is internationally recognised as the leading       authority on Franco and the Spanish Civil War.
The Spanish Holocaust       has received international attention and generated hundreds of articles       and reviews [A].
Preston's book challenges the 'pacto de silencio', the       political decision of the Spanish political elite to avoid dealing with       the legacy of Franco and the difficult transition from dictatorship to       democracy.
Public recognition of Preston's work commended his courage in       breaking taboos [B], and has observed that Spain was still living with the       consequences of a `brainwashing process' [C].
Others have written,       "Preston's study is history as a public good, a substitute for the truth       and reconciliation process that has not taken place in Spain," and that,       "it will never again be possible to write history of that period without       having read El holocausto espa&#241;ol" [D,E].
In 2008, Preston received the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella         the Catholic, awarded by the Spanish Government for services to       Spanish history.
He has been offered honorary doctorates in 2012 by the       Universit&#233; de Pau, France, and in 2013 by the Universidad de Extremadura,       Spain, in recognition of the quality and importance of his research.
His       work has been published in 11 languages and he is regularly noted in the       press.
The "extraordinary moral and emotional power" [F] of The Spanish         Holocaust is demonstrated by the high level of personal engagement       by readers and critics, as evidenced by the 4000 subscribers to Preston's       Facebook page.
Social media offers opportunities for readers to share       personal stories of traumatic family histories as personal and collective       catharsis, contributing to the `memory movement' that Preston's work has       helped to inspire.
Preston's research has achieved significant further impact in three key       areas:     1.
`Memory Movement'     One of the outcomes of NGOs and civic associations working to quantify,       catalogue, commemorate, and seek compensation for the victims of the       Francoist repression has been the recognition of processes for collective       commemoration and memorialisation.
Preston has closely collaborated with a       number of non-governmental organisations involved in this work, most       notably the Andaluc&#237;an association Todos los Nombres (TLN) and the       Memorial Democr&#224;tic de Catalunya (MDC).
Dr Francisco Espinosa-Maestre, the former Scientific Advisor to TLN       describes Preston's work on The Spanish Holocaust as uniting local       historians researching the repression since the 1980s, and revealing to       researchers and readers `an almost completely unknown reality' [G].
Dr       Jordi Guix&#233;, Deputy Director of the Memorial Democr&#224;tic de Catalunya       (MDC), points to the significance of the book for the organisation; it is,       he says, an "exhaustive work which historically contextualises the       different episodes of violence of the civil war...using numerous sources       to bring the state of the question up-to-date" [H].

Public Discourse     Preston's work has stimulated public awareness of, and public debate       over, the historical origins of on-going political divisions within       present-day Spain.
This impact is observable in Spain, the UK and other       countries.
Preston's work informs present-day Spanish affairs, most       notably the trial of the Spanish judge Baltasar Garz&#243;n.     Internationally known as a champion of human rights for his attempt to       bring August Pinochet to trial, Garz&#243;n was charged with abuse of power for       attempting to investigate the crimes of the Franco dictatorship.
Although       Garz&#243;n was acquitted in March 2012, the trial revealed the continuing and       conflicting interpretations of the Civil War and the Franco dictatorship       in Spain [I].
In the UK, Preston was invited to contribute an analysis of       the trial to Socialist Lawyer [J].
Others underlined his role in       challenging the 'pacto de silencio', stating: "the ultimate importance of       Preston's relentless and impeccable research is as a reminder of the evil       unleashed by Franco &#8212; a reminder that is especially needed at this time       when the only trial being brought about by the 'Law of Historical Memory'       is one directed against the judge who has been investigating right-wing       atrocities, Baltasar Garz&#243;n" [K].
On 2 November 2008, Preston delivered the prestigious annual BBC Radio 3       Free-Thinking Lecture `Us, Them and Europe', as part of the 2008 European       City of Culture events in Liverpool [L].
Preston is also a regular speaker       at the Hay Festival in both Hay-on-Wye and Segovia.
On 4 June 2012, he       spoke to an audience of one thousand people on The Spanish Holocaust       [M].
Preston has also contribution significantly to the public domain by means       of key lectures and plenaries and other public appearances.
Lectures and       plenaries include: 2008: Club Internacional de Prensa Santiago de       Compostela; 2009: Institut Fran&#231;ais, London, British Film       Institute, London; 2010, `Historical Memory: Policy and Practice'       jointly organised by Memorial Democr&#224;tic of Barcelona and LSE; and       A.L.Morton Lecture of the Socialist History Society, London.
Notable       research and/or writing contributions/appearances include: 2008: Ramon         Pereira l'home dels refugis, TV3; 2009: The Brits Who         Fought For Spain, History Channel; Digging up the Dead, presented by       Michael Portillo, BBC 4; 2011: The Last of the International         Brigaders, presented by D.J.Taylor, BBC Radio 4; 2012:       Monarquia o Rep&#250;blica, TV3; War of Words a five-part programme       presented by John Simpson on BBC Radio 4.
Preston also contributes regularly to the major Spanish and Catalan radio       and TV channels: TV3, Catalunya R&#224;dio, Cadena Ser, RTVE, Canal +, and in       the UK to BBC Radio 4.
A documentary based on The Spanish Holocaust       is in development in Sweden [N].
3.
Education     The Spanish Holocaust (TSH) has stimulated awareness and increased       understanding of the civil-war and post-war repression within the       educational sector.
The impact in the educational sphere extends far       beyond the submitting HEI.
In at least nine UK universities, including       Royal Holloway University of London, TSH now forms part of course reading       for either one or more undergraduate or postgraduate modules dealing with       Spanish history, general European history, and Spanish and European       contemporary society and politics.
Lecturers from at least six       universities are using the book as recommended reading for undergraduate       or postgraduate students in the present academic year, e.g.
Universities       of Madrid, Girona, Zaragoza, Granada, C&#225;ceres, Paris, Williams College,       USA [O].
Lectures at other educational institutions beyond the submitting HEI:     2011: The Carnival of Death Perceptions of Death in Europe and the       Americas, Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance Studies, University of       London; 2012: Plenary Lecture at the Conference of the Association       for Contemporary Iberian Studies at Kings College; 2013: Keynote       Lecture, `L'Holocauste espagnole' at the Colloque International organised       by Universit&#233; Paris 8, `L'antifascisme en question, 1922-1945: nouveaux       objets, nouveaux d&#233;bats'; Convocation Lecture at Newcastle University;       lecture to inaugurate the academic year at the Universitat Rovira i       Virgili.
