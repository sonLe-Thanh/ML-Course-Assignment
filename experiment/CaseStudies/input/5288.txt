     Research at Imperial into full-waveform inversion has had two distinct       impacts on the petroleum industry: one specific, where individual       companies are directly using software developed at Imperial College to       apply 3D FWI to their own and their clients' seismic data, and one       generic, ranging broadly across the industrial sector, where the uptake       and effectiveness of FWI has been increased by the direct research       contribution made by Imperial.
In both cases, the application of FWI to       seismic data has affected individual drilling and investment decisions       across the petroleum industry worldwide, changing drilling priorities,       borehole locations, sub-surface risk assessment and mitigation, and       ultimately influencing which plays are drilled and which are not, adding       consequent value to individual petroleum assets.
Generic across the petroleum sector     The petroleum industry worldwide has adopted 3D full-waveform seismic       inversion as a new tool with which to improve the quality of images and       interpretations of the subsurface for petroleum exploration and       production.
A decade ago, there was no capability to undertake 3D FWI of       any description within the petroleum sector.
Today, every large       multinational petroleum company (BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil,       Shell, TOTAL), and many mid-sized (BG Group, DONG, ENI, Hess, Maersk,       Nexen, Statoil, Tullow Oil, Woodside) and national oil companies (CNOOC,       Petrobras, Saudi Aramco, Sinopec, among others), have adopted 3D FWI as       part of their technical portfolio for finding and exploiting petroleum       reserves.
All the largest oil-field seismic service companies (CGG, ION,       PGS, TGS, WesternGeco) now offer FWI as a commercial service to their       oil-company clients.
Without the specific FWI research contribution made by Imperial over the       past twenty years, and especially without its dissemination, validation       and demonstration on key problems and datasets, the adoption of this       technology would not have begun so early, and its uptake would not have       developed so rapidly, so widely or so successfully.
The head of FWI research at BP and now with TOTAL [7], writes:     "I have been working on the topic of Full waverform inversion for         about 15 years with both BP and Total.
My research, and its direct         application to industry problems, was made possible thanks to the         technology for FWI that Gerhard Pratt conceived and developed during his         time at Imperial College: which includes key publications and more         practically, a 2D frequency domain FWI software that pioneered the way         that the industry currently performs FWI.
To this date, Gerhard's work         remains the reference in the field and his outstanding contribution to         the community has been recognized by the EAGE Conrad Schlumberger award".
The head of FWI development at Chevron [8], writes:     "In 2007, FWI was an untried, unproven, and potentially unaffordable         technique in 3D.
The paper presented at EAGE in Rome, by Warner et al in         2008, demonstrated to a sceptical industry audience that 3D FWI could be         made to work efficiently and effectively on real 3D seismic data.
This         success convinced several companies of the value of FWI, and within a         year BP was able to demonstrate the full commercial value of the         technique when applied to a large field dataset.
This provided a huge         impetus to others to follow this early lead, and today everyone has the         technology.
Without this paper, and the research at Imperial that         underpinned it, 3D FWI would still have happened eventually, but not so         quickly, and perhaps not yet."
Between 2008 and 2012 the industry was estimated, in a public statement       made by WesternGeco at the 2012 SEG conference in Las Vegas, to have spent       more than $200M on seismic data acquisition, data processing, bespoke       computer hardware, software development, and novel acquisition platforms,       specifically to support 3D FWI [9].
During the same period, in a public statement made on 9 June 2013 during       the "Robust FWI Workshop" at the 75th EAGE Conference &amp;       Exhibition in London, BP estimated that additional value of at least $500M       had been generated for the petroleum industry through the application of       FWI to specific seismic datasets that have influenced at least one hundred       individual drilling decisions [9].
This value is realised because improved       imaging leads to improved interpretation, reduced sub-surface risk and HSE       exposure, more discoveries, and more-effective oil and gas development and       extraction.
Specific impact in particular companies     Since 2008, eighteen companies have licensed 3D FWI computer software       from Imperial: BG Group, BP, CGG, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, DONG, DUGS,       ENI, Hess, Ion-GX, Maersk, Nexen, Rio Tinto, Shell, TGS, TOTAL, Tullow,       and Woodside [9].
Around a third of all the 3D seismic data worldwide, to which FWI has       been applied, was estimated in a public statement made by CGG during the       "Advances in Model Building, Imaging, and FWI Workshop" at the 2013 SEG       conference in Houston, to have been analysed using software derived from       that written at Imperial [9].
The head of global technology at Hess [10], writes:     "By 2010, a few successful 3-D Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) results         had been published on modern seismic surveys.
Hess conducted a worldwide         review of academic consortia, and discovered that Imperial College was         the only group to have FWI results on a real 3-D seismic data set.
The         Imperial College Fullwave consortium was, and still is, the leading         academic group in 3-D full waveform inversion.
Hess joined the         consortium in the fall of 2010 to collaborate and learn about ways to         apply FWI to real-world problems.
With the assistance of Mike Warner and         his staff, we immediately and successfully applied their         industrial-grade code to one of our major assets, leapfrogging many         companies who were trying to climb the FWI learning curve by         themselves."
The head of geophysics for BG-Group [11], writes:     "BG Group have supported the work at Imperial in 3D FWI since its         initiation in 2006.
The team at Imperial are world leading, and the         results of their research and their software are now being used, both         within BG and by our sub-contractors, to assist our exploration and         production worldwide.
We are also involved with Mike Warner's group in a         new initiative within Brazil in commencing in 2013, which involves a         &gt;$20m investment from BG Group, and participation from the Federal         University of Rio Grande Norte in Brazil and the University of British         Columbia.
As part of this large ongoing project, there is an advanced         plan to purchase the largest high-performance computer in South America         specifically to run the FWI software that Mike Warner's research team         have developed."
Among the companies that have licensed the software, CGG is an oil-field       service company with the largest share of the seismic services market.
They offer extensive FWI services from seven centres worldwide based in       London, Massy, Oslo, Houston, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore and Perth.
Their       FWI services are built around the software package developed at Imperial       [9].
Since 2010, they have customised and integrated this package into       their core processing and imaging software, and Imperial and CGG have       jointly published the results of applying this software to industry       seismic data [5].
As a result of adopting Imperial's software, CGG has       moved in three years, from a position where they did not offer FWI as a       commercial service, to become the market leader in this field worldwide       [9].
In order to ensure the continued development and availability of FWI       as a valuable industrial tool and maintain a clear pathway to impact the       spin &#8212; out company Sub &#8212; Salt Solutions is in the process of being       developed.
