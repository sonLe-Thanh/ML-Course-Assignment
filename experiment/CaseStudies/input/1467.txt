     As lead academic partner, the world leading information generated by       Ogden and his team at Oxford Brookes University has played a central role       in developing and proving the merits of light steel technology.
Various       examples of publications and demonstration activities arising from the       research are cited in section 3, however these represent a small       proportion of the total industry accepted outputs.
Projects such as the       Oxford Brookes European MegaProject 5 demonstration building played not       only a key role in developing the technology but also in creating       awareness and understanding.
The building received over 2000 visitors and       gained extensive press coverage (circa 40 articles written between April       1997 and March 1998).
The developments have resulted in increased confidence in light steel       technology:            Companies have been prepared to commit to multi-million pound         investment programmes to deliver products at commercial volumes based on         the demonstrated technologies (e.g: Ayrshire, BW Industries, Fusion,         Kingspan, Knauf, Lafarge, British Gypsum.
Metsec).
Specifiers have gained confidence in the performance of light steel         framing such that they are willing to use it in preference to longer         established but often less efficient alternatives.
Building control agencies (such as local authorities, Lantac, NHBC         etc.)
have accepted that systems are free of unacceptable or abnormal         levels of risk.
Buildings based on the design practices that have been         developed are considered equally by mortgage and funding companies to         those constructed using conventional technologies such as masonry and         timber.
The scale of impact of the research can in part be gauged by the major       contribution that the market makes to the steel production sectors where       the annual tonnage is over 1% of total UK output.
Other key measures include changes in construction markets:            The market share of light steel framing is currently 17% overall and         gaining on timber frame, currently 56% (a).
In the permanent modular         off-site buildings market, light steel framing has essentially taken         over from timber to the extent that few timber framed modular companies         remain.
28% of the total UK offsite construction market is attributed to         permanent light steel modular buildings of the type addressed by the         research, a further 9% to relocatable buildings (approximately 75% of         which rely on light steel framing).
The increasing efficiency of modular         construction has meant that it has grown from a negligible amount in         2000 to a point where it is currently estimated to account for 2% of the         total construction market (b).
Based on annual sector surveys by the independent market research         company `Construction Markets' (c), the peak light steel framing market         in the period 2008-2012 was 66K tonnes pa.
Taking an average galvanised         strip steel cost of &#163;600 per tonne this equates to a materials market of         &#163;39.5 million pa.
The contribution of this to the turnover of supply         chain companies (assuming normal manufacturing overheads of 1.75 and         margins of 12.5%) is circa.
&#163;78 million pa. to the UK economy.
This use of domestically produced product is actively reducing timber         imports, as conventional and pre-existing technologies require softwood         sections not available in the UK.
The effect on the UK trade balance is         therefore significant.
It is important to recognise that this impact has been achieved in a       recessionary period where the total construction market has been reduced       by approximately 50% and where conventional costs are at their most       competitive.
Impact may also be judged in terms of widely acknowledged cost,       performance and efficiency benefits to the construction sector (examples       of supporting material for this latter claim being given in section 5,       refs d &#8212; g).
Benefits include:            Improved speed of construction with rapid reliable construction         programmes.
Higher levels of automation reduce costs and reliance on specialist         site trades.
Improved quality with low levels of defect remediation required post         construction and reliable in service performance.
Improved environmental performance including low waste, good         insulation and high levels of airtightness.
These benefits of light steel construction developed in the UK are also       reflected in the international development of the technology.
In part this       is due to the improved resilience and robustness against earthquake and       wind loading.
Early adopters therefore include New Zealand, Australia,       Japan, USA, Canada and South Africa (h).
The knowledge gained in relation to light steel within the team has also       formed the foundations for commercial innovation, such as the creation of       high reflectivity liner sheets which have been developed for built-up       cladding systems.
Launched in late 2012, these have sold 1000 tonnes by       May 2013 value &#163;600K.
