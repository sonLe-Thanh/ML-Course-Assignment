     As a result of our work, which provided an evidence base for the efficacy       of self-management in LUTS, nearly all evidence-based practice guidelines       recommend self-management as the initial form of therapy for all men       presenting with LUTS.
It has therefore become a global standard of care.
NICE guideline CG97 (2010), on Lower urinary tract symptoms in men,         recommends self- management in the text and in the therapeutic         algorithms.
The BMJ RCT is referenced [a].
Emberton acted as         expert advisor to the group that produced the guidelines.
2011 guidelines issued by the European Association of Urology on         treatment of non-neurogenic male LUTs (on which the majority of the         national guidelines are based) cite our evidence that "self-management           as part of watchful waiting reduces both symptoms and progression".
Accordingly, they recommend that "men with mild symptoms are           suitable for watchful waiting...Men with LUTS should be offered           lifestyle advice prior to or concurrent with treatment."
The table         from Brown et al 2007 is cited directly and the recommendation is         attributed a level of Evidence of 1b; Grade A [b].
Self-management is now widely recommended to patients, for example on the       patient.co.uk website [c] and on NHS Choices [d].
Private       healthcare providers now recommend self- management according to the NICE       guidelines (e.g.
Benenden Healthcare [e]) and it is widely used in       NHS Continence Services [f].
A survey of GPs in 2011 showed that       46% had implemented the guidance, and 80% of those had seen a reduction in       referral costs [g].
The impacts of our work on patients are as follows:             Fewer men require drug therapy: our RCT demonstrated both a         reduction in symptoms equivalent to that achieved by surgery and a         reduction in the need for treatment whether it be medication or surgery        More effective therapy: Our intervention arm was standard care         plus self-management.
Men receiving drug therapy who were randomised to         the intervention arm had greater and more sustained symptom improvement.
Fewer referrals: Self-management is being applied in primary         care and is being promoted through self-help groups.
The resolution of         symptoms without recourse to medication or surgery leads to fewer         referrals to secondary care.
The impacts on patients also provide economic benefits to the healthcare       system through a reduced cost of care.
Our work has shown that once the       self-management skills are taught the benefits are sustained.
This has not       been the case in other self-management programmes.
A conservative       estimate, abstracting from our data, is that men using self-management       have a 3-fold reduction in risk of requiring therapy or progressing       symptomatically.
Estimates of the cost of treating LUTS in the UK are       approximately &#163;120m per year.
Modelling of the effect size and uptake of       self-management as an initial strategy produces an estimate of a &#163;20m       annual saving, largely derived as a result of fewer referrals to secondary       care and to reduced drug costs.
Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed care organisation in the United       States covering a population of 3.6 million, is in the process of adapting       and implementing self-management as a standard intervention based on the       work published by our team and the recommendations in international       clinical practice guidelines.
They state that it is "exactly the type         of innovative, impactful work that can help us break out of the         traditional means of delivering health care, and help contain burgeoning         costs while at the same time, improve the quality of care."
