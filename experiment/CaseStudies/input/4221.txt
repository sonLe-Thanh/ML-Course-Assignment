     The impact of the research is as follows.
The IRA ceasefire of 1994 specified a cessation of `military operations'       only &#8212; i.e.
punishment       violence against alleged anti-social offenders continued.
Between 1973 and       2007 Republicans       were responsible for approximately 1570 such shootings and over 1000       beatings (PSNI 2010).
In       1994 McEvoy and three human rights activists began direct dialogue with       the IRA to explore non-violent       alternatives to such practices.
Following intensive negotiations with       senior IRA members, a       research report written by the team was presented to the Republican       leadership (Auld et al 1997 &#8212; the `Blue Book').
That document mapped out a route for the IRA to       `responsibly disengage' from       punishment violence.
It proposed the creation of local CRJ projects which       would instead deal with       crime and anti-social behaviour using non-violent and lawful restorative       justice techniques.
It also       suggested that relations between the police and Republican communities       could be gradually       improved through such projects.
In late 1997, Sinn F&#233;in President Gerry       Adams announced that,       following extensive consultation with `external experts' (i.e.
McEvoy et       al), Sinn F&#233;in would support       the establishment of CRJ as an alternative to IRA punishment violence.
The       IRA subsequently       issued a series of statements, also confirming its support for the       initiative (press statements in       QUB REF archive).
Four pilot projects were established in 1998.
McEvoy       became a Board member       of the newly formed organisation Community Restorative Justice Ireland       (CRJI) and remains one.
The International Monitoring Commission (IMC), a body established by the       British and Irish       governments to assess the paramilitary ceasefires, concluded that while       one death occurred as a       result of a punishment beating in late 2007 involving IRA members, it was       un-authorised.
In 2009       the IMC further concluded that the IRA remained `on an exclusive         political path' and `where         individuals have engaged in violence or other crime (including against         perceived anti-social         behaviour) we believe they did so without sanction' (IMC 2009:10).
In         effect, no IRA sanctioned         punishment violence has occurred between 2008 and 2013.
At the time       of writing (2013) there are       now five projects operational in Belfast, one in Newry/South Armagh and a       further four in the Derry       area, processing approximately 1300 cases per year.
Given that the origins of the restorative justice projects lay in       dialogue with the IRA, they have been       the subject of extensive external review (e.g.
Criminal Justice       Inspectorate NI 2008, 2011).
As       evidenced by these inspection reports, the quality and value of their work       is now widely accepted.
[text removed for publication] also attest that ending punishment violence       would not have       happened without McEvoy's research.
As Harry Maguire, [text removed for       publication] (convicted       of the murder of two British Army Corporals at an IRA funeral in 1988 and       released early under the       Good Friday Agreement) and current Community Restorative Justice Ireland       Director confirmed       (letter);     "It was the process which Professor McEvoy and his colleagues engaged         in with Republicans &#8212;         known locally as the `Blue Book Process' &#8212; which ultimately led to the         creation of CRJI and the         creation of a non-violent alternative to punishment violence... the         Republican Movement could not         have delivered an end to punishment violence without having something         there in its place.
Community Restorative Justice was that alternative &#8212; a responsible and         progressive response to         crime and anti-social behaviour based upon restorative justice.
Of         course it required the         commitment of our activists to implement it, but the Blue Book written         by McEvoy and his         colleagues was the road map to the IRA ending punishment violence...         McEvoy's subsequent         research conducted on restorative justice, practice standards, human         rights protections, the role of         combatants and former combatants in peace-making and how to work with         the police while         retaining our community credibility has been absolutely crucial to the         successful development of         Community Restorative Justice in the North of Ireland, and to our         efforts to improve relations with         the PSNI.
We couldn't have done all of this without him, simple as         that."
Other than the engagement with the IRA and the involvement of [text removed for publication] as       staff and volunteers on the project, the other most challenging aspect of       these initiatives has been       their relationship with the formal justice system in general and the       police in particular.
The       historically poor relationships between sections of the       Catholic/Nationalist community and the       police was a key driver for the reform process instituted by the       Independent Commission on       Policing chaired by Lord Patten.
While a political deal on policing was       eventually concluded in May       2007 when Sinn F&#233;in took its seats on the Policing Board, both the police       and Republican leaders       emphasised that the quality and durability of the relationship between the       PSNI and Republican       communities would be judged by events on the ground.
Again successive       reports by the Criminal       Justice Inspectorate for Northern Ireland (CJINI), which are required in       order for the projects to       continue to receive mainstream statutory funding, have documented the       centrality of the CRJ       projects in developing good relationships with the Police (2008, 2011).
As       one recent CJINI report       indicated "Inspectors were told by senior police officers in West         Belfast and Derry/Londonderry that         they regard Community Restorative Justice Ireland as the           single most important relationship they           have in reaching out to the previously estranged or hard to reach           republican/nationalist           communities living in those areas" (CJINI 2011:11).
McEvoy's research has been identified by the       police as central to this impact.
As former RUC Assistant Chief Constable       Stephen White OBE       confirmed (letter);     "It is to his [McEvoy's] great credit and perseverance that today his         RJ efforts are widely         recognised as having been a major success in persuading the IRA to end         community         punishments... [A]nother major benefit which flowed from his work is the         promotion of better         relations with the police through CRJ.
Due to his personal and         professional efforts the progress         made in the area of community and police relationships has been truly         remarkable...The fact that         projects which have been spawned directly from his work include many         prominent former members         of the IRA, an organisation that spent 25 years trying to kill police         officers is, quite simply, a cause         for celebration...This work is of major strategic significance to the         police...the PSNI recognised         that they needed partners in Republican communities.
Those partners had         to have local credibility         but often their past made it difficult for the police.
The solution was         to focus on the work within the         projects and demonstrate that it was of high quality, lawful, human         rights compliant and         internationally and nationally respectable.
That is where the research         done by Professor McEvoy         was a key factor.
His research located these developments in the         international context and         provided a vision as to how, within CRJ projects, relations between the         police and the communities         could develop in the interests of both...In short, his research and         reputation helped give the police         the confidence to engage and to develop relationships on the ground...
In 2012 I agreed to join the         Board of Community Restorative Justice.
I now sit on that Board with         former IRA activists, helping         to further enhance police community relations in local Republican         communities, largely because of         Professor McEvoy and his work."
