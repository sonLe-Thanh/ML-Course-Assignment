     The new knowledge produced on the origins and spread of antimalarial drug       resistance has informed treatment policy in sub-Saharan Africa, and the       national and global response to reports of decreased sensitivity to       artemisinins on the Thai-Cambodia border.
There has been a reduction in       the availability of artemisinin monotherapies, one of the main drivers of       drug resistance, and in malaria morbidity and mortality on the       Thai-Cambodia border, but the main beneficiaries of successful containment       of artemisinin resistance will be future populations in malaria-endemic       countries.
Treatment policy in sub-Saharan Africa     Given her expertise, Roper was asked to serve in 2009 on the WHO Expert       Committee on Monitoring SP Resistance in the context of intermittent       preventive therapy in infants (IPTi), which produced recommendations which       informed WHO policy recommendation on the use of SP for IPTi produced in       2010.
5.1 5.2 Her evidence that resistance alleles are shared       amongst P.falciparum populations regionally underpins the use of dhps       mutation data from a single codon as proxy for high level resistance in       the recommendations.
The Global Malaria Programme Coordinator of Drug       Resistance and Containment confirms her `maps have been a useful guide'.5.3     Response to resistance on Thai-Cambodia border     DNA evidence of the previous spread of resistance from Asia and the       impact this had on child morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa       underpinned the urgent response by the malaria community to the threat       posed by the emergence of artemisinin resistance on the Thai-Cambodia       border.
The case was made by Nick White &#8212; Chairman of the WHO Global       Malaria Programme Technical Expert Group on the case management of malaria       &#8212; at early high-level discussions that fed into strategic thinking on how       to manage artemisinin resistance.5.4 The prevention of spread       through `containment' is central to WHO's 2011 Global Plan for Artemisinin       Resistance Containment (GPARC)5.5 in which Roper and Yeung are       named contributors.
LSHTM staff played a significant role in formulating the response to       artemisinin resistance, drawing on their technical understanding of the       determinants of the development of drug resistance gained through       literature reviews and modeling,3.5 and knowledge of the local       context gained from field studies.3.6 In January 2008, Yeung       served as temporary advisor at a WHO meeting that was rapidly convened to       review available evidence and discuss the immediate priorities for       response to the evidence of artemisinin tolerance.5.6 On behalf       of WHO, Yeung drafted the grant proposal to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates       Foundation (BMGF) in 2008 that resulted in the funding of the Artemisinin       Resistance Confirmation, Characterisation and Containment consortium       (ARC3c), which she subsequently led as Programme Coordinator.
The       consortium was a two-year programme coordinated by WHO and MORU and       involving the Ministries of Health of Cambodia and Thailand, Institut       Pasteur-Cambodia and the US Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical       Science (AFRIMS).
As coordinator, Yeung helped to convene a meeting in       Bangkok in February 2008 which issued a consensus statement recognising       the potential catastrophic consequences of failing to contain the emerging       tolerance and/or resistance and recommending efforts to eliminate malaria       in the region.5.7, 5.8     Yeung focused on the `containment' aspect of ARC3c, and played an       important role in drafting the key strategy documents and grant proposals       that resulted in funding and implementing the Artemisinin Resistance       Containment programme in 2009.5.8, 5.9 Formal and informal       meetings and briefings were held throughout, with a wide range of       stakeholders including Ministry of Health officials, donors, NGO partners,       researchers, public and private health care providers.
This process of       proactive engagement contributed to the successful development and       implementation of the strategy.
Yeung also directly facilitated the       switching of first-line drug in the epicenter of drug resistance in       Cambodia from a co-blistered ACT to a single tablet fixed-dose       combination, and also the introduction of a ban on the sale of oral       artemisinin monotherapies in 2009.
There has been a marked decline in the availability of oral artemisinin       monotherapies from around 40% of private outlets in 2007 to less than 5%       in 2011 according to the ACTWatch survey.
There has also been a large       reduction in incidence of both uncomplicated and severe malaria nationwide       but most marked in the `containment' zone.5.10 However there is       evidence that the efficacy of ACTs is continuing to decline.
A similar       containment programme has been implemented in Mynamar, and at a global       level, and these combined efforts have resulted in high levels of       awareness of the risk of artemisinin resistance and the need for urgent       action to prevent emergence and spread.5.5
