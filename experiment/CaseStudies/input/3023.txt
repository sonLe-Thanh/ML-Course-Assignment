     Introduction : Public engagement with our research has led to       impacts on the economy and on society, culture and creativity.
We have       stimulated public interest in science and engineering and inspired       thousands of schoolchildren by including our research in their education       programmes.
We achieve this impact through a strategic approach to       developing a high national and international media profile combined with a       purpose-built facility at Jodrell Bank to welcome visitors and engage them       directly with the actual research going on at the site.
This engagement       with live science and active researchers at a working observatory is a key       element in our delivering impact.
Another key element of our approach is       that the engagement programme is directed by designated members of staff &#8212;       currently Prof. Tim O'Brien (1999-date; Associate Director Jodrell Bank       Observatory) and Dr Teresa Anderson (2006-date; Director of Jodrell Bank       Discovery Centre) and, until 2007, Prof. Ian Morison (retired 2010).
Some       specific examples of this impact during 2008-13 are listed below.
The Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre : In April 2011 we opened a new       &#163;2.9M Discovery Centre (funded by external grants from the Regional       Development Agency and the European Regional Development Fund) replacing       remaining parts of the public science centre which had been on site since       the mid 1960's but reduced in size in 2003.
The new Centre has a broad       remit of enhancing public engagement with our research combined with       providing out-of-classroom education aimed at inspiring the next       generation of scientists and engineers.
From Jan 2008 to Jul 2013, 496,000       people visited the Centre.
From 2008 until it closed for rebuilding in Sep       2010, numbers were around 70-80,000 per year, but since re-opening in 2011       annual visitor numbers have risen to 128,000 (Aug 2012-Jul 2013).
(A)     Current exhibits highlight our research, including the work of the Lovell       Telescope, pulsars, e-MERLIN, the CMB, black holes, gravitational lensing,       the evolution of stars and the search for life.
The latest exhibit on the       science &amp; technology of Big Telescopes (including the work of VLT and       ALMA, and plans for E-ELT and SKA) will open in Oct 2013.
Our researchers       work closely with the Centre e.g.
in daily "Ask an Expert" talks/Q&amp;A       during school holidays (which have attracted 5,500 attendees from July       2011 to April 2013) and in public lectures such as the Lovell Lectures       (held every 2-3 months, each attracting sell-out audiences of around 125).
(A)     The Centre was awarded Tourism Attraction of the Year by Marketing       Cheshire in 2012 (B).
Evidence of impact of our activities at the Centre       can be found in a consistent appetite for our events and exhibitions       throughout the REF period (note visitors paying for entrance provide a       current annual income of around &#163;600,000 which is ploughed back into the       Centre and its operations), audience growth at the new Centre (from 94,000       visitors in first full year 2011/12 to 128,000 in 2012/13), positive       feedback and repeat visits from schools and the general public.
For       example, 82% of visitors rate the quality of the venue and the content of       the exhibition as good or very good; whilst in a Girls Night Out event       targeted at young women, 91% said they were more interested after the       event whilst 94% said they'd come again; quotes include "My 12 year old       loved it, as did I"; "It was extremely exciting and when I go back to       school it will help me with my studying".
A national online survey carried       out by Harris International in 2008 showed that 54% of the UK population       recognise Jodrell Bank as a UK science facility &#8212; a `brand' recognition       unparalleled amongst active UK science centres and indicative of the       impact of our public engagement.
Another Harris survey in 2012 found 76%       of our visitors are very likely or absolutely certain to recommend a visit       to friends (C).
Music &amp; Science &#8212; Live from Jodrell Bank : New audiences are       engaged with our research in innovative events such as the Live from       Jodrell Bank music/science festivals.
The first event in July 2011       attracted 5,000 people from the UK and beyond, in 2012 this increased to       12,000.
In 2013 we held the event over two weekends in July and August.
The first on July 6/7 attracted a total of about 12,000 attendees.
Aimed       at reaching out to a different audience, postcode analysis of ticket       holders showed 65% of the attendees travelled further than 60 miles       (including some from overseas), whereas 94% of our usual visitors come       from within 60 miles.
Alongside the Music Arena with the main stage we       also have a Science Arena which showcases Jodrell Bank research with       exhibitions and talks from our researchers, as well as others from the UK       community, including STFC, IoP, RCUK and the Wellcome Trust.
Our research       is also delivered from the main stage between bands by Prof. O'Brien.
This       includes descriptions of scientific results from use of the Jodrell       telescopes and, in 2012, a live video link to the telescope platform at       the VLT in Chile.
For the 2013 event, although 68% of people had primarily       come to see the bands, 81% of people surveyed said they had learnt       something about science whilst 87% would definitely visit Jodrell Bank       again (D).
Live From Jodrell Bank 2011 was awarded Best Outdoor Event at the       national Event Awards in 2012; the 2012 event received an award for       `Extreme Creativity' from a panel of industry judges at the 2012 UK       Festival Awards for its extra activity of integrating science into the       music event (E).
Job creation &amp; economic impact of tourism : As of July 2013,       26 jobs have been directly created in the new Discovery Centre (6 of them       specifically for science engagement &amp; education), plus 7 have been       safeguarded and more will follow both directly and indirectly.
As part of       the funding process, the Regional Development Agency commissioned an       assessment from EKOS (economic &amp; social development consultants) which       found the Centre is likely to provide an additional &#163;27M economic impact       to the region over the decade from opening in 2011 i.e.
~&#163;6M over the REF       period (F).
Although no similar analyses exist, the economic impact of       visitors during 2008-11 will also have been significant.
Education &amp; inspiration : During the REF period 2008-2013,       43,000 pupils have visited Jodrell Bank as part of school groups, taking       part in workshops relating to our research and targeted at the curriculum.
The new programme, launched in Sep 2012, attracted 13,000 pupils in its       first year and also includes teacher-training and short courses for       adults.
97% of teachers rate these sessions as either good or excellent.
We also regularly deliver talks and workshops in schools; targeting       disadvantaged schools in particular.
For example, we reached around 1500       Cumbrian pupils in an outreach event in 2010 alongside one of our research       conferences (A).
Media impact : Jodrell Bank research has attracted the attention       of the media for many years stimulated in part by our active publicity       programme.
From 2008, we have produced more than 80 press releases and       news items (available on our website) and, from monthly Google News       searches, there were over 1,500 mentions of Jodrell Bank in print and web       news stories (G).
TV producers in particular have been attracted to our work, resulting in       our scientists and facilities appearing many times in a wide range of       programmes.
The most significant recent example is the incredibly       successful BBC2 "Stargazing Live" series broadcast from       Jodrell Bank in Jan 2011, 2012 and 2013.The programme typically attracts       over 3 million viewers on each night of 3 consecutive nights, remarkable       for a science subject.
In 2012, it was the most viewed programme on BBC       Two, Channel 4 or Channel 5 during the week of transmission and its       audience share was 53% higher than the timeslot average (H).
The programme       always features our research and technology (e.g.
pulsars, starburst       galaxies, radio jets, masers, SETI, e-MERLIN and SKA).
The impact has been       clear: many positive reviews; astronomy equipment was reported as selling       out in major retailers; a record-breaking 2.3 million downloads of the BBC       Stargazing Guide; in 2011, 3,800 viewer photos and 5,000 questions were       submitted; the website had 450,000 views; 13,000 people took part in       interactive chat; 40,000 people attended 330 linked events nationwide; and       astronomy societies reported significant boosts in membership and website       traffic (H).
Podcast : A popular feature of our outreach programme is "The       Jodcast", a twice-monthly podcast which has been produced since Jan 2006       by a team primarily composed of research students.
The show features news,       interviews with our researchers and others, and audience Q&amp;A .
There       have been more than 170 episodes and special programmes, including reports       from National Astronomy Meetings and occasional video episodes (e.g.
featuring e-MERLIN and LOFAR).
The shows are regularly downloaded by over       4,000 listeners (this is a lower limit as it does not include syndicated       outlets such as astronomy.fm).
When surveyed in 2010, 95% of 195       respondents said they would recommend it to others, 85% said that it had       increased their interest in astronomy, whilst 94% said they had learnt       something worthwhile.
Quotes include "The interviews are my favourite part       because you talk to an expert at length rather than editing them down to       short sound bites"; "You always inspire and intrigue".

World Heritage Site : In 2011, Jodrell Bank Observatory was added       to the UK Tentative List for World Heritage Site status demonstrating a       major societal impact of our research.
The panel recognised that the site       is "impressive tangible evidence of a major modern scientific development       which has greatly enlarged human understanding of the Universe" (J).
Conclusion : Our aim with the programme of public engagement from       Jodrell Bank is to harness the strong public interest in curiosity-driven       research by directly engaging them with scientific research at a major UK       facility, providing a legacy for decades by inspiring a wide audience       including the scientists and engineers of the future.
