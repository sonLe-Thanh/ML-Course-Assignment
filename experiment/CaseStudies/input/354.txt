       The first UK child protection clinical guidelines       The Cardiff systematic reviews have directly informed five national         guidelines in the field child `protection:                The first NICE evidence-based maltreatment guidelines (2009)[5.1].
The first joint guidelines published by the Royal College of           Radiology and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) in           2008.
As a direct consequence of these guidelines, skeletal surveys           now routinely include oblique views of the ribs for all children in           the UK under the age of two years where physical abuse is suspected           [5.2].
The RCPCH Child Protection Companion &#8212; the clinical guidance for           all paediatricians (2006) across UK and the second edition of the           Companion (Kemp co-edited), published in 2013, to include evidence           from all 21 of CCPSR's systematic reviews [5.3].
National standards for ophthalmological examination in suspected           abusive head trauma (2013).
The Royal College of Ophthalmologists were           preparing guidelines as of July 2013.
`Child Protection and the Dental Team: an introduction to             safeguarding children in dental practice' published 2006,           updated in 2009 with new developments in the Cardiff research.
This           live document accessible online (and supported by a website) was           commissioned by the Department of Health and distributed to all dental           practitioners in the UK to highlight their role and responsibility in           child safeguarding, with information on how to recognise suspected           child abuse or neglect [5.4].
National compulsory training programme       Cardiff's evidence base informs the national child protection training         programme which meets the Intercollegiate National Safeguarding six         levels of competences.
This training is delivered to all healthcare         staff across the UK.
Cardiff's research informs the training manuals         [5.3] for the RCPCH/NSPCC/ALSG training programmes at:                Level 2: Child Protection Recognition and Response (accessed by 400           trainers and 4000 trained health practitioners who work with children)           [5.7].
Level 3: Child Protection in Practice (1700 Child protection           clinicians registered).
Since 2008 Kemp and Maguire have also delivered over 100 invited         lectures to present CCPSR findings and recommendations, reaching an         estimated 15-20,000 child protection practitioners in the UK, Europe and         US.
International reach &#8212; online training and information resources       The publication of national guidelines and the delivery of compulsory         training into evidence-based clinical assessment of child abuse has         embedded Cardiff's research into UK clinical child protection practice.
Since 2008 the Cardiff group has also disseminated its findings to         professionals and practitioners through the Core-Info website         (www.core-info.cf.ac.uk) which hosts the findings from the 21 systematic         reviews and meta-analyses that are updated annually.
Commenting on         Core-Info, the former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and         Child Health noted: "This resource does not only allow easy access           for improved clinical decision-making, the evidence base also           underpins improved expert evidence in courts around the world"         [5.7].
The influence of Cardiff's work has also been highlighted by the         American Academy of Pediatrics [5.6].
Core-Info analytics show that the website is used by 100,000 health         professionals, social workers, law enforcement, the judiciary and         researchers from 40 countries annually.
A recent survey of child         protection paediatricians in the UK and Australia confirms that         Core-Info is used by 60% of these professionals to inform clinical         decisions, provide continuing professional development and education         material, inform legal reports and give scientific validation to expert         opinion.
It is considered to be "one of the most important           developments in the field, supporting better clinical decision making,           training and expert opinion in court, and increasing overall           confidence of paediatricians" [5.5].
Six Core-Info leaflets developed jointly by the Cardiff team and the         NSPCC (2007-2013) translate key research findings into practice for         allied professionals in child protection.
Since 2008, approximately         200,000 hard copies (plus numerous downloaded copies) have been sold to         non-specialists who work with, or come into contact, with children.
The         Core-Info leaflets are regularly updated to reflect the latest evidence         and are widely used for national training (Levels 1-2) and as a quick         reference source for health visitors, social services, general         practitioners and police.
Impact on practitioners and services &#8212; an evidence base for clinical           practice       As a consequence of the wide-spread national and international         dissemination of CCPSR's research findings through national guidelines         and training, child health professionals now base assessments, diagnoses         and court evidence on scientifically informed and clinically validated         models and practices.
The significance of this shift in practice is         summarised by the National Clinical Director for Children at the         Department of Health: "This work is at the forefront in supporting           evidence based practice in a sensitive clinical field of great           importance" [5.8].
The evidence base provided by the Cardiff group has helped child         protection professionals and expert witnesses to re-establish trust.
The         standardised evidence-based practice means that convictions in court and         child-protection interventions are more reliable, with a lower         likelihood of wrongful convictions.
Impact on child health and welfare       The ultimate beneficiaries of this work are the children who are being         abused.
Through the adoption of national guidelines and the         implementation of standardised evidence-based practice across the UK, it         is now more likely that abuse will be recognised and appropriately         investigated and abused children are more likely to be protected from         future harm.
The Deputy High Court Judge in the Family Division and Recorder in the         Crown and County Court states that one of the major benefits of         Cardiff's work has been the improvement in the scientific validation and         quality of expert opinion presented in Family and Criminal Child         Protection Court Cases, in particular the eradication of police and         paediatricians using colour to estimate the age of a bruise [5.9].
In 2013 the CCPSR group won the BMJ Child Health Team of the Year in         the BMJ Improving Health Awards [5.10].
