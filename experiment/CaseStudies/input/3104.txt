Personal Budgets in social care and health care     Personal Budgets in Social Care were introduced in 2008.
The national       evaluation of the Individual       Budgets pilot projects (The "IBSEN" Report [4]), undertaken by the UoM       team in collaboration with       other social care research centres, informed the development and       implementation of national       policy on the individualisation of care within adult social care services.
This research influenced and fed into national and local policy       development through meetings of       the research team with Ministers and policy makers.
The former is       evidenced in the White Paper       Shaping the Future of Care Together (Cm 7673, 2009) and the       documents Personal Budgets for         Older People: Making it happen (S2) and A Vision for Adult         Social Care: Capable Communities and         Active Citizens (S3).
The direction of the policy was altered as a       direct consequence of our       research findings, most notably in the care of older people.
New DH       guidance was issued       indicating the use of approaches derived from our earlier case management       research, with the       option of care manager held budgets for older people (S1, S2).
Reach and significance of the impact            The IBSEN evaluation [4] prompted a specific Government response to         the findings for         implementation of Individual Budgets, particularly with older people,         and continues to be a         focus of Government concern in policy delivery (S1-S3).
Upon completion         of the pilots, the DH         invested &#163;520m in a national roll-out.
Since personal budgets are now to         become the norm,         this is relevant to all people in receipt of social care.
In 2011-12         this involved over 1.2 million         people in England (800,000 plus over 65 years) with an expenditure of         &#163;6.6 billion spent on         community care.
Currently, &#163;3.3 billion is allocated through personal         budgets reaching 76% of         all currently eligible adult social care users (ADASS Survey, 2013).
The IBSEN evaluation continues to influence the Government's policy         agenda, with the         research findings forming part of the evidence supporting the recent         White Paper Caring for           our Future (Cm 8373, 2012 - impact assessment) (2012) contributing         to the calculation and         assessment of the likely costs and benefits of policy expansion.
The IBSEN evaluation was critical to the development of wider         Government policies, most         notably the introduction of the Individual Budget principles in health         care.
The published policy         document announcing the piloting of new Personal Health Budgets used the         evaluation         findings to support its case for the policy, in addition to highlighting         concerns raised by IBSEN         over implementation with respect to older people (S4).
The IBSEN evaluation was used to underpin key elements of the Work and         Pensions White         Paper `Raising Expectations and Increasing Support' (Cm 7506,         2008) in providing the         evidence base to support the Right to Control trial.
This         initiative sought to integrate multiple         benefit and funding streams into a single budget under the control of         the recipient.
The IBSEN evaluation informed the House of Commons Health Select         Committee's         investigation into the social care system in 2009.
The final report         reproduced summary findings         within the main text and also used IBSEN data to raise concerns with         respect to age         discrimination in social care (S2, S4) (Cm 7673).

National Strategies to improve dementia services in         England and internationally     The UoM team's research exploring the range of community support       available for people with       dementia has informed policy and implementation of dementia care in       England, Ireland, France       and the Netherlands.
The roll out of Objective 6 of the National         Dementia Strategy in England (S6),       Community and Personal Support, was influenced through dissemination of       our findings to policy       makers.
Reach and significance of the impact            The evaluation of case management for older people suffering from         dementia was cited in the         National Dementia Strategy (S6) as providing evidence of the         value of early diagnosis and         intervention to improve quality of life and delay or prevent unnecessary         admission into care         homes (p34).
The team also advised a special meeting of the French Fondation           Plan           Alzheimer (sic) in Paris on developing case management in Dementia         Care in 2010 (S9), and         also the Netherlands Institute for Long Term Care (Vilans) in 2007.
Research examining the relative merits of different approaches to the         provision of home care         for people with dementia informed the DH Commissioning Pack for early         intervention and         prevention in the delivery of community personal support.
It is located         on the DH website         http://dementia.dh.gov.uk/contracting-community-support-services/         and the summary findings         from this study are also to be found on several local NHS Commissioning         websites.
It is also         cited in the policy document Case for Change &#8212; Community Based           Services for People Living           with Dementia (S7) and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on         Dementia (S8) inquiry into cost         effective dementia services.
The work is also used extensively in the         planning document of the         Dementia Strategy for Ireland (S10).
