     The development of the SuBETool has shaped the terms of sustainable       master-planning debates.
As theoretically informed, collaborative, applied       research, use of the tool has been disseminated to developer, government       and policy actors, who are direct and indirect beneficiaries.
Specifically, the impact has shaped theory and practice through (section       5: 3,4,8,9,10):            re-framing sustainability assessment methodologies and         master-planning;       setting new benchmarks and standards for sustainability, guiding         planning and design decision making processes for large and medium size         development;       informing the wider community of the benefits of master-planning         processes for different locations and contexts; in particular aiding         understanding of the significance of assessing sustainable         master-planning;       developing an integrated approach linking sustainability assessment         and master-planning with Key Performance Indicators for environmental,         social, cultural and economic factors;       demonstrating innovation in the use of an adaptable framework designed         to allow different regions to set relevant priorities and rating         systems;       strengthening academic-industry partnering relations.
The development of the SuBETool has gone through two phases to date.
The       level of impact has increased as the research matured.
Diverse,       complementary strategies were designed to enhance public, industry and       government awareness of the SuBETool (version 1).
These included       dissemination through traditional web-based and professional publications,       academic symposia, engagement with key professional groups, industry and       government bodies, and industrial advisory panels (section 5:       1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).
Between the start of the research in 2008 and SuBETool's first pilot case       study in 2009 [Milan], AlWaer gave interim reports to organisations and       professionals and disseminated early conclusions in several international       conference/summit talks on sustainable master-planning.
As a direct       consequence of this exposure, a series of workshops were run by AlWaer at       Hilson Moran (2009).
The Director of Sustainability at Hilson Moran       identified the potential of taking the work further in relation to the       firm's master-planning activities.
Three principal collaborators (AlWaer,       Clements-Croome, Hilson Moran) subsequently developed the tool (Section 5:       1,8).
Hilson Moran adopted the SuBETool framework (version 1) as one of the       main protocols for large developments; namely: a major master-plan in       Milan (2009) and the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy in       Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (2010).
Version 2 (SuBETool) was then applied to the       Greenwich Peninsular mixed use development, adjacent to the Millennium       Dome (2011).
Hilson Moran is committed to applying SuBETool to its       master-planning activities to assess the sustainability of new       developments, and the SuBETool team [Husam Al Waer, Derek Clements-Croome,       Hilson Moran] are developing version 3: http://www.hilsonmoran.com/sectors/urban-regeneration/       (Section 5: 1,8).
The SuBETool framework has led to changes in professional practice       relating to designing and planning for large and medium size master plans,       nationally and internationally.
Based on the success of SuBETool, Scott       Brownrigg has developed their own method to assess the sustainability       performance of potential development land, called the Sustainability       Appraisal for Land Development (SALD).
It enables the practice's       integrated master-planning, urban design and planning team to provide a       robust site analysis service for both local authorities and private       landowners.
It is inspired by the BREEAM Communities, LEED Neighbourhood       Development and SuBETool methods: http://www.scottbrownrigg.com/design_research_unit/research_activities/sald/       (Section 5: 2,9,10).
The research has had broader impact within the construction industry       evidenced by AlWaer's invitation to sit on the steering committee of the       master-planning group at Hilson Moran since 2008.
These close       academic-industry relations extend the profile of the Framework and its       innovative contribution to thinking about the master-planning process.
A number of inquiries from national and international organisations and       firms have been received for adapting the tool and applying it to new       contexts (Section 5: 9,10).
The Building Research Environment (BRE)       offered to accredit the Framework as one of the world's leading assessment       tools for sustainable master-planning.
ADAM Architecture, leading       practitioners of contextual urbanism in Europe, expressed interest in       using the SuBETool.
As part of our impact strategy, SuBETool has been disseminated by Alwaer       to (Section 5: 3,4,8,9,10):     - The World Future Energy Summit, Abu Dhabi 2009 and 2011.
