     The W3C standard [A] is of direct benefit to practitioners, as can be       seen from the corroborating evidence and the involvement in the standard's       development by companies and NGOs.
The standard and supporting research       outputs, such as the methodology work led by KCL, allow organisations to       adapt their systems in order to document and analyse their processes, or       to incorporate such functionality into the software they produce for their       customers.
Working backwards from the impact to the underpinning research,       the following summarises how the former was derived from the latter, and       explains Dr Miles' involvement at each stage.
Impact: The W3C standard on provenance (PROV) [A, B], is being       implemented, extended and included in applications by a range of       commercial, governmental and other organisations with use cases regarding       the provenance of their data eg:     (i) Oracle [C]: "Until PROV, one of the hugest problems we faced was         maintaining transaction audit trails in a heterogeneous environment in a         standard and compatible way.
Audit trails are described with literally         millions of different formats in different organizations.
This used to         mean it was impossible to create a single audit time line.
PROV solves         this problem.
We now provide (and consume) a PROV feed that unifies the         audit trails generated by transactions across heterogeneous systems."
(ii) NASA [D]: "Earth Science Data Systems across NASA play a         critical role in data processing and analysis of NASA datasets.
However,         there is a growing need to provide the provenance of these datasets as         scientists increasingly need to assess the lineage of the data products         to improve their understanding and trust of the science results.
Lessons         learned from Climategate show that there is public demand for more         transparency and understanding in the science process.
Science data         systems are key to enabling the capture, management, and use of         production provenance information....
The W3C Provenance Working Group         ... standard is very general, intended to support the breadth of any         domain.
To better serve the needs of specific domain communities, the         standard has several built in points of extensibility.
This working         group will participate in efforts to develop an Earth Science PROV         Extension (PROV-ES)."
(iii) IBM [E]: "We don't know whether the information we find on the         Web is accurate or not.
The Dublin Core model describes a resource for         the purpose of discovery.
The W3C PROV model describes entities and         processes involved in producing and delivering that resource."
(iv) German Aerospace Centre [F], who use the PrIMe methodology [1],       taking OPM [A] as their provenance model.
The primary evidence for this lies in the results of a survey conducted       by the W3C group, during the final stage of the standardisation, examining       implementations and applications of the PROV standard.
There were already       66 such implementations at that time (April 2013).
The implementers       include large commercial organisations (e.g.
Oracle), SMEs, and academic       institutions from around the world.
This survey was conducted before the       specifications became recommendations (official standards), so captures       only the pioneering implementers [G].
Dr Miles was an Invited Expert to       the W3C Working Group on provenance.
He is co-editor of one of the       specifications produced, a primer [3] which provides the introductory       steps for those wishing to understand and adopt PROV.
He is also a       contributor to many of the other specifications, including the core data       model for representing provenance data, PROV-DM, on which the other       specifications are grounded.
Connection to underpinning research: Standards are, by nature, a       collaborative community effort, bringing together adequately mature       state-of-the-art to create a published specification which the world can       rely on to be stable.
However, the standards are directly influenced and,       in some cases, derived from research activities in which Dr Miles led,       co-led or was a major contributor.
W3C Incubator Group.
In order for a W3C working group to be       established, the need for a standard and the maturity of the       state-of-the-art must each be established.
This is achieved through an       `incubator group'.
Dr Miles was involved in the incubator group for       provenance throughout its operation (2009-2010).
In particular, he led the       activity of collecting and curating use cases from a variety of       applications and projects, so demonstrating the need for provenance and       the scope of the requirements.
These use cases are available online [H]and       a related publication later drew together these requirements into some       illustrative scenarios [4].
The research of the incubator group produced       the definition of the standards the working group would create [5].
Open Provenance Model.
Prior to and in parallel to the       incubator group, an international community effort was underway to       interconnect different approaches to provenance.
This ultimately resulted       in the Open Provenance Model [A], a widely used de facto standard       until W3C PROV was developed.
One piece of evidence for the popularity of       OPM comes from its citations, 242 on Google Scholar Citations when last       checked.
The influence of OPM on PROV is direct: PROV takes the same core       model and approach as OPM.
Where OPM is founded on describing past       processes in terms of `artifacts', `processes' and `agents', PROV's data       model core is the semantically almost identical `entities', `activities'       and `agents'.
Dr Miles was a co-author of OPM.
Methodology.
One of the key distinct contributions of KCL       to the international efforts in provenance research lies in methodology,       i.e.
how to design or adapt distributed applications so that provenance       data is recorded that will allow users' questions to later be answered.
The W3C primer is the latest incarnation of this effort, but it is founded       on earlier work.
In particular, Dr Miles led the development of the first       (and currently only) software engineering methodology for adapting       existing applications to meet provenance requirements, PrIMe [1].
Provenance Challenges.
OPM was itself the outcome of prior       research activities: the Provenance Challenges.
These were exercises in       which research teams from around the world, both academic and commercial,       applied their approaches to provenance to a single problem to allow       comparison and establishment of a mutual understanding.
The Second       Provenance Challenge, held in late 2007, compared data models used in       these approaches, and the concluding workshop for the challenge was the       start of the development of OPM.
Dr Miles co-chaired the workshop as well       as co-devising the challenge exercise itself.
The minutes of the challenge       workshop, and participating teams are available [I], together with record       of the resulting release of OPM [J].
Requirements.
The requirements capture work of the       incubator group and the methodology research described above drew on       earlier work led by Dr Miles into provenance requirements, and techniques       for their capture.
In particular, a study was conducted to understand       provenance requirements across scientific disciplines (e.g.
bioinformatics, particle physics, chemistry, proteomics, medicine), which       influenced much future work in the field of provenance [2].
