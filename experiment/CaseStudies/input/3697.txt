     The technological developments of the GAMS system that underpin Virtual         VJ have resulted in       commercial benefits, as well as increasing the knowledge and access to       innovative interactive art       forms for artists, academics and technologists at international       institutions.
Virtual VJ creates       opportunity for a high degree of audience participation, enhancing the       cultural experience of public       and specialists audiences.
Virtual VJ has been exhibited at internationally significant       venues which showcase innovative       research to Human Computing Interaction specialists and a wider audience.
These have proved       successful dissemination vehicles for Gibson's research, but more       importantly have allowed       international artists, academics and students to use the technology and to       explore its opportunities       in their own practice.
During 2011, Gibson exhibited Virtual VJ at CHI at Emily Carr       University of Art + Design in       Vancouver, Canada, and at the Jade Valley in X'ian, China.
The Vancouver       audience comprised       200 professional designers, artists and academics (from interactive art,       computer human-interaction       and interactive media design).
The X'ian audience, approximately 500,       included local       political figures and high profile business people, as well as artists       from X'ian Academy of Fine       Arts.
At these venues, audiences benefited from an opportunity to directly       interact with the piece in       real-time and influenced the creation of a unique live interactive       environment.
The organiser in       Vancouver stated: "Virtual VJ ... directly impacted the         perception of interactive art by the general         public."
Audience members were invited to perform using the       motion-trackers and gain a direct       sense of how motion-tracking can be used to control simultaneous media       with their bodies.
This       exposed the audience members to innovative ideas about art and interactive       experiences,       especially participative art forms.
The next version of the project exhibited at Jade Valley was the       culmination of a week-long       workshop which Gibson held at Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts (XAFA) where       there are no courses in       interactive design or new media.
This was the students' first exposure to       the motion-tracking       technology and their first opportunity to use it to change their artistic       practice and to create their       own interactive projects.
The XAFA students gained awareness,       understanding and practice from       developing these interactive design projects.
Gibson's research has had an international impact on artists, influencing       the design of interactive,       immersive environments.
An artist commenting on a piece of work he       produced in 2011 stated how       he was influenced by Gibson's research, "I was inspired by the concept         of Virtual VJ that a         participator's body gestures can be the interface to control audio and         video materials, and to         explore the spatial and corresponding relationship between humans, space         and diverse media.
GAMS was the key technology used in Light &amp; Shadow, which is not         only a simple interactive         installation, but also an experiment of re-interpreting traditional         culture via digital technology."
The Virtual VJ project was later performed in May 2013 at Digital       Art Weeks in Singapore in an       event sponsored by ETH Zurich.
The primary collaborator for this project       describes the impact on       the Value Lab Asia: "Working with a motion-tracking system for physical         and gestural live visuals         control has helped to add a new scale of dynamics to live animated         content, making content itself         an immersive gesture, similar to a lighting system and disconnected from         projection screen.
In         addition, the first exhibitions coincided with the early design phase of         the Value Lab Asia ... the         experience collected during these exhibitions considerably influenced         several of the principal         design features of the Value Lab Asia."
The statement above corroborates the beneficial changes made to this       high-value facility as a       result of Gibson's research-practice.
Value Lab Asia (VLA) is a digitally       augmented media-enriched       collaborative environment, equipped with several touch surfaces and a very       high-resolution video       wall, located at the Singapore National Research Foundation.
It has a wide       range of applications       such as participatory planning and design, information visualisation and       discovery and remote       conferencing: for example, it is used as a transmedia workshop space,       where an audio-visual       organiser supports participants using voice, tweet and       audio-visualisation, to engage with each       other and with live audio-enabled visuals on the wall of multiple       touch-responsive screens.
The commercial impacts of Gibson's work with the GAMS systems has helped       Acoustic Positioning       Research (APR Inc), a company based in Edmonton Canada, to improve the       quality of the GAMS       system and sell more of them.
These benefits are described by the       President of APR and the       inventor of the Gesture And Media System (GAMS): "Dr. Gibson's work has         helped APR         significantly ... it has improved the quality of the GAMS ... due to his         early-adopter bug finding and         suggestions for both incremental improvements and significantly         different and innovative         functionalities; it has helped sell systems by providing documented         examples of engaging,         performative and public-interactive use; it has inspired our engineers,         confirming and exemplifying         the original integrated-media vision of GAMS technology; ... and         applicable in matters reaching far         beyond the world of media entertainment."
