     To date, the research has been used to inform the development of a       `one-stop-shop' approach to victims' provision; has led to a feasibility       study of provision of a pension for victims of the Troubles; generated a       discussion about definitions of injury which is now recognised as an area       by policy makers and politicians that requires further research and       consensus building; and has been used by the Campaign for All Injured       conducted by the WAVE injured group, to advance the cause of all injured       people.
Mr Ian Paisley Junior, MP expressed an interest in attempting to       arrive at a consensual definition of injury, although in order to succeed,       work of this nature has to be cross-party in Northern Ireland.
The research was initially disseminated at a public lecture on March 8th,       at the University of Surrey, chaired and introduced by Baron Alderdice who       made the following opening remarks:     "Marie brings very particular skills and approaches to her work.
In         politics, there is an interesting division between academics and         practitioners...
There were in Northern Ireland a small number of         academicians who tried to engage with the reality of politics, Padraig         O'Malley working out of Boston... and Marie working with people and         communities who were going through very traumatic experiences... her         work has been substantial and significant because she brings together         the research side and the big P and small P of politics... She has         relentlessly pursued the truth &#8212; this is a dangerous occupation and         Marie has had to face on occasion considerable attack from people who         were not at all happy about some of the things that were coming to the         fore..." Recorded video of Baron Alderdice's opening remarks.
Surrey's research has influenced political debate and policy making as       evidenced by:            Testimonial by the Research Officer at the Commission for Victims and         Survivors setting out how the research findings will be used to as a         reference point for decisions on the delivery of services for the         injured and their families.
The detailed research findings were         presented to a meeting of academic advisors, the sponsors and         representatives of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister on         Friday April 6th, 2012 in Belfast.
Testimonial from Ian Paisley Jnr, MP, MLA who, following a meeting         with him on 17th May 2012, at which he was briefed on the current study         and the lack of a robust definition of injury has undertaken to support         further research on this.
The influence of Surrey's research in the political sphere, led to the       invitation to participate in further engagement, and in turn improving the       public understanding of the issue:            A Policy briefing for the new Commission for Victims and Survivors         when the new Victims' Commissioner took office, took place on 10th         December 2012 in Windsor House, Belfast.
The outputs of this research were presented, alongside a petition         organised by the Campaign for Recognition of Injured People advocating         improved services, to the relevant government ministries in Westminster         and to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 17th May, 2012.
This involved a         meeting with Naomi Long MP in Portcullis House, Westminster, a meeting         with Vernon Coaker, Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,         Member of Parliament for Gedling, (Labour) a meeting with Lord         Alderdice, Northern Ireland Member of the House of Lords, (Liberal         Democrat) a meeting with Gavin Williamson, Permanent Private Secretary         in the Northern Ireland Office, Member of Parliament for South         Staffordshire,( Conservative) a meeting with Margaret Ritchie, Member of         Parliament for South Down, SDLP, a meeting with Laurence Robertson ,         Chair of Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Member of Parliament for         Tewkesbury, Conservative.
The media campaign described in point 2 coincided with a Press Launch         in the Limb Centre in Musgrave Park Hospital, Belfast where Professor         Breen-Smyth presented the findings to the press.
A series of individual briefings and meetings for Westminster MPs took         place in Portcullis House, attended by a range of MPs interested in         conflict related injury or in Northern Ireland.
The work has also been disseminated at the June 2012 conference of the         Royal Geographical Society.
An invitation was received from the British Red Cross to present the         study at their London conference on resilience on 11th April,         2013.
This conference is aimed at community groups, voluntary         organisations, university and government bodies and members of the         public, who have an understanding of what conditions make individuals         and communities more resilient.
