     The output of Price's research fellowship was a video intended for       presentation to audiences as a gallery- or museum-based installation.
The       first iteration of the film called Choir (Parts 1 &amp; 2) was       shown in 2011 at Chisenhale (London), Edinburgh Art Festival, New Museum       (New York) and the Bielefelder Kunstverein.
The film attracted positive       media attention with reviews appearing in the Guardian, Wire, Art Monthly,       thisistomorrow and Frieze, and Price was named Artist of the Week by Skye       Sherwin in the Guardian on 21 July 2011[i].
Price used the proceeds from the sale of three editions of Choir         (Parts 1 &amp; 2) to fund the third and final chapter of the       narrative and the completed work was retitled THE WOOLWORTHS CHOIR OF         1979.
THE WOOLWORTHS CHOIR OF 1979 was one of three films       that featured in Price's solo exhibition HERE, which was held at       the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead in spring 2012[ii].
It was this exhibition that gained her the nomination for the Turner Prize       2012, which the artist went on to win with a showing of THE WOOLWORTHS         CHOIR OF 1979 at Tate Britain in winter 2012-13[iii].
Adrian Searle, art critic for the Guardian wrote that the Turner Prize       2012 exhibition was `one of the most demanding and thoughtful       [exhibitions] in the show's history'[iv].
THE WOOLWORTHS CHOIR OF 1979 has had an enormous reach both       nationally and internationally.
Total visitor numbers for HERE       were 126,735.
As a point of reference, only 25,000 more people visited the       Turner Prize exhibition when the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art hosted       it in 2011[1].
The total number of visits to the Turner       Prize exhibition at Tate Britain in 2012-13 was 70,547, up by 20,000 on       the Turner Prize 2010, when Tate Britain last hosted it.
Analysis showed       that it attracted a young audience of regular visitors with specialist art       knowledge, but that a quarter of visitors were new to Tate Britain[2].The       BALTIC show attracted a similarly young audience mainly from the local       area, but it also brought in lots of new visitors to the gallery many of       whom had no specialist knowledge of contemporary art[v].
The Turner Prize exhibition and announcement were covered by all the       major British and European newspapers[3].
The ceremony       was transmitted live on Channel 4 television (BARB reports an average       daily reach of 13.2 million viewers for that date[vi])       and Price's work attracted massive social media attention with over 26,000       tweets bringing it to enormous audiences.
Counting only the Twitter       accounts with over 50,000 followers, comments on Price's Turner Prize win       were distributed to over 15.5 million followers[2].
Through all this exposure Price's work has had a huge influence on the       public awareness and appreciation of contemporary art and the coverage of       her win in the print and broadcast media and online has had a demonstrable       impact on opinion formers, expert and public audiences as described below.
Analysis of Tate Britain visitor feedback reveals that THE WOOLWORTHS         CHOIR OF 1979 provoked comments mostly about its emotive subject       matter and the manner in which the film was installed[3].
The BALTIC Bites podcast of an interview with Price, which has been viewed       over 8,000 times on YouTube, generated similarly engaged comments e.g.
`Saw this last April.
Probably the most immersive, evocative installation       I've ever seen.
The use of sound, darkness and high definition film is       just awe-inspiring' and `Yes there is a lot of bullshit in art, but the       thing is, this is not an example of it...
The quality of [Price's] work is       very high, both conceptually, technically, aesthetically... Really       powerful stuff to experience...'[vii].The Turner Prize       YouTube video was viewed over 10,000 times between December 2012 and July       2013 and the newspaper coverage attracted a lot of reader comments e.g.
Guardian features writer @kiracochrane tweeted `Elizabeth Price wins the       Turner Prize &#8212; her Woolworth's Choir of 1979 video is brilliant, well       worth seeing if you can.
'[viii]     THE WOOLWORTHS CHOIR OF 1979 has had a significant impact on       audiences for reasons relating to the artist's choice of subject matter       and juxtaposition of content.
Price's skilful editing of still and moving       images, graphics and sound has allowed her to bring together seemingly       disparate elements in the service of a coherent story.
One Guardian reader       commented online `I think this is the crux of it, and why [the film] works       in my opinion.
The slick presentation and assertive insistence of the       text.
The way the content collides and collapses.
There is an unsettling       cadence to it all, it makes for disturbing viewing.
'[ix]      While the work has attracted the esteem of industry professionals, it has       also proved to be extremely popular in the eyes of the general public.
Twitter users commented `Very pleased Elizabeth Price has won #TurnerPrize       #eprice.
Raises video editing to the highest pinnacle, art.'
(@skirrid       03/12/12); `I never used to enjoy video art, but I loved Elizabeth Price's       film in the Turner Prize.
Really captivating and striking stuff.
#EPrice'       (@graphitegrey 22/10/12); `Turner Prize winning artist Elizabeth Price       shows how archives can be used to create new work' (@TWArchives 04/12/12);       and `Wow.
Elizabeth Price's work The Woolworths Choir of 1979 so intense       and absorbing.'
(@ThisMortalMagic 04/11/12).
Chris Sharratt, news editor for a-n wrote `For Price, an emotional as       well as intellectual connection is clearly paramount &#8212; her work gets you       in the gut as well as the head.'
[x] Richard Dorment in The       Telegraph (01/10/12) said `The Woolworth's Choir of 1979 is not only a       visual tour de force, it is 20 of the most exhilarating minutes I've ever       spent in an art gallery.
'[xi]     To further enhance the impact of seeing THE WOOLWORTHS CHOIR OF 1979       the artist designed bespoke environments for each presentation of the       work.
This approach was not lost on audiences.
`The first thing that will       strike you about Elizabeth Price's exhibition at the Baltic is the drama       of its presentation [...] a large, dark room [...] via a corridor of       fading light [...] the artist's work will suck you in visually, aurally or       both,' said David Whetstone in a piece published in both The Journal, 29       February 2012, p.51 and Metro North East, 5 March 2012, p.40.
In Price's acceptance speech for the Turner Prize she emphasised the       importance of public funding for the arts and art education[xii]       and she has committed to make THE WOOLWORTHS CHOIR OF 1979       more publicly accessible in the long-term by selling editions of Choir         (Parts 1 &amp; 2) and THE WOOLWORTHS CHOIR OF 1979 to major       national and international public collections, including the Arts Council       Collection[xiii], Tate, Stedelijk Museum and Hallen,       Haarlem and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston[3].
The impact of the revenue generated from Price's research is huge       relative to the size of the original award from Arts Council England.
The       sales of Choir (Parts 1 &amp; 2) raised &#163;28,000, which Price used       to fund the final iteration of the film.
The sales of THE WOOLWORTHS         CHOIR OF 1979 raised a further &#163;114,000.
Including the income       generated from the Turner Prize, &#163;25,000 of research funding from the Arts       Council England Helen Chadwick Fellowship has leveraged approximately       &#163;200,000 of income for the artist, which has allowed her to sustain her       practice and support the commercial operation of her gallery       MOTINTERNATIONAL[3].
MOTINTERNATIONAL said that the success of Price's work had impacted       positively on them by providing the gallery with an introduction to       prestigious international art collections and generating reports in the       print and broadcast media beyond normal artworld outlets[3].
The Managing Editor at ArtReview tweeted `Going up in the world: @MOT_Intl       ditch the eastend highrise for Bond Street premises.
Elizabeth Price is       the opening show.
24 April.'
