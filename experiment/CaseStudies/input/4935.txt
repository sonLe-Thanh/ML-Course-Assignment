     Clinical and patient benefits     [text removed for publication] shunts and External Ventricular Drain         (EVD)     The initial application of our novel approach to anti-infective catheters       (USA Patent 4917686) was licensed in 1995 to a major USA company [text       removed for publication].
Since launch (1998 in EU, 2001 in USA), about       97,000 children and adults in 47 countries have received the antimicrobial       shunt, and since 2008 there has been a 22% growth in usage in the UK [a].
Almost 70% of shunts used annually in England now comprise our [text       removed for publication] shunt [a] and the technology prevents around 370       brain infections and 38 deaths in England each year [b].
Eleven       international clinical trials involving 5,613 patients [c] (2,180 since       2008) have all shown a reduction in infection (control rate 8.75%, [text       removed for publication] rate 3.6%, extracted from those studies after       2008), and data from the UK Shunt Registry [J Neurosurg Pediatr 2009;       4(4): 389-393] has confirmed this.
In the same analysis, infection rates       for paediatric shunts were: control 5.8%, [text removed for publication]       0.9% [c].
[text removed for publication] is currently the subject of       application for regulatory approval by the Chinese FDA, in which Bayston       plays a pivotal role, having face-to-face meetings with Chinese officials.
In addition, the observed patient benefits of [text removed for       publication] have influenced the Department of Health's National Institute       for Health Research (NIHR), causing them to invest in a large multicentre       clinical trial of [text removed for publication] shunts (the BASICS trial;       &#163;2.04M http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hta/1010430).Bayston       has declined to be involved in this trial in order to avoid bias, but has       given advice on diagnostic criteria and microbiological investigations.
In 2001, the technology was licensed for catheters for external ventricular     drainage (EVD), a temporary means of 3 Use Adult intracranial Use Paed     pressure control.
Since launch in Risk adult 2002 390,000 Risk Paed patients     have benefitted from the new EVD.
In 2010, we licensed our technology     extending the antibacterial spectrum for EVD to cover multi-drug-resistant     Gram negative bacteria such as ESBL E coli and Acinetobacter to     [text removed for publication].
A 2010 study has shown a significant     reduction in brain infection, from 7.6% to 0.9%, using [text removed for     publication] EVD [d].
Use of our EVD catheter applies prophylactic     antibiotics only at the site of bacterial exposure, and a 2010 study has     shown that [text removed for publication] significantly reduces the need for     systemic antibiotics, so reducing their adverse events including Clostridium       difficile infection (an increasing antibiotic-related problem     worldwide resulting in superinfection and often need for colectomy) [J     Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2010,81:1064-7].
[text removed for publication]     therefore has an important role in cutting antibiotic use and reduction of     associated risk.
The current beneficiaries of the [text removed for publication] research       are primarily neurosurgical patients with hydrocephalus or head trauma,       who require intracranial pressure management, and who have been shown to       experience significantly fewer episodes of ventriculitis, abdominal sepsis       and other complications.
In the US, approximately 33,000 patients are       shunted each year costing $100 million [Ped Neurosurg 1995,23: 254-259].
Clinical trials of [text removed for publication] shunts since 2008 have       shown a reduction in infection rate from 8.75% to 3.6% [c].
Treatment of       shunt infections is by shunt removal and systemic antibiotics, and, after       2-3 weeks, insertion of a new shunt.
In up to 26% of cases this needs to       be repeated due to infection recurrence [J Neurosurg (Ped)       2006;105,177-181].
Therefore, applying the reduction in infection rate of       8.75% to 3.6% [c] to the 198,000 shunts inserted in USA since 2008, just       over 10,000 patients would have been spared at least two, and possibly       four or more, extra operations had [text removed for publication] been       used throughout.
Similar results (reduction in infection rate 7.6% to       0.9%) are seen when our antimicrobial EVD catheter is used in       neurocritical care [d].
Dialysis and urinary catheters     Our modifications to the technology for other applications requiring       broad antimicrobial spectrum and long duration have led to other licensing       deals.
The rights to our catheter for reducing peritonitis in Continuous       Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) patients, with activity against       staphylococci and Gram negative bacilli, were licensed to USA company       [text removed for publication] in 2005, and this catheter is now       undergoing CE Marking.
Since 2009, the company has invested approximately       $1.337M in new construction and production equipment and employed one full       time engineer and two part-time regulatory / marketing executives       specifically for this venture.
The company have decided to name the       product the `Bayston Catheter' [e,f].
Beneficiaries of the CAPD catheter are those with end-stage renal disease       (ESRD) who are expected to experience significantly fewer episodes of       peritonitis and fewer catheter changes (each a surgical procedure).
Approximately 1m people in the USA and probably several times this figure       in Korea and China are affected.
Worldwide, an average of 11% of ESRD       patients are treated with CAPD, but in EU and Korea, CAPD is used more       often, and 75% of ESRD patients in Mexico use CAPD [J Am Soc Nephrol       2012;23,533-544].
Long-term urinary catheters are used in tens of millions of patients       worldwide, with infection rates around 40%.
We are working with the       international devices company [text removed for publication] to evaluate       our recently developed urinary catheter for regulatory approval.
Training senior surgeons     The research surrounding the base technology and its clinical       applications has underpinned Bayston's contributions to the DePuy       Hydrocephalus and Neurocritical Care Learning Centre (http://www.depuy.com/uk/healthcare-professionals/education-and-training),       held three times each year for senior professionals in Hamburg, Istanbul,       Neuchatel and Prague.
Since 2008, approximately 400 senior surgeons have       attended, and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) points are awarded       for these sessions at rates depending on national systems.
As an example,       a 3-day training session in Neuchatel in 2010 was attended by 61       professionals from South America, EU, Eastern Europe, Africa, Russia and       Korea.
Up-to-date best practice is taught and discussed so that delegates       return to their home countries in a position to institute regimens to       reduce complications and improve patient outcome.
Commercial benefits     Cost-savings for the NHS     One large USA [text removed for publication] shunt study [g] showed a       reduction in infection rate from 12% to 3.2%, a reduction of 53 days'       hospital stay for every 100 patients shunted, and an associated saving of       $442,133 per 100 patients shunted.
In one German hospital, use of the       antimicrobial shunt catheters led to reduction in infection rate from 5.8%       to 1%, yielding annual savings of $1.3m [h].
In England, the technology       prevents around 370 brain infections and 38 deaths each year, thereby       saving NHS England an estimated &#163;18.4m in treatment costs annually [b].
Costs of infections vary between countries and institutions, but an       estimated $100m annual cost worldwide of shunt complications (which       includes non-infective causes) would be reduced by $35m-$50m by the use of       [text removed for publication] shunts (calculated from figures in the       literature).
