     Weait's research argues for a harm-reduction approach to the use of law,       demonstrating to       international policy-makers and others that an overly broad       criminalisation of HIV nondisclosure,       exposure and transmission has a negative impact on prevention efforts and       on the lives of PLHIV.
Weait's international policy work includes invitations to work as a       consultant for UNAIDS and       UNDP, and dates back to 2002 when the first UNAIDS policy options       paper on criminalisation of       HIV transmission and exposure cited in its bibliography Weait's Taking         the Blame (3.1), one of the       first published articles arguing for decriminalisation of reckless       transmission.
Weait is one of the       very few UK legal academics continuously involved in these policy-making       fora over such a lengthy       period.
Throughout the eligible period Weait has been invited to provide expert       assistance to key       international consultations organised by UNAIDS and UNDP, e.g.
the 2011         Expert meeting on the         scientific, medical, legal and human rights aspects of criminalisation         of HIV non-disclosure,         exposure and transmission (report of the meeting is at 5.4 below),       which united for the first time       leading scientists and legal scholars/practitioners to discuss the latest       medical and scientific       developments regarding HIV and how these should impact on criminalisation       of HIV nondisclosure,       exposure and transmission.

2 of 5.4 advises that it benefited from       "information, evidence and       analyses" from the two background papers prepared by Weait Criminalisation         of HIV Non-         Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission: Background and Current Landscape       and Criminalisation         of HIV Non-Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission: Scientific, Medical,         Legal and Human Rights         Issues.
The papers were also used in the February 2012 High Level       Policy Consultation on       Criminalisation of HIV Non-Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission.
5.1 can       confirm the       background papers and agenda prepared for the 2011 expert meeting       `benefit[ted] from the       scholarship and research of Professor Weait' and that such input was       `critical for the development       of such policy and advocacy approaches'.
As a member of the Technical       Advisory Group for the       Global Commission on HIV (UNDP/UNAIDS) Weait contributed the UNAIDS/UNDP       Policy Brief on       Criminalisation of HIV Transmission (5.7 referring to 3.1) in 2008,       by acting as an `expert reviewer       of several drafts and provid(ing) valuable input' (5.1).
From 2011 to 2013, UNAIDS entered a more intense period of deliberation       of research, evidence-       building and policy dialogue, during which time Weait wrote the background       paper on       criminalisation (5.5) for the Commission, which reported in July 2012 (as       5.6, which acknowledges       Weait's role in the Technical Advisory Group and cites publications by       Weait).
The culmination of       this period was the publication on May 28th 2013 of updated       UNAIDS guidance that both            restated the policy position of UNAIDS and the Global Commission on         HIV and the Law (that         general laws &#8212; not HIV specific laws &#8212; should only be applied to the         extremely rare instances of         intentional transmission of HIV); and       provided recommendations to governments, policy-makers, law         enforcement officials, and civil         society (including PLHIV) to "achieve the goal of limiting and           hopefully ending the overly broad           application of criminal law to HIV" (pg 2 of the guidance).
Weait's research has led to invitations to address policy-makers and       professional medical       organisations e.g.
his presentations at HIV in Europe conferences,       identifying how criminal law       disincentivises the timely uptake of testing by those with heightened       infection risk and on expert       evidence in criminal trials involving allegations of HIV transmission and       exposure (3.3 &amp; 3.4).
National AIDS Trust (NAT) described Weait as the `leading UK       academic' with whom it       collaborated over eight years, contributing specific research-led legal       expertise to NAT and to the       entire UK HIV sector (5.2).
NAT highlighted Weait's expertise on the use       of behavioural orders, for       those convicted of reckless HIV transmission.
NAT used this expertise in       submissions to the       Sentencing Council and CPS, achieving a policy change in       2011 whereby CPS will no longer use       behavioural orders against those convicted of reckless transmission, or       only in very limited       circumstances.
Further, Weait's contribution to a joint paper on HIV       forensics and use of       phylogenetic analysis (3.5) identified how certain scientific evidence can       and had been previously       misinterpreted.
This let to CPS acknowledgment of the inconclusiveness of       phylogenetic analysis       and forensic difficulties in proving HIV transmission; leading to an       acquittal for HIV transmission in       England; and the development of CPS nationwide policy guidance on future       handling of such       evidence.
The evidential threshold was raised for cases to reach court,       with a consequent       reduction in the number of cases prosecuted.
NAT commented that the       response of the UK HIV       sector to criminalisation of HIV transmission is regarded as a model by       UNAIDS and others due to       its evidenced-based focus, training and education of HIV-sector       professionals.
IPPF used Weait's research extensively in their work on       challenging criminalisation across the       world (5.3).
Weait was a key contributor to IPPF's 2010 campaign (5.10);       to Verdict on a Virus:         Public Health, Human Rights and the Criminal Law (translated into       three additional languages); he       participated in the video advocacy resource Behind Bars;       contributed to the school-based anti-       stigma campaign Positive?
Awareness of and attitudes to HIV 2011       distributed through the       Department of Education; and participated in international advocacy work       in Sweden, and a Berlin       Consultation in 2012, facilitating an advocacy session for civil society       participants.
Weait's research acts as an important reference point for non-academic       stakeholders in two other       spheres.
His inclusion in GNP+'s Global Criminalisation Scan Report (2010)       (see 5.9) makes a significant       contribution to its overview of the extent to which laws have been used to       prosecute PLHIV for HIV       transmission and exposure.
GNP conclude the evidence shows there is no       correlation between       the HIV prevalence in a country and their willingness to use criminal laws       and other punitive       measures to regulate transmission; and cites 3.5 and Weait et al's 2009       article Sexually charged:         the views of gay and bisexual men on criminal prosecutions for sexual         transmission.

And the quality of Weait's analysis with respect to criminal Liability       for HIV transmission was       acknowledged by the judiciary in an important 2011 Commonwealth case Neal         v The Queen (5.8).
