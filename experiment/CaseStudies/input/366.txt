     The crucial importance of Cardiff's research breakthrough to the success       of the new GDi engine designs is highlighted by Ricardo's Computer Aided       Engineering (CAE) Manager James Mullineux in `Ricardo Quarterly' [5.2]: `Validating           a detailed VECTIS spray model of the selected injector is         the first step in being able to simulate the operation of a new form of         combustion system'.
He continues in [5.3]: `a significant           aspect of the achievement of the T-SGDI research project has been the           ability to produce validated VECTIS models of the combustion system           that can be used to provide a truly predictive assessment of the           engine under operation.
Although the approach used on the       research project included a CFD correlation exercise both with the       (Cardiff) spray rig and an optically accessed engine, the latter would, as         Mullineux concludes, not be necessary as part of a production CAE         process.'
Details of the major, wide-ranging impacts achieved as a       result of the spray characterisation methodology developed at Cardiff       University are described below.
Economic impact     Significant international business has been secured for Ricardo,           the industrial sponsor and global leader in automotive engine design.
The Cardiff-Ricardo methodology has been applied and disseminated through       Ricardo and their international clients.
Ricardo have, for example, used       this integrated modelling-validation methodology, in partnership with       Cardiff, to develop bespoke gasoline engine designs and fuel-injection       operational strategies on behalf of a broad range of international           clients such as [text removed for publication].
These contracts           have generated over &#163;20M revenue for Ricardo [5.1], and       significantly more revenue for Ricardo's OEM clients through revolutionary       performance improvements and resultant sales.
Recently [5.2] the Ricardo/Cardiff partnership used its methodology in       the design of a fuel-flexible SGDI engine for Malaysian-based           multi-national PETRONAS (a Fortune 100 global       company).
This engine was designed to run efficiently and flexibly on       ethanol, methanol and gasoline fuel.
Hence, not only does this engine       offer the efficiency gain associated with SGDI, but also the           significant additional environmental benefit of utilising sustainable           fuels.
Cardiff worked very closely with both Ricardo and       PETRONAS, including regular PETRONAS research staff visits to Cardiff's       laboratories [5.1], to ensure effective understanding and implementation       of the integrated modelling/validation approach in the engine design       process.
This SGDI engine represents a step change in direct injection (DI)       combustion system design, reaching levels of fuel consumption for diesel       engines, but without the associated costs due to throttle-free operation.
SGDI is even more dependent upon accurate temporal/spatial spray       simulation than its predecessor, the `wall guided' GDi design, thus       further emphasising the crucial role of Cardiff's methodology.
PETRONAS           has recently entered into agreements with far-eastern OEMs that will           see derivatives of this engine entering volume production from 2014,           rising to in excess of 100,000 units per year [5.1].
Ricardo's commercial code VECTIS, which Cardiff's research enabled       Ricardo to validate and hence which contributes to its market lead, generates           more than &#163;1M in revenues per annum for this innovative,       high-tech UK multi-national company.
It is used by global companies such       as [text removed for publication] for combustion system design and       development.
The integrated Cardiff-Ricardo methodology has enabled the design of GDi       engines more quickly and robustly, thereby gaining significant competitive       advantage.
Ricardo continues to use the integrated methodology to secure       new orders in the growing GDi market.
For example, it used the       Cardiff-Ricardo methodology to secure a further $7M contract with a           major US car manufacturer in 2013 [5.1].
Environmental impact     Bosch [5.4] state that GDi engines have increased market penetration from       2% (in 2002) to 22% (in 2012).
The global market for road vehicles in 2012       was around 84 million [5.5].
When coupled with downsizing and boosting       (for which DI is a major enabler), GDi technology is estimated to reduce       CO2 emissions by over 20%.
Hence, interpolating data between       1996-2012 shows that GDi engine technology has already been           responsible for a reduction in new car emissions of over 20M tonnes           globally, including 10M tonnes across Europe.
As Ricardo is       the leading international consultancy in GDi engine design, having       undertaken GDi design projects with many of the major global OEMs since       1996, the Cardiff-Ricardo partnership has provided a considerable       contribution to this global CO2 reduction.
Furthermore, it is projected that around 26 million cars with GDi engines       will be produced per annum by 2020 [5.4].
This represents a reduction of       CO2 emissions from new cars of over 10M tonnes per annum           (by 2020) through the adoption of GDi technology, and integration with           usage of alternative fuels will result in further CO2           savings.
Impact on engineering practice     Ricardo claim that the PETRONAS project is one of their best           examples of successful modelling-led engine designs [5.1, 5.3],       where test-bed commissioning of the first prototype performed generally as       predicted.
Validated spray modelling and integrated design       (enabled by Cardiff's research) is crucial to ensuring such a successful       result [5.2] and for promotion of the elusive goal of truly simulation-led       (rather than empirical) engine design and manufacture.
Ricardo state, `The           (Cardiff) fuel spray rig will always be a crucial part of the CAE tool           chain ....... As such, we have a highly efficient and cost-effective           CAE methodology that can now be applied in the development of           production implementations of this type of advanced and highly           fuel-efficient combustion technology' [5.3].
Hence, it is       clear that the Cardiff-Ricardo methodology provides additional impact       through improving professional engineering practice.
In sum, Cardiff's research has revolutionised the design of modern       gasoline engines worldwide, with global economic and environmental impacts       of major significance.
