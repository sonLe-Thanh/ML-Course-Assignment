     Through the publication of three books, written for a non-specialist       audience, and through an extensive schedule of public engagement work,       Lane has enhanced public awareness of relatively little known areas of       science (evolutionary biochemistry and cell biology) stimulating       discussion and debate in a wide range of media.
During the period 2008-13, sales figures for these books were around       100,000 copies.
Since 2008, Lane's books have been translated into 20       languages, including Japanese and Chinese.
Power, Sex and Suicide       has sold 13,200 copies in Japan alone in the five years since its launch       in translation at the end of December 2007 [a].
Lane's books have been reviewed in many high-circulation newspapers and       magazines.
For example, Life Ascending was selected as a book of       the year by The Times (2010), The Independent (2010) and New         Scientist (2009) and won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books       in 2010 [b].
It has also been recommended for use in school by the       website Science in Schools [c].
Lane's books have received       thousands of 5-star ratings and reviews online on Amazon, GoodReads [d],       LibraryThing etc.
; they have been recommended by book clubs (e.g.
Scientific American Book Club) and on reading lists for the public (e.g.
the US National Center for Science Education [e]).
Impact on the study of science     Admissions tutors at UCL report that 50% of students applying to read       biology or biochemistry at UCL cite Lane's books as inspiration on their       UCAS forms or at interview [f].
That this inspiration goes beyond       UCL is supported by the fact that Lane's books are recommended on reading       lists at universities including Oxford and Cambridge, and are regularly       recommended in online student forums such as The Student Room [g].
Lane's student seminars often pack lecture theatres, and generate return       invitations, a record being four invited lectures to the Oxford University       Scientific Society.
Lane is regularly invited to give talks in schools,       including Henrietta Barnett, St Paul's, and Haberdasher's Aske's, to caf&#233;s       scientifiques, and the University of the Third Age [h].
These       talks directly present the ideas from the research to a non-specialist       audience.
All these activities help draw students into studying biology       and biochemistry at university.
Media engagement     Lane has appeared as an expert in a number of television and radio shows,       bringing the little-known world of cells and evolution to large audiences.
On TV he appeared on the BBC2/Discovery documentary Secret Universe:         The Hidden Life of the Cell (October 2012), a one hour television       special for BBC 2 and Discovery US that uniquely explored the latest       understanding of human cellular biology through the dramatic arc of an       adenovirus invasion.
The film (initially aired in the UK, America and       France) has been watched by about four million people worldwide, was       received to great critical acclaim, and is now routinely viewed as part of       A-level biology courses [i].
Lane also acted as scientific adviser       to the major BBC series Wonders of Life (2013), with Brian Cox.
The producers have stated "Without doubt, Nick's input and influence on         the series had a significant impact.
Each episode drew an audience reach         of well over 3.5 million people on television.
Hundreds of thousands         more watched on iPlayer...Some of the topics that we discussed have also         influenced thinking in the wider Science Department of the BBC" [j].
Lane has appeared on many radio shows, again with audiences numbering       millions, including the Today Programme (February 2010), The World         Tonight (October 2010) and The Infinite Monkey Cage       (December 2011, June 2013) [k], as well as popular radio shows in       the US, such as NPR's All Things Considered (Feb 2010).
He       featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time (on cells,       September 2012), with an audience of over two million in the UK, and       downloads in 40 countries, about which the producer said "The         programme...is used widely as a teaching aid in schools and universities         in both the UK and abroad...each episode is a permanent &#8212; and free &#8212;         learning resource.
...Nick's contribution was crucial in ensuring         that...complex ideas were communicated clearly while retaining full         scientific rigour, and his specialist knowledge in the field ensured         that our account of the subject was both approachable and authoritative".
[l]     Public engagement.
Lane is regularly invited to give public talks at literature and science       festivals, museums, schools and universities, frequently attracting       capacity audiences.
These include talks and debates at the Edinburgh       Festival (August 2009), British Science Festival (September 2010),       Wellcome Trust (September 2010, April 2011) and Natural History Museum       (November 2011) [h].
His lectures on YouTube have attracted tens       of thousands of views (his mini lecture `The Origins of Complex Life' on       the UCLTV channel is the second most popular lecture of 29 with over       16,000 views) [m].
His feature articles for New Scientist       and occasional guest blogs for newspapers such as The Times       attract hundreds of comments per article [n]; features on the       origin of life and the evolution of complexity were among the most       commented pieces for New Scientist.
Blogs and tweets about Lane's       academic and media work have also attracted significant attention and       wider debate, notably the blogs Panda's Thumb [o], Not         Exactly Rocket Science, The Loom and Pharyngula.
He       has also taken part in debates and discussions on podcasts such as The         Guardian Science Weekly (January 2010).
