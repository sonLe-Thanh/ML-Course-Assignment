     As a result of the underpinning research detailed above, Newcastle has       become a leading centre for studying the pharmacology of drugs used to       treat children's cancer and so has had a significant impact on the conduct       of national and European clinical trials.
Crucially, these trials equate       to standard treatment approaches for most childhood cancers, and trial       protocols act as clinical guidelines.
Approximately 90% of neuroblastoma       patients are enrolled in clinical trials.
Benefits to Patients treated with Carboplatin     Newcastle is now established as the national centre for pharmacology       studies in childhood cancer, coordinating patient recruitment in 18 UK       treatment centres [EV a].
A blood testing service offered by the Newcastle       laboratory has been used routinely by 12 of the UK's major treatment       centres for children with cancer since 2008, including all of the largest       centres, e.g.
Alder Hey, Birmingham Children's Hospital and Great Ormond       Street [EV a].
The following figure graphically represents the use of       carboplatin in treating neuroblastoma patients, in accordance with the       protocol for the European High-Risk Neuroblastoma Trial [EV b; Trial       NCT01704716] and other challenging patient populations of various tumour       types.
It shows how the Newcastle blood testing service, alongside the       provision of dosing tables by the Newcastle group, has had a direct impact       on the treatment of children with carboplatin:        The blood testing service is used to determine individualised dosing for       the treatment of children with high dose carboplatin chemotherapy and       other patients where drug dosing is particularly challenging, including       very young children and those without functional kidneys, thus protecting       them from experiencing excessive drug exposures.
This is a vital tool, and       one of the Consultant Paediatric Oncologists at Alder Hey hospital states       that through using this service they have `...observed the need for         significant dose adjustment in several patients' [EV c].
Furthermore, a Consultant Paediatric Oncologist at Birmingham Children's       Hospital, confirms that overdosing patients with carboplatin `...significantly         increases the chances of death from non haematological end organ         toxicity during these procedures' and that `...under dosing         patients increases the chance of relapse from their malignant tumours'       [EV d].
He goes on to say that: `...using the real-time Carboplatin         pharmacokinetically guided dosing has allowed both reductions and         increases in the predicted total dose of carboplatin of more than 20%         and this service has improved both safety and efficacy for our patients'       [EV d].
A Consultant Paediatric Oncologist at Great Ormond Street also confirms       that the Newcastle drug monitoring service `...has been invaluable for         the treatment of patients receiving high dose chemotherapy and infant         patients where the risk of drug toxicity is a real concern' [EV e].
Through involvement with the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group, the       Newcastle dosing tables for carboplatin are routinely included in clinical       trial protocols for various types of childhood cancer, including       neuroblastoma and brain tumours [EV b].
Between Jan 2008 and July 2013       there were four open clinical trials using the Newcastle dosing tables,       with an estimated enrolment of 2,400 children [EV b], all of whom benefit       from a more uniform drug exposure to carboplatin.
In addition, since 2008       the blood testing service has been used to guide dosing in 54 children       outside of clinical trials, with dose changes implemented in approximately       75% of these patients [EV a, EV f].
Notably, the carboplatin dosage tables       have been incorporated into a European High-Risk Neuroblastoma Trial       (HR-NBL-1/SIOPEN), which to date has recruited over 2,000 children at 115       sites across Europe and Australia [EV b; Trial NCT01704716].
Furthermore,       Newcastle provides one of only three reference laboratories for this trial       [EV b; Trial NCT01704716].
As noted in Section 2, carboplatin has important advantages over cisplatin       in terms of reduced long-term toxicity.
Now, thanks to the drug monitoring       approaches developed at Newcastle carboplatin-toxicity can also be       appropriately controlled, even in clinical studies where high doses of       carboplatin are necessary.
This has ultimately resulted in improved care       of children being treated for a number of tumour types.
Recently, use of       the Newcastle drug monitoring approach has also allowed a curative       carboplatin regimen for retinoblastoma to be used safely in the context of       maturing renal function in a neonate who was diagnosed with the disease at       35 weeks (gestational age) [EV f].
This highlighted a clinical situation       where carboplatin therapeutic drug monitoring represented the only       feasible treatment approach to ensure an appropriate drug exposure,       leading to a successful treatment outcome [EV f].
Benefits to Patients treated with 13-cis Retinoic         Acid     Since 2008, and following the establishment of the carboplatin dosing       approach, the Newcastle group have been leading therapeutic drug       monitoring studies for an additional 11 important chemotherapeutics [EV       g].
The Newcastle-led national study on dosing of 13-cis retinoic       acid (13-cisRA) in high-risk neuroblastoma patients (R6 in section       3) reported that some children are receiving potentially sub-therapeutic       doses and therefore may be less likely to benefit from treatment.
13-cisRA       is a key drug used in maintenance treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma;       combining bone marrow transplantation with 13-cisRA treatment       results in an 18% increase in 5 year survival rates compared to bone       marrow transplantation alone [EV h], highlighting the clinical importance       of this drug.
As a result of the Newcastle findings, published online in       October 2012, children weighing less than 12kg now no longer receive       reduced drug doses in clinical trials across Europe [EV b; Trial       NCT01704716, EV i], and recommended increased dose levels for children       unable to swallow capsules have also been adopted [EV b; Trial       NCT01704716, EV i].
These improved dosing guidelines have an impact on       over two-thirds of high-risk neuroblastoma patients and allow for optimal       administration of 13-cisRA across Europe, as highlighted in a       recent editorial published in Clinical Cancer Research [EV j].
