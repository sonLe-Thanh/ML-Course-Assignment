     Meacham has consistently sought to engage wider audiences with his       research.
For example, he organised a series of public debates and events       stemming specifically from the underpinning research described above.
He       also engaged in several media interviews (particularly surrounding the       topic of `smart drugs') and wrote for a general audience on topics       concerning `smart drugs' and doping in sport in OpenDemocracy, the       Huffington Post and The Philosophers Magazine.
In addition       a letter written to the New York Times on the topic of health care       has been used by the United Steelworkers Union (USA) as a model of how       stakeholders should express their positions in a public forum [S1].
Meacham also participated in a `Festival of Ideas' /         mircophilosophy@foyles public event with Professor Steve Fuller.
They discussed Fuller's recent book `Humanity 2.0' in front of around 100       members of the public.
The model of intersubjective relations developed in       the underpinning research was used as a counterpoint to Fuller's arguments       about post-human future of humanity [S3].
In December 2011, Meacham organised and moderated a public debate       `Experiencing Disability: The right to be impaired vs. the legacy of       eugenics', held at the Watershed Media Centre in Bristol.
The event       consisted of short presentations by Professor Christien van den Anker       (UWE), a political theorist and disability rights activist, and Alex       McKeown (University of Bristol) followed by a discussion and debate.
The       presentations addressed the lived-experience of impairment and how the       legacy of eugenics in its various forms impacts upon the lived experience       of impairment.
This links directly to the phenomenological approach to       health and enhancement that Meacham developed in the underpinning       research.
The ethics of `liberal eugenics' is a major topic in the       discourse around `enhancement and health'.
Attitudes often accepted by the       general public were challenged at the event, which was attended by more       than eighty people.
For example, an interior designer for impaired people       wrote: `I found it interesting because the presentation challenged ideas       and put forward a personal experience of this world that was very       relevant, yet different to my experience.
As professionally I have to       engage with design for disability, it was useful for raising awareness.'
[S2].
Professor van den Anker's contribution to the debate will appear in       a volume, Medicine and Society: New Continental Perspectives,       edited by Meacham.
The `Experiencing Disability' event was part of a series of public       seminars and debates on the theme of `Medicine and Society', sponsored by       the Royal Institute of Philosophy.
These also included talks by Dr Niall       Keane (Limerick) on the `Enigma of Health', Dr John Sellars (Birkbeck       College) on `Stoicism and Cognitive Psychotherapy', Professor S.K.
Toombs       (Baylor) on `Three Primary Manifestations of Vulnerability in Illness',       and Dr. Eran Dorfman (Tel Aviv) on `Writing on Illness and Other Emergency       Phenomena'.
All of these talks were held at a local cultural venue and       each attracted capacity audiences of more than forty people.
Impact from       these events have included Niall Keane being invited back to Bristol to       give a masterclass with Meacham on health and hermeneutics to nursing and       other medical professionals.
The podcast from Toombs's talk has also been       provided for use in nursing education [S4].
S.K.
Toombs was a pioneer of       the phenomenological approach to health and impairment that is further       developed in the underpinning research.
The final `Medicine and Society' event was a public debate on the use of       so-called `smart drugs' in education (9 January 2013).
The idea for a       debate on the ethics and fundamental questions surrounding the use of       `cognitive enhancing' pharmaceuticals was based in the approach to doping       that was developed in `Outliers, Freaks and Cheats: Constituting Normality       in the Age of Enhancement' [R3 above].
The aim of the `Should Students       Take Smart Drugs?'
debate was to involve stakeholders in the debate over       the use of `cognitive enhancement' drugs in education, including those who       are responsible or will be responsible for designing and implementing       secondary school and university policy concerning the use of cognitive       enhancing pharmaceuticals in education.
The event attracted considerable       media attention leading to interviews with Meacham in the following media       outlets: BBC Bristol Morning News, Heart Radio evening news, Jack FM       evening news, and BBC Gloucestershire morning news.
The event was also       discussed on the BBC web pages [S5].
As a result of the debate, the UWE       student newspaper The Western Eye called for the university to develop a       `smart drugs policy' [S6].
Stakeholder Feedback from the debate included the following comments       [S7]:            The event definitely provided me with an expanded view point on the         issue, and made me aware of new perspectives.
Given that info, I would         absolutely be interested in a future public event similar to this one.
Overall I think it was a success!
It made me question the efficacy of SMART drugs and whether there was         any proven evidence of their effectiveness.
The discussions around the         topic also gave me an insight to other disadvantages of these drugs         which I hadn't considered before       I came to the event with misgivings (about use of `Smart Drugs') that         I was quite willing to have dispelled, as I wasn't entirely sure they         weren't based on ignorance, and I would be very interested in a bit of         cognitive enhancement.
But I was interested to hear that many on the         panel, and a pharmacologist in the audience, also had informed doubts         and objections.
There are still so many questions and risks involved.
(The) evidence of efficacy or lack of (was) interesting [from a         neuropsychologist's point of view]          The smart drugs debate was complemented by three general audience pieces       written by Meacham in OpenDemocracy [S8], Huffington Post       [S9], and The Philosophers' Magazine [S10].
All of these pieces       present for a lay audience and are based upon positions developed in the       underpinning research.
Comments from these contributions have included:            This article evinces the sort of careful consideration which has gone         sorely lacking in the coverage of the Armstrong debacle.
Dr. Meacham         asks tough questions, and advances some uncomfortable conclusions         regarding where the line in the ever shifting sands of what is         considered legitimate enhancement are to be drawn; if anywhere.
Interesting article &#8212; I totally agree with the author's rejection of         the moral case against doping.
It is entirely hypocritical because it's         basis is the wish to provide a "level playing field" in sport that is         wholly absent in matters of political economy.
If free market ideology         were true then the playing field ought to level itself (which it sort of         would by the free purchase of anabolic steroids....)          Meacham's work on the nature of health and impairment and the ethics of       enhancement have had an impact on a broad range of stakeholders including       trade unions, students, designers, and psychologists.
The public events       and interventions in the media have helped to mould and inform the public       debate around these issues, and they have challenged established norms.
