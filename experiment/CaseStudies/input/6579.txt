     The impact feeds into a developing network of links with cultural and       community organizations in Britain and Ireland in particular, but       increasingly further afield.
One of the key modes of impact for CIS is       exemplified in this case study, primarily working through public       engagement via networks and associations to achieve a concentrated reach       as defined by REF criteria.
This successive public engagement has led to       impact through providing materials and interpretational tools by which       people can better understand cultural change and provoke societal       questioning of received ideas about Irish/migrant identity and Irish       history through screen media.
The main findings of the research outlined       above in 2) have been successfully disseminated to audiences at screening       events and talks (listed below) and non-academic publications (The         Irish Post article, DVD booklet, Stones in his Pocket for       Tricycle Theatre programme notes) and discussions in community, national       and international settings.
The research has had demonstrable impact on the programming agendas of       cultural, educational and diplomatic organisations.
Notable amongst these       is the online BBCNI/BUFVC resource `Chronicle' https://chronicle.bufvc.ac.uk         and http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/chronicle.html 		[access 10 Nov 2013] that repurposed BBC Northern Ireland film       archive material, curated it and provided critical context for the digital       platform.
Pettitt served on its academic advisory board 2010-2011 and       participated in a user-workshop prior to the website launch in 2012.
Pettitt delivered invited talks and more formal lectures at       community/arts organisations, university venues with public attendance and       film festivals to audiences totalling over 800 individuals (attendance at       individual events where known shown in parentheses):            Belfast Film Festival &#8212; 2009 and QFT &#8212; March 2012 `Uncle Jack' (84);       Credited consultant &#8212; BBC4 television `Life through a local lens'.

The research underpinning the case study has brought filmmakers and films       to the attention of curators and festival programmers in London/Dublin,       other city regions of the UK (Leeds, Manchester, Belfast) and Irish       department of foreign affairs-funded events in Brazil, Mozambique and       Argentina.
The economic impact can be seen principally in the commissioned       production for retail of 1000 units of DVD and accompanying book (Output 6       above), but also in helping to sustain the vibrancy of cultural programmes       and providing the basis for future projects, including a "Story of the       London Irish" exhibit, research resource in Hammersmith and a forthcoming       retrospective festival of Hurst's films at the IFI, Dublin in 2014.
Two       examples of impact products and events directly based on research       underpinning this case study include an educational DVD (March 2014) and a       travelling film festival in South America (August 2013) that are listed       below:            [DVD] Thaddeus O'Sullivan: Early Films, 1974-1985.
Curated         with introduction booklet by Lance Pettitt.
2-disk: 5 digitally         re-mastered archive films.
Dublin: Irish Film Institute.
Mostra de cinema Irlandes &#8212; Five events travelling film festival of         screenings, seminars and discussions with filmmaker and curator, three         of which include public arts venues and engagement between 6-27 August         2013.
Acknowledging that these fall beyond the impact census period (July 2013)       in terms of audience, we argue here that the significance of impact lies       in the influence exerted by the research on a government department       (Foreign Affairs in Brasilia and Buenos Aires) and a national heritage       institution in Dublin to publish the DVD and commit resource to the       festival schedule during the early part of 2013 within the census       period.
