     Wide ranging benefits have accrued from this research.
1) Influencing policy and practice developments nationally and         internationally.
As the Head of the UK Government ICT in Schools       Division in the Department of Education 2000-2008 said, the Passey et al.
(2004) research report had: "delivered some very valuable findings [for         example, about uses of interactive whiteboards] and tools [for example,         to reflect on effective uses of these technologies] which are still in         use in schools today."
He went further and stated that the research       had: "significantly influenced government policy."
For example,       this research was a central piece of evidence in the Secretary of State       for Education announcement of greater capital investment in technologies       in schools (beginning with &#163;25 million in 2003-2004, and a further &#163;25       million in 2004- 2005) in an opening speech at the British Education and       Training Technology Exhibition (BETT) in London.
These decisions have       continued to have an effect on the sector and led to widespread adoption       and use of technologies such as interactive whiteboards in classrooms both       in the UK and internationally.
This research continues to strongly inform       the work of policy makers.
For example the Passey et al.
2004 report was       cited by the Secretary of State for Education in an answer to a question       about digital technologies on 25th February 2013.
Research       since 2007 into uses of learning platforms has similarly influenced policy       and practice across Wolverhampton Local Authority (supporting e-learning       policy documentation and strategy, highlighting important and innovative       collaborative online practice within its 80 schools) and impacted company       (LP+) platform developments that have been deployed in the UK and       internationally (identifying additional useful affordances to support       learning).
It was built into guidance produced for schools nationally and       internationally (detailing effective online uses to support school       management needs and enhance student engagement in subject and topic       learning).
2) Increasing awareness of and engagement in learning opportunities.
A wide range of presentations on the research involving 100s of policy       makers and practitioners have increased awareness as well as practice,       leading to wider teacher engagement.
As stated by an E-learning Advisor in       the Wolverhampton Local Authority Learning Technologies Team: "his         findings and recommendations have been used to inform future         developments [about implementation of emerging technologies] and the         City-Wide e-Strategy."
Concerning impacts on schools (since 2009),       he stated that "his relationships with many schools in Wolverhampton         has prompted schools to collaborate on common aims.
This has         engendered a feeling of collegiality."
3) Building capacity is demonstrated in reports from company       personnel as well as those in local government agencies.
Research into       digital online resources has supported wider product marketing; Espresso       Education provides resources to thousands of schools across the UK and       internationally, and used findings in 2010 to extend their work.
A Project       Manager of Aston Pride New Deals for Communities indicated how the       research built capacity, stating that: "his recommendation that a         widening of the pilot could have a strong and wide impact on community         needs in the future supported the development of a national award         winning, three million pound project."
4) Insights into ways to develop, refine and customise educational         products for specific audiences are evidenced in reports from key       company personnel; for example, in mathematics software development       (MathsAlive and Maestro), as a Senior Manager at RM said, the research       from 2001 onwards: "provided the evidence of how technology can impact         learning and has influenced the design [through research         feedback of effective forms of interactions] of some of RM's products         and services."
Additionally, the School Improvement Advisor,       Worcestershire County Council, indicated how insights impacted on       facilities provided for the 58 secondary schools across two Local       Authorities: "This work greatly influenced the direction of the         project and made a significant impact on the quality of the service         [forms of resources and interactions with schools] provided by the         provider."
5) The research findings raised awareness and understanding of         educational concepts in non-academic audiences nationally and         internationally.
This is evidenced through feedback since 2008 from       company, corporate and administrative personnel following some 20 separate       discussions and seminars &#8212; to the BBC (about digital online resources), RM       (about MathsAlive and Maestro software), Espresso Education (about digital       online resources); and following some 15 keynote talks &#8212; to national and       international practitioners at events such as BETT, to policy makers and       politicians in events at the House of Commons (about digital online       resources) and with key media groups (about learning platforms).
Findings       concerned with key educational concepts have been integrated into texts       for non-academic audiences, such as those launched and distributed by the       British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA) to international       ministers of education in January 2008, or those used by a learning       platform company (LP+) to support product use in 2010.
6) Raising awareness of learning and pedagogical practices has       been a focal aspect of research approach.
Findings have been discussed       with and impacted non-academic audiences, such as product developers and       sales managers.
In the case of studies into mathematics software, for       example, a Senior Manager at RM stated: "The work on MathsAlive and         Maestro demonstrated the impact of training programmes that were based         on pedagogy not technology and this influenced the design of the         professional development programmes we created for the Building Schools         of the Future bids and ultimately to the success of RM."
Similarly       the Chief Education Officer at Promethean stated he considered: "insights         to be unique [such as the shape of lessons with technologies] and I         often quote his work when presenting on education productivity, impact         and transformation."
