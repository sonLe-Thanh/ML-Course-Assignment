     The Republic of South Sudan (RSS) has some of the world's poorest       indicators for education, due       largely to decades of continual civil war.
1.3 million primary-age       children are out of school, and only       10% of women are literate.
Poor access to education is exacerbated by       ongoing violence,       insecurity, decimated infrastructure, and displacement.
Consequently,       there is a great need to       rebuild civil society, integral to which is the vast improvement of       literacy in this new nation.
A new Education Bill seeks both to improve literacy and protect the RSS'       63 native languages as a       means to retain and celebrate local cultures, stipulating that all pupils       be taught in their mother-tongue       until Year 4 (and thereafter in English) (1, below).
However, two       fundamental problems       hinder these objectives: most RSS languages do not have established       orthographies, and hence       there are almost no published resources for literacy training in native       languages.
The sets of CDs       and books produced by Impey and the team &#8212; Dance to the Drum of our         Home and Songs of the         Dinka of South Sudan, aimed at children and adults, respectively -       are thus ideally positioned to       offer the first non-religious published resources to support universal       literacy training in Dinka.
Reactions to the resources from those working in education in RSS have       been overwhelmingly       positive.
Deng Yai, Undersecretary for Ministry of General Education and       Instruction, stated:     "This resource is invaluable to us at this moment of education         development in South Sudan.
We         are in the process of revising the curriculum framework to meet the         needs and aspirations of the         nation, and this includes the teaching of languages (...).
Your         materials will be valuable for use in         Early Child Development and Primary education.
But what you are doing is         killing two birds with         one stone: apart from teaching Dinka children to read in their own         language, you are teaching them         a great deal about their own culture.
This is a very good beginning."
(2)     The Dinka-speaking population of RSS is approximately 1.5 million, or       35.5% of the population.
The number who could benefit from the resources is therefore great.
To       ensure their       dissemination, they were in early 2013 distributed to schools, churches       (who run literacy       programmes), community centres, government ministries, and foreign NGOs       promoting education.
500 copies of Dance to the Drum... were circulated to primary       schools supported by USAID in       Dinka-speaking states, for example.
Ezra Simon of USAID notes:     "I have been in this job for two and a half years and this is the         first time that I have been offered         materials for education.
All other materials are either religious or are         extremely outdated.
The CDs         created quite a stampede in the office and we need more!
They are so         exciting and there is simply         nothing like this anywhere in South Sudan."
(3)     300 copies were donated to UNESCO's RSS literacy project whose Head of       Literacy, Samuel       Wollie, affirmed that the children's book "will be most useful for our       literacy training (...) as it       supports our philosophy of `learning' by teaching language through song       and performance."
(5)       300 copies were also donated to DFID's consortium programme, which works       closely with       UNICEF, while 250 were distributed via Catholic Relief Services.
The CDs and books are also consistent with the Education Bill's emphasis       on strengthening and       preserving cultural heritage, offering recorded songs and, for the first       time, written transcriptions in       Dinka.
The ability to assert a cultural identity is entwined with native       language literacy and       revitalisation, and is of particular significance to a population utterly       demeaned by protracted war,       and whose post-war insecurity and displacement still threaten native       traditions.
Lodoviko Lual, Parliamentarian and Chair of Dinka Language Development       Association (DILDA),       attests to the resources' cultural importance:     "This is the first CD like this that is a document of Dinka history,         and particularly of the war.
This is         a document that we can keep.
It is not like the way our grandfathers         remembered word for word,         and when they died, the songs died with them.
These documents will         contribute toward the         continuity of our culture."
(4)     A national archive is being established in RSS and Impey's high-quality       field recordings will form       an important contribution to its holdings.
Outside RSS, the collection is       already in the British Library       Sound Archive and the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the       Netherlands.
In their support of literacy and cultural celebration and preservation,       the resources made possible       by the research of Impey and her colleagues provide teachers, students,       NGOs and other       education providers in RSS and the Dinka diaspora with tangible, practical       tools to strengthen a       new and vulnerable national culture.
