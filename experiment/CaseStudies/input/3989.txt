     The research underpinning the poetry collections (R3, R4) includes the       theoretical ideas explored       in both R1 and R2.
There are therefore strong links between the       theoretical and practice-based       research.
In-depth research into both the nature of creativity and the       complexities of metaphorical       language, explored in these research papers, directly influenced the       evolution of Curtis` creative       practice.
Both creative outputs are concerned with research into heritage,       history, scientific and       eco-critical ideas, as well as experimenting with formal and linguistic       conventions within poetry.
Their impact on the wider community is reflected in their uptake by       general readers through book       and e-book sales (approx.
400 units) and attendance at festival       performances, as well as their       influence on other artists and use in pedagogical environments.
Curtis`       work has been read and       discussed at the Barbican Library (2012), Bridlington Festival (2011),       Nottingham Trent University       (2011), The Troubadour (2011), York Literature Festival (2011), The Betsy       Trotwood (2011),       Chichester University (2010), Sussex University (2009), the Poetry       Society`s Poetry Caf&#233; (2009),       and Stanza Festival (2008).
Production of the poetry has involved       collaboration with (mutual impact       on) other artists including Julian Broughton (musician at Sussex       University), Alice Shirley       (independent artist) and Jon Ablett (artist and curator in the Darwin       Centre at The Natural History       Museum).
The testimonials below demonstrate the impact of Curtis`s poetry in these       contexts:     Julian Broughton, composer:       "To date (August 2013), I have set six poems [to music], using a variety       of techniques.
The       impact of Curtis`s poetry has been significant: I have had to think of new       ways of making       musical settings work...
The two most recent settings bring together A       Power Cut (from       Curtis`s earliest collection, Humbug) and Poltergeist (from her       latest, The Glass Delusion       [...]).
The two are to be performed in sequence as Shadow Play.
I       had to invent a musical       idiom that would reflect the rather dark atmosphere of these restless       poems with their       pungent humour.
[...] [T]he experience of setting Curtis`s work has       influenced other creative       activity, for example when I set Peter Abbs`s poem The Long Negation       (2011) for a       combination of Speaker, Alto voice, and accompanying ensemble."
[E2]     Jon Ablett, Squid Curator, Natural History Museum:       "The broad scope of the Natural History Museum collections lends itself to       analyses       extending beyond the borders of science.
The NHM is always keen to use the       collections in       new and interesting ways in order to reach the largest possible audience       to demonstrate the       importance of the collections, the scientific research that goes on in the       institution and to       adopt new perspectives on our collections.
The work that Abigail Curtis produced combined with the Alice Shirley's       squid drawing was       a perfect example of this type of collaborative, interdisciplinary work.
It highlights a museum       specimen, in a way which would not usually be done at the museum by NHM       staff, to inspire       and engage both academic and general interest audiences.
I also used the       example of       Abigail Curtis' work in a talk I gave [at the Natural Sciences Collections       Association       conference 2012] on the different uses of museum specimens."
[E3]     Unexpected Weather (R3)     The public impact of this collection has been considerable, as evidenced       by its recognition in 2008       through the award of Salt Publishing`s inaugural Crashaw Prize, a       publishing prize for debut       collections.
The prize judges` statement speaks to the impact of this       output beyond academia: "We       need new writers &#8212; sometimes to entertain and surprise us, sometimes to       console us, sometimes       to disturb and challenge us.
These books do just that, each in their own       unique way.
[...] Despite       some claims of marginality for the art, poetry continues to have a lasting       purchase on the mind and       perhaps even the conscience of us all.
We especially need it now."
[E4,       from a report in The         Guardian, demonstrating the impact of Dr Curtis` creative output and       its national reach.]
The collection garnered numerous positive reviews in poetry journals and       on Amazon.
Whilst       journals might be seen as more legitimate places to 2017review` books,       Amazon user reviews present       a truly non-academic indicator of impact, where the public audience for       poetry is able to give its       views.
Some examples of both kinds of review are given below.
Journal, Web and Print Reviews:            "I`d argue that the poems themselves are so unexpectedly fresh and         cunning in         composition that they`re a shock to a usually tepid British poetry         scene.
They could well         bring in new poetry fans, and reinspire old ones."
Fictavia blog, 2012       "I have discovered a book of wonderful light: real, surreal,         atmospheric, exotic and alien...It         is without doubt the most exhilarating collection of poetry that I have         read this year."
Graham Burchell, 2009 Acumen, Ember Press       "This is striking, original poetry."
Pam Thompson, 2009 Stride         Magazine       "Because it`s not immediately anxious to please, its pleasures reveal         themselves through a         longer engagement, and they are serious, unsettled and unsettling         pleasures."
Julia Bird,         2009, Poetry London       "Curtis`s imagination is large enough to allow History in as well as         the stuff of her own life.
This is an important quality for a young poet to have and greatly         increases the breadth and         depth of subject matter she might tackle in the future.`" Kevin Higgins,         2010 Eyewear.
Amazon Reviews:            "This is a beautiful book.
Curtis's poetry is by turns wonderfully         perceptive, delicate, tough,         quirky, funny, poignant and haunting.
[...] [Y]ou never know which way a         Curtis poem is         going to go.
Nowhere is that perhaps more neatly encapsulated than in         the unexpected         context in which the title-phrase of this collection appears."
"This is a fantastic debut collection.
It's lyrical yet quirky, sharp         yet tender.
It is beautifully         crafted and a joy to read."
The Glass Delusion (R4)     This collection was a winner of the prestigious Society of Authors       Somerset Maugham Award,       which is awarded to writers under 35 for a single work in any genre.
Past       winners include Zadie       Smith, William Fiennes and Sarah Waters.
The award is judged by a panel of       writers.
The judges       in 2013 were journalist Bidisha, non-fiction author William Fiennes and       novelist and journalist       Benjamin Markovits.
The judges of the award said the following in their       report: 'A stunning       collection of fierce, rugged &amp; muscular new poetry.'
[E5]     Below are several endorsement statements from poets written at the time       of publication:            "These highly imaginative scenarios have the jubilation of discovery         being made on the         hoof.
The poems are daring, wondrous and unexpectedly funny.
Reading         Curtis is like         being blown offwards by a whisper."
Daljit Nagra       "If Abi Curtis`s first collection plotted a course through myths both         personal and legendary,         The Glass Delusion wanders off from the breadcrumb trail altogether and         finds its own way         home through the forest of our collective unconscious.
Reading her is to         be reminded of the         mystery of every living creature, to awake from your own delusions to         find that reality is         even stranger. "
Luke Kennard       "These poems playfully and tenderly blur the border between fact and         fantasy, imbuing true         stories with a melancholy magic and establishing fables which feel all         too true."
Antony         Dunn       "Tender, surprising, funny and sad, the poems of The Glass Delusion         demonstrate a range         of preoccupations, passions and interests unique in contemporary poetry.
In its fascination         with the who (wittily explored in 2017Marrying Doctor Who`) and the what         (the quiddity of a giant         squid in the stunning poem, 2017Squiddity`), with history and the         everyday, Abi Curtis`s poetry         has a strange beauty, a precision and reserve reminiscent of Elizabeth         Bishop.
This is a         remarkable volume."
Nicholas Royle, author of The Uncanny           Both poetry collections have had an impact on the wider reading public,       as well as being judged       merit-worthy by fellow writers within writing communities such as the       Society of Authors.
