     The outputs produced by Kemp et al.
have had international impact in       fisheries engineering, and       river restoration and planning.
Kemp advises the EA and DEFRA on fish       passage, and the       Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology on the Hafren proposal for       a Severn Estuary       barrage.
Research on eel swimming ability and behaviour has been       incorporated in the EU eel       regulations, which require measures that allow 40% of adult eels to escape       from inland waters to       the sea.
Until Kemp's research, information needed to provide effective       screens for eels had been       lacking.
In 2010 the research findings were used by the principal Swedish       hydropower company,       E-ON, who installed and evaluated new screen designs and fish collection       facilities at the &#196;trafors       Hydroelectric Power plant, testifying that Kemp's advice had strongly       contributed to the success of       the project: "As a result of the research on developing screens for         eels led by Dr Calles at the         University of Karlstad and Dr Kemp and colleagues at the University of         Southampton, new screen         designs and fish collection facilities have been implemented and         evaluated at the &#196;trafors HEP.
This is the first of its kind in Scandinavia."
[5.1].
In the UK, the research findings on eels were incorporated into the EA's       guidelines for       hydropower and other abstraction points in 2011 [5.2].
In 2011, the       guidelines were launched and       disseminated at the Institute of Fisheries Management's International Fish       Screening conference in       which Kemp gave an invited keynote presentation, and Russon (Kemp's PhD       student) was       employed by APEM (the UK's leading fisheries Environmental Consultancy) as       a direct result of his       expertise in fish passage for eels and lamprey.
Kemp has applied his research to assess fish response to fluid dynamics       to several real life       challenges.
In 2008 the climbing ability of Pacific lamprey (funded by the       US Army Corp of       Engineers &#8212; USACE) was quantified to aid conservation efforts in       collaboration with the US       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the       Confederated Tribes of the       Umatilla Indian Reservation.
Lamprey harvest is ceremonially important to       the Tribes, but numbers       have been declining rapidly, partly due to dams impeding their return to       river systems to spawn.
There were no previous detailed studies of their behaviour.
Kemp's       description of climbing       behaviour and performance was fundamental in the design, installation, and       full field testing by       USACE of novel lamprey-specific fish passes at dams on the Columbia River       (Washington State)       costing several million US dollars.
A testimonial from NOAA National       Marine Fisheries Service       stated: "This research was applied directly in the design and         modification of lamprey passes         installed at lower Columbia River hydropower dams, and is now being         applied to the development         of lamprey passes at the ubiquitous low-elevation irrigation diversions         in the Columbia River         Basin.
Moreover, the work has been instrumental in development of         methods to assess the         efficacy of these structures.
Thus, this research collaboration is a         prime example of the extension         of research to a direct application developed to aid in recovery of an         imperiled fish species."
[5.3].
There are now plans to construct further lamprey passes in the Pacific       Northwest based on Kemp's       work.
In China, where dams are being constructed more rapidly than anywhere       else in the World,       Kemp et al.
's research has aided the development of fish passage criteria       for economically       important species of carp on the Yangtze River since 2009.
Kemp et al.
provided data on       swimming capability and behaviour of Chinese carp to the Ministry of Water       Resources, who       incorporated them into the design of fish passes.
Kemp (representing the       European Union) also       presented data on the environmental impact of hydropower development on       fisheries and potential       for mitigation at the 4th Yangtze River Forum (Nanjing 2011)       [5.4].
This influenced Chinese policy       makers to develop a research programme on fish passage and screening.
A       testimonial from the       Ministry of Water Resources, China, stated: "With the advice of Dr         Kemp, the Institute has         designed about 20 fish passage facilities for hydropower projects all         over China; among which the         trap and haul system at Pengshui Dam (the first of this kind in China).
Dr Kemps' presentation at         the Yangtze Forum and the Training Courses convinced Chinese         policy-makers that some         research needs to be done before design of fish passage facilities; it         is a regulation now that the         swimming capability of fish must be tested before designing fish passes.
With the assistance of Dr         Kemp, our research team has been formed, from a couple of persons at the         beginning to more         than 15 fellows at the present, which is playing a leading role in China"       [5.5].
In Sweden, full scale field trials were conducted in 2007 based on Kemp       et al.
's       experimental research finding that overhead cover can discourage       downstream migrating trout       from entering turbine intakes [5.6].
Structures creating overhead cover       were subsequently       strategically installed at hydropower stations to deter fish from       approaching turbine intakes.
Kemp's modelling tool for assessing the impact of barriers and       prioritising their removal or       mitigation (e.g.
construction of a bypass) was adopted in Scotland by SEPA       and continues to       facilitate the on-going implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive       (WFD) there [5.7];       Scottish fisheries officers are trained in the use of Kemp's methodology.
Kemp's research article       and report [3.5] have been widely accessed worldwide; the methodology is       being adopted in       several states.
Kemp and co-author O'Hanley (Senior Lecturer University of       Kent) were       commissioned by the State of California in 2011 to help develop a similar       optimisation tool.
A       testimonial from the Fisheries and Wildlife Service in California stated:       "The California Fish         Passage Forum commissioned Drs.
Kemp and O'Hanley to complete this         project based on         examples of their past and current related work, published history of         international excellence in this         field, and an outstanding proposal for this project........ After an         extensive literature search related         to this type of assistance, we were very pleased to speak with Drs.
Kemp         and O'Hanley and learn         about their highly innovative work and published research related to         prioritizing aquatic habitat         restoration projects using optimization methodologies......., the Forum         was extremely impressed         by Dr. Kemp's and Dr. O'Hanley's unique and proven ability to combine         academic excellence and         real world applicability to complex social and natural resource issues"       [5.8].
In the UK, results have       been shared with DEFRA, and Kemp was commissioned by the EA in 2012 to       develop the       methodology in the South East region, providing proof of concept for       development nationally [5.9].
In 2012 Kemp was invited to Brazil to give keynote presentations to CEMIG       (one of Brazil's largest       power generators) and at the Sympass II international conference on fish       passage on adapting the       methodology to help develop hydropower while minimizing environmental       impacts.
The research commissioned by the Scottish Executive was used to form a       response to       objections raised against the reintroduction of beaver by the powerful       Scottish salmon fisheries       lobby.
The research has been disseminated as a public report [5.10] and       has gained considerable       media attention in the UK, EU and the US where beaver reintroduction       continues to gain interest.
Kemp currently holds a position on the Beaver-Salmonid Working Group       preparing a position       statement for the Minister in 2014.
