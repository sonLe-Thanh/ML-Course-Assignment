     The impact of Dawson's research can be observed from citizen level       through to government, nationally and internationally.
The Climate Change       Adaptation Coordinator for the National Park Service (the lead U.S. agency       for cultural resource management) states that Dawson's work `in         identifying the problems of coastal erosion for archaeology, processing         archaeological data for rapid assessment, and engaging the public in the         documentation and care of threatened sites, is unparalleled         internationally' (5.1, below); and the coordinator of NABO, the       international North Atlantic Biocultural Organization notes that `Dawson         and his team have had a major impact on international archaeology,         heritage, public engagement, and in education for sustainability.
His         work is genuinely world-class and world-leading' (5.2).
Influencing Public Policy     Dawson's research into identifying and quantifying Scotland's coastal       archaeology and developing robust methods for prioritising the resource in       the context of a changing climate has created manageable targets and       protocols used by government.
The Head of Archaeology Strategy at Historic       Scotland notes that `the evidence upon which to make more strategic         decisions was largely lacking until the instigation of the work of         Dawson and his colleagues at the University of St Andrews' (5.3).
An       HS Board Report notes that Dawson's work has led them to `move from         excavating targets of opportunity... to excavating targets which have         been prioritised by a reasonably objective process' (5.5).
The       team's work was also used to review HS priorities for funding, resulting       in a `...focus on projects which help to mitigate threats posed by         coastal erosion' (5.6).
His research projects have been included as       completed deliverables in the Scottish Government's Adapting to Climate       Change document (5.7).
Dawson's national community projects have tested and demonstrated the       efficacy of meaningful collaboration with the public, contributing to a       significant shift amongst heritage policy makers towards a wider       definition of value which embraces local importance and community benefit.
Referring to this shift, the HS Board Report notes that the final       selection of sites for grant aid `will factor in matters such as local         community support' (5.5).
HS notes that `engaging, sharing and         celebrating our heritage with local communities is a key strategic         priority for the Scottish Government... and the work of Dawson and his         colleagues is a key element in aiding the delivery of this vision'       (5.3).
Widening Public Access and Participation     Thousands of people have become directly engaged with coastal heritage       through Shorewatch, a       national community project managed by Dawson.
Multi-year Shorewatch       excavations have combined rigorous archaeological research with public       training.
Working with island and rural communities in remote areas, four       Shorewatch excavations (5.11) have had high direct impact on the       regular volunteers who actively participated in the digs year after year       (3% of the local population per project) and on the wider community (over       30% of the local population through open days, school visits and talks).
Examples of other projects include the use of research evidence to       reconstruct and interpret two Shetland sites for visitors, which combined       a physical legacy with an educational benefit; and the installation of a       ground-breaking 3D digital resource at Timespan Museum, Helmsdale,       Scotland (13,000 visitors per annum), which presented scientific evidence       within a computer gaming environment and has engaged a wide swathe of the       community, young and old.
Shorewatch excavations are cited in the draft Strategy for Scotland's       Marine Historic Environment, which states that they have demonstrated 'how         to maximise recovery of information and community benefit from assets         which will otherwise be lost to the sea' (5.8).
In 2012, the       excavations won the Rescue           Dig of the Year Award, receiving over 50% of the public vote       from the readers of Britain's leading popular archaeological magazine, Current         Archaeology (subscription c. 20,000) (5.12).
Dawson's other national project has made his research results accessible       to the public via an interactive website and smartphone app (www.scharp.co.uk).
The Scotland's Coastal Heritage at Risk           Project (SCHARP) aims to enhance understanding of       environmental issues and gives training and support to the public in       updating records and contributing local knowledge.
Between launching in       August 2012 and July 2013, over 360 people registered to become citizen       archaeologists, 500 people directly participated in training events and       workshops and over 1,000 people attended public talks (5.13).
Fiona       Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Culture said SCHARP would 'give the         thousands of Scots with a passion for archaeology the chance to help         record important archaeological sites along our coastline' and       further noted that Dawson's research has 'led the field in highlighting         the erosion of coastal sites' (5.9).
The U.S. National Parks Service       noted that the project has 'provided an outstanding example of public         engagement in cultural heritage education and protection' (5.1).
Providing Expert Advice     Dawson has influenced strategy by sitting on expert panels.
He was       appointed Commissioner on the Royal Commission on the Ancient and       Historical Monuments of Scotland as a result of his research into coastal       and community archaeology (as above, section 2).
He sat on the BEFS Marine       Taskforce guiding development of the Scottish Marine Bill.
He was also a       key member of the Marine and Maritime Panel which created the Scottish       Archaeological Research Framework, and HS notes that 'the report from         this panel has highlighted the challenges in dealing with Marine and         Maritime archaeology, substantially informed by Dawson's 2010 [report]'       (see 3.3 above and 5.3, below).
His work was debated in the Scottish       Parliament in April 2013, after which he was invited to join a taskforce       established by the Cabinet Secretary for Culture to look into heritage and       coastal erosion.
Impact upon heritage managers beyond Scotland     The methodology created by Dawson and his team has been copied       internationally.
A senior heritage manager from Denmark's National Museum       notes that the research 'has been an important reference and         significant inspiration' used by teams of archaeologists from       Denmark and Greenland (5.4).
Shorewatch directly impacted upon the       development of the national Welsh community project, Arfordir, and       the first Arfordir report noted that 'feedback received         following a presentation by Tom Dawson... indicated there was a clear         desire from communities in the region to set up the project' (5.10).
The coordinator of NABO is also a US National Science Foundation (NSF)       grant holder, and has worked to identify top-end examples of research that       serve as international models.
He noted that through the work of '...Dawson's         team, Scotland is genuinely a world leader in combining creative         response to coastal erosion with effective community engagement and         world class cyberinfrastructure'.
The grant holder has arranged for       Dawson to speak at several international conferences, noting that the 'willingness         to commit NSF grant resources to providing the widest possible         visibility to the team's accomplishment may underline the sincerity of         my high impact assessment &#8212; this is not empty praise but an actual         commitment of international support to a project of world-leading         significance' (5.2).
