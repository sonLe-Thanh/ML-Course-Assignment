     Professor's Gross's writing, both in poetry and prose, has had a broad       and deep impact on a diverse number of individuals and groups outside the       academy, including school children, artists, peace workers, religious       groups, environmentalists and health care professionals.
His publications       and cross-arts collaborations &#8212; including work with Wattle and Daub Figure       Theatre (2009), Medea Mahdavi Dance Company, (2011), sculptor Alec Peever       (2006), and the Resonabilis music ensemble, Gareth Peredur Churchill and       Si&#226;n Cameron (2010) - have led to enhanced awareness of the role of       creative process in thinking about key contemporary questions including       peace building, transculturalism, environmental concerns and health.
The multi-level, national and international reach of this impact       is indicated by the sheer number and variety of Gross's invited       engagements and collaborations inside and outside the academy.
During the       review period, he has been invited to give over 96 public readings/talks       with an estimated total non-academic audience of over 6,594.
For the       climactic shortlist reading for the T.S.
Eliot Prize (2009) in the Queen       Elizabeth Hall on the South Bank there was a capacity audience of 914.
He       has been an invited speaker at over twenty literary and arts festivals       (including Poetry Now 2010, Dun Laoghaire; Hay Festival; Ledbury Festival;       Poetry International, South Bank Centre; StAnza Festival, St Andrews;       Transeuropa Festival, Amsterdam; Lancaster Literature Festival; Cheltenham       Poetry Festival, Manchester Children's Book Festival).
These appearances       regularly produced audiences of 200 to 500.
His broadcast work includes a       major contribution to `Listen to Them Breathing' (Radio 4 documentary on       Quakers and Poetry, 17 July 2011), the title of which was taken from his       poem `The Quakers of Pompeii'.
An interview with him featured on arts       programme OP on Estonian National TV (10 Jan 2011).
He has tutored at       Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre, and at international Creative Writing       courses at Tallinn University, Estonia (2011, 2013), as well as giving a       reading/talk at the Writers' House in Tallinn (2011).
Gross's longstanding commitment to children's engagement with poetry and       the study of the creative process has also led to numerous commissions       from national educational organisations and frequent invitations to give       workshops, readings and talks in schools.
Highlights include visits to       Springwood Primary School, Cardiff, as part of writing week with Michael       Rosen (2008), to Ysgol Gymraeg Plasmawr, Cardiff as part of Foyles Young       Poets scheme (2010), and to Ysgol Tre-Gib, Llandeilo in association with       REEP (Religious Education and Environment Programme) (2011).
International reach is evidenced by a residency at Stellenbosch       University, South Africa (August 2012) which included work with high       school pupils, and a Skype interview with staff and pupils of Beaconhouse       School, Karachi, Pakistan (Jan 2013).
He has worked on several projects       with The Poetry Society.
His poem `Room Inside', from Off-Road to         Everywhere, for instance, was performed by a community poetry group       in Nottingham in a highly popular video commissioned by The Poetry Society       for National Poetry Day 2010.
An accompanying education pack was       circulated to approximately half a million schoolchildren.
Since 2011       Gross has been a member of the steering committee of the National Literacy       Trust action research project into formative assessment and writing.
The       influence of his insights and techniques in the work of writers in schools       enabling children's creativity is evidenced by the Liz Cashdan Prize for       the outstanding contribution to Writing in Education in 2006 awarded to       his essay `No Artform Is An Island' in the journal of the National       Association of Writers in Education (Writing in Education, 40       (2006), 18-26).
Moreover, the Poetry Archive has issued a recording of       Gross reading his children's poems (2012) and will shortly issue a       parallel recording of adult poetry, making him one of only a handful of       poets included in both categories.
The significance of Professor Gross's work is indicated by       widespread public recognition of his status as a major poet whose writing       addresses the `big' questions which face our society and whose reputation       is likely to endure.
In the review period, four of his books won major       prizes, including the T.S Eliot Prize (2009) for The Water Table,       and the Wales Book of the Year Award (2010) for I Spy Pinhole Eye.
T.S.
Eliot Prize judge Simon Armitage said of The Water Table,       `this is a mature and determined book, dream-like in places but ultimately       dealing with real questions of human existence.'
The prize generated       substantial coverage of Gross's work in national newspapers, such as The         Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Scotsman, as well       as journals such as Poetry London (see Sources below).
The       awarding of the People's Prize, given on the basis of a popular vote, to Deep         Field in the Wales Book of the Year Award (2011) indicates       recognition of his significance by the general public.
He is frequently       invited to judge poetry competitions (e.g Poetry Society's Stanza       competition (2009), New Welsh Review poetry prize (2009), Cardiff       International Poetry Competition (2011) Yorkshire Open Poetry Competition       (2011)).
The significance of Gross's status as an advocate for the role of       creative process in understanding our society's most urgent challenges is       further evidenced by the following selection:             Peace-building and transculturalism: a translation by Gross of         a peace poem by Nordahl Grieg, commissioned by the Poetry Society along         with the Royal Norwegian Embassy and the Mayor of Oslo's office, was         exhibited on a hoarding in Trafalgar Square round the Norwegian         Government's gift of a Christmas tree in 2010.
It was seen by         approximately 300,000 people, and an accompanying Schools Resource Pack,         Look North More Often, commissioned by the Poetry Society         Education Department in association with the Norwegian Embassy, was         circulated to all primary schools in the UK, an approximate potential         audience of five million children.
1,170 school students have been         directly in contact with the Poetry Society with evidence of their         active participation in the project.
Gross's work on peace connects to         his activities around transculturalism, developed through his         connections with Estonia.
He was also a speaker and subject at a         translation workshop (12 languages), for Transeuropa Festival, Cardiff         University Centre for European Studies which included a commissioned         poem (Amsterdam / Cardiff, 2011).
Environmental concerns: the publication of The Water Table         led to an invitation to contribute to a (filmed) public consultation on         the National Environment Framework in Bangor in September 2010.
Gross         was a speaker at the AHRC Researching Environmental Change Network, Flood           Stories: Exploring Informal Narratives of Resilience Past and Present         (March 2011).
A poetry reading at the opening of the Valerie Coffin         Price exhibition at Oriel Canfas, Cardiff (September 2010) has led to         continued collaboration with this artist and a team of natural resource         economics, cultural ecologist and anthropologist as part of the         AHRC-funded Living Flood Histories project, demonstrating how creative         input can set the agenda for cross-disciplinary work.
Health and ageing: Gross's work on his father's aphasia, first         in Deep Field and most recently in Later (Bloodaxe,         2013), has led to invitations to speak on `Creative Writing and         Healing', with Dannie Abse and Sacha Abercorn, at the Hay Festival (June         2010), and at the `Writing in Health and Social Care' course at Ty         Newydd (November 2012).
He was an invited speaker at the 4th         International Hippocrates Symposium on Poetry and Medicine, Hippocrates         Initiate for Poetry and Medicine and Wellcome Trust, London (May 2013),         and he will judge the Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine (2014).
