     These research undertakings have shaped and informed policy debate in two       main ways: first,       through personal engagement of key members of the research team with       advocacy groups and       policy-makers in India and via dissemination workshops in South Asia (e.g.
Delhi, Kathmandu,       Hyderabad, Colombo) attended by government officers, NGO workers etc.
;       second, through       engagement with international donor advisors.
Impact on policy-framing in India (corroboration sources:       sections 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4)       In a post-colonial context, research impact on government policy in India       is often best achieved       through local advocacy groups, in this instance especially SAHAYOG and       CHSJ (see above) who       work to ensure that government policy and programmes on reproductive and       child health etc.
are       informed by rural ground realities beyond the normal purview of the state.
The research has had       two distinct but inter-related impacts on their work: it has alerted them       to the prevalence of       oxytocin misuse intra-partum and the importance of ensuring that policy       targeting PPH through the       use of oxytocin post-partum is not undermined by such misuse; and it has       provided them with       qualitative research training to enable them to generate an evidence-base       from around India on       this and other aspects of birthing experiences, for use in their advocacy       work on Safe Motherhood.
The research conducted by PJ and RJ has shown how small-scale research       can reveal and       crystallise key issues to be addressed by larger-scale research projects       that can then influence       policy-makers.
Thus health activist [text removed for publication] writes that this       research "has made important       contribution in the framing of policy debate around health in India ... in       respect to the production       and use of drugs" (email, 26 June 2013).
[text removed for publication] writes that it       provides "a detached,       scholarly voice to the political aspects of access to medicine in India       and is a great help for       rational drug policy advocates in India" (email, 26 June 2013).
During the RECOUP project (2005-10), RJ and Dr Nidhi Singal (University       of Cambridge)       developed a training-package on qualitative research methods       (http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page       ).
The training-package has       been used in a variety of contexts: it has e.g.
been translated into       Russian and Kazakh for use by       Kazakhstani teachers in school-based research informing education reform.
It was used by [text       removed for publication] (SAHAYOG) and [text removed for publication] (CHSJ) for a four-day workshop in       2008 to train       activists/advocacy workers from various Indian states, so that they could       conduct community-based       investigations into the experiences of women and their family members with       respect to       `near-misses' (obstetric emergencies that almost resulted in maternal       death).
With on-going       guidance from PJ, [text removed for publication] and her colleagues analysed the       state-level interview data and       compiled an overarching evaluation report on the quality of maternity       service provision at the       grassroots.
[text removed for publication] was appointed to manage civil society       monitoring of the Indian       Government's National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), and used this report in       his evaluation of       NRHM as well as in his work on the Steering Committee on Health working on       12th Five Year Plan       under the auspices of the Planning Commission.
In a joint statement [text       removed for publication] confirm that       the TPSA project contributed to their work in the following ways:            (...) helped CHSJ to develop its research skills, particularly in the         appropriate use of         qualitative research and mixed method research and small scale research         which is policy         focussed.
CHSJ subsequently used this competency to conduct/steer more         than 25 small         scale studies on different policy aspects.
These studies by CHSJ have         been acknowledged         by the Planning Commission of India and the Ministry of Health and         Family Welfare as         sources of independent feedback for improving the health system         performance.
It has also         acknowledged CHSJ's expertise by appointing [text removed for publication] as a member         of the Steering         Committee on Health for the 12th Five Year Plan.
SAHAYOG developed its skills in using rigorous research for policy         advocacy through its         association with the TPSA project.
SAHAYOG took the issue of quality of         maternal health         services forward, from the oxytocin component of study into a process of         collaborative         research and advocacy.
SAHAYOG received support from Prof Patricia         Jeffery in         designing a collaborative study of quality of care of institutional         delivery.
This study has         been widely presented and reported in global circles.
The collaboration         has led to the         formation of national network &#8212; National Alliance on Maternal Health and         Human Rights &#8212; which         continues to advocate for better quality services with the Ministry of         Health and         Family Welfare, Government of India.
The issue of poor quality maternal         health as a         serious concern has now been mainstreamed in the global policy arena and         SAHAYOG is         intimately connected with the global advocacy around the region through         its involvement in         the International Initiative on Maternal Mortality and Human Rights, and         with the Office of         the High Commissioner of Human Rights at the UN.
(email, 5 June 2013)          Impact via international donors (corroboration sources:       section 5.2).
PJ has been invited to contribute in various ways to programme       development among international       donors.
Her main involvement has been through Seattle-based PATH         (Program for Appropriate         Technology in Health).
PATH is a hugely-influential global health       NGO (it funded, for instance,       the world's first successful malaria vaccine), and it has a Gates       Foundation-funded project to       develop UnijectTM, "an easy-to-use, injection-ready tool       that ensures an accurate dose in a non-reusable,       sterile device with minimal preparation and minimum waste", containing       heat-stable       oxytocin.
In 2009, PJ was asked to join PATH's Oxytocin Initiative       Technical Advisory Group       [TAG] to contribute to landscaping analyses of oxytocin availability and       use in India, Ghana, Nepal       and elsewhere.
PATH is now carefully planning the roll-out of UnijectTM       to minimise the risks of       unregulated access and misuse identified by PJ and to establish in-country       systems to ensure that       oxytocin designated for post-partum use to prevent PPH is not siphoned off       for dangerous intra-partum       use.
[text removed for publication] comments:     Patricia Jeffery's ethnographic finding &#8212; that unmonitored intrapartum       oxytocin injections       are widespread in home deliveries in India &#8212; has had a crucial impact in       alerting the       international donor community to the need to keep the risks of unmonitored       use in mind       when formulating policy in respect to access to oxytocin.
(email, 5 June       2013)     In 2012, PJ was invited to advise another Gates Foundation funded project       (developing inhaled,       low-cost, heat-stable oxytocin dry powder for combatting PPH) on the       safeguards needed to       prevent unregulated availability of the new product.
[text removed for publication]       comments:     The intrapartum use and misuse of oxytocin is now recognised widely as an       issue for all       forms of oxytocin and particularly so in South Asia, and responsible       product developers       need to keep this firmly in mind.
The results of Patricia Jeffery's       fieldwork have been vitally       important in achieving the widespread recognition of this crucial       practical issue.
