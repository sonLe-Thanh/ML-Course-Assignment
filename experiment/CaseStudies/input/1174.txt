Directly Influencing Scots law on Extreme Pornography to Include           Rape Images     Durham University's research has influenced NGO activities, public and       policy discussions, the recommendations of the Scottish Justice Committee       and Ministry of Justice, and has consequently shaped Scots law on extreme       pornography.
The effect is that, in contrast to the law in England and       Wales, Scottish legislation specifically includes rape within its       definition of what constitutes `extreme pornography' (Scottish Criminal       Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 s42).
Shaping NGO activities and policy debate in Scotland       McGlynn and Rackley's research was a large influence on the arguments used       by women's organisations in Scotland to campaign for measures against       extreme pornography, and specifically on (a) arguments used to justify       criminal sanctions and (b) the need to include rape pornography within the       remit of the proposed legislation.
Rape Crisis Scotland state that McGlynn and Rackley's research was       `particularly useful' in directing their campaign away from `the       cul-de-sac of causal harm' and was `really, really helpful in terms of how       we ... approach[ed] it [the campaign]'.
As a result, `we framed it [our       campaigning] very much in terms of the cultural harm'.
This `had a big       impact': ` we got the legislation we wanted in Scotland' because `we       managed to avoid what you have in England which is a distinction in terms       of forcible rape [with violence] and I think that is quite an       achievement'.
The effect has been that the new law, `gives us a really       important tool to try to address what we think is a major area of concern,       but also because the law has an educative function as well' (source 1).
The `cultural harm' argument, and examples from a Factsheet on Rape       Pornography, produced by McGlynn and Rackley which gave contextual       information about the existence and nature of `rape pornography' (see https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/glad/GLADFactsheet.pdf)       were also widely cited in the Scottish media (sources 1-2).
The         Scotsman invited McGlynn to submit an opinion piece, arguing for       inclusion of pornographic images of rape in legislation on the basis of       `cultural harm' (`Is this Big Brother in the Bedroom: No', 18 January       2009, http://www.scotsman.com/news/jail-for-downloading-extreme-sex-images-1-754571),       and the newspaper gave support and emphasis with a front-page article.
This discussion of `cultural harm', and the omission of rape from the new       English law ensured that, in contrast to debates in England and Wales       prior to the enactment of the CJIA, public debate focused on violence       against women.
This created the policy context in which the Scottish law       on extreme pornography was more likely to include pornographic rape       images.
Shaping the Recommendations of Scottish Parliament Justice Committee         and Ministry of Justice       In December 2008, in order to influence the Scottish consultation and       legislative processes, McGlynn and Rackley disseminated the research       findings of outputs 1-3 through letters to a large number of       Scottish MSPs, government ministers and departments (see, eg, https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/glad/GLADLetter.pdf).
These letters presented the key lessons from analysis of the English       legislation (drawing on outputs 1-3), emphasising the failure of       the English legislation to criminalise the possession of all rape       pornography, as well as outlining the `cultural harm' justification for       the introduction of a law criminalising the possession of extreme       pornography.
In January 2009, McGlynn drew on outputs 1-3 to       deliver a plenary lecture at a conference organised by Rape Crisis       Scotland, and attended by the Scottish press, the Scottish Justice       Minister, members of the Scottish Procurator Fiscal's Office and women's       rights campaigners and activists.
McGlynn and Rackley also submitted written evidence (with copies of outputs         1-2) to the Scottish Parliament's Justice Committee during its       consultation on the proposed legislation.
In addition, eight women's       organisations, comprising one third of respondents and including Rape       Crisis Scotland and the Women's Support Project (a Glasgow-based women's       organisation funded by local and national government), deployed the       `cultural harm' argument in their submissions to the Justice Committee       and/or quoted directly from the Factsheet on Rape Pornography, produced by       McGlynn and Rackley (source 3).
During their deliberations, after       the initial consultation process, the Committee received supplementary       evidence from a third party which highlighted and responded to McGlynn and       Rackley's submission (source 4, p. 13).
McGlynn and Rackley's       submission had a direct influence on the Committee's recommendations.
In       its Report, the Committee endorsed their argument that the use of the term       `obscenity' should be reviewed, and that greater consideration should be       given to the 'cultural harm' of extreme pornography (source 5,         [292-4], [315]).
In 2010, the Scottish Parliament adopted a new criminal law on extreme       pornography which was broader than the English legislation and which       specifically covered rape pornography.
In 2011, the Scottish Justice       Directorate responded to a Freedom of Information request from the       organisation `Consenting Adult Action Network' which had objected to the       legislation, and which sought information on how the decision had been       made to include rape.
In response, the Justice Directorate referred       directly to the letter received by the Minister of Justice from McGlynn       and Rackley as advocating for this and attached a copy of the letter to       its response (source 6).

Changing Government Policy in England &amp; Wales and           Influencing NGO Campaigns     In May 2013, the Ministry of Justice stated that it did not `feel it       appropriate or necessary' to extend the law to cover pornographic images       of rape (source 7).
Following this announcement, Rape Crisis       (South London) and the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW)       launched their successful `Stop Rape Porn' campaign (source 1).
McGlynn and Rackley advised this campaign, and shaped the arguments it       presented.
EVAW state that Durham University's research is `incredibly       powerful and is really important ... [it] helps us to make the case to       government, and it improves the way that we influence and the work that we       do as it brings something very solid to our campaigns' (source 1).
McGlynn's and Rackley's work included: attending meetings at the Ministry       of Justice and with Government and Opposition MPs; producing briefing       documents, drawing on outputs 1 and 2, making comparisons between       English and Scottish law, and making recommendations for reform https://www.dur.ac.uk/resourcesglad/McGlynnRackleyRapeP_rnBriefingJuly2013.pdf).
They also assisted EVAW in drafting an open letter to the Prime Minister,       which was signed by over 100 women's groups, campaigners and academics,       including Sue Berelowitz, Deputy Children's Commissioner and Mumsnet (source         7).
The campaign attracted considerable public support.
A Change.org       petition, which referred to the Durham University research, secured over       72,000 signatories in a month, and the issue was raised by three MPs       during an Opposition Day debate in Parliament.
During the debate, Diana       Johnson MP quoted McGlynn's statement, drawing on the arguments of output         2, stating that "It is undeniable that the proliferation and       tolerance of such images and the messages they convey contributes to a       cultural climate where sexual violence is condoned" (source 8).
The campaign also shaped wider public debate.
During June and July 2013,       McGlynn and Rackley were quoted or referred to over 45 times in       international media (France, New Zealand, India) and in national media       (including Guardian, Daily Mail, Independent, Times, Observer,       BBC news and Sky News).
There were over 210 further media discussions of       the campaign, including the front page of the Daily Telegraph       (`Porn loophole "gives animals more rights than women"', 18.6.13) (source         9).
McGlynn was also interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour and       `Law in Action' about rape pornography and the key findings of the       research (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p018rdr5       (8.5.13); http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0213yg9       (6.6.13)).
The effect of the campaigns influenced by McGlynn and Rackley is that in       July 2013, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would `clos[e]       the loophole' in the legislation, `making it a criminal offence to possess       internet pornography that depicts rape' (source 10).
In announcing       this change of policy, the Prime Minister recognised that possession of       such material was already a criminal offence in Scotland, and that such       `images normalise sexual violence against women' repeating the arguments       made during the campaign and in Durham University's research.
EVAW state       that Durham's `research on extreme pornography was absolutely fundamental       to securing the high profile commitment by the Prime Minister' and that       `without the research and the expertise of the legal academics ...there is       no clear way that that would have been such a success, and it was a       success in a very very short period of time because it was so evidenced       and so strong' (source 10).
