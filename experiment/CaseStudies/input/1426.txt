     The direct beneficiaries of the research were organisations with a public       voice on the ethical use of, and regulation on, body parts for       reproduction and medicine: specifically the Nuffield Council on Bioethics       (NCOB), and indirectly the Welsh Assembly, the UK-wide Human Fertilisation       and Embryology Authority (HEFA).
In turn, their work has had significant       impact on public understanding and debate (on egg donors and recipients in       particular), and through this on health and well-being.
The research underpinning the impact was subsequently disseminated to       such organisations through their direct involvement with the research       conducted (including their attendance at events designed to develop       consensus definitions), through Strathern's role as Chair of the NCOB       Working Party, and through McDonald's evidence to that Working Party;       wider dissemination has occurred through publication, the sharing of best       practice, and the media.
As confirmed by the NCOB:          "Marilyn [Strathern] was appointed as Chair to the Working Party because         of her academic reputation, particularly in connection with her         anthropological work on new reproductive technologies and on gift         relationships.
"(a)     In 2011 the NCOB Working Party produced a report, Human bodies:         donation for medicine and research(b), which set out       guidance to help professionals and others consider the ethical       acceptability of various ways of encouraging people to donate, both for       treatment of others and for scientific research.
Whilst the NCOB report was the result of the collective discussion and       opinion of the Working Party, their overall analytical approach to the       work was shaped by Strathern in particular Strathern's guidance on the use       of comparative analysis (referred to as "analogies" below) was       essential.
The Final Report also more directly reflects engagement with Strathern       and McDonald's research.
For example, the guide to the full report       highlights sections on international comparisons and conceptual issues       around uses of money in the context of donation, and argues that it is       possible to compensate donors without donations becoming purchases, as       well as consider alternatives.
(d) The full Final Report makes       extensive use of concepts and ideas developed by Strathern (e.g.
2002),       including sections on: comparison and analogies, discussion of money in       context of ethical choice, gift relationship, relational thinking (public       and private) and the issue of altruism.
As summarised in a letter by the NCOB on Professor Strathern's       contribution:"Marilyn's role was crucial... both through her highly         facilitative and inclusive chairing...and because of her own         intellectual contribution to the thinking and analysis that underpinned         the practical recommendations made in the report.
The following areas of analysis in the report derived almost         exclusively from Marilyn's input:            the use of analogies across a wide range of forms of donation and           volunteering, and in particular between the donation of eggs and           volunteering to participate in a first-in-human trial (see Box 1.8 in           Chapter 1 of the report);       the distinctions between various forms of payment: `purchase' of a           thing; `reward' to a person; and `recompense' of a person (see figure           2 on p71 of the report);       the analysis of the gift relationship (paragraphs 4.9 - 4.14); and       the analysis of the role of money, and the very different meanings           assigned to money in different contexts (paragraphs 4.15 - 4.16 and           box 4.4).
These four areas of analysis were essential in reaching our         conclusions as to what role various forms of payment could legitimately         play in promoting various forms of donation..."(a)     In addition, McDonald's research was used in evidence to the Working       Party (c), drawing on Lambert and McDonald (2009).
McDonald's       evidence focused on relational thinking and the need for future policy and       guidance to take account of different perspectives on bodies and parts,       and the context in which decisions were made.
Strathern's work on       surrogacy and money shaped the Working Party's position on compensation,       and this subsequently fed into policy (see below 7) Following publication       of the NCOB Report in 2011, Strathern helped disseminate the findings to       the public and other stakeholders through the media.
There was wide media       coverage of the Report's concerns.
In the context of organ donation for       example, one BBC article attracted 371 comments before the discussion       closed.
(d)     As well as informing public understanding and debate in this way, the       Report also influenced both practice and guidance.
(Full details appear in       the NCOB's 28-page summary of the Report's impact one year after       publication).
(e) The clearest example of a direct impact on       practice is the adoption of the NCOB Report's recommendation by The Human         Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the UK-wide regulator       which oversees the use of gametes and embryos in fertility treatment and       research, as reported by the NCOB:     "The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority today decided that         women who donate their eggs for others' treatment should be compensated         &#163;750 per cycle, and that sperm donors should be compensated &#163;35 per         clinic visit.
"The [NCOB] Council recommended in its recent report `Human bodies:         donation for medicine and research' that lost earnings should be fully         reimbursed for those donating eggs or sperm for others' treatment, so         that they are not left out of pocket.
The Council specifically         recommended that the cap of &#163;250 on recovery of lost earnings for egg         and sperm donors should be removed.
"(f)     (Further, according to the Independent (20-10-2011)"The decision         followed a two-year review, including a public consultation, of the         medical, social and ethical issues.
"(g))     In turn, the change in practice has improved health and well-being.
According to a survey of fertility clinics carried out by The         Telegraph in November 2012(h) &#8212; official HFEA data are       not yet available - more women donated eggs as a result of the change in       payments and "waiting lists have now halved".
Shorter waiting lists       mean that women are less likely to seek assistance abroad (and thereby       incurring greater cost and risk to health where assisted reproduction is       less regulated).
The significance to this to those who rely on egg donations is       illustrated by one recipient quoted in The Guardian in 2012: "I think         of my donor every day...Our donor didn't just bring joy into our lives,         but into the lives of everyone who means the most to us".
(i)     In terms of influencing guidance, the NCOB gave evidence to the National       Assembly for Wales Health and Social Care Committee on the Human         Transplantation (Wales) Bill based on the Report.
The Working Party Report has also been used by the International         Society for Stem Cell Research to inform the discussion of their       recent position paper,(j) using the report to argue that       commercial transactions `are ethically highly controversial' but       compensation is not.
