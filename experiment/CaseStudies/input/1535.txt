     CAC's relationship with HMP Grendon is characterised by a culture of       exchange, in which both parties benefit from the applied knowledge       generated through research.
The research cited has both reach and       significance and can be demonstrated in a number of ways for the different       audiences who have used the research:     Dr Caulfield's 2011 evaluation of the Artist in Residence, commissioned       by the Marie-Louise von Motesiczky (MLVM) Charitable Trust, resulted in       the residency being extended for a further two years (2012 and 2013),       demonstrating effects on and benefits to practice within the prison and       benefits to opportunities available to Grendon prisoners.
The recreational       art group built around the Artist in Residence currently has places for 15       prisoners and resulted in 107 entries being made to the Koestler Trust       Exhibition in 2013 &#8212; the highest number of entries from the prison in its       history.
Of note, the work of the artist and the prisoners with whom she       worked will be exhibited at the offices of the Guardian in March 2014.
The       Chair of the MLVM Charitable Trust stated, "The evaluation demonstrated         the impact of the artist in residence programme to date.
This is turn         was the basis for the MLVM Charitable Trust's decision to fund the         programme for a further two-year phase".
CAC research with BME prisoners has resulted in the prison improving its       cultural sensitivity when applying core values of decency, respect,       equality and diversity.
The research was presented as evidence during an       inspection of the prison, is cited in the publicly available inspection       report (HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, 2011) and as such, is indicative of       the wider reach of the research.
The proportion of BME prisoners at HMP       Grendon has increased as a result of the research.
This evidences effects       on, changes to and benefits to policy and practice within and beyond       Grendon, effects on, awareness and understanding of group-specific needs       and reduction or prevention of harm / negative effects upon staff and       prisoners.
Evidence of this impact is provided in the testimony of the       Governor of HMP Grendon and Springhill, who stated that the research "was         part of our project to better understand the experience of BME people         before and during treatment at Grendon.
This helped to revise our recruitment         processes and the internal environment.
The BME population has now         increased to 27%".
It is further stated, "This research was an         important element in a wider programme of engaging with diversity of         race and ethnicity.
Historically BME people have been under-represented         in treatment services and this had been the experience at Grendon (16%         compared to 25% of the prison population as a whole)".
In addition,       the publicly available inspection report (HM Chief Inspector of Prisons,       2011, p. 18) notes the contribution of the research to achieving key       performance indicators, "2.28.
The race impact assessment on           treatment delivery and other relevant assessments should be informed         by consultation with black and minority ethnic prisoners.
(3.50)           Achieved.
Equality impact assessments demonstrated some         good quality consultation with black and minority ethnic prisoners.
Birmingham City University had been commissioned to undertake a         consultation with black and minority ethnic prisoners about the         therapeutic regime and the results were being applied in a review of         these prisoners' experience of the therapeutic regime.
The report of the         consultation had been made available to prisoners on the residential         units and a series of meetings planned to discuss the findings and agree         actions to improve the situation".
Professor Wilson is the Chair of the Howard League for Penal Reform's       Policy Committee and in this capacity, Chaired the Commission on English       Prisons in 2009.
Professor Wilson's research was among that cited in the       publicly available report of the Commission, entitled Do Better; Do         Less: The Report of the Commission on English Prisons Today.
The       research undertaken by Professor Wilson at HMP Grendon played a       significant role in his selection as Chair of the Commission.
This       demonstrates impact in terms of effects on awareness and understanding of       public and policy audiences regarding contemporary issues in the CJS.
The       Chief Executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform stated, "David         Wilson's invitation to Chair the Commission came about through his         reputation as a leading criminologist in his field, having been a         high-profile prison governor and based on the research that he had         undertaken into the therapeutic community at HMP Grendon.
David led         discussions with ministers, officials, NGOs and the media on publication         of the report so that the findings influenced UK government policy         embedding concepts of justice reinvestment, penal moderation and         restorative justice.
The Coalition Government championed restorative         justice and ministers introduced justice reinvestment pilots,         particularly for youth justice, into local authorities across the         country".
HMP Grendon and CAC remain committed to an annual debate between the       prison and final year students at BCU, evidencing benefits to the       opportunities available to HMP Grendon prisoners.
Around 40-50 prisoners       participate in the debate each year.
Insights into the offending behaviours of the prisoner groups specified       above has resulted in West Midlands Police commissioning CAC to jointly       host four training seminars at the University between 2010 and 2012 to       better train Senior Investigating Officers during murder investigations.
Therefore, CAC's underpinning research around understanding and responding       to diverse offenders demonstrates effects on practice in policing and       criminal investigation.
Evidence of impact is also demonstrated in terms of the continuous and       extensive media presence of the work of CAC members, demonstrating       benefits in terms of awareness of penal issues amongst audiences.
`Reach'       is considerable as reporting has taken place locally, nationally and       internationally.
Professor Wilson is frequently quoted in mainstream media       items about HMP Grendon (see for example McClatchey, 2011).
Items relating       to CAC's expertise in `understanding and responding to diverse prisoners'       has been widely disseminated through these media, particularly relating to       sex offending, murder and serial killing.
These latter three themes are       underpinned by knowledge directly developed through the Grendon       relationship.
`Significance' can also be evidenced here in that Professor       Wilson has been identified in published, peer reviewed research       (Groombridge, 2007) and the higher education press (Corbyn, 2009) as a       leading, frequently quoted criminologist in the media.
