     The publication of the book SAMHC led to two distinct streams of       impact.
The first relates to the       impact of the ethos and approach of the research through The Kairos Forum       for People with       Intellectual or Cognitive Disabilities; the second through chaplaincy       provision in GP practices.
A.
Learning Disability Impact: The Kairos Forum Impact from       SAMHC in relation to       intellectual disability has come about primarily through the formation and       work of The Kairos Forum       for People with Intellectual or Cognitive Disabilities.
The route to       impact from this underpinning       research came through the commissioned reports outlined above (section 2).
Swinton and his       team were commissioned to carry out research and develop training and       teaching materials for a       number of organizations including the Mental Health Foundation, the       Scottish Executive, the NHS       and the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales.
The       commissioned reports informed       the work of religious communities, health and social care providers, and       families.
The very       commissioning of the reports identified a clear need in society for       consultancy, policy formation and       advice for churches, para-church organizations and the government in       relation to specialist       provision for the spiritual lives of people with disabilities.
These       reports had wide distribution, and       became central to the research and education stream that the Foundation       for People with Learning       Disabilities (which is part of The Mental Health Foundation) developed in       relation to spirituality and       religion from 2004 onwards.
From the reports and the research, a number of       teaching materials       were produced for churches, schools, social care facilities and families,       aimed at enabling the       meeting of spiritual needs.
These were made available free online and       widely utilized (419 page       views &amp; 601 downloads).
Combined with a series of teaching sessions       carried out by Swinton,       these resources impacted health and social care professionals, and ensured       that a broad range of       service providers have access to the findings and the educational       materials.
All the reports and       research projects took the model and understanding of spirituality laid       out in SAMHC as central,       since very few, if any, empirically based resources had been available       prior to these projects.
The effect of these projects clearly identified the need for finding       creative ways of       operationalizing the research findings in SAMHC and effectively       communicating it to people `on the       ground', in forms that facilitate understanding, education and effective       training, so as to enable       families, churches and social services to notice and respond to an area of       human experience that       frequently went unnoticed, was often not taken seriously, and for which       there were limited       resources to inform practice.
This insight (arising from the above       projects that flowed from the       findings of SAMHC) led directly to the formation of the primary       impact entity: the creation of The       Kairos Forum for People with Intellectual or Cognitive Disabilities.
The       Forum has been in       existence since April 2012, and uses the underpinning research to provide       specialist services and       resources designed to support the spiritual lives of people with       disabilities       (http://thekairosforum.com/).
Reports and teaching materials from the research projects are now       available online and the research from SAMHC is currently being       delivered to a broad range of       health, social care and religious communities via the Kairos Forum, to       improve provision for the       spiritual needs of those with intellectual and cognitive disabilities       (see, for example,       http://thekairosforum.com/content/everybody-has-story).
The Forum is the first and only university       based, empirically supported specialist provider of resources, training,       continuing professional       development, consultancy, and expert policy advice in relation to the       spiritual lives of those with       disabilities.
It facilitates the crafting and empowerment of `Communities       of Belonging', within both       religious and secular settings, and does this by providing specialist       services which enable and       empower people with disabilities to experience dignity, respect, care,       access and authentic       participation within well formed and empathic communities.
It provides:       (1) a forum for inter-professional       networking; (2) the identification of need, development and introduction       of new and       effective resources for spiritual care, religious practice, support and       accompaniment for people with       cognitive or intellectual disabilities; (3) a consultancy service designed       to enable the       implementation of person-centred modes of spiritual care, support and       accompaniment for people       with mild and severe disabilities; and (4) the development and production       of educational       programmes for lay and professional people and for people with       disabilities.
The following are       examples of its impact thus far:             Many Yet One: Curriculum directory for the catechesis of people         with intellectual disability         preparing for the sacrament of first Eucharist and reconciliation.
This         is a curriculum guidance         document and will be published by the Bishops' Conference Department of         Education in 2013.
It         specifically names Swinton's work as its underlying theological         basis.
Kairos was the advisor and provider of training to the More Than           Gold Olympic organization         which offered pastoral support for the Olympic and Paralympic games in         2012, for whom Kairos         was the official press spokesperson and writer of a nationwide training         programme for the         Christian laity.
Kairos also contributed to the development of the         Transport for London Olympic         preparation consultation paper, providing two direct recommendations         relating to the training of         staff in effective communication and presenting information in symbols.
At the request of Archbishop Vincent Nichols, Kairos is now         represented on the executive board         of the John Paul II Foundation for Sport (JPIIFS), offering advice on         issues relating to disability         for the Roman Catholic Church.
This means that, following on its work on         the 2012 Paralympics,         Kairos now has a direct impact on the Catholic Church's strategy on         theology and sport and is         providing support for the preparations and training for the next         Paralympics in Rio 2016.
At the request of Maria Miller (UK Minister for Disability 2011),         Kairos was invited to         Westminster to discuss its vision for the provision of services.
As a         result of this, Kairos gave a         formal response to a UK government consultation paper named `Fulfilling         Potential':         odi.dwp.gov.uk/docs/fulfilling-potential/discussion-so-far-rich-text.rtf        The Forum has been employed (2012-2013 renewable contract) by the         Catholic Bishops'         Conference of England and Wales as the adviser for all policy making and         Bishops' Conference         disability initiatives.
The Forum has been employed to provide consultancy and training for         agencies, clergy,         catechists and parents in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds.
The Forum developed a programme of training on spirituality for         management and staff working         for Adelaide Care, a private healthcare provider.
The Forum is currently developing a training programme for the         Catholic Social Action Network.
Impact has taken place therefore in relation to: policy formation; the         form and content of         associations between people and groups within the church in relation to         those with intellectual         disabilities; cultural values and social assumptions locally, nationally         and internationally in relation         to the spiritual lives of those with disabilities and new forms of         religious expression; and the content         of the education of people, extending significantly beyond the         submitting HEI.
B. Chaplaincy Impact: Community Chaplaincy Listening The       avenue to the impact of       SAMHC on healthcare and chaplaincy in the current census period       began prior to this period with a       series of invitations to Swinton to speak about the research in SAMHC       at various health and social       care conferences across Scotland and England, culminating in Aberdeen       University hosting an       international conference titled Spirituality in Healthcare Practices:         Integrating a Forgotten         Dimension (funded by the British academy: &#163;1,600).
This in turn led       to the Scottish Executive to       commission a series of reports (see section 2 above), including specific       policy advisory documents       arising from the research in SAMHC: Spirited Scotland.
An         initiative to raise chaplains and health         care professionals' consciousness to the importance of spirituality.
(Scottish Executive: &#163;41,000;       1/4/03); Religion and suicide in the highlands: An exploratory study of         the spiritual landscape of         suicide in the highlands.
(NHS Highland, &#163;11,228; 1/6/04);         Developing NHS healthcare chaplaincy         research.
(Scottish Executive &#163;10,000; 1/4/07).
These reports provided a route to impact as they burgeoned into an       ongoing working       partnership between Swinton and the NHS.
This culminated in 2010       when, as a direct result of       work on the role of chaplaincy in healthcare, Swinton's research       formed the basis of the new NHS       Education for Scotland initiative &#8212; Community Chaplaincy Listening (CCL).
Initially, this project       placed chaplaincy `spiritual listeners' in twelve GP practices across       Scotland.
These listeners       respond to patients who visit their GPs with vague issues and       existential/spiritual questions which       the GP does not have either time or expertise to deal with.
The feedback       and assessment via       PROMS (Patient Related Outcome Measures) indicates that the act of       listening is deeply       therapeutic and healing.
Initial feedback came from 250 patients, six GP       practice focus groups and       thirteen chaplains; it reported very positively overall.
All said they       would like to see CCL as part of       the continuing NHS service provision.
As a result, in 2012, the Scottish       Government asked       Swinton to manage an extension of CCL across Scotland.
This next       stage involves a minimum of       32 pilot sites with more than 600 patients benefiting in the first year.
29 chaplains have been       recruited and 30 CCL volunteers have been trained for this next stage, as       chaplaincy provision in       GP practices spreads across Scotland directly as a result of Swinton's       research; the project is       ongoing.
Impact has taken place, therefore, in relation to policy formation, and       the development and       delivery of public services to support the health and welfare of people in       society.
