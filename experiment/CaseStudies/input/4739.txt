     The Nephrops fishing industry     Once considered part of the cod `bycatch' (that is, caught       unintentionally), Nephrops have become increasingly popular among       consumers over the past 50 years.
Nephrops are delivered to the       food chain as either live animals or raw meat for subsequent freezing or       cooking.
The increased demand for Nephrops has led to the use of       mass-fishing methods such as trawl-capture using nets, which is largely       unregulated within the commercial industry.
Boats commonly collect       sequential trawl catches over an 18-hour day with little standardisation       of methods and frequently no understanding of Nephrops biology or       the damage exerted by capture methods.
Scotprime Seafoods Ltd.
Lack of understanding of the consequences of trawl-capture were       highlighted when one of the major UK commercial seafood exporters, Scotprime         Seafoods Ltd attempted to branch into the lucrative live Nephrops       market.a This company found wide variations in the survival       rates at destination of the Nephrops exported by live "vivier"       transport to continental Europe.
The company partnered up with University       of Glasgow whose research showed that the animals caught later in the day       were in fact exhausted and near physiological collapse from the trawl       methods used but crucially that the potential existed to allow them to       recover by resting in seawater tanks.
As a direct result of these       findings, recommendations were made to Scotprime Seafoods Ltd to reform       their post-capture handling and transport working practices.
"[The] benefits of collaboration between our company and the         University of Glasgow have been numerous and diverse.
[The] results of         trials at sea have shown the need to physically alter the set-up of         catching vessels in order to make them more successful at capturing and         maintaining live Nephrops.
To date approximately 15 vessels have         invested in this way and have boosted their income as a result.
This is         ongoing with the latest being completed in April 2013.
"...General       Manager, Scotprime Seafoods Ltd.a     Following the installation of the on-board recovery tanks on boats in the       Scotprime Seafoods Ltd fishing fleet, the first catch of the day, instead       of the last, is now placed to recover for the remainder of the day.
Following a short transport (&lt;1 hour) to an on-shore facility, animals       are placed into recovery tanks overnight for further physiological       stabilisation prior to transport to market.
University of Glasgow research       also revealed that there is a minimum time which animals should be kept in       the holding facility before onward shipping to customers.
This allows       animals the best chance to recover to pre-capture physiological state and       affords them the greatest chance of arrival in good condition.
The       University of Glasgow research also showed that it was possible to relate       the physiological status of Nephrops to visual cues in the       behaviour of the animals.
This finding allowed the development of a       "Vigour Index"; training staff to spot these cues has allowed animals to       be graded more efficiently and with a greater degree of accuracy.
Since       2008, this practice has been used by all Scotprime Seafoods Ltd staff and       all new staff are trained in its use.a     These improvements in handling at source saw survival rates at       destination of Nephrops following transport increase, with marked       improvements in product quality (as reported by customers) leading to       uniformity in supply.
Production at Scotprime Seafoods Ltd prior to       University of Glasgow involvement was on average 65 tonnes per year; this       value has since risen to 100 tonnes (years 2008-2012).a This       has reflected an increase in live department profits by a similar       percentage increase and the live animal handling department now employs an       additional two members of staff in response to increased production.a     Young's Seafood Ltd.     Young's Seafood Ltd has a 55% share of the UK Nephrops market and       is the leading brand for frozen fish, which includes a breaded scampi       range.
The raw Nephrops tail product &#8212;predominantly sourced from       the company's Stornoway fishery &#8212; is highly susceptible to post-mortem       spoilage, and wastage levels in the company were high owing to poor       handling practices.
In an attempt to reduce wastage and improve product       quality, the University of Glasgow Langoustine Lab demonstrated that       deterioration of Nephrops meat depends on initial storage       temperature.
In 2006, the researchers recommended a `handling window' to       Young's in which the raw product must be sorted, tailed and iced within       less than 4 hours of capture.
Prior to this recommendation, many of the       boats in the Young's fishing fleet did not even carry ice and the product       was only iced at port or within the processing facility.
Data obtained       from Young's confirm the successful implementation of the `handling       window' showing that the mean on-board storage temperature has reduced       from 5.6oC in 2006 to a steady 2.5oC in 2012.b       A spokesman from the company states:     "Professor Neil's work clearly established the benefit of icing the         freshly caught product as soon as possible after landing which saw an         improvement in the quality of the product being landed.
This brought         with it several benefits.
One, the fishermen had less product rejected         for poor quality therefore providing a more stable income for their         efforts and secondly there was a gain in processing yields as the         product had deteriorated less prior to processing and so there was less         wastage through rejects and quality of the meat being produced improved         as it remained firmer."
Improving sustainability     In 2009, Young's Stornoway fisheries successfully attained the Marine       Stewardship Council (MSC) certification of sustainable good practice.c       The MSC is a world-recognised, international body that aims to improve       practices of the seafood industry and promote sustainable fishing of       existing stocks.
This was the UK's first award for a trawl fishery and the       University of Glasgow's input was instrumental in its successful       recognition.
Assessment, certification and annual surveillance audits on       the Stornoway Nephrops fishery have since been conducted by the       independent assessors Moody Marine Ltd.; the University of Glasgow studies       are cited throughout the annual reports clearly demonstrating their       influence on the maintenance of the MSC certification.
The `YoungsTrace'       self-assessment system was implemented across the Stornoway fleet in 2010       contributing to the maintenance of the certification.d The MSC       certification had a positive impact on Young's ability to expand their       customer-base.
"Attaining the MSC certification allowed Young's to attract business         from other UK markets for scampi and European markets for langoustine         for MSC designated products."
and "there is no doubt that certain         European customers would not have purchased product from us without the         MSC certification [it] was of primary importance to them"...General       manager, Young's Seafoodb
