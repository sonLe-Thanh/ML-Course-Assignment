     Impact from War Posters: Weapons of Mass Communication     Staff in the Visual Cultures Research Centre undertake applied research       in collaborations and partnerships with public-facing organisations and       professionals through exhibitions, editorial projects, publications,       archives, web-based material and events.
The research addresses and       confronts issues raised by the visual discourses of conflict and enhances       public understanding and professional awareness.
In 2007, Aulich was       commissioned to curate a major international exhibition War Posters:         Weapons of Mass Communication (WMC) at the Imperial War Museum       (10.07-04.08) that received 47,000 visitors (25,000 in 2008 [A]).
The exhibition was a direct result of the AHRC resource enhancement       project Posters of Conflict (2003-06)       http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/collections/IWMPC.html       [B].
The accompanying database enabled the collection to be       interrogated without the physical manipulation of originals.
As testimony       from the Imperial War Museum attests, `The lead curator was Professor         James Aulich ... his approaches to the material had an important effect         on our museological practices in relation to the understanding and         display of the posters.
The associated book sold 100 copies per week (1         in 18 visitors) with 1,400 sold at the museum in 2008.
This new         accessibility to the collection through the searchable database enabled         popular publications such as Richard Slocombe's British Posters of the         Second World War, IWM Publications, 2010' (Full testimonial on file       [C]).
A Weapons of Mass Communication public seminar hosted at the IWM       featured practitioners Peter Kennard and David Gentleman, publicity       analysts Nicholas O'Shaugnessey, and a representative from the advertising       industry.
In his opening speech, Sir Martin Sorrell emphasised the       affiliations that were brought out by the research between propaganda,       publicity and advertising.
These affiliations were further underlined       through a public display of some of the posters from Weapons of Mass       Communication organised at Liverpool St Underground by CBS Outdoor,       Kinetic, Ogilvy Group and the IWM.
Underground passengers were exposed to       the posters in a way that emulated their original use.
Overall impact for Weapons of Mass Communication grew out of       international media coverage.
The exhibition was featured in the Times         Online 08.11.08; Campaign; The European Journal of         Communication, The Sydney Morning Herald 18.06.11; H&amp;SS         Newsletter, Queen Mary University, London, 06.08; Independent on         Sunday 06.08; Museum's Journal 02.08:50-1; Guardian         Guide 12.07-04.01.08; Mail Online 19.03.09: Times         Literary Supplement 21.01.2011:32; The Times Magazine       08.11.08: 64-71; ww2poster.co.uk 04.01.10 and on over 30 Websites, Blogs       and Forums.
The exhibition was reviewed by Joseph Heller in the New         York Times Book Review; on Front Row (BBC R4); Night         Waves (BBC R3); in the Socialist Worker; Culture 24;       Eye magazine; Time Out London; History Today.

Secondary impacts were created within national media as stories       and features appeared on posters in wartime; Enquiries continue to follow       from the media [D] resulting in features in Daily Mail Online       (19 March 2009); Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, and       local radio stations.
The exhibition also stimulated wider general       interest.
The raised profile of the MMU research team led to membership of       the Arts Council England Subject Specialist Poster Network [E] and       an invitation to contribute to "1914-1918-online.
International       Encyclopedia of the First World War", The German Research Foundation,       Freie Universit&#228;t Berlin and the Bavarian State Library with free access       for scholars and the public to high-quality information.
Impact of Art in Ireland (Barber)     The book Art in Ireland Since 1910 (2013) and the exhibition Archiving         Place and Time (APT) (2009-2010) has established Barber as the       pre-eminent international expert in the field.
APT was jointly curated       with Megan Johnston, Director of the Millennium Court Arts Centre (MCAC),       Portadown, Northern Ireland (NI).
It challenged stereotypical       representations of NI through art and photography.
Funded by the Arts       Council of NI National Lottery Fund, APT received favourable reviews in       the Guardian and AN magazine [F,G].
The Manchester       launch, funded by the Irish Embassy, took place at Manchester Art Gallery       and was opened by the Northern Irish Minister for Culture.
Art in Ireland has been applauded as a `landmark publication' by Choice       [H] and acknowledged as an `overview for the common reader...a       starting point for further critical debate' in Apollo [I].
Barber's work has also had an impact through the NI Prison Memory Archive       (PMA) at Queens University, Belfast, where she contributed to two films, Inside         Stories (2007) and We Were There: The Women Of Long Kesh / The         Maze (2013) providing contributions to cross-community debate around       memories of the conflict.
These films have been screened publically in       venues ranging from art galleries to community centres creating interest       and discussion.
Ongoing Impact     Impact by staff within the Visual Cultures Research Centre goes beyond       analytical interpretation and takes the form of knowledge exchange and       collaboration with artists where visual culture theory feeds creative       practice and vice versa.
Faulkner's `Between States' (Black Dog,       forthcoming, 2014) in partnership with the Israeli artist David Reeb       juxtaposes image and text to address local and global political and       cultural issues.
Beginning in 2010, the project has received support from       the Israeli Center for Digital Art in Holon (near Tel Aviv) [J].
