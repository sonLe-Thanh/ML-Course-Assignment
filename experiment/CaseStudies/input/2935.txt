     Pathways: Following the submission of the 2002 report `Phasing out       the EU milk Quota', DEFRA       organized a meeting in Brussels attended by around ninety key players from       across the EU, to put       the UK case for eliminating milk quotas to member countries.
At this       meeting, Colman led the team       of four economists presenting the results from the 2002 report relating to       the UK dairy industry.
In       2003, following a debate by the European Community authorities &#8212; the       European Commission       (EC) and the Council of Europe (COE) &#8212; it was decided to extend milk       quotas only up to 2015, (EC       reg.
No.1788/2003).
Additionally, the findings of the 2002 report also       influenced the UK       government's on milk pricing and milk quota being cited in reports from       the House of Commons       Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee in both 2004 (HC 335), and       2007 (HC 546-11).
In 2006, DEFRA commissioned a follow-up report from a team of economists       from Drew       Associates, led by Colman.
This study used the models reported in [C] to       analyse the best process       and scenarios for the elimination of the milk quota.
The analysis fully       supported the 2008 move to       "progressively increase national milk quotas before 2015 in order to         reduce quota rents, permit         adjustment and achieve a `soft landing.'"
[1].
Reach and Significance: In 2008, the EU Agricultural Commissioner       announced the decision that       milk quotas in the EU were to be eliminated in 2015.
Colman's work has       thus had impact on:     (i) EU policy discourse leading up to this decision by the Commissioner     (ii) The evaluation of various scenarios for phasing out the quota     (iii) Subsequent analyses of the impact of quota elimination on land use       and the       environment in the EU.
Evidence of Colman's impact is provided by EU policy documents,       supportive testimonials from       those involved in the policy process and the frequency of references to       his work and ideas in       studies commissioned by the EC.
For instance, in 2009, the European       Parliament (Policy       Department B) published a report on the reform of market regulation       mechanisms in which it is       stated that in reference to the 2008 decision to eliminate milk quotas: "following         the same approach         as the analyses drawn up by some economists (Colman, 2002), this         decision was made in         consideration of the fact that milk quotas were undermining the sector's         competitiveness" [2].
The       influence of Colman's analysis is also evident in a 2008 study by the       European Parliament (Policy       Department B) analysing possible future scenarios for milk quota as it       references Colman's work       [B][D][E] twelve times in its assessment of both the regional and EU wide       impacts of alternative       quota elimination strategies [3].
Subsequent to these reports, the EU       decided in the 2008 Common       Agricultural Policy (CAP) `Health Check' to increase national quotas by 1%       per annum, a `soft       landing' that would slowly erode their value and prepare the way for the       quota to expire completely       in 2015.
This evidence of Colman's influence in European Parliament documents is       underscored by       testimony from Richard Ashworth (MEP), member of the Committee for       Agriculture and Rural       Development in the European Parliament, who confirmed that: "Professor         Colman's comments         greatly added to the discussions and were of immense value in the         debate...Professor Colman's         research remains valid with reference to the next round of discussions         around the CAP, with the         current consensus being that the quota will be removed in 2015, but         other controls may be         introduced" [4].
Similarly, Colman's work also impacted on the       response of DairyUK (an       organization representing the interests of the entire dairy supply chain)       to the stakeholder       questionnaire conducted as part of the 2008 CAP health check.
The Policy       Director of DairyUK,       summarised DairyUK's position on the milk quota as follows:            "[The] Milk quota should be eliminated as they were acting as an           effective constraint on the           total EU milk production, (response to Question 19 CAP Health Check           Stakeholder's           Questionnaire).
It would be irresponsible simply to do nothing until 2015 and let           the quota regime expire as           all available studies indicated that his would impose a rapid and           disruptive price adjustment           on the industry.
Instead, the EC should engineer a smooth landing by           manipulating quota           amounts and demand management tools, (response to Questions 20 &amp;           21 CAP Health           Check Stakeholder's Questionnaire)."
He further notes that: "These positions were greatly informed by the         work of Professor David         Colman [references B-E in Section 3 above] in which he         demonstrated clear economic arguments         for both the elimination of milk quota and the gradual expansion of         quota from 2008 to 2015 to         ensure a smooth landing."
[5]     Additionally, it was recognised that the elimination of milk quotas had       implications not only for the       dairy industry but also for both land use and landscapes in the EU.
In       2008, Alliance         Environnement submitted a wide-ranging report to the European       Commission, commissioned by       DGARD, on the wider environmental impacts of milk quotas.
Again Colman was       at the centre of       this work, alongside six other leading agricultural economists from across       the EU [6].
Four years       later, in 2012, the EC (Joint Research Centre) brought a number of strands       together in more       general assessment of the impact of the CAP on agricultural landscape.
Within the final report,       Colman's research was cited, with insights from both [B] and [6] used to       analyse the impacts of       changes in the dairy industry on landscapes in the EU [7].
Timeline &amp; Legacy: Following the 2008 CAP decision, the EU has       continued to commission       studies re-evaluating the impacts of quota removal on the dairy industry.
Colman's work is still       clearly influential in these recent debates.
Firstly, in 2010 the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural       Development "adopted a proposal         on `contractual relations in the milk sector'... to help the sector         prepare for a `soft landing' when         quotas come to an end in 2015."
This proposal was outlined in the EU       report `Evolution of the       Market Situation...' which report sought to synthesise three reports       submitted to the Directorate-General       for Agriculture and Rural Development (DGARD).
One of these reports       (Tonini &amp;       Dom&#237;nguez) contained a review of six suitable econometric approaches for       the quantification of the       economic effects of the European milk quota scheme.
It suggested that all       of these approaches       have merit, and one of these six approaches was the method presented by       Colman et al in [C][8].
Secondly, in 2011, DGARD commissioned a further re-evaluation of the milk       quota system by LEI       (Netherlands).
This report identifies nine key objectives of EU policy       towards milk, one of which is       the structural evolution of the milk sector, again placing the insights       from [C] at the heart of the       narrative, in order to argue for the negative impact of milk quotas on the       structural evolution of the       dairy sector.
On 14th March 2012 EU Regulation 261/2012       (amending EC reg.
No.
1234/2007), put       in place the pathway for a `soft landing', with the update to the       `Evolution of the Market Situation...'       report subsequently noting:     Both the evolution of milk production versus milk quotas, and the         downward trend in quota         prices show that "soft landing" is on track.
In the vast majority of         Member States, quotas are         no longer relevant to limiting production and the quota price has         already reached zero or is         approaching it.
Against this analysis, the Commission is of the view         that no change is         required in the existing framework, which has been providing certainty         to milk producers         since 2008 and is proving its efficiency in securing a smooth         phasing-out towards a quota         free environment.
[9]     Finally, the issue of supply controls remains salient, with the director       general of Dairy UK recently       arguing &#8212; in response to European Parliament proposals to retain a `strong       element of supply       management' after the 2015 quota abolition &#8212; that "the removal of milk         quotas presented the         European dairy industry with `enormous opportunities for growth that         will provide a strong         foundation for the future...
The EU must continue the evolution of CAP         dairy sector policy towards         greater market orientation.
The industry has been building its plans for         the future based on this         expectation" [10].
