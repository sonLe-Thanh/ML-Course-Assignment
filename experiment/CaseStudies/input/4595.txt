     4.1 The pathway to impact     4.1.1 Bamforth's research on the manuscript and printed editions of       Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses [3.1; 3.2], and his status as a       scholar of marvels in 16th-century Europe [3.3], led to an invitation to       collaborate in a major French exhibition, A New World-The Birth of         Modern Lorraine, which took place 4 May-4 August 2013 at the Mus&#233;e       Lorrain, Nancy [5.1].
The exhibition was part of `Renaissance Nancy 2013',       a programme of activities designed to celebrate and recreate the       `Renaissance effect': to bring alive the rich past of Lorraine, to promote       pride in its Renaissance heritage and, by building on Renaissance themes       of curiosity, wonder and discovery, to inspire the inhabitants of Lorraine       to look at their region, which has lost its industrial base, in new,       positive ways.
Having `greatly admired' Bamforth's edition of Boaistuau       [3.2], the curator asked him to contribute his research findings to       further the exhibition's aim of shedding new light on a curiosity rooted       in traditions and superstitions local to Lorraine [2.6].
The 16th-century       experience of marvel was recreated for the visitor through visual impact       [2.5], through the juxtaposition of bizarre everyday objects with wondrous       objects from the world of scientific enquiry [2.3], and through the       prominence of books and book illustration [2.5].
4.1.2 Bamforth, one of just two UK members of a large team of curators       and scholars, wrote a 5,000-word illustrated essay (one of a total of 14)       for the 400-page exhibition catalogue Un nouveau monde.
Naissance de         la Lorraine moderne (Mus&#233;e Lorrain/&#201;ditions Somogy, 2013) [5.3].
Bamforth's essay, `Marvels and the marvellous in the sixteenth century'       (pp.
156-67) articulates in an accessible manner not just how central the       concept of marvel is to the process of inquiry in the Renaissance [2.1],       but how marvel is woven visually into the experience of the everyday [2.2;       2.5].
He also curated seven exhibits for a room devoted to `Prodigies,       presages and signs: the supernatural' (cats.
110-16, printed catalogue pp.
280-83 [5.3]).
They were chosen to exemplify the centrality of marvel as a       feature of the cultural landscape of 16th-century Lorraine, both as object       (in terms of cultural heritage) and wondrous response (a way of       experiencing and interrogating the immediate world) [2.4].
The       predominance of a place-specific marvellous [2.6] was shown by two statues       and an everyday, ironwork object relating to the local legend of the       dragon Graoully, native of Metz.
The omnipresence of the marvellous in       everyday life [2.2] was illustrated by the ironwork support of a cooking       brazier in the form of a flame-dwelling chimera.
Finally, the way marvel       is intrinsic to learned as well as popular enquiry [2.3], and the crucial       role of book illustration in its propagation [2.5], were demonstrated by a       tome on giants (considered an extinct earlier form of humanity), an       illustrated plate representing the `Monstrous Pig of Metz', born in       Lorraine [2.6] with 8 legs, 4 ears and a dog's head (from a treatise on       monstrous births by anatomist and surgeon Ambroise Par&#233;), and a copy of a       1576 edition of Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses, the       illustrated compilation of natural wonders and monstrosities at the centre       of Bamforth's research [3.1; 3.2].
4.1.3 On receipt of the catalogue essay, the curator wrote: `Thank you       once more for your very fine text on the supernatural, prodigies and the       marvellous, which is sure to become an essential point of reference.
It       throws very suggestive light on various sections of the exhibition and I       am grateful for the detailed cross-references you have included.'
Of the       `Pig of Metz', he stressed that `visitors from the region will be       expecting local examples that they can recognise and place', and that `the       exhibition's funders, and especially the municipality of Nancy, are very       keen on this aspect of the exhibition'.
(email 6.12.12 [5.2])     4.2 Throwing light on Lorraine at the start of modern times &#8212; the         visitor experience            A total of 24,295 visitors attended the exhibition from Nancy, Greater         Nancy and the Lorraine (60%), but also from other parts of France (21%),         the EU (7%) and the rest of the world (12%) [5.4]       Visitors included 2,672 children on organised school visits, 3,158         children of school age on independent visits and 3,449 school teachers         [5.4]       For 93.5% of visitors, the exhibition `lived up to' or `more than         lived up to' their expectations, with high scores for the content of the         exhibition (91% satisfied or very satisfied) as well as the spatial         layout and presentation of the exhibits (87.4% satisfied or very         satisfied) [5.4]       77.3% of visitors said their knowledge of the Renaissance and Nancy's         history had increased [5.4]       Contributors to the visitors' book described the exhibition as `very         fine', `magnificent', `very interesting', `fascinating', `well         conceived', `very informative'.
Longer comments include: `I liked         everything and learned new things' (10-year old); `Very good exhibition         with beautiful objects and books'; `Congratulations to the curators of         this outstanding exhibition which throws light on Lorraine at the start         of modern times'; `I learned many things'; `A very well designed,         high-quality exhibition.
What a shame it doesn't go on all summer';         `This is my second visit.
The exhibition really is exceptional'.
[5.5]          4.3 Capturing the singularity and vitality of Lorraine's heritage &#8212;         the catalogue reader     The catalogue was on sale at the museum and available through bookshops       and Amazon.
A blog review of 3.6.13 indicates the reach of the research       beyond those who actually visited the exhibition: `Some books make you       want to discover the historical and artistic heritage of a region.
This is       the effect of A New World: The Birth of Modern Lorraine, a       collaborative publication of the very highest quality that explores the       mysterious Renaissance Lorraine in an original, modern manner.
[...]       Richly illustrated, it offers an unusual account of the attitudes of the       population of Lorraine in the period, avoiding the trap of boring the       reader with long lists of artists and historical events.
Above all, it       appears motivated by the desire to capture the singularity-and vitality-of       Nancy and the Lorraine, offering an original perspective on the sociology,       psychology and politics of these people through their everyday lives.
This       informative volume familiarises us in an appealing way with the complex       heritage of Lorraine.'
[5.6]     4.4 Promoting the museum &#8212; flagship of an ambitious programme of         expansion     A new and wider audience was attracted to the museum, including       11,467 first-time visitors [5.4].
Visitors were encouraged to explore       other parts of the museum, which is housed in the culturally and       historically significant palace of the Dukes of Lorraine and contains       important collections concerning the heritage of Lorraine.
The national         and international prestige of the museum was enhanced by the award       to the exhibition of the prestigious accolade `cultural event of national       importance' by the French Ministry of Culture and Communication.
It is       described on the Ministry website as an `exhibition of international       significance' and of `outstanding importance for its intellectual quality,       its strategic engagement with the media and its remarkable public       outreach' [5.7].
5,000,000&#8364; of public and private funding was awarded       for this and its sister exhibitions (3,500,000&#8364; from the municipalities of       Nancy and Greater Nancy, 152,000&#8364; from the national Ministry of Culture       and 1,348,000&#8364; from corporate sponsors (source Le Monde, 20.5.13       [5.8]).
The major corporate sponsor of The Birth of Modern Lorraine       was the Vinci Group (European investor in infrastructural projects), while       its main regional sponsor was Banque populaire Lorraine/Champagne (a       banking and insurance group) [5.1].
Public perceptions of the image of         the museum were enhanced by the exhibition, with 82.45% of visitors       reporting a more positive view of the Mus&#233;e Lorrain and their intention to       return.
In these ways, the exhibition had a flagship role prefiguring         the museum's ambitious 10-year programme of expansion and renovation.
A high-profile international architectural competition ran in parallel to       the exhibition, with the winning firm announced in Sept 2013 [5.1].
Mounting The Birth of Modern Lorraine in a newly renovated gallery       of the Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine was the symbolic first stage of a       project that is designed, with significant national and municipal funding,       to transform the Mus&#233;e Lorrain into a major regional museum [5.1; 5.3;       5.8].
4.5 A Renaissance for the 21stcentury: the wider impact on         Nancy and the Lorraine region Public awareness of the exceptionally       rich cultural heritage of Nancy and Lorraine was increased, whether by       visiting the exhibition, or by exposure to its widespread media coverage       (as well as that of `Renaissance Nancy 2013' as a whole), at local and       national level [5.8].
Public perceptions of the historic and cultural         importance of both town and region were enhanced, with 91% of       visitors to The Birth of Modern Lorraine reporting a more positive       view of Nancy [5.4].
Civic pride and regional optimism and vitality         were renewed, following industrial decline across the Lorraine,       through reconnection, on an individual and collective level, with the       Renaissance ethos of curiosity and inventiveness.
Two exhibition reviews       in the national press stressed this dimension: `It's the richness of a       past that combines darkness and new light that the inhabitants of Nancy       and Lorraine are invited to reappropriate and defend' (Le Monde,       20.6.13 [5.6]); `We celebrate the past of a magnificent town and the       beauty of its heritage.
But we plunge too into the future by reflecting on       a new renaissance for a somewhat gloomy 21st century.'
(Le Point,       2.5.13 [5.6]) Comments in the visitors' book include the following: `It       makes you proud to come from Lorraine!
'; `What a magnificent Renaissance       and what a Renaissance for the 21st century!'
[5.5]     4.6 A stimulus to local tourism was provided by The Birth of         Modern Lorraine, which attracted regional, national and       international visitors to Nancy.
The museum's own interim impact study       shows that a total of 11,661 exhibition visitors came from outside the       local d&#233;partement of Meurthe-et-Moselle, of whom 7,045 came from       other parts of France, 1700 from the EU, and 2,915 from other parts of the       world [5.4].
Tailored packages including exhibition entry and guided tours       of Renaissance Nancy were widely marketed by the Tourist Office.
Further       detailed analysis of the impact of the exhibition on all aspects of       tourism is underway, and will include the overall impact of `Renaissance       Nancy 2013' of which the exhibition was a part [5.4].
The final report on       this and all economic spin-offs of the exhibition will be published by the       Ville de Nancy in Spring 2014.
