     The LECHe project narrative     The importance of "lived experience" as experiential meaning framed within     specific cultural and environmental contexts evolved from two     conference/workshops held in Uganda in 2004 and 2006 (Conference Report,     2006) between academics and NGO development practitioners.
This led to a     joint Sustainable Development Network for OU academics and MSc Management     Masters alumni Sub-Saharan Africa to which U0A7 (Prof Abbott) was invited to     join.
Simultaneously, UOA7 was invited to explore how formal education     reflects on development practice at a "grassroots" level in a consultancy to     analyse some 60 MSc projects.
These were written mostly by world-wide     practitioners from NGOs, public and private services who had studied OU MSc     Development Management courses resulting in an important paper "Development       management as a reflexive practice" (D. Abbott, S. Brown and Wilson,     G. 2006).
It became increasingly clear that there was much knowledge value in       academic and practitioner partnerships from multidisciplinary fields,       evident in the production of a seminal collection of targeted papers , Environment,         development and sustainability: perspectives and cases from around the         world (2009).
A key feature is the book's diverse authorship,       spanning 12 countries, and bringing together 33 social and "pure"       scientists and practitioners in one volume &#8212; thus unifying an       epistemological narrative drawing on cultural and disciplinary diversity,       and expanding the concept of interdisciplinarity by demonstrating the       validity of practitioner and academic partnerships.
These partnerships further revealed the importance of "lived"       experiential meanings of climate change.
For instance, NGOs such as Food         for the Hungry working in the various conflict and food insecure       regions in the Pader region of Northern Uganda, reported that climate       chaos and unpredictable events had exacerbated hunger crisis to increasing       hunger to the point of desperation to which the poor could only respond       through their "lived experiences" (which were also "lay rationalities".
Arguably, the rich do the same (e.g.
no wind turbines in my back yard!)
(See also Abbott 2009).
It is therefore "lay rationalities" (rather than       scientific ones) that give credence to policy legitimisation and changes       in citizenery behaviour, poor or rich.
Yet, practitioners needed to       articulate the needs of the poor to a global forum but they lacked       capacity and educational opportunities to build academic knowledge,       especially in developing countries.
The arguments for (i) the recognition of experiential knowledge in       meeting global policy challenges, and (ii) OERs that could reach       practitioners and world universities easily were presented to the European       Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU) Task Force on       Sustainable Development for innovative pathway for teaching and research       by Prof Wilson (OU) in 2008, leading to successful funding by the EU.
Derby UOA7 actively contributed to all above aspects.
The significance and reach beyond academia       The project ended only a year ago (2011) and as yet it is in its infancy.
Its reach has to be understood within that context.
A mix of dissemination       and exploitation strategies have been utilised to extend reach beyond       academia, references and links to which are identified in the section       below.
For instance            14 representatives from European Regional Centres of Expertise (RCEs)         with policy remits on climate and environmental change, together with         NGO representatives accepted invitations to participate in a joint month         long e-forum with project academics and pilot students (June-August         2011) Through collaborative group work in e-forums, they created a joint         briefing paper on the importance of "lived experience" of climate change         for informing policy (VCSE link).
March 2012 a policy workshop was held at the European Commission in         Brussels and attracted significant interest from policy makers within         the EU Erasmus Programme and a wider group of higher education         institutions who are concerned with the creation of OER,         operationalizing virtual mobility and linking virtual mobility to         transboundary competence (Public report of project link).
Use by practitioners (who were also students) in their work of skills,         knowledge and understanding at were developed in the pilot.
One         commented explicitly in the evaluation of the pilot: `Skills such as         creating a CBA [cost benefit analysis] and writing an EU report [were]         really excellent and something I can transfer into my working life.
'(VCSE           link- evaluation forum).
Production of a video about the project by Universidad Aberta for a         national television audience which clearly indicates a reach to policy         makers and citizenry (Promotional video link).
Currently the workpackage developed by UOA7 (Prof Abbott) on         interdisciplinary methodology is being used by 42 institutions of higher         education and practitioner agencies (Google scholar link).
The LECH-e project has been nominated for an award by the Spanish         National Education for the best OERs through public voting (Universia           Foundation link).
