     Context: Government policy for the past decade has promoted the       use of alternative dispute       resolution methods, especially mediation.
In the areas of SEN and ASN       there is a statutory right of       appeal to a tribunal against local authority decisions.
There is also a       parallel mediation route.
This       research confirmed the disputatious nature of SEN/ASN decision making and       its underlying       reasons.
Pathways to Impact and Dissemination: The findings were       disseminated as the research       progressed, including through the posting of working papers at regular       intervals on the project's       website and also via the ESRC website.
In October 2009 Professor Harris       organised the       dissemination of results conference at UoM.
All delegates and speakers       received a copy of the       briefing paper [1] which was subsequently cited in the Government's Green       Paper on SEN (March       2011) in its discussion of policy on mediation [2].
Attendees at the       conference included local       authorities, government officials, mediation organisations, academics, a       senior tribunal judge and       members of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council (AJTC).
Impact on advice to parents: In 2009 Professor Harris was invited       to a meeting with senior       members of the tribunal judiciary, including Judge Phillip Sycamore &#8212; the       President of the Tribunal,       and the Deputy President with responsibility for SEN cases (the SEND       jurisdiction), to discuss the       research findings.
The Deputy President later noted that:     "The research did indeed have an impact.
It not only raised awareness         of mediation but         prompted further contact between the Tribunal and mediators who have         forms of block         contracts with Local Authorities.
Initially we designed a letter which         now accompanies each         registration of an appeal with an exhortation to reconsider mediation.
This raised mediation         from around 2 or 3% to something around 5%."
[3]     Around 3,000 appeals are registered each year and there is now a standard       letter by the Deputy       President sent to all appellants advising them of the availability of       mediation arranged by the local       authority, and recommending its take-up.
The research has therefore       prompted this policy so that       cases with a potential for settlement can be resolved more quickly.
The       Deputy President also       confirms that in pilot areas a direction to receive information on       mediation has been issued to       parties to an appeal, which has been "very successful and around 18%         of cases given this         mediation direction then enter mediation", and also confirms the       influence of [A]: "I have found the         book you have written very interesting and with real value for SEND in         formulating our approach on         a strategic basis" [3].
Impact on justice system: Professor Harris was also invited to       meet with the AJTC in August       2010.
The Council's previous interest in the research was evidenced by its       contribution of two       speakers at the results dissemination conference.
Its 2009-2010 Annual       Report to the Lord       Chancellor and others referred to the research, describing the (October       2009) dissemination event       as having been "of particular interest to us both in respect of our         oversight of the First-tier         Tribunal... and our wider interest in the promotion of ADR as an         alternative to tribunal hearings"       [4].
Harris' contribution to the AJTC's thinking is also acknowledged in       the Council's 2012 report       `Putting it Right &#8212; A Strategic Approach' [5].
The research itself &#8212;       particularly the book and the       briefing paper [A][1] &#8212; is discussed at length, prior to the Council's       conclusions and       recommendations concerning mediation; a juxtaposition indicative of its       growing impact.
Influencing Government policy: In its March 2011 SEN Green Paper       (Cm 8027) the Government       consulted on making entry into mediation a pre-condition to appealing.
A       senior Department for       Education (DfE) policy official wrote:     "I am happy to confirm that two of your articles &#8212; Is Mediation in         Need of Promotion?
with         Sheila Riddell and Resolving Disputes about Special Educational Needs         and Provision in         England with Emily Smith (Education Law Journal 2009) [D][E] &#8212;         were, and continue to         be, important in helping us to develop our thinking on our proposal for         compulsory         mediation before parents can register appeals at the Tribunal."
[6]     He also asked if Professor Harris would agree to be a `sounding board'       for further ideas as they       develop.
Further influence on policy thinking around the research has arisen from       Harris' invited keynote       speech in London (26th January 2012), at a Westminster       Education Forum (WEF) focusing on the       Green Paper proposals, chaired by the Shadow Minister for Children and       Families and a Member       of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Learning Disability.
WEF seminar       attendees typically       include members of both Houses of Parliament, senior government officials       and representatives of       Ofsted and Ofqual, together with other stakeholders.
Professor Harris'       speech related the research       to the Government's policy intention of making the system less       adversarial.
Initially, in September 2012 the Government published draft legislation       on SEN (Cm 8438) which       would, inter alia, have made entry into mediation a compulsory       pre-requisite to an appeal.
Subsequently, the policy was modified and the draft Children and Families       Bill (1st Reading, 5th       February 2013) replaced this requirement with one stating that the parent       or young person be       provided with information or advice about pursuing mediation (and if they       opt for mediation, to have       taken part in it) before an appeal may be brought.
Professor Harris, at       the express invitation of the       DfE, made in the light of his research and expertise [7], attended a       meeting with the Department       and regional mediation providers in June 2013 to discuss the arrangements       for mediation under       this new framework.
He subsequently made recommendations to the DfE which       were taken on       board in July 2013 in the framing of the draft new Code of Practice of SEN       to which all local       authorities and schools will be required to have regard.
A senior DfE       policy official notes that these       recommendations, communicated on 16th July 2013, were: "considered...within         the next couple of         days and the majority of them were taken on board at that time and         reflected in the revised text of         the Code which came round for further comment" [8].
In the light of all these developments the research can be seen to         have had a significant         impact in influencing thinking on policy and practice in an important         field of dispute         resolution.
