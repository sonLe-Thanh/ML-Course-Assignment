     Based upon the research outcomes reported in the set of 4 academic       construct volumes (Refs3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.5 above),       specific recommendations for improving Cambridge examinations were made in       each publication's concluding chapter.
CELA has been implementing the       proposed changes in its examination revisions (2010-2013) to enhance their       construct validity and thus their fitness for purpose.
Examples of changes       in the reading paper that have taken place include:            SCF contextual and cognitive validity features for reading are now         used to tag items in CELA's item bank to ensure tests constructed from         one year to the next exhibit comparable validity indices, and guarantee         that distinctions between proficiency levels are maintained.
SCF analysis of tests led to removal of some tasks (gap filling) and         inclusion of new tasks (intertextual summary) that are more cognitively         valid for the highest proficiency level CPE.
CRELLA's research on developing a methodology for establishing         comparability in reading texts has now been incorporated into the         organisation's guidelines for producing a test paper.
The immediate impact of CRELLA's ground-breaking research       in test validation can thus be seen in improved measurement in high-stakes       language proficiency tests (Ref5.8).
By implementing the SCF for       developing, validating, reviewing and revising its high-stakes       examinations, CELA ensures the tests exhibit appropriate contextual and       cognitive features at different language proficiency levels &#8212; see Ref5.1,       an article by CELA staff member, Dr Gad Lim, who states: "The socio-       cognitive framework for test validation can be seen as an elaboration of       the different aspects of a valid test so that these different aspects       might be properly accounted for and validated in a structured and       systematic way".
The result of this collaboration has been that CELA is       able to define the constructs underlying Cambridge examinations at       differing proficiency levels more explicitly.
The SCF also ensures that       due regard is paid to the psychological, physiological and experiential       characteristics of the target test population so that tests are fair to       all candidates irrespective of gender and background (see Ref5.5).
In their 2009 article (Ref5.3), Khalifa and Ffrench (both directors       at CELA) explain how the SCF is helping the organisation in its strategy       to establish and confirm the alignment of its exams with levels of the       CEFR for UKBA/QCA and other compliance purposes.
CELA state that they       promote CRELLA's four construct volumes among their stakeholders to       support professional development and public accountability (REF5.8).
Since 2008, CRELLA's SCF has provided commercial test developers with the       rigorous means of investigating and improving the overall fitness for       purpose of their tests, thereby achieving wider impact in 2 key areas,       which they attribute in part to the involvement and the research of       CRELLA:             Contributing to economic prosperity         Various test providers have enlisted CRELLA's expertise in applying the         SCF to clarify the proficiency levels in their tests, improve their         assessment products and thereby increase candidature and associated         income.
They include:       Language Training and Testing Centre (LTTC) Taiwan &#8212; for the General         English Proficiency Test (GEPT; 2 million additional candidates since         2008).
Ref5.2 refers to increased use of GEPT in Taiwan, e.g.,         48% increase in Advanced stage 1 candidates between 2011 and 2013; the         criterion related validation evidence generated by CRELLA; improvements         to tests, specifications and distinctions between levels through         applying SCF and Weir training its staff.
Cambridge English Language Assessment (CELA) Examinations &#8212; for a         suite of multiple, high stakes, general English language examinations         across different levels and domains (rising from 2 million candidates in         2008 to over 4 million candidates in 2013, in 130 countries).
See         discussion above, client testimonial &#8212; Ref5.8, and website on         underpinning research Ref5.5.
British Council &#8212; for the new International Language Assessment (ILA)         from 2010 (120,000 candidates pa) and the new Aptis tests from 2012         (150,000 candidates pa).
See British Council report &#8212; Ref5.6 and         client testimonial Ref5.9 for central role of the SCF in these.
Trinity College London &#8212; for revision of Integrated Skills of English         (ISE) tests, a suite of examinations at five levels, and validation of         the Graded Examinations in Spoken English (GESE), a suite of         examinations at twelve levels.
Overall, Trinity tests are taken annually         by 600,000 candidates worldwide.
REF5.10 for key role of         CRELLA's SCF and staff in defining multiple levels of proficiency.
Valid, internationally recognised multi-level language examinations         enable institutions and governments to handle recruitment, gate-keeping         and transnational mobility in a well-informed way.
For example,         Cambridge English examinations are used by 13,000 employers,         institutions and government ministries for admission, recruitment and         training purposes, and immigration; they underpin critical selection and         gate-keeping functions.
CELA states that CRELLA's approach and         contribution to their tests has been `particularly helpful in         communicating the qualities of our tests for accreditation and         recognition by agencies' (Client testimonial Ref 5.8).
Fit-for-purpose, well- regarded tests with a high value for successful         candidates play an important part in improving revenue streams for their         suppliers; a logical outcome in a commercial chain of events.
Accurate international language certification through accredited         language tests plays an important role in economic prosperity.
A recent         British Council report (Ref5.7) evidences how, in the developing         world, English language proficiency underpins the growth of national and         individual wealth, and helps drive economic development.
Reducing         unemployment is seen as a means of securing political stability.
Governments in the developing world view the improvement and         certification of English language skills at all levels as an essential         part of achieving growth, by giving domestic companies a competitive         edge in the global economy.
They are also a significant factor in         attracting Foreign Direct Investment.
Coleman (Ref5.11) provides         empirical evidence of English: increasing individuals' employability;         enabling international collaboration and cooperation; providing access         to research and information; facilitating the international mobility of         students, tourists, workers, etc.
He concludes that English impacts on         individuals, on particular industrial sectors (especially service         economies) and at a national level.
Valid certification of English         proficiency through language tests enhanced by CRELLA's SCF plays an         important role in this.
Enhancing educational and employment opportunities 	       Cambridge English examinations, enhanced by the application of CRELLA's         SCF, are used by employers around the world as evidence of candidates         possessing the requisite levels of proficiency in English.
For example,         more than 3,000 educational institutions, businesses, government         departments and other organisations around the world now recognise the         Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English (Cambridge Advanced) as a         quality index of high-level achievement (Cambridge website Ref5.5         and client testimonial Ref5.8).
Improved Cambridge examinations         have had a direct impact on teaching and a positive impact on education.
External certification through CELA examinations has contributed to more         efficient English language learning in primary and secondary schools         with faster progression up the CEFR scales of ability.
In the Italian         State System, for example, empirical evidence shows a rise of a full         CEFR level among secondary school leavers (from Cambridge English         Preliminary (PET) to Cambridge English First (FCE)); increased student         motivation for learning English; greater parental satisfaction; and         improved pedagogical practice (see research study Ref5.4 and         client testimonial Ref5.8).
Research into proficiency levels informed CRELLA's development of the           International Language Assessment (ILA), a British Council web-based           test used to place c.120,000 learners of all proficiency levels into           appropriate classes in its teaching centres worldwide more efficiently           and effectively with fewer false placements than before (see client           testimonial Ref5.9).
In 2012 CRELLA's SCF provided the           conceptual basis for the development of the new British Council Aptis           testing service used by corporate businesses, government           organisations, educational institutions and NGOs worldwide for:           benchmarking students and employees; language audits to identify           training needs; filtering current/potential employees for           promotion/interview, and as a diagnostic tool to identify           strengths/weaknesses of people seeking employment (see research report           Ref5.6 and client testimonial Ref5.9).
Reem Salah,           GlaxoSmithKline, Egypt, describes how: "Aptis has allowed us to           benchmark our employees' English skills easily and affordably.
We have           been able to identify those employees who need further training, and           those who may be suitable for an alternative role within our           business."
