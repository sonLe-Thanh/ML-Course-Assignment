     The `Sisterhood and After' research has succeeded in enriching public       appreciation and understanding of post-1968 feminism in the following       ways:            It led directly to the production of a new, public, digital and         searchable archive of personal voices about the WLM held at the BL Sound         Archive, with two public, multi-media gateways, both of which drew on         the team's practice-based research: an extensive schools-facing website         (online at: http://bl.uk/sisterhood),         permanently hosted by the BL's Learning Programme, which provides 10         detailed but accessible narratives to trace campaigns and debates; and         the online short films produced/directed by Thynne.
The narratives         showcase 120 audio clips alongside the films, supporting images,         animations and a detailed timeline, and are framed with questions for         discussion and Teachers' Notes.
The site links to the Sound Archive         catalogue, where the full archive entry is found.
In its first 18 days,         the Learning Programme website attracted over 12,000 visitors and nearly         30,000 page views.
Between 8 March and 31 July page views totalled         50,241.
SAA research project material was used to enrich national         exhibitions/workshops: 		       Propaganda: Power and Persuasion Exhibition at the BL, 17 May-17         September 2013, featuring extracts from and workshops about SAA,         including two of the films by Thynne.
The Long March to Equality' Exhibition at the WL, featuring extracts         from `Sisterhood and After', 17 October 2012 to 22 March 2013.
Kate         Murphy, guest curator, noted that it `added great depth to the         exhibition to be able to hear the voices of women who had been involved         in the many events and campaigns of the 60s, 70s and 80s that were         represented'.
The research was used directly in public and educational outreach         activities by its two national cultural-institution partners: 		       The BL prepared a substantial series of public-outreach engagements         (March 2013-March 2014) to use and showcase SAA material, including 10         fully-booked 90-minute-long schools workshops for Year 7-13 pupils         (May-September 2013) in relation to the BL's `Propaganda and Power'         exhibition (300 pupils attended).
Russell also shared the research at a         BL Teachers' Forum in London on 6 July 2013 for secondary-school English         teachers, after which attendee Anne Turvey wrote that `I know I speak         for so many people.
It was thought-provoking and moving AND full of         things for teachers to think about "using"'.
This event led to three         further bespoke group workshops at the BL and Russell also fed project         materials into other exhibitions, media events and focus groups.
At one         of the latter, participant Claire Stansfield wrote: `We'll use [SAA] in         A-level politics for feminism / AS history for the changing nature of         women and I've passed it on to colleagues for use in sociology'.
SAA's other curatorial partner, the WL (now based at LSE) used a         public-facing website to share its creative interpretation of SAA         oral-history materials.
The launch of the SAA archive attracted prominent news and social         media coverage: 		       The BBC World Service `World News' programme announced the launch in         its bulletins on 7 March 2013.
Positive articles about SAA were published in The Telegraph (7         February and 8 March 2013), The Guardian (9 March) and The           Times (9 March).
A link to the SAA page on the BL Learning Programme site link was         tweeted on the exhibition launch date by journalists Caitlin Moran and         Zoe Williams, with just under 500,000 Twitter followers between them.
Curators and community historians, teachers and pupils, and writers,         broadcasters and artists have used the research to challenge stereotypes         and offer role models in further pursuit of equal rights and gender         justice, and to bring feminism to life for new audiences.
In BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour on 6 March 2013, presenter (and         SAA interviewee) Jenni Murray used extracts from the archive alongside         interviews with a project team member and a feminist academic to         publicise the SAA project launch and to follow up on a multigenerational         phone-in on `What feminism means to you?'.
The senior producer for the         feature, Kate Murphy, said that `extracts from the Sisterhood and After         Project were used to great effect [in it], bringing these voices to the         wider general public'.
Journalist Caitlin Moran participated in the creation of a video         trailer for SAA.
The TES produced an online teachers' resource-files         collection.
`The Silver Action Project' Performance Art Event by artist Suzanne         Lacy took place at the Tate Modern, 3 February 2013 (with a follow-up         event involving Jolly on 9 March).
A project on older feminists, it         employed Jolly as a consultant because of her SAA role and drew directly         on SAA project findings, expertise and contacts.
BL Lead Curator of Oral History and Director of National Life Stories,         and Secretary of the Oral History Society, reported that: `The project         also makes a useful contribution to the collective endeavours of the         oral history community in the UK.
It is important to the Oral History         Society and public historians in general, to see these kinds of         academic-activist partnerships flourish.
I can see the project impacting         on popular historical understandings of the period as well as the         history of gender relations, but also acting as an encouragement to         younger generations of feminists and activists who themselves want to         explore oral history.'
Feminist Archive South re-used materials from the SAA in their         Heritage Lottery-funded community history project to catalogue Bristol         WLM activist Ellen Malos' archives.
BL Curator Polly Russell has argued of Jolly's contribution to SAA         that it `complicate[s] the stereotypes around feminist history and         feminist stories.
... [W]hen we're teaching in workshops, that is very         interesting to students, and allows them to explore some of their own         stereotypes and ideas about feminism.'
As Abiola Olanipekun,         work-placement trainee at the BL, wrote: `As a young woman, I am not old         enough to recall some of the key aspects of the women's liberation         movement and pivotal turning points for equality in this country.
Nonetheless ...
I feel a wholehearted appreciation for the liberation         movement [and] a genuine appreciation for the project of "Sisterhood and         After" which has documented the movement through dedicated and         uncompromising research.'
