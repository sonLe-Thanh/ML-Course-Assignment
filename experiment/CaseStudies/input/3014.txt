       Pathways: Taken together, the impacts documented below have         developed with respect to UoM's         reputation as a centre of research excellence in the area of class and         cultural participation,         resulting in a series of collaborative research relationships and         consultancies with stakeholders.
There are three main sets of engagement:                A cooperative partnership with the BBC, framed both to           challenge and extend public           understandings of `class' (and of how class inequalities work), as           well as to augment the           corporation's public service remit.
A reworking of class measurement within mainstream market             research.
A range of engagements with governmental and third sector bodies,           developing and refining           organisational, public and policy understandings of how class           inequalities are bound up with           cultural participation.
As one collaborator observes: "CRESC's work has been responsible           for the widespread           deployment of a more sophisticated approach to evidence-based policy           in the cultural sector" [1].
The CRESC approach is able to unpack the ways in which survey methods         construct particular         and limited understandings of `class' and `participation', with the         partnerships outlined below each         utilising the conceptual innovation and methodological strengths of the         CCA approach.
1: The BBC and Public Sociology: CRESC's work on culture and         stratification led to a public         sociology partnership with the BBC in the `Great British Class Survey'.
Its success resulted in an         unprecedented public interest in class and inequality, and has had a         major impact on the BBC's         public engagement and network data journalism work.
As an innovative         online survey, the GBCS         took advantage of the BBC's high profile Lab UK web site to         generate unusually large samples.
According to the BBC producer responsible for the GBCS, the research         provided `a forum for new           types of audience engagement' creating `valuable interactive           content for BBC audiences' as well         as an `editorial platform for many different BBC outlets to discuss           social class'.
He concludes that:         "The research was of particular interest to the BBC, because it           allowed the BBC audience to reflect           on their own position in the new seven part class system and think           about the way class has           changed since the industrial revolution and the social changes of           post-war Britain...
Working with a           team of academic sociologists has been a positive and productive           experience for the BBC, and is           something we intend to build upon, long term" [2].
The results of the survey were publicised through the simultaneous         online publication of an         academic paper in the journal Sociology [A] alongside a BBC news         campaign [6], and led to over         6.9 million unique visits to the story on the BBC web pages &#8212; which         became its most popular in         2013 &#8212; and a huge volume of exchanges on social networking sites such as         Twitter (8,000 in 24         hours, from a search of just four hash-tags).
A large proportion of         these 6.9 million visits were to         the `Great British Class Calculator', an interactive web device drawing         on the GBCS which allowed         users to find out to which of the new social classes they were most         closely matched.
The research         also featured prominently on frontline TV and radio programmes         (28 outlets in total) ranging from         Radio 4's `Today' programme to `The One Show' on BBC 1.
The story was         also taken up across         the national and regional print media (36 titles on 3rd         April alone), as well as internationally &#8212; it was         the most emailed New York Times `World News' story of the year.
As the         BBC GBCS producer         recognises: "Occurring at a time of increasing concern about the           intensifying effects of the recent           economic crisis on social cohesion, the GBCS has encouraged a more           nuanced discussion around           the themes of class and mobility... the GBCS presents numerous           prospects for future           collaboration, and this collaboration has also represented excellent           value for the licence-fee payer" [2].
The resulting public discussion continues in print and on social media,         including a special edition of         Radio 4's `Thinking Allowed' (1st May 2013).
The research         team have also been approached by         groups, such as The Hindu Association, wanting to find out more about         specific aspects of the new         class model.
Indeed, in the wake of publicity garnered, an additional         200,000 individuals have         completed the online survey, more than doubling the sample size to         366,000.
Moreover, the GBCS         promises a new form of `public sociology', and "has helped to           revitalise the BBC's web science           presence... [with] plans to link this valuable collection of           responses on social class to a series of           other prominent BBC Lab UK experiments (e.g.
`The Big Personality           Test', `The Stress Test and           `Test Your Morality') in order to generate further outputs of value to           both ourselves and CRESC.
This is particularly important and timely as the BBC wishes to be part           of the scientific community           and as such the large meta dataset can be a valuable resource for           social scientists and           psychologists" [2].
In 2013, as a result of the GBCS collaboration         with CRESC, the BBC won the         Global Editor's Network International Data Journalism Award, for         their work on the interactive         `Great British Class Calculator, with the award recognising `outstanding         work and editorial         excellence in the field of data journalism' [7].
2: Re-orienting Market Research: CRESC's cultural class         analysis approach, including insights         gained from the GBCS, has been applied to endorse a reworking of class         measurement in market         research.
Though repeatedly discredited by sociologists, since the 1940s         market researchers have         used the social grades (A to E) as class proxies.
However, over the past         two years Kantar Media &#8212; who         run the Target Goods Index, the largest market research survey in the UK         &#8212; have been         seeking new measures for social groups.
Their `TGI Why Code' now         includes: "The "Social DNA"           classification, highlighting nine segments, developed on the basis of           the individual's cultural and           economic capital."
As Kantar note, "work undertaken by CRESC &#8212;           particularly utilisation of the           work of Pierre Bourdieu to re-consider the structuring of social           divisions &#8212; parallels our own work           on the Social DNA... CRESC's work has been both timely and an           inspiration... and alongside the           CRESC/BBC collaboration... has confirmed that this path is both           intellectually fruitful as well as           substantively worthwhile."
Savage, Miles and Warde have been         invited to further collaborate on the         development of this model by Kantar, who see working with CRESC         academics as a long term         proposition and "vital, particularly as engaging with robust and           up-to-date research, as provided by           CRESC, clearly enhances our credibility with clients particularly in           the media sector" [3].
3: Cultural Sector Research and Policy: CRESC's work has been         responsible for the         deployment of a more sophisticated approach to evidence-based policy in         the cultural sector, an         area previously characterised by largely informal, ad hoc         judgements.
At the national level,         interest in CRESC's empirical focus and methodological innovation has         resulted in strategic         relationships with the Arts Council England (ACE) and the Department of         Culture, Media and Sport         (DCMS).
Savage provided ongoing advice to the DCMS on the design of             `Taking Part', the first             integrated national government survey of cultural participation.
The survey began in 2005,           and is still run to this day.
As the (former) head of DCMS research           notes, the CRESC team           were influential in shaping the survey with "impacts...both in             terms of conceptual and policy             thinking (such as how we defined our targets for cultural             engagement), as well as organisation             practice (such as the recent more towards collecting more             longitudinal data)... the team have             continued to strive to bring the latest thinking in sociology to             bear on current and important             policy issues.
They have been a rich source of challenge and support             to me as a social scientist             in government."
[4]         Miles' six-months as an ESRC Placement Fellow in the DCMS `Evidence           and Analysis Unit'           (2009-10), helped shape the Department's flagship `Culture and             Sports Evidence' (CASE)             programme, leading to "key recommendations regarding the             development of the DCMS `Taking             Part' questionnaire, utilising insights and conceptual frames             from... (CCSE), for example around             cultural capital and consumption, cultural `omnivorousness' and ways             of thinking about cultural             consumption in a policy context.
This provided an effective             conceptual vocabulary upon which             to frame the CASE research, and led us to take seriously the issues             of methodological             pluralism, and the deployment of longitudinal qualitative tools to             unpack categories and             meanings of participation &#8212; many of which are subsequently             documented in....[B] and internal             papers and presentations [e.g.
8] written for and given to             staff at DCMS."
[4]         The methodological aspects of this research in turn "chimed with             and helped to inform the             design of" Arts Council England's `Creative People and             Places' programme (&#163;37 million,           2012-14).
The Arts Council confirm the significance of CRESC's input           noting that it: "facilitated           [them] towards a greater understanding of strategies and programmes             to encourage interest in             the arts.
It has done this by stressing the need to clearly             foreground the interests and practices             of those individuals who do not generally engage in formal or             mainstream culture."
[5]          Engagement at regional level, with a programme of work on           cultural institutions (2005-08) led           to a strategic partnership with Culture Northwest through its Culture           Observatory, designed to           influence the development of evidence-based policy at the regional           level [9].
This work           subsequently generated a knowledge transfer network involving 54 non           HEI organisations and           businesses that directly impacted on the regional Cultural Olympiad           (2009-12), with Miles co-developing             and writing the reporting and evaluation framework for the Cultural             Olympiad             programme for ACE and the Olympic Legacy Trust.
This CRESC           contribution &#8212; the           programme manager notes &#8212; enabled the Olympiad "to show important             headline outputs, such             as the fact that...30% of the audience (1/4 million people) were             from areas of no or limited             engagement ...
The specific value of the CRESC approach is an             integrated approach to the             evaluation of cultural activity which synthesises different             approaches and practices into a             coherent approach and robust measures which enable the cultural             sector to demonstrate its             contribution at many levels and specifically to social and community             development, place making             and cultural and non cultural sector innovation as well as to             employment and tourism             development" [1].
