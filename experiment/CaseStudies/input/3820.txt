     As summarised above, this research has had direct and indirect impacts in       five areas:     &#8226; Work with the NUS which has informed their policies and         interventions     Phipps' work in the area of sexual-violence policy led the NUS to ask her       to provide consultancy for the Hidden Marks report (detailed in       Section 2).
This was launched at the 2010 NUS Women's Conference, and the       debate on its recommendations led to the NUS `zero tolerance' campaign       detailed below.
The other main recommendation (for students' unions and       universities to develop cross-institutional policies to tackle violence       against women) has been more difficult for the NUS to implement, although       some successes are detailed below.
The NUS Women's Campaign subsequently       adopted the issue of violence and objectification towards women students       as its lead campaign [see Section 5, C1], and Phipps' contribution to Hidden       Marks was a major factor in the award of the grant to conduct the `That's       What She Said' study [C2a].
This was launched at the 2013 NUS       Women's Conference, where delegates adopted a number of policies such as a       national `zero-tolerance' charter and motions against street harassment       and rape apology on campus, as well as `pimps and hos' parties,       slut-dropping and the Uni Lad website [C1].
It was also debated at the NUS       National Conference, where President Liam Burns welcomed its findings and       stated that it highlighted a need to introduce gender balancing across NUS       committees [C1].
&#8226; Improved public and policy understanding of the issues of violence         against female students and `lad culture' in UK HE     Phipps' research has been extensively covered by the British media and       has been read, cited and disseminated by policy-makers and third-sector       organisations, informing their knowledge of the issue and current and       planned interventions.
`That's What She Said' was featured in over       40 separate articles in various tabloid and broadsheet newspapers,       magazines and student publications &#8212; for instance The Guardian, The         Independent, The Huffington Post, The Times, The         New Statesman, Times Higher Education, the Telegraph,       Glamour magazine and The F Word [C3].
It also featured in a       number of blogs and there were lively discussions on many of the news       articles [C3], as well as a `Tweetathon' hosted by the Everyday Sexism       project in which over 300 men and women posted [C3].
Statements were made       in response to the report by high-profile individuals such as Diane Abbott       MP, Polly Williams (Senior Policy Adviser, Equality Challenge Unit) and       Nicola Dandridge (Chief Executive of Universities UK) [C3] and by YWCA       England and Wales [C3], and the NUS have been in discussions with       ministers and organisations such as the Equality Challenge Unit about a       potential summit on the issues [C2].
The NUS have stated: `The media and       public interest in the research has already facilitated our efforts to put       the recommendations into practice' [C2].
The media and public debate built       on earlier responses to the Hidden Marks report, for example from       Sandra Horley OBE (CEO of national domestic violence charity Refuge) [C3]       and journalist Julie Bindel (whose piece sparked a lively discussion)       [C3].
&#8226; Students' unions attempting to tackle problems associated with `lad         culture' and adopting `zero-tolerance' policies in relation to sexual         harassment and abuse     Phipps' work with the NUS has led directly to a number of students'       unions adopting `zero-tolerance' policies or putting in place other       initiatives to address problematic `laddish' behaviour.
In an informal       survey of 75 students' unions conducted by the NUS in 2012, 96 per cent       had engaged with the Hidden Marks report in some way (passed       policy in their union relating to it or otherwise tried to take forward       the recommendations), and 75 per cent had run a `zero-tolerance' campaign       [C2a] in line with the model developed by the NUS, which requires unions       to take measures including awareness-raising, training for union staff       working in bars and at events, instituting clear reporting procedures,       developing relationships with local police, engaging with sports clubs and       societies, and doing an audit of potentially sexist union-sponsored events       [C2b].
There have also been other responses from student groups: for       instance, in response to `That's What She Said', the Oxford       University Rugby Club launched GoodLad, a campaign which involves       providing gender workshops for players, which sits within a broader Oxford       Students' Union campaign entitled `It Happens Here' which aims to address       issues of sexual violence and harassment primarily through targeting       sports clubs and drinking societies [C4].
In addition to their       zero-tolerance campaign, the University of Birmingham Guild of Students       teamed up with the local branch of Hollaback, a global movement       which aims to end street harassment, to tackle harassment on campus [C4].
The Sussex Students' Union zero-tolerance campaign was also set up       following `That's What She Said', and runs alongside an initiative       within the University to develop a clear process of reporting and to       ensure a consistent level of support and signposting for survivors of       sexual violence [C5].
&#8226; Institutions developing procedural frameworks around reporting and         addressing violence against women students     Although prompting institutional responses has been difficult, there are       examples of universities responding positively to Phipps' work with the       NUS.
For instance, in Autumn/Winter 2012 she gave substantive input to the       drafting of the Sexual Assault policy at Corpus Christi College Oxford and       continues to give advice as it is implemented; if this is successful, the       policy will be rolled out to other Oxford Colleges [C6].
In response to `That's       What She Said', Durham University instituted a group to review       discipline procedures [C7] and Glasgow University Senate are also       investigating `lad culture' within the institution [C8].
There were broad       discussions amongst faculty and students at Sussex University following       the publication of Hidden Marks, with the Students Against Sexual       Harassment Campaign being set up in response; a Sexual Violence working       group was also set up as a collaboration between the institution and       students in 2012, aiming to establish a clear process of reporting and       ensure a consistent level of support and signposting for survivors of       sexual violence.
To date the University has funded training to all key       front-line staff in the University and Union on how to support survivors,       and has started working on draft guidance for all University staff on       supporting survivors and signposting them to specialist services [C5].
&#8226; Governmental, public and third-sector organisations including         students as a key demographic in their policies and initiatives     In response to the Hidden Marks report, the Home Office agreed to       add information on violence against women and girls to its `Student         Survival Guide' published in partnership with the NUS, to make links       with the NUS on their `This is Abuse' campaign targeted at teenagers and       to engage with the Association of Chief Police Officers to try to improve       advice given to students on violence [C9].
There are also a number of       examples of local governmental and non-governmental bodies acting on the       intelligence in Hidden Marks and `That's What She Said'.
For instance, in response to Hidden Marks, Lincolnshire Police       produced a specific factsheet on students and domestic abuse [C10], and       the Nottinghamshire Domestic Violence Forum began working in partnership       with students from the University of Nottingham on an awareness-raising       campaign [C10].
In response to `That's What She Said', the Scottish       White Ribbon Campaign started a collaboration with NUS Scotland on a       series of postcards, aiming to inspire a national dialogue around sexist       banter [C10].
As a result of both reports, the national End Violence       Against Women Coalition have now taken steps to broaden their successful       prevention work in schools to include universities, with a pilot project,       on which they will work with Phipps, planned for early 2014 [C11].
Phipps       has also been asked to sit on Brighton and Hove City Council's Sexual       Violence Reference Group (subsequently the Senior Officers Strategy Group       on Sexual Violence and Abuse and the Violence Against Women Programme       Board), specifically to feed in intelligence on issues around students.
She was directly involved in drafting the city's Violence Against Women       and Girls Strategy, and continues to work closely with the Violence       Against Women and Girls Commissioner on liaison between the council and       student groups [C12].
She also acts as advisor to the Board of Trustees of       local rape crisis centre `The Survivors' Network', giving input       specifically to their work with students [C13].
