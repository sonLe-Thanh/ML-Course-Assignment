     The major impacts of this research are the influence on government policy       and the impact on public debate.
Based on the data from this research       [5.1], the Government developed a new badger culling policy based on       extensive culling of badgers in areas with a high incidence of bovine TB,       which is now being implemented.
This was developed in partnership with the       farming community, which will bear most of the cost.
Details of the       implementation of the badger culling are available on the Defra web site       [5.2].
While the research has allowed the design of culling policies that are       predicted to have a beneficial effect on the bovine TB problem if properly       implemented, it has also highlighted the shortcoming of this approach as a       stand-alone option.
Indeed, the evidence of the extent of culling that is       required to produce any substantial impact has hardened opposition to       culling by numerous community groups.
An example is a recent decision to       ban badger culling on Council land [5.3].
Equally, the research has had a       major impact on public debate around badger culling [5.4-5.6]     The research and the intense public debate have subsequently influenced       the UK government to redirect resources to alternative control measures.
These include development of badger TB vaccination, which has received       increased funding from Defra over the last 5-10 years, with plans in place       to develop a bait-delivered vaccine that could be applied to large       populations of badgers [5.7].
A second approach is based on the recent demonstration that resistance to       TB in cattle is a heritable trait (5.8).
At its May 2013 board meeting,       DairyCo agreed to fund genetic evaluation of dairy bulls in the UK for TB       resistance [5.9].
