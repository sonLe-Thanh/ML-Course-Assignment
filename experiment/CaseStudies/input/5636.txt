     Recent research conducted by the Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights       Organisation in 2011       highlighted the increasing incidence of honour crimes in the UK.
In 2010,       for example, 39 police       forces in the UK dealt with a total of 2,823 incidents, which represented       a marked increase from       the preceding year.
Many more cases go unreported.
In London, honour       crimes are more than five       times the national average.
Since the publication of Honour: Crimes, Paradigms and Violence         Against Women in 2005 and       particularly since 2008 when the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act       was made statutory in law,       the definition of honour crimes created by Lynn Welchman and collaborating       partners in the       Honour Crimes Project hosted by the Centre of Islamic and Middle Eastern       Law (CIMEL) at SOAS       has gained general acceptance.
It has informed multi-agency statutory       guidance published in       2009, as well as good-practice guidelines published throughout the period       since 2008 that shape       how professionals in all public authorities including the police, the NHS,       local authorities and in the       education and social care sectors respond to honour crimes, including       forced marriage, honour       based violence and female genital mutilation.
Each of the following either       directly cite the work of       Lynn Welchman and her colleagues, or include clear references to their       distinctive definition of       honour crimes:            The September 2008 and 2010 editions of the Honour Based Violence           Strategy produced         by the Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and         Northern Ireland         (Appendix B discusses the definitions (pp.
29ff) in line with Welchman         et al.)
(1, below);       The November 2008 and January 2010 multi-agency, statutory guidance         for dealing with         forced marriage, The Right to Choose, cites this academic         publication alone on honour         crimes, using the same definition (2);       The June 2009 multi-agency statutory guidelines, Handling Cases of           Forced Marriage         produced to complement the statutory guidance listed above, quotes         exactly the definition         from Welchman et al.
(3);       The June 2009 Newcastle Safeguarding Adults Board, Honour Based           Violence and Forced           Marriage: Guidance for All Staff Working with Vulnerable Adults         (4);       The 2010 Forced Marriage and Learning Disabilities: Multi-Agency           Practice Guidelines (5).
The author of the Honour Based Violence Strategy referred to       above, Yasmin Rehman, confirmed       in interview the importance of the CIMEL project and its establishment of       a usable definition that       shifted the emphasis away from the notion of honour crimes as a minority       issue to one that fell       within the broader categories of violence against women.
(6) Rehman also       began to develop       training programmes and materials for the police in 2008 in keeping with       these definitions.
She and       Katharine Furniss, Violence against Women and Girls Project Officer,       Islington Council, also       recognised the ubiquity of the definition in current debates and training.
(7) Indeed, the definition is       clearly evidenced in the FCO training materials, which are some of the       most commonly used online       training resources treating the issues associated with honour crimes       within government and public       services (8).
In addition, the Metropolitan Police Service set up a National Forced       Marriage Working Group in       which CIMEL participated to agree definitions and to design training and       guidance programmes.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has published legal guidance on       honour-based violence       and forced marriage that quotes the work of Welchman et al.
(9).
More       broadly, the CPS guidance       presents honour crimes as a class of crimes that represent a fundamental       breach of human rights       and a manifestation of violence against women that transcends particular       cultural mores, stating,       "Such crimes cut across all cultures, nationalities, faith groups and       communities.
They transcend       national and international boundaries."
Internationally, Welchman's work has also received much attention,       particularly in Europe and       North America where courts are hearing increasing numbers of cases in       which "honour" is imputed       as a motivating factor in the commission of crimes.
Her definitions have       shaped the responses of       The Dutch Ministry of Justice dealing with similar issues surrounding       honour crimes in a number of       diaspora communities (10).
In Germany, the Max Planck Institute was       commissioned by the       German government to undertake a study of honour crimes and also referred       to Welchman's       definition (11).
The Canadian Department of Justice has cited the work of       Welchman in its       "Preliminary Examination of so-called `Honour Killings' in Canada" (10)       and Honour: Crimes,         Paradigms and Violence against Women is one of four references       consulted in the Swiss Surgir       Foundation's Manual for Policy Makers, Institutions and Civil Society:         Combating Honour Crimes in         Europe (12).
The work of Welchman et al.
provided a framework of definitions that was       utilised by the police in       the first instance to be followed by consistent application of such       definitions in a range of forms of       guidance and training provided by different government agencies, the NHS       and the CPS.
These       have then been utilised in daily practice by teachers, doctors, lawyers,       social workers, and interest       and lobbying groups as, for example, in Islington where the Council       `periodically holds training and       workshop events delivered either by the forced marriage unit or some of       the leading voluntary       sector organisations in this field.'
