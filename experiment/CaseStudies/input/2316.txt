     Use of tacrolimus as the first line immunosuppression agent in liver       transplantation had begun to climb from 1999 onwards, although trials at       this stage had not demonstrated an unambiguous improvement over       ciclosporin.
The research by Burroughs firmly established tacrolimus as       the optimal calcineurin inhibitor to use in immunosuppressive regimens       following liver transplantation, and has thus changed standard clinical       practice in the UK and worldwide.
Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression has       become the "gold-standard".
The results of the trial were confirmed in a       subsequent Cochrane meta-analysis of 16 trials which showed that treating       100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of ciclosporin would avoid acute       rejection and steroid-resistant rejection in nine and seven patients,       respectively, and graft loss and death in five and two patients [a].
In the US, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) and       Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) Annual Data Report       2010 stated that; "Immunosuppressive strategies based on tacrolimus and         mycophenolate continue to be the dominant early regimen.
In 2009, the         alternative calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine was used relatively         infrequently (7.3%) compared with tacrolimus (85.8%)" [b].
In 2011, they reported that; "Initial immunosuppression for most         recipients is tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), commonly in         conjunction with steroids... By 1 year after transplant, most patients         are no longer taking steroids and are taking tacrolimus with or without         MMF.
With these immunosuppressive regimens, acute rejection occurs in         less than 20% of recipients during the first year" [c].
Of       14,658 patients transplanted between 2002 and 2010 in the US, 92% (13,515)       were on tacrolimus [d].
This landmark study therefore changed clinical practice and provided a       clear benefit to patients.
A 2006 meta-analysis of 16 trials demonstrated       that tacrolimus reduced mortality by 15% and graft loss by 27% compared to       ciclosporin [e].
Assuming 550 liver transplants per year in the UK       since 2008, we can estimate that, with 90% of patients treated with       tacrolimus and 10% ciclosporin, tacrolimus-based immunosuppression has       resulted in 165 grafts and 192 lives being saved in total for the period       2008-13.
