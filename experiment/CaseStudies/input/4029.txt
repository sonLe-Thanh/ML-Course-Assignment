     IMPACT: Influencing practice within the healthcare setting, reducing         environmental         microbial contamination and commercial sales of copper surfaces (2008 &#8212;         date)       Data generated from the world's first clinical assessment of antimicrobial       copper surfaces,       undertaken by Aston, at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham raised awareness,       nationally and       internationally (S5.1; S5.2; S5.3).
As a result of this seminal research,       the sales of copper surfaces       have increased significantly within the UK and many healthcare       establishments, nationally and       internationally, are now using copper touch surfaces on their wards as a       measure to reduce       infections.
Director of the Copper Development Association quotes: "It         is remarkable to note that         the first results from Selly Oak were announced as recently as 2008 and         just over 4 years later,         there are more than 50 healthcare facilities around the world where         copper has been installed.
In         the UK, 5 NHS hospitals have deployed copper as part of their infection         control bundle."
(S5.2).
Aston's contribution to copper research has helped lay the cornerstone of       the evidence of copper's       clinical efficacy, translating clinical and laboratory findings into       practical, potentially life-saving       applications (S5.2; S5.3).
In addition, raising awareness of copper's       contribution to reduce HAI has       been achieved through practitioner (Healthcare Supply Chain) engagement       conferences within the       UK (e.g.
Clarendon Suites, Birmingham, 24th April, 2012).
IMPACT: Reducing post-surgical skin site infection and influencing         policy change (2007 &#8212; date)       Data generated from our published research into improved skin antisepsis       has influenced practice       within the NHS and also policy within the UK National EPIC 2 guidelines       (Evidence-based       guidelines for preventing healthcare-associated infections in NHS).
Indeed, ChloraPrep&#174;       (Carefusion), following recommendation in EPIC 2 guidelines in 2007, is       widely used in clinical       practice and is recommended as the standard first choice antiseptic for       pre-surgical skin antisepsis       nationally and internationally (http://www.chloraprep.co.uk/evidenceBasedGuidelines.html).
The       use of ChloraPrep&#174; for pre-surgical skin antisepsis has       impacted upon improved patient health       within healthcare as the formulation significantly reduces the number of       both superficial and deep       post-surgical infections (S5.4; S5.5).
IMPACT: Development and Marketing of Novel Disinfectants and Biocides         (2008 &#8212; date)       Aston's novel disinfectant, EuClean&#174;, was evaluated in the       clinical setting, thus raising awareness       within the NHS (Birmingham Children's Hospital user feedback trial, 2009)       and the data is now in       the public domain.
A full European patent is now held (S5.6; S5.9)       (granted 5th July 2013) allowing       Insight Health Ltd (Industrial partner on KTP/EPSRC grants) to licence the       product, potentially in a       variety of formats (wipes, solution, spray).
Following feedback from the       Birmingham Children's       Hospital regarding the `strong' smell of the wipes, a decision was made to       modify the disinfectant       formulation without loss of efficacy to satisfy customer need, thus       demonstrating impact on       company decisions and product development.
The first production run of       EuClean&#174; has now been       made and used as samples within the healthcare setting to engage potential       customers.
Sales of       EuClean&#174; into the NHS and other establishments (care       facilities/hospices/schools) are expected by       2014 (S5.6).
Furthermore, Aston's publications (S3.4 and 5) have had a       significant impact on       raising awareness of the product and has led to a raised number of       enquires by potential       customers and Pharma companies at Insight Health in 2012-2013 (S5.6).
Through collaboration with Insight Health Ltd, we have also developed a       novel germination biocide       (2011) which eliminates the spores of C. difficile.
Based on the       novel mechanism of our       formulation a patent has been filed (S3.6; S5.10).
This research has now       been adopted by Insight       Health Ltd thus generating commercial awareness and activity through       increased enquires by       manufacturing and Pharma.
In addition, Insight Health is now in a position       to licence the product.
This aspect of Aston's research was peer reviewed by a KTP project       assessment panel and       awarded a significance and impact grade of `outstanding' (S5.7; S5.8).
