     Prostate cancer screening is one of the most controversial healthcare       topics globally.
Prostate cancer kills over 11,000 men per annum in the       UK.
Many prostate cancers can be identified when potentially curable       following screening with a PSA blood test and prostate biopsy, but it is       not possible to identify which tumours will become aggressive or       life-threatening (the vast majority will not).
Screening leads to large       numbers of men being diagnosed and suffering harms related to the       diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer in the context of small and       uncertain benefits &#8212; hence the current UK policy not to recommend       screening.
Our research has provided the evidence-base for this policy and       has had the following specific impacts:     The establishment of UK policy and origin of the impact     UK policy was established in a letter from the DH to all UK health       authorities and clinicians in 1997, stating that: "Population screening       for prostate cancer, including the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA)       as a screening test, should not be provided by the NHS or offered to the       public until there is new evidence of an effective screening technology       for prostate cancer".
[a] This was based directly on two cited systematic       literature reviews, one led from UoB.
[1] The policy has remained unchanged       throughout the REF impact reporting period, based on this original policy       statement.
Implementing UK policy     A National Screening Committee (NSC) Scientific Reference Group       (including UoB Donovan and Lane as members) launched the Prostate Cancer       Risk Management Programme (PCRMP) in 2002.
PCRMP issued on-line and paper       documents containing information about PSA testing, prostate cancer       diagnosis, and treatment, based on evidence from the UoB systematic       review[1] to enable patients to make informed decisions about       screening.
[b] PCRMP documents were revised in 2009[c] with UoB Donovan       given first acknowledgement (p.2) for contributing evidence from the       review[1] and ProtecT feasibility study.
[2] The PCRMP remains the primary       source of information for UK GPs and men.
Low levels of UK PSA-testing have been corroborated by independent       research in 2004 showing the rate of PSA-testing in primary care of 6% of       eligible men;[d] UoB research confirmed this rate (6.2%) in 2008.
[8]     Evaluating the benefits and harms of screening     UK policy has led to much lower levels of incidence and treatment of       localised prostate cancer compared with countries where PSA testing has       been widespread since the 1980s: for example in the USA (as shown by our       research[7]), and Canada, Australasia, Northern and Western Europe.
[e]       Evidence for a potential prostate cancer-specific mortality benefit from       screening comes from a relatively robust European RCT,[f] published       alongside a USA RCT showing no benefit from screening.
[g] Our research has       provided evidence about the harms of screening.
A cohort study of men       undergoing prostate biopsy in the ProtecT study showed that 1.3% required       hospital admission and 10.4% consultation with a doctor because of       post-biopsy symptoms including pain, fever, and blood in urine, faeces and       ejaculate.
[4] Among the two-thirds of men who received a negative or       inconclusive biopsy result, around 20% reported high distress persisting       up to 12 weeks.
[5] Concerns about the harms caused by prostate cancer       diagnosis and treatment in the context of uncertain benefit, and       increasing realisation that high levels of PSA-testing did not reflect       clinical need, led to a policy review in the USA in 2011.
The review       focussed on the harms and uncertain benefits[h] and so in 2011, USA policy       changed explicitly not to recommend prostate cancer screening &#8212; 14 years       after the 1997 UK policy decision.
Formal review of UK policy in 2010     The UK NSC formally reviewed policy for prostate cancer screening in 2010       using evidence from an independent option appraisal analysis based on       ProtecT trial data (acknowledged, p.xi).
[i] The appraisal analysis       estimated rates of diagnosis, potential benefits and harms of treatment,       as well as impact on survival and costs to the UK economy of introducing       prostate cancer screening at age 50 years, annually, or every two or four       years, using statistical modelling.
The harms of treatment always       outweighed any possible benefit of screening in each potential       scenario.
[i] The clinical costs alone, without administrative costs, were       estimated to be &#163;0.6 to &#163;1.7 billion per year.
[i] The 2010 review       concluded that UK policy should remain as established in 1997, and       re-iterated that any change needed to await evidence from this research       team's ProtecT[3] and CAP[6] RCTs.
[j]     Health Technology Assessment in the UK, review 2013     This review, written by an independent team, specifically identified the       ProtecT study as "The outstanding example of 143 projects for screening       and diagnostics funded by the HTA programme," and noted ProtecT had       "affected clinical practice ... by allowing the UK to reaffirm its policy       of no routine screening" and through its qualitative research that       "pioneered ways to involve patients" in recruitment, and research on the       psychosocial effect of screening.
[k, page 1280]     In summary, UoB-led research established UK policy in 1997, and UoB-led       and collaborative research has supported policy implementation since then,       including providing evidence for the formal confirmation of UK policy in       2010.
UK policy, underpinned by this research, has ensured that knowledge       about prostate cancer screening has increased, very many men have avoided       known harms of testing, and the UK economy has saved billions of &#163;s every       year.
