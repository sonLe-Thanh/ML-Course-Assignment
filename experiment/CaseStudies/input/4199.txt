     Since 2008 the rotomoulding research group at QUB has continued to make a       major contribution to       the understanding of the process, the development of improved rotomoulding       grade polymers,       advances in the application of high performance polymers for more       demanding product       applications and novel developments in rotomoulding technology aimed at       improving the efficiency       and versatility of the process [1,2].
Global Industrial Training Seminars       Since 2008 QUB staff have trained over 400 personnel from companies       throughout the world in the       latest processing technologies arising from QUB rotational moulding       research.
These training       seminars have been located in rotomoulding hotspots throughout the world.
Establishment if this       industry in developing countries, such as Thailand, would not have been       possible without       knowledge transferred from QUB [3].
Furthermore developed countries, such       as Australia and New       Zealand have significantly benefited.
Leisa Donlan, Chief Executive       Officer, Association of       Rotational Moulders Australasia has stated "Your contribution allows         our members to quantify and         strive toward global industry best practice and the independent nature         of your position means that         we can confidently provide our members access to your workshops without         any concerns about         competitive issues.
We believe there will be substantial benefits to the         industry through the         training" [4]     Rotolog       First marketed via a university spin out company, Rotosystems, which was       sold to Ferry Industries,       USA one of the largest rotational moulding suppliers in the world in 2003.
It has since become           the standard method for rotational moulding process control, used           around the world.
Beyond 2008 Ferry Industries continue to successfully market this product       [5], with its proven use       significantly reducing new product development times with consequent       savings in raw materials,       energy and labour.
It furthermore ensures consistency of part properties       which again companies to       assure part quality and reduce process scrap.
RotoSim       This software has been licensed for commercial use via Rotomart [6].
The       total number of licences       for RotoSim for the period 2008-2013 stands at 74 to 27 counties at a cost       of $1560 per licence       (sales total $115,440).
The majority of licences have been bought and used       by rotomoulding       companies, mould manufacturers and polymer manufacturers.
It           continues to be the only           process simulation software available to the rotomoulding industry       [7].
Rotocooler       This device reduces cooling times for the rotomoulding process by up to       40% with production rate       increase by up to 15%.
In 2013 QUB set up an exclusive licence deal with       German company Maus       [8].
The Rotocooler product was launched in June 2013 and to date 5 units       have been sold within       Europe and USA at approximate cost of &#8364;10,000 per unit.
The market is       global and Maus expect to       sell 200 units per year by 2018.
Materials       The work on multi-layered products conducted in collaboration with       Total Petrochemicals (one of       the top 5 petrochemical companies in the world) has led to a number of new       product developments       since 2010, including skin/foam/skin constructions and multi-layered         fuel tank (both using TP-Seal       technology).
Total Petrochemicals exclusively used QUB facilities for       product development       and pilot trials.
Process setup is performed on location by QUB staff at       rotomoulding companies       using TP-Seal in Japan, Germany, Italy and USA; supplying companies such       as BMW, Ducati,         Harley Davidson and Honda.
The environmental impact is highly significant since cross-linked       polyethylene was used in fuel       tank manufacture prior to 2010.
This material was permeable to fuel,       permitting hydrocarbons and       toxins to be release to the atmosphere.
The new TP Seal multilayer         technology is resistant to         permeation of fuel and meets all US Environmental Protection Agency fuel         permeation         regulations introduced in 2010.
Total Petrochemicals have also collaborated with QUB to       develop a new rotomouldable bio-based sustainable       material (Bio-TP Seal) recently showcased in a concept       car at both the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2011 [9] and       Paris Motor Show in 2012.
This is the world's first car         to be produced using sustainable polymer materials         in place of metal parts.
This has a light-weight skin-foam-skin       material produced from sustainable poly lactic       acid (derived from Maize and Sugarbeet).
Demonstration       car components were produced by QUB staff on       secondment at Total.
Reactive liquid polymers in which the polymerisation process occurs       inside the mould present an       exciting opportunity for the rotational moulding industry in terms of       engineering material properties       and significantly reduced cycle times (from 40 mins.
to 5 mins.
for a 5mm       thick moulding).
The       work done on reactive materials at QUB has led to a number of       companies introducing these       materials into production including one of the largest rotomoulders in the       US, Centro Inc (suppliers       to companies such as Caterpillar, John Deere etc.)
