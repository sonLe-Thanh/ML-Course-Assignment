     Glynd&#373;r researchers were named as inventors in 2 of the patents of BSH       Electrodomesticos Espana S.A from the project, in recognition of the       contributions arising from their research.
These patent applications are:            Grout, V. &amp; Picking, R., "Assembly and Method for Monitoring at         Least One Household Appliance", (EP2302312 (A1) " 2011-03-30) European           Patent Office Patent No.
09382180.9 - 1266, 11th November 2009         (with others from the EU FP6 `EASYLINE+' project - Proprietor BSH         Electrodomesticos, Spain).
[source a]        Grout, V. &amp; Picking, R., "Assembly and Method for Monitoring a Set         of Household Appliances", (EP2302605 (A1) " 2011-03-30) (Grout, V. &amp;         Picking, R., with others from the EASYLINE+ project - Proprietor BSH         Electrodomesticos, Spain).
[source b]           Evaluation of the challenges of installing RFID in enclosed environments       such as fridges and washing machines contributed to the "Design for all"       programme at BSH's central technology unit in Germany.
In the Design for       all programme there is a vision that in a few years there will be       appliances that can be integrated in an intelligent house, including those       that users will be able to control and monitor on a display.
Siemens (BSH)       was a partner in the Easyline+ consortium, and since then they have       developed further concepts in smart home technologies, for example a range       of Siemens smart homes appliance concepts which were exhibited at IFA       2012, the largest exhibition of consumer technology in Europe          http://itersnews.com/?p=11708.
Some of the functionalities on show       were directly informed by Easyline+ (e.g.
the Siemens `homeConnect'       system, which is very similar to the Easyline+ E-servant, and the       controlling of appliances with mobile/tablet remote devices).
[source         c]     BSH Electrodomesticos has reported that the company learned valuable       lessons from the research that have impacted their strategy not to       implement the results of their project commercially until the technologies       improve in reliability and affordability in kitchen environments       (particularly RFID tagging and readers), and until these technologies       become more mainstream in consumer retail.
[source d]     A BBC television news story enabled widespread public awareness of the       user interface concept developed by the Glynd&#373;r researchers and the       achievements of the research.
[source e]     The Glynd&#373;r researchers contributed to STEM education in the region by       engaging with and visiting a number of high schools (6 in all -       names/dates available on request) to explain the purpose, conduct and       achievements of the EasyLine+ project in the context of future healthcare       technologies.
The largest of these events was held at Glynd&#373;r in March       2011, when over 100 schoolchildren and their teachers were shown the       Easyline+ project as part of the BCS Computers at School conference       series.
