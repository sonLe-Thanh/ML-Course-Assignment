     The body of research published by the Cosstick group from the 1990's       through to the present, has described a wealth of information relating to       the chemistry and biochemistry of the 3'-sp linkages.
Oligonucleotides         containing this 3'-sp linkage are an essential component in a DNA       sequencing method known as SOLiD&#8482; (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation       and Detection).
SOLiD sequencing was launched by Applied Biosystems Inc       (ABI, now incorporated into Life Technologies as of 2008) in 2007 and the       SOLiD sequencing instruments became commercially available in 2008.6,7       The SOLiD method is based on sequencing by ligation and uses universal       sequencing primers (essentially short oligonucleotides containing the 3-sp       linkage) to interrogate the DNA template to be sequenced.
The sequence is       read through rounds of hybridisation, ligation, detection and cleavage.
The cleavage step removes the fluorescent label (required for the       detection step) from the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide and resets the       system for the next round of hybridisation and ligation, so that the next       nucleotide can be sequenced.
The specific cleavage step of the 3'-sp       linkage, which is conducted under mild conditions compatible with the       requirements of the SOLiD method using aqueous silver ions as demonstrated       by Cosstick,1 is crucial: at the time when the method was       developed, no other of DNA modification was known to work in SOLiD       sequencing.
Details of the sequencing method and the role of the 3'-sp       linkage are clearly evident from the patents of McKernan8 and       from a review article on sulfur analogues of nucleic acids by Zon.9       Cosstick's chemistry was thus decisive in enabling implementation of SOLiD       sequencing.
It was subsequently shown that SOLiD sequencing can also be       performed in what is known as "the reverse direction" using the isomeric       5'-sp linkages,8,9 but in this case an additional step is       necessary to remove the 3'-phosphate prior to ligation.
In 2006, ABI were working on the development of their SOLiD sequencing       method and needed to produce oligonucleotides containing the 3'-sp       linkages on a large-scale, as these were essential reagents for the SOLiD       instruments.
Their synthetic approach to the large-scale synthesis of       these oligonucleotides was principally based on scaling-up the synthetic       procedures published by Cosstick in 2004.2 On invitation from       Dr Gerry Zon (then director of sequencing chemistry), Cosstick visited the       ABI chemistry labs (Foster City, CA, USA) in October 2006 for detailed       discussions relating to some of the difficulties the chemistry sequencing       group had encountered with the synthesis of 3'-sp modified       oligonucleotides.
At that time there was considerable urgency to establish       an efficient method for the production of the 3'-sp modified       oligonucleotides in order to meet the demand for these reagents when the       instruments became commercially available.
In terms of their performance, the latest SOLiD instruments (5500 series       genetic analysers) deliver greater than 90 giga base-pairs of sequence       information in one day and a 7 day run can complete the sequence of the       human genome.
The two-base encoding, which is unique to the SOLiD method,       provides exceptional sequencing accuracy at &gt;99.94%, (for       further information see: http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/brochures/cms_057511.pdf),10       as each nucleotide in the sequence is essentially read twice.
The SOLiD       technology is one of several so-called second/next-generation sequencing       systems (together with instruments from Illumina, Roche and to a lesser       extent Helicos) which were available as of 2008.
Each of these sequencing       systems seems to have its own advantages and limitations, although in 2011       the SOLiD system was reported to have the lowest reagent cost needed         to reassemble a human genome11 and came top in the J.P.       Morgan Next Generation Sequencing Survey12 (published in 2010)       for accuracy.
Accuracy was also shown to be the most important attribute       when choosing a DNA sequencing system.12     The estimated sales value of SOLiD sequencing systems to Life         Technolgies is also presented in the J.P. Morgan survey12         and rose from zero in 2007 to $68 million in 2008, $100million in 2009         and predicted sales of $136.9 million in 2010, $178 million in 2011 and         $222.5 million in 2012 (figures based on J.P. Morgan estimates and       company reports12).
In 2010, only two years after becoming       commercially available, the SOLiD instrument was estimated to have about       20% market share for second/next-generation sequencing and was predicted       to rise to 22.6% (second largest market share after Illumina) by 2012.12       New jobs created by commercialization of SOLiD sequencing include       USA-based manufacturing of consumable reagents, world-wide hiring of       technical specialists to support customers, and (especially) world-wide       sample preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis at       service-provider facilities.
The benefit of the SOLiD sequencing system goes beyond that of generating       economic impact, as the technology is now enabling patients to benefit         from personalised medicine derived from DNA sequence information.
For example, whole genome sequencing (conducted with the SOLiD 4       instrument) of twins with dopamine-responsive dystonia, a clinically       complex neurological movement disorder, that is normally treated with       L-dopa, identified unexpected mutations in the gene encoding sepiapterin       reductase.
This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of co-factors       required for the synthesis of dopamine and seratonin.
Supplement of the       L-dopa therapy with a serotonin precursor resulted in considerable       clinical improvements in both twins.13     The exceptional accuracy of the 2-base encoding means that SOLiD       sequencing is ideally suited to cancer research/diagnosis, because tumors       contain mixed sub-populations with different mutations.
Deep-sequencing on       the SOLiD platform has revealed differential expression of microRNAs in       favourable versus unfavourable neuroblastoma (the most common extracranial       solid tumor of childhood) and provides a reliable method to assess the       aggressiveness and hence prognosis of the tumor.14 Whilst just       two specific examples are presented here, they indicate the tremendous       scope of the SOLiD sequencing technique to aid diagnosis and treatment of       a wide range of diseases.
There is a list of over 100 publications resulting from SOLiD sequencing       at the Life Technologies website which cover applications on: sequencing       accuracy, bioinformatics, de novo sequencing, targeted resequencing and       transcriptome analysis (further details available at: http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Sequencing/Next-Generation-Sequencing/Publications-Literature.html       )10     The wealth of research that was conducted by the Cosstick group on DNA       containing the 3'-S-phosphorothiolate linkage has been absolutely       crucial to the development of SOLiD sequencing.
The contribution that the       work in Liverpool made to the SOLiD programme has been corroborated by Dr       Gerry Zon15 (letter available) who was directing the ABI       chemistry sequencing group in Foster City (USA) at the time SOLiD       sequencing was being developed.
To quote from Dr Zon's letter, "the         scale-up of the synthesis of the phosphorothiolate-containing DNA         reagents had to be done in a very short period of time, because of         competing sequencing techniques which were due to come on the market.
It         was an enormous benefit therefore to be able to use and adapt your         published procedures, particularly the automated synthesis of the         phosphorothiolate oligomers you published in 2004" (reference 2).
To       quote further, "from the work you had published (reference 3 is       quoted in the letter, it was apparent that) the phosphorothiolate         reagents would be fully compatible with all aspects of the sequencing         technique (and) gave ABI confidence to commit to the technique".
