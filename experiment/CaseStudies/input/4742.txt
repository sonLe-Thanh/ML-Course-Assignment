     The images created by Kesseler during his work with Kew are visually       stunning and bring about engagement with the subject, resulting in impact       on public understanding of plant biology.
The books Pollen, Seeds       and Fruit, are specifically designed to appeal to the wider public       with the further aim of increasing public understanding and support for       the conservation work of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Millennium       Seed Bank Partnership (the largest ex-situ plant conservation project in       the world).
The reach of Kesseler's impact is evidenced by sales figures       and media coverage of his work, and its significance by the importance of       the research to scientific, publishing, educational and creative       communities.
Kesseler's images enable what was only previously accessible to a small       number within the scientific community to reach a global audience.
On       Kew's website, Stuppy describes the images produced as a `key         attraction of the books'.
In 2012, images from Seeds were       used as part of a Kew produced documentary Beyond the Gardens: The         Millennium Seedbank Partnership which has been viewed by c. 9,500       people on YouTube.
In 2011 Jonathan Drori (Trustee of the Royal Botanic       Gardens Kew) utilised Kesseler's images in two TED Talks; Every Pollen         Grain has a Story and The Beautiful Tricks of Flowers.
On       the TED platform these talks have been viewed over 660,000 times.
TED       states that the number of total views across all platforms (YouTube,       downloads etc.)
is typically double this figure.
The Head of Seed       Conservation Department &amp; Millennium Seed Bank writes `His         [Kesseler's] colourful, crafted images have become compelling icons that         reassert the beauty and diversity of the plant world and capture the         imagination of wide audiences, including people who do not have a         particular interest in plants.
The beautifully illustrated books [...]         have brought new audiences to the important work we do and have become         recognised by our partners internationally.'
Kesseler's work has been the subject of exhibitions at Kew intended to       inspire new audiences and raise awareness of the important work being       undertaken.
Kew's Galleries and Exhibitions Leader commented on the `remarkable         use of imagery' saying it has `captivated visitors and was a         powerful vehicle to highlight some of the significant "behind the         scenes" science that is not widely known.'
Canopy &#8212; a new Micrographia       took place in The Nash Conservatory (05/2008-09/2008).
During this period       598,000 people visited Kew and it is estimated that 15% to 20% would have       seen the exhibition (Source: Kew), which was reviewed in New Scientist.
This exhibition was subsequently modified and displayed at the Millennium       Seed Bank (MSB), Wakehurst Place, Kew (05/2009-01/2011).
Wakehurst Place       has nearly 400,000 visitors per year and Kew estimate that between 10% and       20% visit the Seed Bank.
Designer Thomas Heatherwick became aware of       Kessler's work when visiting MSB and has said `Whilst researching         ideas for what became known as the Seed Cathedral, the British Pavilion         at the Shanghai Expo, 2010, I visited the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew         where I became aware of the work the artist Rob Kesseler had been doing         with seed morphologist Wolfgang Stuppy.
His stunning colourful images of         microscopic seeds and pollen were truly inspirational and revealed how         their complexity and diversity exists even on the most minute scale.'
Eight images of seeds by Kesseler have been on permanent display at the       MSB since 2009.
The publications Pollen, Seeds and Fruit have found a       worldwide audience.
The reach of Kesseler's research impact is evidenced       by sales figures for the publications, averaging c. 25-30,000 per title       (source: Papadakis).
In 2009 The Bizarre and Incredible World of         Plants was published, bringing together elements of all three       previous publications in one volume.
The books have been translated into       seven languages and foreign co-editions have been published in USA/Canada,       Germany, Spain and Japan.
French and Chinese editions of The Bizarre         and Incredible World of Plants have been published in France, Taiwan       and mainland China, respectively.
Pollen is currently in its third       edition and second editions of Seeds and Fruit have been       published.
In May 2011 Seeds featured in the list of top 10 botany       books in The Times' special science supplement Eureka       magazine, and in 2009 the German edition of Pollen was awarded the       prize for the most beautiful book of the year by Wissenschafts BDW,       Germany.
In 2010 Up Close was published by Papadakis, an extensive       survey of Kesseler's work from the past twenty-five years.
It is `[...]         undoubtedly Professor Kesseler's striking and groundbreaking work that         has led to the popularity of this series of books [..] which is         recognisable and much admired throughout the publishing world' the       series `[...] has led our publishing house to pursue new lines in         publications and we have since developed a very strong line in nature         and natural history.'
(Publishing Director, Papadakis).
An image       from Fruit features on the cover of the Papadakis Autumn 2011       Catalogue, a further indicator of the continuing importance of Kesseler's       body of work to his publishers.
The publications have received much attention in the press, both in the       UK and abroad.
During 2008 the work was the subject of a BBC News Website       feature, had a centre page spread photo feature in The Guardian, received       an illustrated feature in The Telegraph, was the subject of an article in       Kew Magazine, and featured in Time Magazine, who described Fruit       as `a spectacular new book of botanical architecture.'
In 2008 Fruit       was the subject of a cover feature and lead article for Infocus magazine       (the proceedings of the Royal Microscopical Society).
In addition Nesta's       celebration of 10 years of Fellowships in 2011, featured an interview with       Kesseler and utilised images from the publications.
In       November 2012 an article Amazing Close-ups of Seeds was published       on the Smithsonian blog giving an overview of the work of Kesseler and       Stuppy against the background of the MSB at Kew.
`The Millennium Seed         Bank is a global seed garden of epic proportions.
By 2010, the project         had amassed about 10 percent of the world's 400,000 plant species, and         the trajectory is to reach 25 percent by 2020.
Wouldn't you like to see         it?
The vault itself, of course, is hidden from the public eye.
But,         MSB's seed morphologist Wolfgang Stuppy and visual artist Rob Kesseler         have come up with a clever workaround.'
In May 2013 an article on       Kesseler's work was published in Design Bureau Magazine (US).
In Nov/Dec 2011 Primary Science recommended Kesseler's work as a       starting point for teachers in the classroom in the article Drawn         Together: Linking Science and Art and The Millennium Seedbank saying       `the work of artist Rob Kessler [...] is inspirational in revealing the         detail of natural forms.'
He contributed to the Skills in the         Making Workshops (2009-2012) organised by The Making, and       his work is cited as a resource for inspiration in their publication Working         with Craft across the Curriculum (supported by the Paul Hamlyn       Foundation).
AD magazine (the magazine for National Society for Education       in Art and Design) ran         an illustrated article showing how Kesseler's work has       been used as part of a project within the School of Education at the       University of Brighton, developing new curriculum approaches to art and       science in schools.
Here students were introduced to Kesseler's work as an       illustration of the potential of making connections between science and       art (Spring 2012, Issue 4).
In 2013 AD magazine (Spring 2013, Issue 7)       published an article by Kesseler Awe &#8212; A personal approach to looking.
The cover of this edition featured an image from Fruit and the       article was accompanied by a specially designed pull-out poster.
In 2012       Kesseler's images were reproduced in a US textbook What is Life?
A         Guide to Biology by Jay Phelan (W.H Freeman Publishers) where they       were used to accompany chapters on growth and reproduction in plants and       the common structural features of plants.
As a direct result of the underpinning research outlined above Kesseler       was awarded a Fellowship with the Instituto Gulbenkian Ciencia, Oeiras,       Portugal, instigated by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation London as part       of the Year of Bio-Diversity 2010.
Here he was invited to work with the       molecular biologists at the Gulbenkian Science Institute and produced Jardim         Porcel&#226;nico, a body of work focusing on the cellular structures of       Portuguese wild flora and continuing exploration of the themes of       accessible presentation of the process of science developed at Kew.
Jardim         Porcel&#226;nico was selected for inclusion in the AWARD at the       Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent as part of the British       Ceramics Biennial in 2011.
Kesseler was invited to contribute to Ceramic       Review Magazine, where he authored a feature on Jardim Porcel&#226;nico,       and the work was the subject of an interview in Nature magazine.
Work       undertaken during the fellowship was showcased at Petals, Pixels and         Plates &#8212; an artist in the laboratory, a one day solo exhibition at       Sala Verde da Esta&#231;&#227;o Agronomica Nacional, Oieras, Portugal in celebration       of International Plant Fascination Day &#8212; a worldwide initiative adopted by       39 countries, with events taking place at 580 institutions ranging from       botanical gardens to plant research centres.
