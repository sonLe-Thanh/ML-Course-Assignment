     Beneficiaries and dates of impact: Ball also feels uncomfortable       about the idea that his research has `beneficiaries', at least in the       traditional sense.
He seeks to be `useful' by helping people, particularly       teachers, to "think about what they do", and to think too about what       policy-makers, edu-businesses and the new breed of philanthropists are       doing &#8212; and how the UK education system continues to help reproduce the       class system.
Teachers, trade unions and pressure groups campaigning on       behalf of state education have gained most from his research &#8212; throughout       the REF period.
But the public has also benefited from his important       contributions to general debate on issues relating to education policy and       social justice.
Reach and significance: Ball's research has been discussed by       teachers, union representatives and education commentators as far apart as       Alaska and Australia.
The distance his thoughts have travelled helps to       underscore their importance for those who care about education and social       equity.
Websites based in North and South America, Australia and Europe       carry discussions on his work, and teacher unions throughout the       English-speaking world, particularly Australia and the UK, use his       research to help them make sense of &#8212; and argue against &#8212; education policy       developments such as inter-school competition and performance benchmarking       (S1).
Ball does not claim that his work has had an instrumental2         impact (influencing policy and practice), although he gave evidence to         the House of Commons Education Select Committee inquiry into the 15-19         examinations system in 2012 and was quoted twice in the Committee's         report (S2).
But he has certainly had widespread conceptual         impact (enhancing general understanding and informing debate).
Privatisation: Ball's 2004-7 research (R2) resulted in an       invitation to produce a major report, Hidden Privatisation in Public         Education (2008), for Education International (S3).
This Brussels-based body is the world's largest federation of unions,       representing 30 million education employees in about 400 organisations in       170 countries and territories.
The EI report, co-written with Dr Deborah       Youdell while she was at the IOE3, maps and examines the spread and         consequences of the reconfiguration of education in the market form         around the world.
The report was translated into Japanese, German and         Polish by EI's affiliates and has since been used extensively in the         advocacy work of many unions.
Teacher unions (e.g.
the Canadian         Teachers' Federation and the Australian Education Union) also shared the         findings with their members.
EI says that the concepts of `endogenous'         and `exogenous' privatisation4, which Ball and Youdell conceived           and explored in their report, are now "firmly embedded in global           unions' conceptual framework about privatisation ... [the report]           played a catalyst role in teacher unions' policies worldwide" (S4).
Fred van Leeuwen, EI's general secretary, explains that one of the           study's key purposes was "to get the trend towards privatisation out           into the light of day.
We need to get greater transparency ... so that           we can engage in an open debate about the future of education in our           societies".
Websites and newspapers around the world, including the Manila             Times and the South China Morning Post, helped to ensure           that this goal was achieved by reporting the study's findings.
Organisations such as the Global Campaign for Education also           publicised the study.
Pressure groups: Ball lends his support to a number of pressure       groups that promote state education, such as the Anti Academies Alliance       (AAA), Local Schools Network and the Campaign for State Education.
These       organisations have invited him to speak at their events (e.g.
a major AAA       conference in TUC headquarters for parents, governors and school staff on       June 11, 2011).
They have also promoted and discussed his research on       their websites.
Margaret Tulloch, chair of Comprehensive Future,       commented: "Education research is often of little relevance to education       non-professionals such as parents and governors who nonetheless have a       serious interest in education policy and, in particular, want to campaign       for change.
Professor Ball's research and his ability to bring its       findings to a non-professional audience are very important in this area.
We are undergoing a very serious shift in how education is managed, so       research in this area is vital.
His impact has been to raise awareness and       provide evidence for campaigners, for example in mapping the extent of       edu-business and the profound changes in how schools are governed" (S5).
Performativity: Ball's analyses of the consequences of       managerialism and its methods and values (performativity) have also helped       to shape the University and College Union's (UCU) thinking on       professionalism.
A recent UCU policy paper states: "Any explanation of the       kind of professionalism that is now required will need to take account of       the external forces and circumstances facing education and       educationalists.
It also must take account of the very insidious ways that       the culture across education has become infected by managerialism,       commodification and marketisation, and how these processes become       internalised and then eat away at the professional soul of UCU members.
This process has been referred to as `performativity'."
The paper also       quotes Ball as saying: "Performativity invites and incites us to make       ourselves more effective ... to improve ourselves and to feel guilty or       inadequate, if we do not" (S6).
Dan Taubman, UCU's senior       education officer (S7), said that Ball gave a brilliant       presentation to a UCU seminar in March 2013.
"His presentation based on       his extensive writing on this subject was clear and cogent.
His analysis       of professionalism in education in an age of managerialism engendered a       great deal of discussion and interest.
Professor Ball spoke about the       underlying trends that impacted on educational professionalism and was       able to illustrate his central thesis with current examples from       education."
Conferences and seminars: Ball has addressed countless other       seminars and conferences over the REF period &#8212; and many of them have been       attended by teachers, governors, trade unionists and members of the       public.
He has spoken at TUC and NUT conferences as well as teacher union       events in Australia and Canada.
He has also given public lectures on his       work in Britain (for example, in Cambridge, Huddersfield, Southampton,       Bath, Chester and Strathclyde), Australia (Sydney), Germany (Halle) and       the US (Madison, Wisconsin).
In March 2013 he delivered The Vere Forster       public lecture in Dublin &#8212; to an audience including Ireland's Chief       Inspector of Schools and senior officials in the Irish education       department.
As a result of this address, an Irish radio station, Dublin       City FM, invited Ball to talk for half-an-hour on the educational impact       of neo-liberal ideas (S8).
One listener later contacted the station       to say: "So much food for thought here and a wake-up call to those of us       who have been seduced by the 'common sense' of the market, managerialism       and performativity.
Stephen explained his way of developing his world view       so well by describing the sociological toolbox that he dips into.
Long       live the teacher as intellectual".
Media coverage: Some of the most highly-regarded UK education       journalists and commentators have taken a close and continuing interest in       Ball's work on privatisation and Conservative and New Labour education       policies and have interviewed him many times.
They include: Peter Wilby (Guardian       and New Statesman), Richard Garner (Independent), Jessica       Shepherd (S9) and Fiona Millar (both Guardian) and Warwick       Mansell (TES and freelance).
Guardian columnist Seamus       Milne and Matthew Taylor (RSA chief executive and Tony Blair's former       chief political adviser) are among the other prominent commentators who       have highlighted his research findings.
Ball recognises the value of using       the media to get his ideas across to the world beyond academia and adopts       a proactive approach.
He writes blogs and newspaper articles that       invariably generate a big response from readers.
One of his Guardian       comment pieces, pointing out that the shift towards marketised education       is combined with an authoritarian and nostalgia-driven approach to the       curriculum, drew no fewer than 253 comments from readers (S10).
Effect on teachers: Ball is acutely aware of the irony of his work       on `performativity' being used in a REF impact case study.
He takes       comfort in the knowledge that his research is useful to teachers.
"Last year [2012] I gave a talk about performativity in education to a         very mixed group of people, including teachers and students.
Afterwards         a woman came up to me and said: `Thank you, thank you very much for         that.
I resigned as a teacher last year'.
She then added: `Now I know         why I resigned ... emotionally I couldn't cope anymore.
I found what was         happening to me abhorrent'.
And although, in a sense, that's a sort of         negative example I was very pleased with that because I think she was         saying that she now had the tools to make sense of her experience.
She         hadn't been able to analyse it intellectually, and she now knew why she         had made the right decision from her point of view."
That is the kind of impact that matters most to Ball.
