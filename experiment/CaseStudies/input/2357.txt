     That Sweet Enemy (item 1) received considerable media       coverage (press, radio, television) in the UK, the USA, and France, as       well as in several other countries, that began on publication in 2006 and       continued into the survey period after paperback publication in the US and       UK in 2007-08 and in French translation in 2012.
Interviews and/or reviews       in the scholarly and general press included the TLS, The New York         Review of Books, The Guardian, The Observer, The         Washington Post, The Washington Times, Los Angeles         Times, The New Statesman, The Independent, The Sunday Times,       the Literary Review, The Financial Times, The Times,       The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Times, Le Monde, Le         Figaro, L'Express etc.
The book was runner up for the Duff       Cooper Prize (a literary prize awarded for `the best in non-fiction       writing').
Media references include:            In Times Literary Supplement (`startling and insightful things         to say about the lives of exiles, sports, food, literature and         cross-pollination in countless other fields'), 12 May 2006       In New York Review of Books, by Julian Barnes (`grand and         luminously detailed'), 29 March 2007       In the Atlantic Monthly (`A remarkably inventive, stylish and         audacious work... one of the most engaging and invigorating works of         international history I've read in years '), 27 Feb. 2007          This initial reception ensured that the book would become a frequent       point of reference on Anglo-French relations in the French media &#8212; see for       example Liberation, 13 Feb. 2012, and Le Point, 15 Feb.       2012 (5a); it established Professor Tombs and his work in       political, diplomatic and policy circles, recognized by the award in Oct.       2007 of a French government decoration, the Ordre National des Palmes         Acad&#233;miques, for `services rendered to French culture', and made       possible the following impacts in the survey period on both sides of the       Channel.
In political and diplomatic circles:            The last three French ambassadors (G&#233;rard Err&#233;ra, Maurice         Gourdault-Montagne, and Bernard Emi&#233;) have all referred to the book in         public speeches on several occasions and have described it as essential         to the understanding of present Anglo-French relations.
Newly appointed         French diplomats in London are expected to read it for that reason.
In         2012 the French Ambassador to the UK celebrated the translation of this         `now classic book' which would make it `from now on the standard work         for all those interested in this extraordinary and unique relationship'.
(5e, 5f)        William Hague, as Foreign Secretary, referred to the importance of the         book (item 1) in a public speech (29 June 2011) on Anglo-French         relations, and it is widely read in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
His special adviser testifies that he `personally found the book a great         resource for help in putting together the Foreign Secretary's speech.
.
.and I know other policy makers in the Foreign Office have drawn on [it]         for insights that help them with their work'; it is, he continues, `a         hugely helpful one stop shop in understanding not only the deep history         behind the current Franco-British relationship.
.
.but also just how         embedded parts of the French world view.
.
.are in their national         history'.
(5c)           Policy advice:     The research has had demonstrable influence in European discussions of       policy and cultural diplomacy.
For example, in Nov. 2011 Robert Tombs was       invited by the European Directorate of the Foreign and Commonwealth         Office to speak at a policy seminar on Anglo-French relations in       preparing for the Anglo-French Summit of 2011; the other speakers were two       French ambassadors, the UK National Security Advisor, Sir Peter Ricketts       (now ambassador in Paris) and the FCO European director Mr Simon Manley       (reference was made to the book by all the other speakers).
Professor       Tombs, drawing on the research summarized in Section 2, spoke of the       historical roots of present day policy, and how historically informed       expectations among politicians and diplomats continue to influence       present-day decisions, and help to explain, for example, converging French       and British policies in Africa and simultaneously diverging policies in       Europe.
He warned that the closeness of the Anglo-French security       relationship should not be expected to deliver support over internal EU       policy.
This led to a lively discussion and positive feedback from       participants.
(5d)     Robert Tombs was also appointed to the Franco-British Council in       2008 following the publication of his research on Franco-British       relations.
The Council, an independent body established in 1972 by the       British and French governments and financed by the two foreign ministries,       promotes joint action through meetings of leading representatives of the       worlds of culture, science, education, the academy, parliament, and       business, and provides advice to governments as well as diffusing       information to the public, to policy makers, and to business.
As a member       he has been particularly responsible for organizing conferences and       publications on Franco-British relations, including co-organizing a       conference in Paris which led to a co-edited report, L'Histoire         coloniale en d&#233;bat en France et en Grande Bretagne, 2010, which       compares present day public attitudes to the memory of empire in both       countries, and is addressed to a broad readership, including policy       makers, teachers and the general public.
(5b)     Robert Tombs was invited by the French Foreign Ministry to       contribute in May 2013 an essay on the influence of France in the United       Kingdom for an official French publication.
Business     In Sept. 2012 Robert Tombs was invited to give a talk on the Anglo-French       relationship in Marseilles to a conference of senior managers (of French,       British and other nationalities) from Kingfisher plc (which includes the       French group Castorama), as part of the company's efforts to bring about a       more effective merger of its French and British subsidiaries and their       workforces.
He drew attention to some of the myths and stereotypes that       influence attitudes, to some of the real cultural differences that can       cause problems, and to similarities that are sometimes overlooked.
