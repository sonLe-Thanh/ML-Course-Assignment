     The clinical guideline     The new Clinical Guideline was published by the Royal College of       Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), with endorsements from additional       relevant colleges in 2008.
It was awarded NHS Evidence       accreditation in 2010 [a].
The awareness campaign     In line with recommended practice, we planned a dissemination strategy       and acquired funding through a collaborative application involving the       Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre (CBTRC), RCPCH and The Brain       Tumour Charity (formerly the Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust) to the       Closing the Gaps scheme of the Health Foundation.
The strategy was       designed to reduce multiple referrals by highlighting symptom clusters in       a handy symptom card for the public and profession, and by signposting to       a decision-support website (www.headsmart.org.uk/home/).
These       use evidence-based criteria for reassurance, timed review       and urgent referral for imaging.
The information support website       is linked to relevant NHS websites.
Training modules have been developed       within the HeadSmart website as well as an additional module [b] developed       in conjunction with the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP),       called `Brain Tumours in Children' (launched from their e-learning       website).
There are also Facebook (facebook.com/headsmartcampaign)       and Twitter       (https://twitter.com/HeadSmartUK)       profiles, and a smartphone app (Text SMART to 81400).
The dissemination campaign, consisting of symptom cards, website and       media programme, was launched on 11th June 2011 to the       profession and the public, with political, professional, charity and       Department of Health support.

Was awareness and confidence raised?
`The awareness of the signs and symptoms of a childhood brain tumours       have dramatically increased since the HeadSmart campaign was launched'       [c].
Around 14 million people were made aware of HeadSmart, equating to       11% of the UK population [d].
Over 650,000 symptom checklist cards have       now been distributed, the website has had over 117,000 visits from       &gt;98,000 unique visitors and is currently (July 2013) experiencing       &gt;12,000 visits from &gt;11,000 unique visitors per month, the Facebook       site has &gt;12,000 likes and Twitter has &gt;1,250 followers [e].
Professional surveys identified that 73% of paediatricians but only 26% of       GPs were aware of HeadSmart after the launch in 2011 [f].
Amongst       paediatricians, confidence in making a brain tumour diagnosis rose from       32% to 54% [f].
In July 2013, the RCGP agreed to disseminate campaign       materials to its 46,000 membership throughout 2013/14 [g].
Were cases diagnosed more quickly?
Through our clinical guideline and HeadSmart campaign, we `effectively       decreased the risk of serious consequences associated with delay through       significantly reducing the time taken to diagnose brain tumours in       children from 13 weeks to 6 weeks' [g].
Comparing total diagnostic interval (TDI) data at 3 time points:     1) In 2006 in 4 centres for one year,     2) In Jan-June 2011 after Guideline publication in 2008       and prior to HeadSmart launch;     3) Post HeadSmart launch until May 2013.
There was a 52% decrease (p=0.001) in median TDI across these three time       points, with a 65% decrease (3 weeks to 1 week) in median time from first       doctor contact to brain scanning.
These decreases in median TDI had the       greatest impact in low grade tumours, compared with high grade tumours,       and a trend for centrally placed tumours involving optic pathways compared       with other anatomical sites.
The fall in TDI began with the publication of       our clinical guideline in 2008 [g,h], and HeadSmart built on this, `the       time to diagnosis being dramatically reduced from 9.2 to 6.9 weeks in just       two years, summing up the remarkable impact of this campaign' [c].
Figure: Time from symptom onset to brain tumour diagnosis has been reduced from a median/mean of 14.4/35.4 weeks (2006) to 6.9/20.4 weeks (2011-2013).
Our preliminary findings on 1 year survival, disability rates, visual       impairment rates, public and professional awareness and website usage, are       the focus of on-going evaluation until 2016, whilst the awareness campaign       is sustained and augmented.
As a result of our lobbying, the National       Cancer Intelligence Network announced in 2012 that it will collect TDI       data from children with a brain tumour as part of the cancer registry       dataset from August 2013 [i].
This will benefit researchers and clinicians       nationally, and also facilitate our ongoing evaluation of the impacts of       HeadSmart.
This strategy is a `world first' in paediatric brain tumour, now being       emulated in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy and Iran [g,j].
Its excellence       was acknowledged by an NHS Innovation Award in 2013, worth       &#163;100,000.
As summarised by the RCPCH `Overall, this is an excellent piece       of work with wide professional and societal impact and has helped ensure       speedier diagnosis for children with complex conditions as part of       optimising clinical practice' [h].
