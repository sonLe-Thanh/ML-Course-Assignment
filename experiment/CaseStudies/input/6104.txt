     The research carried out by LSHTM has made an important contribution       towards reducing the number of deaths from malaria.
Using WHO methods of       estimation, it can be estimated that approximately 1m malaria-related       deaths were prevented by LLINs between 2008 and 2013, mostly among African       children.5.1 This impact was brought about by net distribution       operations and investment decisions during the impact assessment period       (mostly in 2009-2010).
The WHO policy that led to these operations, which       explicitly cites LSHTM research as supporting evidence, was first drafted       and announced shortly before the impact assessment period (in 2007).
Nevertheless, it is clear that the operations putting this policy into       practice did take place during the assessment period, and were equally       influenced and justified by the same research, as were the subsequent WHO       statements repeating and amplifying the initial policy announcement.
Following a very limited emphasis on vector control by WHO and leading       agencies in the 1990s, the late 2000s marked a strategic sea change.
Since       2006, and supported by the evidence accumulated through the research, WHO       has been recommending ITNs/LLINs as the default vector control         intervention for Africa, with indoor residual spraying (IRS) as a       possible alternative that might be preferable in some settings.
The       relevant WHO report, Malaria Vector Control and Personal Protection5.2       acknowledges Curtis' work on the Study Group that produced it, as well as       Rowland's written contribution.
It also cites numerous relevant LSHTM       outputs.
This document set the scene for further strategic emphasis on       malaria prevention through ITNs/LLINs.
In 2008, The Roll Back Malaria partnership (RBM) &#8212; the global framework       for coordinated action against malaria &#8212; made ITNs and LLINs the lead         intervention in its Global Malaria Action Plan.5.3 The       plan acknowledges the contributions of no fewer than six LSHTM researchers       and quotes a December 2007 briefing produced by Lines and colleagues for       the Department for International Development (DFID), which was based on       3.1 and 3.3 and itself highlighted LLINs as a central plank in the quest       to eradicate malaria.5.4 As part of the 2008 Global Malaria       Action Plan, `SUFI' (Scaling-Up For Impact) was proclaimed as a goal &#8212;       aiming to rapidly reach universal coverage for all populations at risk       with locally appropriate malaria control interventions, with 730m         LLINs to be distributed globally (about 350m in Africa) (5.3, p.       14).
The impact paper in Pakistan and the implementation research that       followed led to the LLIN strategy adopted by the Global Fund for South       Asia (e.g.
Pakistan and Afghanistan) 5.3 and by WHO for       conflict induced emergencies 5.5.
In 2008, following a series of publications arguing that the impact of       ITNs would be maximised only if they were given free to everyone in the       community (because of the `mass effect' demonstrated by Lines et al.3.3,         3.4), the UN Secretary-General announced a vision of universal         coverage to end malaria deaths.5.6 His message was that       LLINs, along with indoor residual spraying, would be made available to all       people at risk, especially women and children in Africa.
It was based on a       WHO position statement on Insecticide-Treated Mosquito Nets which       was first published in 2007 and remained the standard WHO policy position       throughout the 2008-2013 period.5.7 The position statement       explains the reasons for this shift to universal coverage through the use       of ITNs, citing several LSHTM outputs as well as Lengeler's Cochrane       review of the earlier mortality trials.
Subsequently, and following these       WHO recommendations, ITN distribution campaigns have mostly been       standalone and designed to provide nets for entire populations, with one       net provided for every two people (eg Uganda).
The contributions of LSHTM       research and staff are acknowledged by the WHO unit responsible for global       WHO policy on this topic.5.8     Largely as a result of the strategic initiatives described, expenditure       on malaria control as a whole is expected to exceed $1bn throughout       2008-20135.1, 5.2 with some 40% to 60% of this being spent on       vector control (mostly nets).
Not all countries wish to rely on externally funded and free distribution       of all nets, and some prefer to develop approaches more readily       sustainable over the longer term.
LSHTM research findings on the public       health value of commercial markets as a distribution mechanism for       ITNs, and their importance in achieving overall coverage levels,       encouraged several countries to promote a diverse and complementary       mixture of distribution channels.
Examples include Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania,       Pakistan and Afghanistan, who are encouraging mixed distribution         systems operating in parallel, including not only mass campaigns but       also distribution of free nets through routine public health systems       (especially antenatal and immunisation services) and unsubsidised       commercial markets.5.9, 5.10
