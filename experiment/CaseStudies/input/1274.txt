     Impact on Commerce and Industrial Collaboration     Artymiuk, Ross and Sayers co-founded the spin-out company Asterion       Ltd in 2000 using an initial investment of &#163;125,000 from the White Rose       Seedcorn Fund (which had been created in 1999 through the Department of       Trade and Industry's University Challenge competition) [S1, S2].
The University of Sheffield and the Asterion cofounders filed a patent       application on engineered growth hormones and other cytokines commencing       in 2000 (inventors: Ross, Artymiuk and Sayers), since then over       200 applications have been filed, with a total of 27 granted patents and       23 applications still pending in a number of countries [S3, S4].
The cofounders sought to raise venture capital and collaborative research       funding by presenting their proposal to potential investors, including       Fusion IP, the University of Sheffield main vehicle for raising commercial       IP investment.
This has led to total equity/loan funding and investment to       Asterion over the REF period in excess of &#163;1M.
In 2003 Asterion signed an R&amp;D deal with [text removed for       publication], which ultimately led to licensing milestone payments in       2009.
In addition, early in 2008 Asterion entered into a deal with [text       removed for publication] that also led to licencing income during the REF       period.
Details of these partners and their interest in Asterion's       products are as follows:            [text removed for publication], is a global specialty-driven         pharmaceutical company with total sales exceeding &#8364;1.2 billion in 2012.
They licensed the development of long-acting growth hormones patented by         Asterion Ltd for clinical development in 2009 [S5], provided         R&amp;D funding and funded a number of patents based on Asterion's         Profuse technology.
[text removed for publication], paid license fees to evaluate         Asterion's designs in the field of an undisclosed hormone.
Asterion has received licensing income from [text removed for       publication] and [text removed for publication] since 2008 exceeding       &#163;500,000 [S1].
Asterion research income over the REF period totals       &#163;0.96M, with joint R&amp;D contracts and license income from [text removed       for publication] since 2004 totalling over &#163;1.7M.
Finally, [text removed       for publication] have funded applications for over 200 patents in 15       families based on Asterion technologies, with Ross, Artymiuk and       Sayers as co-inventors.
The research income allowed Asterion to employ train and employ two       postdoctoral researchers (Drs.
Wilkinson and Padhananga) during the REF       period.
Their work involved designing, producing and purifying recombinant       proteins and testing in bioassays for biological activity.
The       methodologies developed by Asterion were transferred to [text removed for       publication] for scale-up to commercial production and preclinical trials       of some of Asterion products.
The cost to [text removed for publication]       of these studies, and the costs involved in the generation and protection       of the associated patents by [text removed for publication], are       commercially sensitive but are significant.
The success of Asterion as a University start-up led to a cover story in       the 'BBSRC Business' magazine July 2008 ("Sheffield spin-out wins       additional investment for novel therapeutic proteins"), and Asterion was       one of four new companies highlighted in the BBSRC Annual Report in 2009.
Thus the success of Asterion has been used by RCUK to promote the       Excellence with Impact agenda, leading to a wider impact on       university-based translational research [S6, S7].
