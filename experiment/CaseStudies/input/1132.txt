     This body of research has achieved impact in a number of areas:             Improved access to information for patients with a diagnosis of           infertility and/or endometriosis, especially in languages other than           English.
The ASFERT project found no existing information from UK         healthcare providers on infertility in any language other than English         and this was shown to be a barrier to good communication.
Booklets and         CDs [Trying for a Baby] produced in Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali,         and Urdu were distributed (on request) to 30 infertility clinics for use         with South Asian patients.
PDFs of these resources are available to the         public and health professionals via the DMU website.
These remain in use         as key resources with over 300 copies distributed to clinics and         individuals (2005-present).
In 2009, the ENDOCUL study produced DVDs         specifically tailored to five minority ethnic communities.
These are in         use in at least five major hospital sites in: the West Midlands         (Birmingham Women's Hospital, City Hospital Birmingham, Sandwell         Hospital); Leicester (University Hospitals of Leicester); and London         (Whittington), providing information on the condition and its management         for patients.
This material is also available via YouTube, where it had         received ca.
500 views in one year (until 31st July 2013).
The DVD material and an educational resource for professionals is also         publicly available from www.endocul.co.uk.
As of 31st July 2013 248 health professionals have taken the         educational training course online.
Facilitation of dialogue between infertility professionals,           patients, and their support representatives in the voluntary sector.
The TRANSREP project held a successful stakeholder event attended by 22         invited delegates including patients, support groups and clinicians         (including from overseas clinics), third sector groups, the HFEA and the         British Fertility Society (2009).
TRANSREP was also the subject of two         public lectures attended by 150 people on each occasion (2009, 2010).
These activities formed the basis of a series of recommendations about         policy on cross-border care, which were used by the HFEA to inform their         2011 review of donation policy.
Development of a network of local skilled community based South           Asian research facilitators.
The ASFERT, GAMDON and ENDOCUL         (2002-09) projects recruited, trained and employed a team of bilingual         members of South Asian communities to conduct qualitative fieldwork.
The         ENDOCUL project was showcased by INVOLVE (2010) as an excellent example         of public and patient involvement.
An improved understanding of patients' experiences of infertility           and use of assisted reproduction amongst healthcare professionals and           patient support group representatives.
The studies have been         presented and discussed at over 20 national and international meetings         of infertility and reproductive medicine specialists between 2008-2012.
TRANSREP has generated invitations to speak at three national events         specifically aimed at fertility nursing staff, an event organised by the         International Infertility Counselling Organisation in Munich and a         plenary address at a joint conference of the British and Irish Fertility         Societies and the Association of Clinical Embryologists (2010).
Combined         attendance at these events included 2,500 fertility professionals.
Findings and recommendations from the TRANSREP project have also been         recorded as an international IVF podcast for fertility professionals and         has received 3188 hits by 31st July 2013.
Media coverage of         the ENDOCUL and TRANSREP projects in particular has been extensive,         including radio interviews and features (BBC Asian Network, BBC Women's         Hour Radio 4; BBC World Service; BBC World TV and several local and         regional stations, see also www.transrep.co.uk).
Co-development of strategy for recruitment of minority ethnic           donors.
Following the GAMDON study in 2006, the findings were used         to develop, in collaboration with the National Gamete Donation Trust, a         strategy to enhance the recruitment of egg and sperm donors from         minority ethnic communities across the UK.
Enhanced awareness of key issues in infertility and related           conditions for policymakers and regulators nationally and           internationally.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority         (HFEA &#8212; the licensing authority for all infertility treatment in the UK)         and patient support groups (Infertility Network UK, Donor Conception         Network, Daisy Network) have been heavily involved in supporting our         work.
Evidence includes involvement in stakeholder meetings, invitations         for team members to speak at HFEA meetings, contributions to HFEA         debates and `Horizon Scanning' events and information gathering         exercises.
The TRANSREP study was discussed and minuted at a         public meeting of the HFEA in the context of the HFEA Donation Review.
In addition, Culley was invited to:                 work with the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology         Task Force on Cross Border Reproductive Care which produced an         International Code of Practice, which is now being implemented in         European member states       present evidence to the International Society for Cross Border Care         (Clinical group), who are developing international clinic accreditation       present evidence to the Nuffield Council for Bioethics Working Party         on Human Tissue Donation.
Reference to GAMDON and TRANSREP projects are         included in the Nuffield report       to discuss the TRANSREP and GAMDON studies with Gareth Johnson MP,         Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Committee on Infertility to inform         their work: a meeting was held at Westminster in June 2011          In February 2012 Hudson gave evidence at the Nuffield Council on       Bioethics Working Party on Donor Conception: ethical aspects of       information sharing.
Both the GAMDON and TRANSREP findings were used in       the report from this consultation, which made a number of recommendations       for the regulation of donor treatment in the UK.
In the commercial sector, the team have provided advice to Intuition       Communication, a major commercial player in international web-based       information for medical travel via the Managing Director.
This company are       preparing a website specifically targeting infertility travellers with       information on overseas providers and how to ensure safe treatment.
An       extensive interview with Professor Culley was published in the       International Medical Travel Journal published by Intuition Communication       for healthcare providers in medical travel with a circulation of 8,500       readers.
