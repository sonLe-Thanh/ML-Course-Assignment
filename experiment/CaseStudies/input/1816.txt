     Research conducted by Prof deBruijn (QMUL from 2004 onwards) has been       critical to the success of a start-up business Progentix Orthobiology BV       (founded in 2007) and its revolutionary new IBG product AttraXTM.
Significant impact has been generated from 2008 onwards.
Economic impact       includes venture capital funding (2008 - &#8364;1 million from BioGeneration       Ventures &#8212; Section 5, source 2) and commercial deals with the leading       global spinal surgery device company NuVasive Inc (2009 - up to US$80       million trade sale &#8212; Section 5, source 3) and a dental (2011) market       leader to market AttraXTM and other related products.
Since       2011 AttraXTM has been used successfully in more than eleven       thousand patients (as of 2013Q3) with global reach demonstrating impact on       health and welfare.
Within 1 year of commercialisation, a 1.1% share of       the estimated US$2 billion global spinal bone graft market had been       achieved.
This research has seen an economical benefit in terms of new       jobs at Progentix Orthobiology BV with an increase in staff from 2 FTE in       2008 to 25 FTE in 2013.
Improved Instructive Bone Graft AttraXTM &#8212;         impacting unmet clinical and commercial need       There is an unmet clinical and commercial need for a product with the same       effectiveness as the gold standard autograft but without its       disadvantages.
Current alternatives to autograft have major drawbacks such       as immune reactions, disease transfer, regulatory constraints, limited       efficacy and high costs.
AttraXTM, developed with QMUL       underpinning research and marketed under an agreement worth up to US$80       million from NuVasive Inc., delivers impact on the unmet clinical and       commercial need as its bone regeneration potential is in line with that of       the clinical gold standard autograft and bone growth factor rhBMP2 InfuseTM       (annual sales totaling US$1 billion) and superior to other synthetic       biomaterials [Section 5, sources 4,5].
Further it is more cost-effective       than InfuseTM.
AttraXTM is targeted at the US$5       billion global orthopaedic bone graft market as a substitute of autologous       bone, initially impacting the US$2 billion spinal market, representing       approx.
1 million procedures per annum [Section 5, source 6].
Since the       introduction to market of AttraXTM at the end of 2011, more       than eleven thousand patients have been treated (as of 2013Q3) spread       across the world (including EU, US, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil).
Within 1 year of commercialisation, AttraXTM had attained rapid       market penetration equivalent to 1.1% share of the estimated US$2 billion       global spinal bone graft market [Section 5, sources 7,8].
The approval of       a putty formulation in the US in 2014 will allow full scale rollout in the       home-market of NuVasive and should lead to a 10% market share within 2       years with a potential to grow to &gt;25% in the coming 5-8 years.
Delivering health impact to patients       AttraXTM has delivered significant benefit to over 11,000       patients who have received the product since it was introduced in 2011.
The impact relates firstly to benefit to patients compared to the       autograft gold-standard procedure where bone taken from one area of the       patient and placed at the defect site resulting in two operative sites.
AttraXTM delivers similar performance to autograft but without       the disadvantages, which include significant post-operative pain at the       graft donor site in over 30% of patients, which can last for 2 years or       more in some patients.
Treatment with AttraXTM further reduces       the risk of revision surgery as the synthetic product has greater       reliability compared to living autograft.
The simpler and quicker AttraXTM       operative procedure ensures more rapid recovery, with less time in       hospital and a more rapid return to full activity and work for patients,       when compared to autograft.
There are also potential safety benefits to       patients when compared to the rhBMP2 growth factor product InfuseTM,       with current concerns over significant side effects of InfuseTM       reported.
Delivering economic/commercial impact and changing clinical practice       The development of AttraXTM has already generated major       economic and commercial impact, summarised as follows:            Supporting the establishment of a company, Progentix Orthobiology BV         to commercialise the product.
Attracting significant venture capital investment for the development.
Securing a trade sale worth up to US$80 million from NuVasive to         obtained exclusive worldwide distribution rights for spinal treatment.
Securing an exclusive distribution deal with a global top 3 dental         company for use of the technology in the field of dentistry and         craniomaxillofacial surgery.
Generating new jobs, with Progentix Orthobiology BV employing 25 FTE         staff in 2013, compared to 2 FTE in 2008.
In health economics terms the use of AttraXTM delivers       significant savings compared to autograft or InfuseTM as       follows.
Compared to the clinical gold standard autograft, AttraXTM       delivers:            A reduction in length of the operation compared to autograft,         estimated at approximately 40 minutes, resulting in a saving of         approximately &#163;800 per operation.
Reduced post-operative hospital stay, typically 2-3 days less with a         saving cost of approx.
&#163;225 per day.
Reduced post-operative complications, and revision surgery, which         costs approx.
&#163;5,000.
The product cost for AttraXTM (approx.
US$1,500 for one spinal       level) is considerably lower than other products with similar reported       efficacy, such as InfuseTM (US$4,000) or Osteocel (allograft       plus stem cells - US$3,500).
The commercial partnership between Progentix Orthobiology BV and NuVasive       Inc is being used to impact clinical practice as a synthetic bone graft is       now available that is as effective as the gold standard autologous bone       graft and more cost-effective and safe than the growth factor rhBMP2       (InfuseTM).
The recent agreement with a global top 3 dental       company for use of the technology in the field of dentistry and       craniomaxillofacial surgery will impact practice within these clinical       specialisms that relate to more than 1.5 million procedures annually.
