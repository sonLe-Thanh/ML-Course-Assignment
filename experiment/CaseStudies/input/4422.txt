     The impact of Widdows's research is most clearly evident in her       appointment and work on the EGC of UKB (2007-2013).
UKB is a 30-year       epidemiological study building the world's largest information and       material resource in its area and has recruited half a million UK citizens       (c.2% of the 40-69 eligible age group).UKB's funders include the Wellcome       trust, the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Department of Health (DoH),       the Scottish Government, the Northwest Regional Development Agency, Welsh       Assembly Government and the British Heart Foundation.
UKB is the first of       its size and type and its significance is attested to by the media       coverage it has received.
Over 20 features by the BBC and features in most       broadsheets, including The Guardian, The Financial Times, Nature       and New Scientist.
(Further details at: http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/news-         releases/).
It is the first biobank of its type to abandon informed       consent and accordingly UKB is developing new forms of governance which       are being adopted globally and as a member of the EGC Widdows has made         major contributions to the development of the policy and practice of UKB         and in the ethical practices adopted by UKB.
As a member of the EGC Widdows has fed directly into the policy         development of UKB.
The EGC is not a `policy commission' or an       academic body or thinktank, but an independent body designed to evolve new       ethics and governance appropriate to the new structures developed by UKB.
It is demanding with at least 4 full council meetings a year and numerous       sub-group meetings and public meetings.
Widdows was selected as a member       of the ECG because of her expertise and research track record in the area       of genetic ethics and governance and was interviewed by representatives       from the DoH, the Chair of the MRC and the Chair of the Wellcome Trust.
Widdows was appointed via a rigorous selection process over many more       senior academics, precisely because of her research on genetic ethics,       particularly on rethinking consent, and her interest in the public good;       and these matters were discussed in the meeting (research in the PropEur       project, and particularly R1, R2, R4 &amp; R5).
Members usually serve for       a 3 or 4 year period, but Widdows was asked to extend her membership given       her pivotal role in the development of the UKB's access policies.
Widdows has had impact in the following ways:            In the critique of informed consent for biobanking and genetic           research in general;       In policy recognition that standard ethical procedures fail in           biobanking;       In development of new ethical models;       In promoting the public good as an ethical justification;       In making the public good and public interest key ethical criteria.
As explained in section 2, informed consent is not appropriate for       biobanks.
Widdows' critique and her work on new forms of governance       (particularly in the ProEur project) contributed to her appointment to the       EGC.
Widdows has had distinctive impact in showing UKB the         implications of having broad consent rather than informed consent       (see [2] - publicly available minutes from meetings 18, 20 and 21).
This       recognition that informed consent is not appropriate for biobanking was       the reason she was invited to be the UK representative and keynote speaker       at the World Medical Association `Expert Conference on the revision of the       Declaration of Helsinki' (Tokyo, 2013).
This Declaration is the code that       governs research globally and sets ethical standards against which all       researchers are judged.
Widdows gave the keynote address to an audience       which included the international Chair of the World Medical Association       and chairs of all the national medical associations as well as significant       policy lobbyists (including government representatives from Japan and US)       and lobbyists from Pharmaceutical companies.
She was invited to speak precisely       because her work on revising consent and genetics (especially with regard       to biobanks) is setting world agendas.
In the recent draft version of         the Declaration of Helsinki (now released for consultation, see [3])         biobanks are explicitly mentioned for the first time.
The suggested       revision recognises Prof. Widdows' claim that these are "exceptional       situations where consent would be impossible or impractical" (Clause 32 of       the current consultation document).
In addition to having impact in       ensuring the failure of informed consent is recognised she has had impact         on the development of new ethical models which do not rely on       informed consent, such as that adopted by UKB.
Her impact in the       development of these in UKB, and her insistence that UKB continue to       consider alternative models such as benefit- and/or profit-sharing can be       seen in the minutes of the committee (see [2] and minutes from meetings 16       and 26).
Crucial to the new governance model adopted by UKB is the foregrounding         of public good and the role this plays as an ethical criterion when       informed consent is not used.
Widdows' role, as key stakeholders in the       process have attested, has been pivotal in ensuring that UKB understands       the extent of the public good requirement of the biobank's aim, namely       that all research must be demonstrably in the public interest and that       this is ascertained before access is granted (see [7] and [8]).
Shown in       minutes from meetings 14, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 ([2]).
This impact         is shown in the final access policy and processes which require that       public good criteria are met for access to be granted.
Widdows' work in       its development are shown in minutes from meetings 14, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26,       27, 28, 29 and 30.
Further evidence for all this impact can be attained from the respective       Chairs and secretary.
For instance, one former Chair of ECG states, "had       she not been so relentlessly insistent about the responsibilities of both       the EGC and UKB, as trustees for the interests of participants as well as       being stewards for the public interest, it is unlikely that the         resulting Protocol would have been as explicit as it is in embedding         these interests".
Likewise the Secretary states, "It was Heather,       with full backing of the access subgroup, that proposed an extension to       this exception to include Intellectual Property Rights that are being used       to restrict access to health-care unreasonably.
The proposed extension         has been adopted by UK Biobank" and "I believe that through       Heather's input the `public interest' features more prominently in the       access procedures than it would otherwise have done".
Taken together Widdows has shaped policy-making both nationally and       internationally:            As a key member of the IP and Access Sub-Group of the EGC       As a keynote speaker 2013 World Medical Association Conference feeding         into the redrafting of the Declaration of Helsinki (the code governing         research globally)          In these arenas her work on consent, trust and genetic governance has       shaped understandings of genetic ethics, which has created new policy:            Nationally in the development of the policies and processes of UKB       Internationally, as the processes and lessons of UKB are taken up by         other biobanks &#8212; demonstrated by the interest in UKB as the first of its         kind from international consortia (such as the P3G &#8212; Public Population         Project in Genetics).
Internationally, in her impact on the revision of the Declaration of         Helsinki in the explicit mention of biobanks in the current draft.
