     In 1998 Gaelic support organisations and Scottish Government       policy-makers on Gaelic were only beginning to question previous language       policy which saw English as the utilitarian language of business, and       Gaelic as the language of church and home.
Our research has played a key       role in changing this perception and leading to new policy initiatives in       this field.
This can be seen in clear pronouncements within subsequent       policy documents from both the Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE)       Economic and Development Agency and others stressing the benefit of       investment in Gaelic language arts and culture for wider economic and       social development.
As the Chair of the Gaelic Language Board put it six       years ago,&#160; when the impact of the research was making itself clearly       felt: "Some of the best research in Gaelic is now coming from Glasgow       Caledonian" (West Highland Free Press, 16th February         2007).
In 2007 Chalmers was invited to contribute to seminars         held by the Gaelic television funding agency MG Alba on the relationship         between Gaelic arts and culture and the economy.
The argument stressing         the link between the two subsequently featured in the debates leading up         to the establishment of BBC Alba.
The relevance of this research also         led to the involvement of Chalmers and O'Donnel in the Framework 6 EU         Integrated Project DYLAN - Language Dynamics and the management of           diversity - which brought in &#163;160k to GCU over 5 years (October         2005 - September 2010).
The work of this IP was described as "exemplary"         by the European Commission and a resultant summary which included the         explicit approach of Chalmers and Sproull in relation to Scotland was         disseminated throughout Europe in popular form in six languages to         policy makers working at the interface between language and the economy.
The project also featured in news reports on BBC Alba (20th November         2009) and on the BBC's Gaelic-language radio station Radio nan G&#224;idheal,         whose reach is 80 percent of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.
The 1998 and 2006 reports have also been quoted in the         background documents against which the Glasgow Gaelic Language Plan was         constructed in 2008, with Chalmers being invited to be part of the         underpinning design team: one result is that in recent years there has         been a notable increase in the demand for places at Gaelic-speaking         schools in Glasgow and other parts of the geographical area covered by         the reports.
The approach of identifying the Gaelic Economy and its link         to arts and culture was key to a further report, of which Chalmers was         also co-author, commissioned by the Gaelic Language Board: the         Hecla/Chalmers/Danson/McLeod report on Measuring the Gaelic Labour           Market - Current and Future Potential (2008).
The publication of this last report led to a seminar         on the Gaelic Labour Market and Skills Development hosted by Highland         and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and Comunn na G&#224;idhlig (the Gaelic Language         Society) in November 2011, where opening remarks were given by the         Government Minister for Learning and Skills, and keynote introductions         given by Hecla Consulting (principal author of the report) and by the         Scottish Government Employability, Skills and Lifelong Learning Analysis         team.
The seminar was attended by representatives of the Scottish         Government; HIE; Highland Council; Skills Development Scotland; Creative         Scotland; MG Alba; the Social Enterprise Academy and BBC Scotland.
A         follow up working party was agreed, which is continuing its work to         identify skills gaps and subsequent possible action.
The holistic         approach championed by the reports and their underpinning research is         currently mirrored in documents produced by different policy and         government agencies: for example HIE's "Strengthening the Gaelic         language" (2009) focuses on young people, broadcasting, cultural tourism         and the arts as a priority, working with partners including Comunn na         G&#224;idhlig, the Gaelic Festival Society and the Gaelic Arts Agency.
An         Lochran's "Gaelic Arts Strategy" (2005) focuses on "core, strategic and         project activities to develop a Gaelic arts infrastructure in Glasgow".
At the public launch of Chalmers and Sproull's second         research report in 2006 the Chair of HIE said in its praise: "Investing         in &#8230; the native language and cultural traditions of the&#160; region         will &#8230; lead to business creation and ultimately higher GDP.
Quite simply         we at HIE believe there is a direct link between levels of confidence         [in language and culture] and levels of economic activity and economic         growth.
Our investment in Gaelic language and Gaelic arts and culture         not only brings about the direct creation of employment in the Gaelic         sector, jobs which are largely based in the Highlands and Islands [but         also] increased cultural vibrancy and nurturing creativity make the area         more attractive, driving economic growth".
