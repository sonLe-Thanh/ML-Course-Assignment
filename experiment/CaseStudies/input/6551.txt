     The work and expertise of ISM in tobacco control have contributed       directly to the development of the 2009 Health Act (England and       Wales) and the Tobacco &amp; Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act         2010.
The latter is the most significant change in tobacco control       legislation in Scotland since the 2005 ban on smoking in enclosed public       places.
Both acts include restrictions on the display of tobacco at the       point of sale (PoS) to make tobacco products less attractive and       accessible.
Instrumental in the passage of both pieces of legislation was ISM's       research showing that PoS is a sophisticated marketing function used by       tobacco manufacturers to influence consumer behaviour and has a clear       effect on adult and youth smoking.
The display ban was implemented       successfully in large shops and supermarkets between April 2012 and April       2013.
Smaller shops must comply by 2015.
PoS marketing concerns all activities that take place in the store to       promote tobacco, including advertising, furniture, d&#233;cor, staff clothing       and product displays.
The 2002 UK Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act       (TAPA) limited the amount of tobacco advertising allowed in shops       to one A5-sized poster.
However the TAPA did not regulate the display       of products, a gap which was subsequently exploited to circumvent the TAPA       regulations.
Sophisticated and stylish gantries now dominate many small       shops (where underage smokers typically buy tobacco) and elaborate sales       booths were a prominent feature in supermarkets.
The Guidelines for       Article 13 of the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on       Tobacco Control, an international public health treaty covering over 170       countries, recommends the removal of all PoS tobacco marketing.
Since       1999, ISM (through its Centre for Tobacco Control Research) has monitored       the nature, extent and effects of tobacco marketing in the UK through the       YTPS.
Findings from this research, published in a 2008 Cancer Research UK       report `Point of Sale Display of Tobacco Products' and in several       peer-reviewed publications, were influential in demonstrating the public       health case for a ban on PoS displays in the UK.
The 2008 report was       widely cited between September 2008 and May 2009 in submissions and       responses to the UK and Scottish consultations on the proposed       legislation.
Media interviews given by Professor Gerard Hastings       contributed to the public debate around the issue.
Hansard records of       debates on the legislation in the House of Commons and House of Lords show       that the ISM report was considered one of the key pieces of evidence in       the passage of the legislation:     Lord Faulkner of Worcester: "I am delighted that the Government have         based their proposals in the Bill on research.
Some of the most         important research has been carried out by Professor Gerard Hastings,         director of the Centre for Tobacco Control Research.
He investigated the         complex relationship between tobacco marketing at the point of sale and         young people's intention to smoke.
He found that: "In 2006, almost half&#8212;46 per cent of UK teens&#8212;were aware of tobacco marketing at point of         sale".
Moreover, the likelihood of a young person stating an intention         to smoke may increase by 35 per cent with each brand that they can         recall having seen at the point of sale".
(Hansard, 4 Feb 2009).
Beneficiaries of the research     Legislators have benefited from the provision of timely and robust       research to inform evidence-based policy-making, and the public health       community has benefited from a strengthening of the scientific evidence       base on the role of marketing in smoking.
The legislation itself will       ultimately benefit young people and adult smokers by protecting them from       one of the forms of tobacco marketing still permitted.
Emerging data (McNeill et al 2011 http://dx.doi.org/110.1136/tc.2010.038141)       from Ireland, which prohibited PoS in 2009, indicate that the law is       contributing to the de-normalisation of smoking, as evidenced by decreases       post-legislation in the proportion of children thinking that more than 20%       of teenagers smoke.
Over a third of teenagers, nearly two months after       legislation implementation, thought that removal of the displays had made       it easier for children not to smoke, while six months after       implementation, nearly one in five smokers reported that the ban had made       it easier to quit.
This is supported by research suggesting that the       presence of cigarette pack displays makes it more difficult for smokers to       quit (eg.
Germain et al 2009 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02714.x).
Building on the PoS work, ISM is a partner in a major NIHR study to       evaluate the impact of the legislation in Scotland on youth smoking uptake       (DISPLAY study 2011-2016, PI: Professor Sally Haw, with the       Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, and ScotCen).
