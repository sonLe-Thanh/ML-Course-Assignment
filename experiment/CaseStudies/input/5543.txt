     The academic community in the field of record production is characterised       by the large number of lecturing and research staff at universities who       are also extensively involved in professional and creative practice in the       area.
Producers such as Mike Howlett, Phil Harding, Richard James Burgess,       Mark Mynett, Steve Savage and many others who now have one foot in the       academic world and one in the professional world, are engaging with the       research, underaking PhDs, presenting papers at conferences and submitting       to journals.
Many of them are citing the writing of SZT and Allan Moore in       their academic work and using it in their pedagogic practice in       recognition of the influence this is having on their professional       practice.
SZT has, through his continued leadership in the ARP projects       and his determination that ARP will maintain its bridging position between       the academic world of research and pedagogy and the professional and       creative world of record production practice, been a pivotal figure in       developing the impact agenda in the study of record production.
In addition, research driven pedagogy is shaping the mind-set and       professional practice of the new wave of producers, musicians and sound       engineers; SZT's own research and his research leadership in the field       have been instrumental in this.
The reach of this research has extended       throughout Europe, North &amp; South America, Australasia and beyond.
A       survey for Ashgate press received responses from 40 universities in 10       countries, indicating an intention to use the Art of Record Production       book in teaching and Ashgate sales figures so far seem to corroborate       this.
SZT has been invited to give guest lectures on The Musicology of       Record Production and Analysis of Recorded Popular Music in UK, Germany       and USA, and to examine research degrees that cite his research in UK, NZ       and Denmark.
In 2010 he was invited to teach a postgraduate summer school       in Osnabr&#252;ck based on his research with students from Germany, France, UK,       USA, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Poland and Finland.
SZT's current visiting       fellowship at Cambridge on Performance in the Studio involves working with       undergraduate students from RCM, GSMD &amp; Tech Music School to develop       pedagogical tools.
These will help a wider range of students and teaching       staff in further HEIs to prepare a new generation of performers for work       in the studio or concert hall.
The department's research agenda is now       informing teaching practice in vocational and theoretical courses around       the world, underpinning the professional practice of students as they       enter the world of work.
Alongside professional practice within LCM, this strand of research (both       theoretical work and public dissemination of practice-as-research) has       contributed to impact both directly and indirectly through participation       in the following events, all involving international academics,       representatives of industry organisations and professional practitioners,       in variable combinations:            Oct 2004 &#8212; SMA / CHARM Study Day [Centre for the History &amp;         Analysis of Recorded Music]       Sep 2005 &#8212; 2nd CHARM symposium / 1st ARP         conference (London)       Sep 2006 &#8212; 2nd ARP conference (Edinburgh)       Apr 2007 &#8212; 4th CHARM symposium (Royal Holloway College)       Sep 2007 &#8212; CHARM/RMA conference       Dec 2007 &#8212; 3rd ARP conference (Brisbane)       Nov 2008 &#8212; 4th ARP conference (Lowell, MA)       Mar 2009 &#8212; Rethinking the Postproduction of Sound: seminar         (Copenhagen)       Sep &#8212; Dec 2009 &#8212; Making Records: public lectures at UWL       Nov 2009 &#8212; 5th ARP conference (Cardiff)       Oct &#8212; Dec 2010 &#8212; Making Records: public lectures at UWL       Dec 2010 &#8212; 6th ARP conference (Leeds)       Mar &#8212; May 2011 &#8212; Making Records: public lectures at UWL       May 2011 &#8212; ARP workshop at 130th AES convention (London)       Nov 2011 &#8212; Making Records: public lectures at UWL       Nov &#8212; Dec 2011 &#8212; public lectures by SZT at University of Massachusetts         Lowell, Peabody Conservatory (John Hopkins University), Case Western         Reserve University and Mid Tennessee State University.

This is the influence of greater understanding about       the process of both production and reception in recorded popular music.
The development of an analytical framework alongside the vocational and       historical approaches to recording is having an impact on the way that       practitioners think about the process of production.
By developing and       encouraging a more nuanced narrative about the development of recording       technology and practice, this area of research also stands to contribute a       balancing influence on the process of canon formation in popular music,       with potentially far-reaching effects on both practitioners and audiences.
