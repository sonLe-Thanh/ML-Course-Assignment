     Pathways to Impact       After the publication of the initial working paper [5] had attracted the       interest of several developing countries, the model [3] was used by       Nicholson in an extensive action research project reporting directly to       the Costa Rican Minister for Science and Technology and funded by the       Inter American Development Bank [1,2].
This involved Nicholson leading and       working alongside a team of consultants to i) engage in a process of data       collection from key stakeholders; ii) benchmark the existing software       export cluster against other international clusters, iii) advise and set       up a series of task force groups comprised of the relevant stakeholders in       the supporting institutions such as the marketing exports promotion       agency, banking and finance, the industry representation and education       institutions that support the sector development.
This analysis and       process resulted in the Costa Rican National Strategy for Software       Exports.
The software export success framework was subsequently adopted by Egypt's       Information Technology Industry Development Agency (ITIDA) policymakers to       design the Egyptian plan for software exports promotion.
ITIDA actively       pursues two broad goals: building the capacities of Egypt's local       information and communications technology (ICT) industry and attracting       foreign direct investments to boost the ICT sector locally and globally.
As a government entity, ITIDA works in collaboration with the Ministry of       Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) and the private sector to       support the quality of IT services and applications.
Reach and Significance     Costa Rica       The Costa Rican project involved the use of the software exports success       framework [3,5] as the basis for the disciplined planning and       implementation of software exports policymaking and strategy [A].
The       resulting documents and implementation processes involving a series of       task force groups led to the creation of the Costa Rican national strategy       for software exports.
The strategy has had the following effects and has       continued to be an important feature of the Costa Rican ITD industry:            The Chamber of Software Producers in Costa Rica evolved to the Chamber         of Information and Communication Technologies (CAMTIC) that now is the         umbrella for a wider range of IT and business process outsourcing         companies (collectively known as the "digital industry").
This is         significant because the cluster in 2003 had limited prospects as it         involved only software producers, mostly focused on the local market.
In         his statement [A] the former Director of the Inter American Development         Bank who funded the Costa Rican Prosoftware programme confirms; "Widening           the Chamber scope to include other actors was the key strategic           direction advised by Dr Nicholson critical to the success of the           sector.
An example of the continuing positive effect post 2008 is           shown in December 2012 when CINDE (Costa Rican organisation in charge           of attracting foreign investment) instituted a national programme           "CENTRAL GATE" to create a cluster for the whole Digital industry in           Costa Rica, focused initially on selling their services in North           America.
The digital industry now includes contact centres, back           office support, digital media, software development and related           services.
All are Costa Rican companies and CINDE will promote the           firms as an organized cluster.
This is a step which was advised as           appropriate by Dr Nicholson as a component of an organized digital           sector with most of the companies belonging to CAMTIC."
CAMTIC         figures show that between 2003 and 2008 the digital sector grew from 150         to 805 companies in Costa Rica and exports represents 10.6% of the         national GDP [A].
According to the A.T. Kearney Global Services Location         Index, in 2011 Costa Rica was ranked in 19th place.
Using the         same metrics in 2007, Costa Rica was ranked 34th a climb of         15 places in global ranking [D].
According to the former Director, the         main impact of Nicholson's analysis has been in, "consolidating the           sector as a more significant contributor of the Costa Rican economy.
This has had the effect of more concerted political action that allows           the sector representatives in CAMTIC to lobby for changes in           legislation and investment such as the recent CINDE initiative".
The second effect is the internationalization of the sector with more         companies today "born to export" which represents a major contrast with         2003.
The third effect is the maturity of the sector.
Today, most of the         companies in the digital sector understand that competition is not         locally based in Costa Rica and that working together through CAMTIC can         be beneficial for the digital sector.
"Proximity Costa Rica" is an         example of the kind of "born global" firm that has emerged in Costa         Rica.
It is a consortium of 3 companies, working under one umbrella,         sharing costs and benefits.
In general the creation of the national strategy based around the       original research undertaken by Nicholson in Manchester has allowed Costa       Rica to improve its global competitiveness in the ITC software export       market.
This has helped the sector grow from an underdeveloped industry       into one that is now genuinely competitive on a world stage.
Elements of       the framework have since been used in training provided to government       officials in other Central American countries [C].
Egypt       The impact of Nicholson's research into the key dimensions of software       exports planning can be seen in further countries where policy and       strategy have been designed using the model.
A further example is Egypt       where in 2006 a new IT industry national development strategy targeting       export growth was announced.
This strategy used insights from the original       research of Nicholson [5].
This paper is extensively cited in the national       strategy documentation [E].
The key factors from Nicholson's research that were implemented during       the Egypt strategy plan are detailed below:     1) An elaborate, exhaustive, practical and well-designed check list which       was used while defining Egypt's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and       Threats (SWOT) in the targeted export industry segments and markets.
2) A benchmark of the Critical Success Factors (CSF) we needed to examine       in Egypt's specific case in order to assess its potential, chances to       succeed in achieving the committed objectives of its strategy and those       CSF needed to cover in designing more than forty two enablement programs       behind the strategy.
3) A well-documented study detailing the features and specifics of the       "First-Tier Software Exporters: The `3Is'; India, Ireland and Israel"       helping us to learn from the successes achieved by those leading players.
The importance of the software exports success model is acknowledged in a       statement [B] from one of the Egyptian policymakers, who at the time was       Technology Development Advisor to the Egyptian Minister of Communication       &amp; Information Technology and was the lead policymaker responsible for       creation of the national strategy document.
He writes:     "Development of the Model of Software Export Success and using the         model in assessing the performance and potential of other developing and         transitional economies namely; Russia, the Philippines and China,         provided us with a methodology to examine and confirm Egypt's chances         for success, which was also pivotal in ensuring buy-in of the concerned         stakeholders and securing the approval of decision makers of Egypt's         strategy".
Since the introduction of the strategy in Egypt software exports have       risen from $250 million (2005) to &#163;1.1 billion in 2010.
An additional       60,000 new direct and 150,000 indirect jobs had been created in the IT       sector by the end of 2010 [B].
In addition the attractiveness of Egypt as       an offshore location has also improved moving from position 13 on the A.T.       Kearney Global Services location index (GSLI) in 2007 to position 4 in       2011 [D].
The success of the strategy is further acknowledged by the policy maker,       further demonstrating the value of the model developed by Nicholson on the       IT industry in Egypt.
"Egypt's case study as a late entrant to         software exports market and its success not only achieving its planned         and announced objectives but actually over achieving those objectives is         a solid confirmation of the value provided by the study and its intended         objectives to help those late entrants' countries."
