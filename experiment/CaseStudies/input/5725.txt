     Traditional laser light sources operate at a single wavelength and       consequently if a particular investigation requires multiple wavelengths,       the user has to buy and install a separate laser system for each.
By       contrast, supercontinuum fibre lasers provide the directional beam and       tight focus of standard lasers, but with an exceptionally broad spectral       bandwidth.
Although this comes at the cost of lower power compared to       single wavelength lasers, there are nevertheless a myriad of applications       requiring multiple wavelengths for which high power is not necessary.
For       these a supercontinuum source provides an effective all-in-one solution in       which the wavelength is changed simply by inserting an appropriate filter.
Applications are found across microscopy, medical imaging and       spectroscopy, enabling experiments or analyses that would otherwise be       impossible or prohibitively expensive [9].
As such, there is a large and       rapidly expanding market for any company able to provide supercontinuum       fibre lasers having the right price and performance.
As a result of its collaboration with Bath researchers, Fianium [10,11]       is now firmly established as a world leader in supercontinuum sources,       with a [text removed for publication].
Following [text removed for publication] and in recognition of their       outstanding achievements in international trade and innovation, Fianium       received the Queen's Award for Enterprise in both 2009 and 2012 - the UK's       top award for business performance [13].

The 2012 award       specifically recognises the innovation associated with Fianium's       supercontinuum sources.

Bath's CPPM is a world leader in fibre supercontinuum research, and       although not the only research team in this active field [text removed for publication].
The success of the early interaction with CPPM led to a joint DTI/TSB       project with Fianium between 2006 and 2008 [15].
The strengthened links       that ensued provided CPPM researchers with improved insight into the       commercial possibilities of supercontinuum fibres.
In particular, Knight       and Wadsworth initiated research on how to extend the short wavelength       cut-off of the supercontinuum further into the blue end of the spectrum.

An improved understanding of the non-linear optical physics       that underlies supercontinuum generation resulting from theoretical work       at CPPM (Skryabin [7]) led Knight in 2007/8 to design a new fibre that       reduced the short wavelength cut-off to 420 nm (ultraviolet) [5].

Another TSB-funded project, Whitelase, between Fianium and the CPPM       (Knight, Wadsworth; 2008-2011 [8,15]) further extended the supercontinuum       into the deep ultraviolet (320 nm)[6] [text removed for publication].
Knowledge transfer       into engineered products has been facilitated by two KTP projects (Knight,       Wadsworth; 2011-2013) [text removed for publication].
In total, this investment revenue       amounts to [text removed for publication].
The on-going relationship between Fianium and       the CPPM has also been supported by licensing and consultancy agreements       with Knight and Wadsworth.
A number of US and EU patents protect Bath's       methods for supercontinuum generation [16].
