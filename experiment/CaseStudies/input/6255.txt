     Improved diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders     Through the underpinning research described above, we developed a new       diagnostic test for ASD, the computerised Developmental, Dimensional         and Diagnostic Interview (3Di) [a].
We also established a company       (IXDX Ltd) to oversee the training of clinicians in how to use this       product [b].
In the period 2008-13, over 1,000 clinicians from the       UK and around the world were trained to use the interview.
The majority of       these have been psychiatrists, paediatricians and clinical psychologists       working in the NHS.
Courses have been held throughout the UK, including       some specifically commissioned by NHS Education Scotland and by the Welsh       Assembly, who have funded courses across Wales over the last five years,       as part of the ASD Strategic Action Plan [c].
Courses have also       been run in South-East Asia, Europe and South America [d].
The 3Di is now in regular use in the UK and around the world.
For       example, a survey of clinicians in Wales in 2011 revealed that the 3Di was       the most popular history-taking instrument in the diagnosis of autism       spectrum disorders [e].
At our own specialised clinic for High       Functioning Autistic Disorders &#8212; the first such national dedicated       multidisciplinary clinic for this patient group in the UK &#8212; we see over       300 patients per year for assessment and treatment, and the 3Di is used in       all clinical assessment procedures.
Our research directly informs the way       we provide services [f].
The National Autistic Society recommends       our clinical services for parents of children in mainstream school, who       are suspected of having an autistic spectrum disorder.
Use of the 3Di has led to an improvement in the standard of clinical       assessment of autism spectrum disorders.
One NHS Consultant Child and       Adolescent Psychiatrist reports the following: "Feedback from patients         and their families has been excellent... Other agencies (e.g.
Children's         Services and Education) have commented favourably upon the value of such         a thorough assessment, in the context of observations of the child.
I         have been using the 3Di for several years and each one of my patients         has derived benefit from a greater understanding of their difficulties"       [g].
Guidelines     The 3Di is recommended in NICE Clinical Guideline 128, Autism in         Children and Young People.
[h].
Similarly, the Scottish       Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recommend use of the 3Di in Clinical       Guideline 98, Assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions for         children and young people with autism spectrum disorders [i].
Our work has influenced the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical       Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5), published in May       2013.
This included major changes to the content and structure of autistic       symptoms.
The committee identified studies conducted with the 3Di as       offering the best test of the proposed revised symptom model.
The DSM-5       workgroup also acknowledged that the 3Di offers a unique opportunity to       study phenotypic features not captured by other instruments.
Studies by       our team, which focused on children who failed to meet all diagnostic       criteria for `classical autism' as conventionally defined, influenced the       introduction of a new diagnostic term `Social Communication Disorder' in       DSM-5 [j].
International use of the test     Several 3Di translations including Thai, Flemish, Dutch and Spanish [k]       have been made available.
Other countries in which translations are in       regular usage range from Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Finland) through the       United Arab Emirates and India, to Hong Kong.
A Swahili version is       currently underway, our first in Sub-Saharan Africa.
We have been invited       to train practitioners in the standardised diagnostic process of autistic       disorder evaluation, using our procedures, in over 20 countries worldwide.
In 2011-12, for example, we trained over 230 practitioners across       Argentina in a Spanish translation of our procedures [l].
The       President of the Argentine Program for Children, Adolescents and Adults       with Autism Spectrum Conditions (Panaacea) reports that: "In Argentina,         the 3Di is currently the most used diagnostic interview in the ASD         field.
The general feedback has been that the 3Di is a very valuable         instrument in clinical settings, reliable and easy to use."
Informing and stimulating public debate     Our work on raising awareness of the dimensional characteristics of       autistic disorders has had national and international coverage.
For       example, 3Di work on sex differences was featured on Radio 4's Woman's       Hour, and our research has featured on blogs such as John Brock's Cracking         the Enigma, where a post on our research entitled `What is PDD-NOS?'
has received over 300,000 hits [m].
In particular, our work has       informed public and media debate about how ASD should be defined and who       should qualify for the diagnosis.
Mandy was quoted in a recent Scientific       American piece about whether the new DSM-5 ASD diagnostic criteria will       unfairly exclude some children [n].
A number of articles in       newsletters of the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI)       have highlighted our research in this area, and these articles have       garnered many comments from interested members of the public [o].
