     This research has: a) helped to shape the way journalists and       media practitioners around the world have interpreted right-wing populism       (thus also indirectly affecting their audiences, including policy makers);       and b) influenced political debate in Italy and Finland.
The work       was drawn into the public sphere by the growing electoral success of       right-wing populists in Europe, including in countries such as Finland,       France and the UK, as well as their accession to government (or       availability to provide external support to governments), in countries       such as Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland.
In the       specific cases of Italy and Finland, the research gained particular       relevance following, respectively, the accession to power of the Northern       League alongside Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom in 2008, and the       electoral success of the True Finns in 2011.
In light of such       developments, Albertazzi's work, already well known in the public domain,       attracted increased interest (source 3) from journalists and left-wing       parties/organisations seeking critical reflection on the nature of       right-wing populism, as well as the strategies the left should deploy to       respond to the actions of populists in government and/or their electoral       success.
The impact of the research, further discussed and evidenced in       the two sections below, was thus to a large extent driven by its       consumers.
1) Improving public understanding of contemporary European populism by         influencing media reports, including those reaching policy makers.
Albertazzi has been relied upon as a source of expertise by       journalists/media practitioners, and has established a sustained       relationship with prominent organisations which regularly draw on his       research when covering the parties he writes about.
These include, among       newspapers and magazines: in the UK, The Observer (which quoted       from Twenty-First Century Populism in its editorial of 30th       March 2013), The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph; in       Italy, La Stampa and Liberazione; in Brasil, O Estado         de S. Paulo; in China, Sanlian Life Weekly Magazine; and, in       Finland, Helsingin Sanomat.
Moreover, Albertazzi has also commented       on right-wing populism for Italian, British and Australian public service       broadcasters, Radio France Internationale, Channel NewsAsia and the       newsletter of `The Civic Institute', a think-tank financed by the Polish       political party `The Civic Platform'.
The impact of Albertazzi's work on       media practitioners and their audiences is evidenced by the many emails       and letters he has received from journalists (source 3).
For instance, a       journalist writing for De Groene Amsterdammer (The Netherlands),       stated that Albertazzi provided him with very useful analysis on populism,       which allowed him to show that `the PVV [i.e.
the Party of Freedom] is         not an isolated Dutch phenomenon and that there are similarities between         European nations'.
Two interviews given by Albertazzi to De         Groene Amsterdammer were copied and distributed among all Dutch MPs       in the daily `Reader of media articles' produced for Dutch       Parliamentarians.
The first of these interviews was also quoted       extensively by one Dutch MP in his blog; the second saw a very high number       of responses on the magazine's website (source 3).
Further proof of impact       is provided by the statements made by a journalist writing for Vremya         Zavishennih Trebovaniy &#8212; a high profile newsletter through which       ideas were discussed in the period leading to the Global Policy Forum:       'The Modern State in the Age of Social Diversity', held in Yaroslavl       (Russia) in September 2011.
The journalist said that Albertazzi `provided       insight into the nature and characteristics of populism in Europe and helped         the audience gain a better understanding of the detachment between         voters and &lt;&lt;the elites&gt;&gt;' (source 3).
Copies of Vremya         Zavishennih Trebovaniy featuring Albertazzi's interview were       distributed to Russian policy makers, including the Administration of the       Russian Presidency, and other government institutions, with about 3000       copies being sent to experts on international politics around the world.
A       journalist writing for the magazine Marteen!, argues that       Albertazzi's availability to discuss populism helped her to `understand         more of the nature of populism in the UK and the different       definitions that are used when discussing populism', while a reporter from       O Estado de S. Paulo (Brazil) states that, by contacting       Albertazzi, she developed a better understanding of `the political         context in Italy that time' [i.e.
under the fourth Berlusconi       government].
2) Influencing political debate in Italy and Finland.
The success       of right-wing populist parties in Italy and Finland in recent years has       spurred interest in Albertazzi's research among observers of these       countries' politics, leading to invitations to contribute to high-profile       events attended by diverse audiences, which have impacted on political       debates in these countries.
The following are prominent examples of such       events:     a) The One-day Conference: `Berlusconi and Beyond: Prospects For Italy',       held in Birmingham on 12 February 2010, and organised by The Open       University.
Albertazzi participated as a roundtable panellist, alongside       speakers such as the former editor of The Economist, Bill Emmott.
The event was attended by journalists from La Stampa, La         Repubblica and Liberazione, academics, think- tank       researchers, students and the general public (audience c. 60), and focused       on the strategies adopted by Italian populists in government from 2001       onwards.
The discussion, which uncovered the lack of an effective strategy       by the Italian opposition to the Berlusconi government, led to the       compilation by panellists of a list of `Ten questions for Italy's       opposition'.
Due to the exposure enjoyed by the event in the Italian media       &#8212; the list was published by four Italian newspapers, including the best       selling La Stampa and La Repubblica &#8212; Enrico Letta, then       vice-chairman of the major party of opposition, the Democratic Party,       agreed to be interviewed on the matter by La Stampa.
In the       interview, published on 14 February, Letta provided answers to each of the       `Ten questions' raised at the conference, thus publicly reflecting on his       party's response to the populist challenge in the country, its identity       and policy proposals.
It was the first time that a very prominent Italian       politician &#8212; Letta eventually became prime minister in April 2013 &#8212; agreed       to engage directly and publicly with criticism of his party voiced at an       event of this nature.
The public debate on these matters continued in the       following days, ignited by Letta's response, and led to a lively debate       about the strategies of the Italian Left.
For instance: the `Ten       questions' were published in Italian on one of La Stampa's       official blogs and were commented upon by 60 readers (source 4), while on       the Open Democracy website the English translation of the `Ten questions'       attracted a further 19 comments from readers across the world (ibid.).
In       addition to this, La Stampa's editorial of 21 February was also       dedicated to Letta's response.
b) On 10 November 2011, Albertazzi gave a key-note address to the       conference `6th Research and Policy Days &#8212; the State of       Democracy', organised at the Parliament House in Helsinki (audience c.       120).
The event was organised by two think-tanks funded by Social       Democratic parties: The Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS)       and the Kalevi Sorsa Foundation.
Speakers included: the former Social       Democratic Prime Minister of Finland and Candidate in the Presidential       Elections of 2012, Paavo Lipponen, members of the Finnish Parliament, and       policy analysts from a variety of European organisations and think tanks.
In the words of one of the organisers, conference attendees came `from a       variety of backgrounds, ranging from party activists, politicians and       policy makers, to representatives from civil society organisations, NGOs,       trade unions and people with an academic background' (source 1).
Albertazzi's contribution, based on article R6 focused on the consequences       of populist rule for Liberal Democracy and the strategies Social       Democratic parties should adopt in responding to the populist challenge.
The         discussion contributed to political debate in Finland in the period         leading to the Presidential election of January 2012, which was also       contested by the populist True Finns party.
The media provided extensive       coverage of the event (source 1), with Helsingin Sanomat       interviewing Albertazzi on the nature and characteristics of populism in       Europe.
c) On 25 November 2011 Albertazzi delivered a key-note speech informed by       the findings of his Twenty-First Century Populism (R1) to the       conference `Populismo in Europa', a two-day event held in Rome and       funded by Italy's largest Union, the CGIL (audience c. 200).
The       conference brought together members of civil society such as Union       representatives, political activists, researchers, academics and students       to interrogate the impact of right-wing populists in government on social,       welfare and immigration policies, as well as the left's response to them.
According to the organiser of the event (source 2), it provided `a very         useful forum for a thorough analysis of policies promoted by populists'.
Its proceedings were published in a special issue of La Rivista         Italiana delle Politiche Sociali and were made available on U-Tube,       where Albertazzi's contribution has been seen by 108 users so far (source       5).
