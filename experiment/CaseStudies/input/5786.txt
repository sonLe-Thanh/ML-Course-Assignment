     Lambin's research has directly underpinned the World's largest mainland       species eradication programme.
The CNP eradication initiative involved the       deployment of over 500 mink rafts by over 180 volunteers that has led to       the removal of over 700 mink and the effective eradication of all breeding       mink from a 10,570 km2.
Within the CNP eradication zone, many       populations of water vole that had gone extinct have been recolonized, and       the remnant populations are beginning to show signs of population recovery       and expansion [a].
As such, this project is recognised as "...having a         positive impact on the conservation and management of biodiversity in         Scotland" [b] through safeguarding populations of one of the most       iconic species of conservation concern and UK biodiversity, the water       vole, as well as salmonids, ground nesting birds and other key riparian       species.
The eradication protocol put in place by the CNP initiative has now been       adopted as the "standard operating procedure" for effective mink       eradication both nationally and internationally.
Equivalent eradication       initiatives in place or planned in Europe recognise Lambin's research as       "...instrumental for defining procedures and protocols" and "...have         impacted on management policies and practices put in place" [c].
The       CNP initiative underpins a follow-on mink eradication programme in       Scotland covering a 30,000 km2 area north of a line running       from Montrose to Ullapool, which involves over 500 volunteers and (to Sept       2013) the removal of over 1700 mink.
This project is coordinated and run       autonomously by a cooperative involving Rivers and Fisheries Trusts of       Scotland (RAFTS), Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT), Scottish Natural Heritage       (SNH), Cairngorms National Park Authority, University of Aberdeen and many       river authorities with an economic interest in keeping northern Scotland       mink free [d].
As such, Lambin's initial research and subsequent eradication project has       influenced environmental policy and delivered changes in management       practice.
In recognition, the Scottish Government Minister for the       Environment &amp; Climate Change presented Lambin with a certificate for       special contribution to species conservation and management in Scotland,       notably through the SNH Species Action Framework programme [b].
Lambin's work on invasive species eradication in the CNP has had broader       conservation and management impact beyond mink.
According to Scottish       Natural Heritage "Lambin has been instrumental in changing the way we         undertake directed conservation action across large geographic regions,         and has empowered local communities to take ownership of, and steward,         their natural capital".
Moreover, Lambin's work is "...turning         back the tide of pessimism and establishing that low level actions can         have significant positive outcomes for our native wildlife" [b].
This is echoed by the Cairngorms National Park Authority, who highlight "stakeholder         groups now feel empowered to take ownership of the conservation of their         local biodiversity and (have a) perception that their efforts         can have positive effects.
"[a]     Indeed, as a consequence of the CNP eradication initiative the       stakeholder groups involved in the project have taken the decision to       expand mink control activities into lowland agricultural landscapes, and       represent a trained and motivated workforce keen to take on board other       conservation issues.
The project has thus secured a legacy for       conservation beyond mink and water voles.
This is exemplified by the       statement "Lambin's project gave the Cairngorms National Park Authority         the confidence to initiate a program aimed at conserving the critically         endangered Scottish Wildcat" [a].
More broadly the project has had impacts for improved public       understanding of conservation issues [e], as directly quantified by a       subsequent social science study [f].
The impact of the research as defined by REF includes: Impacts           on the Environment by affecting the management and         conservation of natural resources, informing and influencing         environmental policy and planning decisions, and affecting the         management of an environmental hazard; and Impacts on Society       through improving public understanding and engagement/involvement in         research and adoption of new processes involved in conservation.
