     [Superscripts are References to sources in Section 5]     Changing policy: Meeting a need (identified by RSPB and British       Trust for Ornithology) for research into       population declines in woodland migratory songbirds, Goodenough et al.
(2009) examined data from the       RSPB-managed Nagshead Nature Reserve, a nationally important site for pied       flycatcher.
Species-specific research was a strategic priority at this site       (2001-2004 &amp; 2004-2008 Reserve       Management Plans) and throughout the UK [1, 2].
This research       showed substantial decline in flycatcher       numbers, providing important detail for the species profile created by BTO       and Joint Nature       Conservation Committee (cited: http://www.bto.org/birdtrends2010/wcrpiefl.shtml),       which informs       national policy (Biodiversity Action Plans).
This in-depth work informed       additional research (by       BTO) on the geographical extent of the decline and was instrumental in       pied flycatcher being listed       as of conservation concern throughout the UK [1].
Changing practice: Researching the multiple causes of decline,       especially those relating to       breeding success, was an acknowledged RSPB priority, which Goodenough et         al.
(2008) and       Goodenough &amp; Stallwood (2010) addressed.
The finding that nestbox       orientation affects breeding       success (Goodenough et al.
2008), probably related to directional       differences in nestbox microbial       load (Goodenough &amp; Stallwood, 2012), changed RSPB management practice       [2].
At Nagshead,       new guidelines mean nestboxes are oriented away from south-west, improving       breeding success       by pied flycatchers by c. 20%.
This change is critically important       to ensure effective conservation       and buffering decline at a nationally important site for an       internationally declining species.
This       good practice has been shared with other RSPB sites with nestbox schemes       that support pied       flycatchers (e.g.
Gwenffrwd-Dinas in mid-Wales) [2].
Wider impact: Dissemination of these research findings by Dr       Goodenough to Gwent Wildlife       Trust staff and volunteers at an annual training event (March 2011)       attended by more than 50       people, led to altered nestbox placement policy for 28 woodland-based       nestbox schemes       (involving ~800 nestboxes) throughout S. Wales [3].
This       benefits the entire small songbird       community, including Redstart&#8212;another declining bird of conservation       concern&#8212;by increasing       breeding success and allowing population growth.
The project is among the       top five in the UK [3].
Internationally, the findings concerning nestbox orientation were cited in       an International Avian       Conservation manual http://www.conservationevidence.com/actions/498       &#8212;part 58).
Habitat dynamics     Chambers et al.
(1999) showed how palaeoecological methods could       be used to test received       opinion on loss of heather and spread of Molinia within moorland.
Cited 50 times, academics       elsewhere, conservation practitioners and agencies [4, 5]       regard this research as evidence of the       value of palaeoecology (long-term ecology) to palaeoecology, and       legitimised practical attempts to       control Molinia.
This pioneering work led directly to contract       research from statutory national       conservation agencies in Wales (Contract Science Report 420, CCW [6])       and England (Project       Contract VT014, English Nature [5]) on blanket mire and       moorland.The commissioned contract       research demonstrated the utility of such methods for blanket mire       (Chambers et al., 2007, 2013),       which informed the treatment of priority habitats in the Welsh uplands [4,         7], and led to the initial       drafting by CCW of an EC-LIFE application [4].
Prof Chambers contributed to the inaugural `Bridging the Gap' (BtG)       symposium in Hull (designed       to forge links with practising conservation agencies), and to subsequent       BtG Newsletters; to an       international symposium in Stirling involving palaeoecologists and       conservation practitioners; and       to a session on use of past history (palaeoecology) at a Peatlands       Symposium (Durham)&#8212;which       all prompted the Yorkshire Peat Partnership to sponsor a PhD student       (under Prof.
Chambers'       supervision) to investigate the palaeoecology of sites they are restoring,       to inform their       conservation management [8].Cited by Davies and Bunting (2010)       [9] as having major impact on a       key question for UK conservation policy, his research led ultimately to a       call for a review of the       value of the utility of palaeoecology to conservation by Natural England,       for which he was a prime       consultee, influencing a subsequent tender invitation (2012).
The       academic/practitioner group       dealing with biodiversity at the international PALAEO50 Conference       (Oxford, Dec 2012) cited his       2013 paper as informing three follow-up questions in the current top 50       research questions in       palaeoecology: those concerned with assessing "the extent of [past] human       influence and [the use       of palaeoecology to inform] the management of cultural landscapes" (Seddon       et al., in press, line       313)[10].
Chambers' research is regarded as having the greatest       impact on upland policy in Wales       of any commissioned by CCW during the past 17 years [4].
These examples show how innovative uses of ecological and       palaeoecological scientific research       have been applied to species- and habitat-conservation by principal bodies       and statutory       conservation agencies.
The findings influenced change in direction of       policy and attitude, and led       to changes in management and conservation of rare species and habitats.
