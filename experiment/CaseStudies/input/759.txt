MMC research has driven heritage policy, created new art from         research, engendered new understanding of cultural artefacts       and spaces, and contributed to public knowledge and economic         regeneration.
Beneficiaries include the museum and council,       which have been able to make better use of medieval collections and sites,       and the public, who understand more about medieval Chester and who       have been inspired by the events and artwork.
How the impact unfolded: A public workshop was included in the       original MMC project, but the interest of the local museum and the public       led to a rapid expansion.
The workshop became the `Mapping Medieval       Chester Festival' (August 2009), organised in partnership with the       Grosvenor Museum, Chester &#8212; a full day of concurrent events related to the       project across the city, including living history activities, workshops,       tours and presentations all based on the `Mapping Medieval Chester'       research &#8212; which attracted nearly 1,200 people, and generated media       coverage.
The unexpected level of public interest within Chester (and       beyond) also led to the creation of additional resources attached to the       digital atlas of the medieval city [C1, C2].
An interactive, developmental       layer provided an opportunity for the public to upload their own       photographs of medieval sites in modern-day Chester [C1], making a genuine       contribution to the project resources whilst also engaging with the       research in active and accessible ways.
The www.medievalchester.ac.uk       website has received over 2.7m hits from web users to date (excluding       automated search engine requests).
The project captured the interest of local planners, and MMC research was       incorporated in Chester's `Public Realm Strategy' (2009) [C3], as       a model for heritage interpretation.
The MMC project directly informed       policy on which civic enhancements and tourist / arts attractions should       be developed, including St John's and the City Walls.
An AHRC Knowledge       Transfer Fellowship [C4] extended the initial impact of the research and       built on links with the Council, the interest of local history groups and       the public, and the partnership with the Grosvenor Museum, producing:     Hryre (ruin): a Public Art Project, commissioned by       Cheshire West and Chester Council and `Chester Renaissance' with a grant       of &#163;63,000, plus funding from the AHRC.
The permanent light installation       was the work of Nayan Kalkarni, in collaboration with Clarke.
It involved       considerable public engagement (200 people, and a core of 20-25 with       sustained involvement) which fed into the final installation.
The project       has also reinvigorated a regeneration area as a destination for cultural       tourism.
Interpretation leaflets [C5] are available in Chester from       outlets including the Tourist Information Centre.
The artwork was       commended in the Chester Civic Trust Honours, 2012, [C6] and featured in       Chester's bid for City of Culture Status, 2017.
A full project report       including positive public feedback is available [C7].
A major exhibition with 50 associated events, `Discover a         Medieval City: Places, Voices, Journeys Chester' (4 May-22 Sept       2013), curated by the local museum, Clarke and her MMC team.
The       exhibition arises from MMC research, and provided an opportunity for the       Museum to assess and display its medieval collection (previously mostly in       storage), thus enhancing the use of archives.
The exhibition will transfer       to Wrexham Museum and then become a smaller permanent exhibition in       Chester.
Attendance at the Chester exhibition is forecast to be c.31,700       people (11% local, 89% visitors from outside Chester, based on previous       Visitrac records; actual visitor numbers to 31 July 2013 were 26,205, plus       over 2,030 people attended associated events at other locations) bringing       a significant contribution to the local economy.
The economic impact of       visitors attracted to the city's medieval heritage is valued at &#163;51.12 per       head [C8].
An extensive new digital resource was produced (http://discover.medievalchester.ac.uk/,       C2) with handheld/mobile compatibility.
It uses MMC research in new ways,       including customizable tours, games, photographs and maps to enhance       public understanding of medieval Chester and to support the artwork and       exhibition.
It is aimed at a wide audience of local communities and       tourists.
The website has received 382,275hits from web users to date       (excluding automated search engine requests).
Other events (talks, workshops, literary tours) and         media coverage [C9, C10] have expanded public understanding of       medieval Chester, including a talk to Chester Archaeological Society       (2009), Diocese of Chester / St John's Church (2011) and events at the       Chester Literature Festival (over 60 at talk, fully booked workshop of 30;       C11).
Media coverage includes regular articles on project events in the       local press (see section 5 below); the Welsh-language magazine programme,       Heno (S4C) covered the exhibition and ran a piece on the Welsh communities       in Chester (July 2013).
Outcomes from the project have a begun to influence KE/KT practice       and the impact agenda nationally, and the Chester project was the       central focus of a two-day Knowledge Exchange conference at Southampton       University in 2013, which involved delegates from HEIs and the heritage /       local government / commercial sectors.
The MMC project has shared its       models for academic partnerships with heritage bodies (e.g.
Cadw, RCAHMW       and the Church of England Cathedrals and Church Buildings Division).
MMC       research has also contributed to the English Heritage Urban Archaeological       Database project for Chester.
User testimonials show that the public have gained new insights         and understanding of the medieval heritage and culture of Chester:             "Although I've lived in Chester for 40 years, I knew very little           about medieval Chester.
The whole project therefore, has really           informed me and my family."
"...bringing out the richness of the Medieval heritage imbues the           city with even more depth and interest.
Certainly it has raised           questions in my mind.
I have read around the subject and have enjoyed           finding out about it especially when the artefacts, maps and           archaeology have been available to make tangible links with the time.
I hope to continue to develop my knowledge of this area of Chester's           past."
"The writing workshop with its focus on "Borders" was hugely           enjoyable and thought provoking.
It was wonderful to see our group           reading the resulting poems on video at the exhibition."
