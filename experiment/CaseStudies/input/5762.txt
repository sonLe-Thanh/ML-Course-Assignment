     We have achieved impact through research dissemination and engagement       with policy makers at governmental and non-governmental levels.
Here we       focus on the impacts attributable to our work within EEP.
The first impact is the EEP programme itself.
The EEP programme is a       flagship programme for the Governments of Bangladesh and the UK       (represented via DFID, Bangladesh), and represents a major policy shift in       the international development landscape of Bangladesh.
Bath's research       expertise was central to the successful proposal which guided the design       of the flagship programme, and has thereby impacted key governmental       policy decisions [5.1].
Second, our research has embedded the discourse of extreme poverty within       the Bangladesh polity and directly influenced the establishment of a new       institutional focus for extreme poverty.
In 2009, Devine and Wood authored       an EEP paper which was used as a keynote presentation at an international       conference in Dhaka (see reference 3.1).
The conference was widely       reported in the national press and attended by leading academics,       politicians including Ministers and the Speaker of the House of       Parliament.
On the basis of this, Devine and Wood were invited to deliver       `expert workshops' on extreme poverty to the country's parliamentarians.
Five workshops were organised and over 150 parliamentarians, again       including Ministers, attended.
This led directly to the establishment in       2010 of the country's first All Parliamentary Group on Extreme Poverty.
The formation of the group represents a major institutional change at the       highest levels of government in Bangladesh.
According to the Speaker of       the House "the formation of the All Party Parliamentary Group on         Extreme Poverty[...]is a major political development in Bangladesh.
Not         only will it foster cross-party support for extreme poverty programmes         but will also promote a wider discussion in society about the need to         care more for those in greatest need.
Colleagues at the University of         Bath have played a central role in supporting the formation of the Group         and building the capacity of its members" [5.2]     Third, Bath's research has had a direct impact on the capacity       development of the 35 partner NGOs working in the EEP programme.
During       EEP's inception phase (2008-2009), Devine and Wood supported partner NGOs       in devising new projects for extreme poor households, as well as tools for       targeting, monitoring and evaluation.
They also influenced the overall       design of projects supported by EEP's innovation fund.
For EEP NGO       partners, to work with the extreme poor was a new challenge and required       them to develop more suitable approaches.
Commenting on the role of Devine       in this, one NGO leader states: "with the EEP programme, I believe we         have the strongest lesson learning team we have ever had, and the         support and direct supervision you have given to staff has been central         in building up that team.
Having greater capacity in lesson learning has         already brought benefits - we carry out our programme better, we have         improved the effectiveness of the organisation and we have attracted the         interest of new potential donors".
[5.3]     The fourth impact refers to livelihood improvements among the extreme       poor.
The EEP programme has far exceeded its targets in terms of numbers       of direct beneficiary households, with the number recruited exceeding       248,000 against a target of 150,000 [5.4].
Independent baseline survey       analysis [5.5.]
verifies that beneficiary households belong to the bottom       2-3% of the country's poor.
Given that beneficiaries had no prior       experience of NGO involvement and that NGOs had no experience of working       with the extreme poor, this represents a major and radical achievement in       policy terms.
In 2010, Andrew Mitchell, then UK Secretary of State for       International Development, visited the programme and is quoted as saying:       "I've seen credible data that 74% of beneficiaries on one of the Shiree         projects has managed to lift themselves off the bottom, and now have a         chance of a better life ...It's wonderful that British aid is lifting         the poorest of the poor on to the ladder of economic opportunity".
The data he refers to comes from the lesson learning/monitoring and       evaluation activities of the programme overseen by Devine and Wood [5.1].
Fifth, EEP research has influenced policy decisions at local levels in       Bangladesh.
One of the EEP partners, an NGO called NETZ, carried out       research supervised by Devine and Wood into indigenous community access to       government safety nets.
The findings of the research were used to develop       an integrated advocacy campaign which consisted of a) lobbying policy       officers in local areas where indigenous communities resided; b)       organising a national workshop (in which Devine participated as a keynote       speaker) to stimulate a wider debate in society and put pressure on       national policy makers; and c) hosting an international conference in       Berlin and Brussels (in which representatives from the EU parliament, the       UN as well as the German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development       participated) to secure high-level external support.
The advocacy campaign resulted in notable and tangible benefits for       indigenous communities.
Before the research and advocacy, only 2.65% of       NETZ's beneficiaries had access to government safety nets.
At the end of       the campaign, this figure had risen to 10%.
The NETZ Executive Director       concluded: "Our research was important to help us plot out an advocacy         strategy with local communities and government officials at national and         international levels.
Joe's supervision of the original research and his         support in the analysis of the data ensured we had strong and convincing         evidence to lobby policy makers.
His participation at the national         workshop was also very important" [5.6]     Sixth, our engagement with the EEP programme has further enhanced our       expertise on poverty dynamics in Bangladesh.
Save the Children is one of       the NGO partners in the EEP programme and in 2012, asked Devine and Wood       to help develop a global `signature programme' in Bangladesh.
Devine and       Wood prepared concepts notes and facilitated two international workshops       in May 20-12 and December 2012.
According to the Regional Food Security       &amp; Livelihoods Advisor for Save the Children, "Both Geof and Joe         had supported our successful EEP programme and we asked them to help us         build on this to develop the signature programme.
Joe and Geof brought         invaluable insights, expertise and knowledge of poverty in Bangladesh to         the workshops, and this directly influenced the strategy Save the         Children adopted to achieve the ambitious scale of the signature         programme" [5.7].
Further evidence of enhanced reputation is given       in Devine and Wood's work (2012-2014) for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign       Affairs.
Following a peer reviewed international competition.
Bath (Devine       as PI) was awarded a 659,000 euros research grant to assess the       effectiveness of the government's framework for development cooperation in       Bangladesh.
The successful proposal, authored by Devine, was written       substantially around the expertise gained through our EEP work (5.8).
Finally, the EEP has directly benefited the reputation of the University       of Bath as a centre of excellence in poverty studies.
Devine's research in       Bangladesh was selected, following a peer review process, as a showcase       for a Set-Squared Partnership event which sought to highlight "research         programmes that have genuinely changed the world for the better".
Devine's work was one of the 25 highlighted cases from across the       sciences, one of the very few from the social sciences, and is used to       illustrate the contribution university research can make to society [5.9].
Furthermore our research and policy engagement was recognised in the 2011       Diamond Jubilee round of the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Further and       Higher Education [5.10].
