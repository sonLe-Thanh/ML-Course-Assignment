     The aurorae captivate the public imagination and there is a great deal of       interest in this beautiful and mysterious natural phenomenon.
The impact       of AuroraWatch was highlighted when Channel 4 contacted Farideh Honary       (SAMNET PI) in 2006 mentioning that the phrase "aurora borealis" was in       the top 100 of most searched-for terms in MSN's UK search engine, and       asked if they could visit Lancaster to produce a programme on aurorae.
Since then, SPEARS scientists have given more than 20 national/regional       radio interviews, have appeared on television to explain the auroral       phenomena, such as the BBC's Sky at Night ("The Merry Dancers", 2009,       ~200,000 expected audience) and Horizon ("Solar storms &#8212; the threat to       Planet Earth", 2012, 1,800,000 expected audience), and have delivered 32       talks to schools and 60 presentations to public audiences (~500       attendees).
In addition to TV and radio programmes, AuroraWatch has       featured in 10 newspaper/magazine articles since 2008 (RC2), and in the       book "Field notes from a hidden city: An urban nature diary" (Esther       Woolfson, 2013) (RC3).
Lancaster's auroral research was the subject of a       short film ("Written in the sky: aurora borealis explained") produced by       the IOP in 2012 as part of the "Physics Lives" series, for A-level       students.
It won a British Universities Film and Video Council award in       April 2013 and has over 16,960 viewings on YouTube (RC4).
The huge public interest is clear.
AuroraWatch has over 109,000       subscribers, comprising 26,930 Twitter followers, 21,279 Facebook fans and       61,628 email subscribers.
Users are encouraged to photograph the aurora       and share via our Flickr group, which has 771 members and 1,239 aurora       photographs since 2011.
These numbers indicate a significant increase in       public engagement compared to 2008 when AuroraWatch had 22,000 subscribers       (RC5).
Professor Wild has delivered 12 enrichment lectures, to audiences of ~500       passengers, on board the Queen Victoria and Queen Mary cruise-liners       between 2008 and 2011.
He has also delivered lectures to aurora       enthusiasts on four aurora pleasure flights (~130 passengers per trip).
The repeated invitations testify to the interest and impact of these       lectures (RC6).
The public support for AuroraWatch led to over 2500 individuals       expressing their concern to PPARC following its decision not to fund       SAMNET as a UK National Facility.
At the time AuroraWatch had only 10,000       subscribers, hence the 2500 individual letters corresponds to 25% of       AuroraWatch subscribers.
Their support letters constitute a four-volume       document which was sent to PPARC's Chief Executive.
To view all these       letters, please see (RC7).
Many AuroraWatch users are amateur astronomers       and radio amateurs.
Following the public outcry over concerns that the       research council's decision might threaten the operation of SAMNET       magnetometers and the AuroraWatch service, Robert Goodwill, MP for       Scarborough and Whitby raised these concerns and questioned the Secretary       of State for Trade and Industry in Parliament over PPARC's decision       regarding SAMNET funding and the future of the AuroraWatch programme       (RC8).
Following Mr Goodwill's intervention, Ben Wallace, MP for Lancaster       and Wyre, visited the SPEARS Group at Lancaster University in 2006 and       lobbied STFC (PPARC's successor) for the decision to be reconsidered.
The       public support re-instated SAMNET's funding in 2007 (RC1).
According to a Royal Astronomical Society survey in October 2011,       AuroraWatch has had a significant impact on public's interest and       appreciation of science.
The survey attracted 9971 responses (a response       rate of 25%, total number of AuroraWatch subscribers were &lt;40000 in       2011) and found a range of positive impacts.
For example, as result of       subscribing to AuroraWatch, 3667 respondents report that they watch more       science on television, 1348 read more science magazines, 3089 read more       science websites and blogs, 524 now study or plan to study science and 865       participate in citizen science projects.
More than 1400 subscribers listed       other changes in behaviour including an interest in amateur astronomy,       buying a telescope or booking a cruise to the Arctic to see the aurora       (RC9).
The RAS survey indicated that school pupils were the age group       least-represented in the survey respondents.
To increase participation by       school pupils we developed a wireless, low-cost magnetometer and obtained       funding from Lancaster University to construct ten magnetometers.
A       competition was launched to select ten schools that would best incorporate       the magnetometer and its data into their teaching of STEM subjects.
164       applications from across the UK were received.
The selected schools will       involve 1800 pupils in AuroraWatch related activities, including projects       for CREST awards, astronomy, science, physics, engineering, electronics       and STEM clubs, and comparison with solar telescope, sunspot, VLF       receiver, muon detector and high-altitude balloon radiation detector data       (RC10).
The impressive response has encouraged Lancaster to seek further       funding to involve more schools in AuroraWatch.
