     The ICR's HSP90 research programme has had significant impacts on health       and on commerce.
ICR research has validated HSP90 as a drug target and identified       biomarkers to be used in clinical trials.
This work was published, so that       pharmaceutical companies worldwide could use the public domain information       to develop their own in-house drug discovery programmes and more than 20       novel HSP90 inhibitors are now in clinical trials.
The ICR independently discovered the pyrazole resorcinol series of HSP90       ATP competitive inhibitors and then entered into a research collaboration       with the UK biotechnology company Vernalis to optimize this chemical       series further in order to identify a clinical candidate.
Later Vernalis       licensed the programme to Novartis, who adopted the ICR/Vernalis clinical       candidate, named it AUY922 and took it into clinical trials worldwide.
Impacts on Health            AUY922, a novel HSP90 inhibitor discovered by the ICR, is now         progressing through clinical trials in the UK and internationally, and         some of the Phase II trials have now been completed.
Since 2008, many         patients have participated in these trials (4 trials with 89 patients         have been completed and 18 trials with estimated enrolment of 845         patients are ongoing); the drug has a good safety profile and there is         preliminary evidence of efficacy (20-30% response rate in breast and         non-small cell lung cancer with positive Phase II data by objective         RECIST criteria in both diseases).
The most promising, advanced trials         so far include phase II clinical studies in patients with HER2-positive         breast cancers which have become resistant to the commonly used antibody         drug trastuzumab (Herceptin), and also in patients with non-small cell         lung cancer who have become resistant to the widely used drugs erlotinib         and crizotinib, which target two tumour pathways driven by EGFR and ALK,         the protein products of which require HSP90 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Research         Ref 6 above].
The ICR validated HSP90 as a potential cancer target and provided         intellectual leadership (in parallel with Memorial Sloan-Kettering and         NCI).
This encouraged other pharmaceutical companies to develop novel         drugs and recruit patients into clinical trials.
Over 20 novel HSP90         inhibitors are now in clinical trials [6].
Over 15 international         pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have cited the ICR's published         research in this field (Web of Science data).
The ICR developed novel pharmacodynamic biomarkers that are being used         internationally in clinical trials of HSP90 inhibitors.
Use of these         biomarkers demonstrates target engagement and increases the rational         basis for proceeding with treatment and reduces the risk of later         attrition.
Research Ref 5 above has been cited 280 times and by more         than 7 international companies (Web of Science data).
Impacts on Commerce            Vernalis has received substantial licence fee and milestone payments         from Novartis as a result of the HSP90 deal.
This has helped Vernalis to         continue to employ UK staff at its facilities in Cambridge and Reading.
Vernalis' Interim Results report 29th July 2013 states that         AUY922 is one of the operational highlights and that the company's         collaboration income has been growing [7].
Vernalis has added shareholder value by having AUY922 in its pipeline         [7, 8].
Novartis has added shareholder value by having AUY922 in its pipeline.
A Novartis investor report listed AUY922 as one of its potential         blockbusters (Novartis 2nd quarter 2011 results and a         Novartis R&amp;D Investor Day presentation lists accelerating AUY922         development as a planned key activity in 2013-14 [9].
Industry has invested in HSP90 research.
Novartis and other         pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials of HSP90         inhibitors.
There are 90 clinical trials of HSP90 inhibitors listed on         the National Institute of Health Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, with a         conservative estimate of an excessive of 5,000 patients treated with         these inhibitors worldwide.
