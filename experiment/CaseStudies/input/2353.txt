     The University of Glasgow's research into conflict and battlefield       archaeology has enjoyed high visibility in the media, encouraged public       interest in history and battlefield archaeology, and ensured the       preservation of sites for future archaeological study.
The University of       Glasgow findings have also allowed countries and families to honour       long-dead soldiers whose whereabouts had been unknown and assumed lost.
Excavation and commemoration of WWI sites in Europe     In 2009, Pollard and Banks' discovery of the 1916 mass grave at Fromelles       containing 249 previously unidentified Australian and British soldiers led       to the construction of the first Commonwealth         War Graves Commission (CWGC) cemetery in 50 years.
The Fromelles         (Pheasant Wood) cemetery was completed in July 2010 and the soldiers       were honoured by their countries in a ceremony attended by Prince Charles       and the Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce.
The remains       discovered by Pollard and Banks were identified using DNA testing,       offering the soldiers' descendants a `conclusion' to their relatives'       stories.
A 2012 ceremony honouring the Australian soldiers who died at       Fromelles and whose remains were identified was attended by Australia's       Parliamentary Secretary for Defence David Feeney, who said: "Today, on the       96th anniversary, we can finally honour these men and give them       back their individual identities."
Pollard and Banks' excavation of the 1918 `Vampire' dugout tunnel system       in Ypres gained a similarly high public profile by delivering previously       `hidden history': during WWI tens of thousands of men spent much of their       time underground in a system of shelters and bunkers that were flooded,       buried and then forgotten for almost nine decades.
The team's work was       filmed by Channel 4's Time Team in spring 2008 (broadcast late       2008).
Its work on the flame projector under the Somme battlefield was       also filmed by Time Team in 2010 (The           Somme's Secret Weapon, broadcast April 2011).
In 2011, Pollard       and Banks led a team investigating the Stalag Luft III PoW camp in Zaga&#324;,       Poland, which was filmed by Channel 4 as the documentary Digging           The Great Escape (broadcast November 2012).
The Time Team       programmes aired to an average of 1.6 million viewers, while Digging         the Great Escape attracted an audience of over 2 million.
The Centre       for Battlefield Archaeology at the University of Glasgow is also       completing a three-year sustainable tourism programme with the Treadright       Foundation.
The agreement provides $50,000 per year for the Centre to       undertake battlefield archaeology projects that have a tourism benefit for       the local economy, which the Foundation then passes onto tourists and       travel companies.
The first year (2010-11) sponsored excavation work at       Mont St Quentin on the Somme in France, with material from the September       1918 battle being exhibited at the Historial de la Grande Guerre       museum in P&#233;ronne, France.
The Historial also has the artefacts       from the flame projector project, which formed the basis of a museum       exhibition Breathing           Fire from June to December 2011, attracting hundreds of       visitors to the museum.
The flame projector work was sponsored by Cream       Productions in Canada and Channel 4 for &#163;39,000.
Channel 4 devoted a Time         Team special to the dig, broadcast on 14 April 2011, and also       sponsored the work on the Great Escape at Zaga&#324; in Poland in 2011, with       the project attracting &#163;30,000.
Policy change through the identification of battlefields in Scotland     Because of their expertise in battlefield archaeology, Banks and Pollard       were invited to conduct the research for an Inventory of Scottish       Battlefields for Historic Scotland.
Through this research the University       of Glasgow played a key role in the definition, identification, and       preservation of historic battlefield sites.
Historic Scotland confirms       that "their work on the Inventory was directly related to the Scottish       Government's Scottish Historic Environmental Policy (SHEP) relating to       battlefields (published 2009)."
The Inventory of Scottish Battlefields was fundamental to the development       of the Scottish Government's SHEP on battlefields, published in 2009.
This       changed the official status of a battlefield to align with the status of a       historic monument or listed building.
Before this, battlefield sites were       not included as sites of national importance in their own right, although       they have sometimes been preserved due to a castle, monument or grave       somewhere on the site, such as the graves and markers at Culloden.
Following the issuance of the policy, it is more difficult to develop such       sites, and Historic Scotland states that the impact has been to afford an       official layer of protection for battlefields against depredations which       have already damaged or destroyed many historically significant sites.
As the Inventory came into effect, Historic Scotland provided assistance       to landowners and local authorities to help them establish management       plans to ensure the preservation of battlefields.
With Banks and Pollard       acting as consultants, Historic Scotland produced guides to the new       management status of battlefields with specific mention of planning       concerns: Managing Change in the Historic Environment: Historic         Battlefields Interim Guidance (2011) and An Introductory Guide         to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland (2011).
In       2011, they also provided three training days (in Edinburgh, Perth and       Blair Atholl) on use of the Inventory for local authority archaeologists,       Historic Scotland staff and representatives of natural heritage bodies.
Use of the Inventory in planning decisions     Local authorities throughout Scotland have issued guidance on planning       issues relating to battlefields listed in the Inventory, and planning       applications affecting Inventory battlefields must undergo consultation       with Historic Scotland.
For example, Stirling Council quotes the Inventory       frequently in responses to planning applications encroaching on the       battlefields of Sheriffmuir and Bannockburn, under development pressure       due to their locations adjacent to existing housing.
And, accordance with       Historic Scotland requirements, Stirling Council has included Draft         Supplementary Guidance 24: Battlefields as part of its Local       Development Plan in October 2011.
A typical example of the changes       introduced by the SHEP with regard to battle sites is the approval by East       Lothian Council in 2011 of a number of conditions and changes to a       proposed development with a car park potentially encroaching on the Pinkie       Cleugh (1547) battlesite.
Historic Scotland believes that:     SHEP broke new ground by including protection of the whole landscape of       the battlefield, encompassing the range of events during the battle rather       than the main area of fighting alone.
SHEP policies include a measure of       protection through the planning system and other public policies for the       first time.
SHEP was also innovative in establishing the Inventory as a       publicly accessible resource to promote the understanding, research and       appreciation of battlefields and as an active record that can be amended       and expanded over time.
These prime aims have been achieved, with       Inventory sites now included within Local Development Plan policies, and       decision-makers provided with clear information on which to base their       policies and views.
The detailed site reports and indicative maps in the       Inventory bring together information only previously available from       disparate sources, and in the majority of cases provide new information       resulting from the researchers' documentary research and non-invasive       field-work.
Consequently the Inventory adds significantly to knowledge       about battlefields in Scotland and incorporates important new primary       research, both of which are having a practical impact on the protection of       battlefields in Scotland.
Policy influence outwith Scotland     Historic Scotland notes that the Inventory has led to interest from other       countries, including Ireland, England and Wales, in developing and       enhancing similar inventories/battlefield protection measures.
Following       informal discussions between Banks, Pollard and the Irish Government in       2007, Ireland developed a Battlefields Project very similar to the       Scottish model.
In 2011, Dr Pollard was appointed to the English Heritage       Battlefields Advisory Panel, a group advising the heritage body on       battlefield conservation and management policy and playing a key role in       the protection of English battlefields.
A recent example is the addition       of the Battle of Lostwithiel in Cornwall to the English Heritage Register,       which makes the battlesite a material consideration for the planning       authorities.
