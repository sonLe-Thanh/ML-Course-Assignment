     Two multinational enterprises to benefit directly from University of       Glasgow research are Holcim       Ltd, a Swiss-based organisation and the world's second largest cement and       building materials       company, operating in 90 countries with 80,000 employees, and Getinge AB,       a Swedish-based       medical technology company operating in 14 countries with 14,000       employees.
Since 2008, these       two organisations have sought to improve their corporate reputations by       implementing global       policies and initiatives in employer branding and employee engagement to       attract, motivate and       retain talented people in a range of occupations.
The senior HR teams and HR Directors of both companies were influenced by       the ideas and       empirical research disseminated in practitioner conferences by Professor       Martin, and invited him to       act as an internal adviser to teams leading major projects on employer       branding and employee       engagement.
This advisory role began with invited seminars in both       companies and progressed to       advising on HR policy and practice.
Both the Holcim and Getinge AB cases       have been used to       inform conceptual development in how employer branding and engagement can       contribute to       innovation and reputational capital in a recent academic journal article       (see Martin, Gollan &amp; Grigg,       2011), emphasising the mutual influence/engaged research element of this       work.
Holcim Ltd       Between 2009 and 2011, Martin acted as confidential advisor to the project       leaders and HR       Director at Holcim.
His involvement resulted in policy changes to focus on       employee engagement       as well as employee attraction.
In 2010 Martin and the team implemented       employer branding       research in a pilot project at Holcim.
In 2011 they developed a talent       pipeline model in which       different stages of the talent management process were identified and       elaborated to aid policy       development and evaluation of the process.
Both these projects are       included in a critically       reflective book chapter (published in Scullion and Collings, Global         Talent Management, Routledge       2011) produced by Martin in collaboration with Holcim's HR Director and       currently being used to       influence policy and practice at Getinge.
The former HR Director of Holcim, now Vice President (Supply Chain),       stated:     I first came across Professor Martin when he provided a keynote at a         conference in London,         during which he outlined ideas that helped me think more clearly about         the design and         implementation of the project [developing an employer branding       program]... His research on         employer branding, engagement and social media was of great help in         shaping the project         and providing context for a company new to these concepts.
This had the         impact of         sharpening our thinking by acting as a critical friend to the team and         ensuring that what we         proposed to do was evidence-based and importantly, relevant for an         organisation that had         not conducted such a process in HR previously.
The resulting tools, such         as Touchpoint,         gained traction globally &#8212; particularly in Latin America, and are still         in use today, proving their         sustainability.
The Holcim Annual Report for 2010 describes the HR Touchpoint Analysis as       `an easy-to-use tool         to assess how a Group company manages its workforce from an HR         perspective.
It analyzes how         consistently and strongly Holcim Group companies manage the candidate         and employee         experience at Holcim, and the impact this experience has on employee         engagement and company         reputation.'
Because the Touchpoint analysis tool linked to employee       engagement and satisfaction       surveys, it provided the company with the necessary information to       formulate action plans and also       provide insight on how central HR functions were perceived by the staff.
Getinge AB       Working with Getinge AB from 2008-2013, Martin helped to shape more       rigorous thinking and       policy with regard to HR leadership, employer branding and employee       engagement, such as       establishing a more theoretically informed approach to evaluating these       policies.
He provided       research expertise to support two critical areas for Getinge AB: a major       Global Employer Branding       Initiative (June-November 2011); and an Employment Engagement Survey       (March 2012),       described below.
Martin devised a development programme for ten       senior-level HR practitioners at       Getinge AB, running two four-day courses in 2009-10.
Due to their success,       these courses will be       repeated with a new cohort of senior HR executives in 2014.
Martin became       part of an internal       consulting team advising Getinge AB on the choice of vendor selection for       conducting engagement       and employer branding research (among major international consulting       firms, including Towers       Watson, Kinexa and Engage).
This advisory role began in 2011 and continued       through to 2013,       during which time Martin oversaw the design and implementation of       appropriate survey material in       Getinge AB for two ambitious HR projects.
The first project focused on building an employer branding identity and       establishing a genuine way       of communicating that identity with the company's 14,000 employees.
The       company vice president       in charge of the initiative wanted to `generate appeal, create a         company identity and establish a         way of communicating the identity which was authentic and real'.
Going on to note that, `With the         assistance of Graeme Martin at Glasgow University, we started to         establish a branding strategy         which could become a way to sustain a corporate reputation.'
Martin       helped to design the       methodology for the research and interviews which were conducted with       approximately130 staff in       10 countries and in multiple business units.
An outcome of this stage of       the work with Getinge AB       was senior management's conclusion that an employee engagement survey was       required before       an employer branding strategy could be devised.
The Getinge AB project       manager states:     `As a result of this work, a multitude of issues and problems         throughout the organization were         identified, which could also be considered opportunities.
Several         business actions were defined,         yet the general decision was not to proceed with these strategies until         we better understood the         challenges and gained a broader picture via a global employee engagement         survey.'
Martin subsequently contributed to the design of Employee Engagement       Survey (March 2012),       which measured employee involvement, commitment and psychological       investment in the       organisation.
Martin remained an active advisor to the project through       2013; Getinge AB is now at       `Phase 3' (the launch of the survey: September 2013) and aims to implement       an action plan in       2014.
