     The research resulted in creation of the performance work Blueprint       which has since been staged       at, and contributed to the programmes of, a number of UK theatres and       performance venues and       to nationally and internationally respected festivals of performance.
Blueprint       has provided public       access to theatre that, through its approach to working with       non-performers, is recognised to have       created an original experience of parental relationships in performance.
In the REF period, there were eight public presentations of the work, in       seven different venues,       collectively attracting audiences of some 400.
The work was publicly       marketed by promoters for its       exploration of relationships between mothers and daughters and its       incorporation of non-performers       via video.
This attracted audiences with little or no previous knowledge       of experimental       performance and contemporary theatre; in consequence, Blueprint       has not only introduced new       audiences to contemporary performance but also to the contemporary       performance programmes of       some of the venues in which it has been staged.
By and large, these venues       cater for regional       audiences whose access to, and awareness of, new work is otherwise highly       limited.
Additionally, however, Blueprint's incorporation within significant       festivals (Brighton Fringe; Flint       Festival) engaged audiences with an existing interest in contemporary       performance in some of the       key debates currently informing theatre and live work.
It can also,       therefore, be seen to have       contributed to the thinking and/or practices of informed, non academic       audiences: other theatre       makers; performance promoters and programmers; students of drama and       performance; critics;       Arts Council England officers and so on.
Because these festivals have an       international audience       base, and their programming is international, Blueprint also       supported the international standing       and awareness of emerging practice in the UK.
An after-show talk at the       Flint Festival for example       was attended by other artists performing at the festival as well as       regular visitors to the theatre.
Blueprint was discussed and commented on positively with regard to       its originality.
Practitioners       expressed interest in the exploration of non-performance in relation to,       and development of, their       own practices.
At the Lakeside Arts Centre, Nottingham an after show talk was attended       by a diverse mix of the       general public, performance practitioners, an Arts Council England       officer, and researchers from       the Centre for Genetics at the University of Nottingham with whom Rippel       and Garton had       previously collaborated (see above).
Performances of Blueprint have been promoted by means of arts       centre and festival programme       brochures, dedicated flyers, posters, face book and other social media       sites, You Tube videos and       Zoo Indigo's (http://www.zooindigo.co.uk), arts centres' and festival       websites.
Public awareness of       the work and engagement with it, by these means, may be seen to have       extended to significantly       greater numbers than the 400 who came into contact with it first-hand.
