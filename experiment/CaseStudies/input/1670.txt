     Creative and critical research in poetry has developed new audiences         and enriched existing ones through local, national and global engagement         with different communities.
Innovations in international contexts     Dr Zo&#235; Skoulding's poetry from Remains of a Future City and The Museum of       Disappearing Sounds has been translated into eighteen languages,         contributing to the cultural life across the world via her participation         in numerous international literary festivals.
Such readings in other       countries often have far greater cultural impact than they do in the UK       because they happen on a larger scale.
In Nicaragua (2010) and Venezuela       (2011), for example, Dr Skoulding read at events with audiences of         thousands [5.8] as well as extensive coverage in the         national press [5.9].
Because of her wide international       experience she was a leading contributor to a programme for Radio 4,       Guns, Roses and Poetry Readings, aired in 2011, explaining to UK listeners       why poetry is seen as so important in other cultures.
[5.7]     While the first workshops of Metropoetica in Krakow and Ljubljana       were planned with Literature Across Frontiers as part of Dr Skoulding's       AHRC project, subsequent events were commissioned by literary         festivals in Riga, Wroclaw and Athens, where the group (see website       [5.1]) was invited to create performances to reflect an       understanding of a particular city through poetry, film and photography       and present it to a local non-specialist audience.
[5.1] These       invitations show that the project's impact in generating a new         approach to artistic practice and literary interaction between minority         languages.
LAF's director writes that Metropoetica 'had a profound       impact on our practice with respect to the translation of poetry in the       context of gender-related inquiries on the one hand and community cultural       development on the other.
The project engaged both the participants and       local communities in the cities where the project took place in thinking       about their environment and about life in urban environments in general.
'She adds that Dr Skoulding's approach to connecting writing and         translating poetry about cities from a gendered perspective has provided         useful insights for other projects.'
[5.3] The Wroclaw event       received extensive coverage in the Polish media [5.2].
Work from       the project is publicized via a website at [5.1] and an       international co-publication in book form (3.3).
Dr Skoulding worked with UK, Indian, Swiss and French poets in December       2010 on a co-translation and performance project in Chennai, Pune and       Trivandrum, India, organized jointly by Literature Across Frontiers and       the British Council.
Follow-up multilingual performances took place in       Bangor and at the high-profile Ledbury Poetry Festival in June 2011,       showing how the combination of translation and multimedia performance         in Dr Skoulding's previous work has informed further cross-cultural         engagements [5.4].
Enriching cultural life in Wales     The projects outlined above have generated ways of understanding the         role of English as a `bridge' language in poetry translation and         performance; English is decentralized and placed in relation to       other languages, while the process in itself is made a creative focus       rather than a neutral transaction.
This approach addresses the literary       cultural heritage of Wales, which is split between two languages, and has         provided new models for cultural interaction.
The first North Wales       International Poetry Festival, directed by Dr Skoulding, took place in       October 2012.
Nine visiting international poets gave readings alongside       Welsh writers in both languages with a focus on the role of translation       and performance in the local bilingual context.
Performances took place in       empty shops and small businesses in Bangor High Street, including a       recital in Welsh by local schoolchildren, contributing to current         initiatives to regenerate the town through artistic and community         engagement.
Encompassing experimental work by highly regarded       international practitioners in several languages as well as Wales's       historic strict-metre traditions, the festival transcended the binary         linguistic oppositions that often limit cultural exchange.
The       curation of the festival as a multilingual event with site-specific and       cross-media elements was drawn from Dr Skoulding's research in       Metropoetica.
The event was the first of its kind in Wales and over 300         people attended, mainly in Bangor but also in Aberystwyth and Mold.
Dr Skoulding's application for Arts Council of Wales funding for a second       festival in 2013 was successful, indicating support for the project at         a national level.
[5.6]     As Editor of the quarterly Poetry Wales since 2008, a position she was       offered on the basis of her work as a poet and critic, Dr Skoulding has commissioned         poems and essays from leading poets and critics both within Wales       and internationally as a means of encouraging diversity within Welsh         culture and opening it to international readerships.
Her editorials       link creative and critical elements in the magazine, providing an         exchange between public literary engagement and practice-based research       by poet-academics throughout Wales [5.5].
Public presentations of       Poetry Wales have enabled her to speak about writing from Wales at       literary events across the world.
At the same time, she maintains contact       with thousands of contributors and would-be contributors through replying       personally to unsolicited submissions.
In providing a channel for         cultural engagement across the country, with attentiveness to its       disadvantaged regions as well as more obvious centres, the magazine         contributes actively to the development of Welsh culture outside         academic structures.
This ongoing work links an awareness of       poetry's international significance with its local and regional potential,       thereby increasing cultural confidence.
