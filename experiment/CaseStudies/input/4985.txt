     Improved patient outcomes and quality of life through BTX-A         administration using the         Dasgupta technique: KCL research has changed the way that OAB       syndrome is managed by       using a less invasive BTX-A bladder-injection technique that rapidly       reduces overactive bladder       symptoms and removes the need for major reconstructive surgery to increase       bladder capacity.
Using validated clinical questionnaires, patients undergoing BTX-A       treatment show significant       improvements in their quality of life, as they are able to overcome       negative emotions and social       limitations associated with the syndrome, and experience fewer physical       symptoms (10).
Enhanced cost effectiveness using BTX-A injections as a treatment for         OAB syndrome: A       comparison of the more invasive surgical therapy for OAB syndrome,       augmentation cystoplasty,       with BTX-A micro-injections has shown that the BTX-A approach is cheaper       over a 5-year       period (11).
Given the minimally invasive nature of BTX-A therapy, these       lower costs are often       directly related to the decreased incidence of surgical complications.
The       high success rate of       BTX-A treatment also reduces the need for additional costly complementary       treatments, such as       incontinence aids or antibiotics for urinary-tract infections.
International uptake of the Dasgupta surgical technique through         KCL-based teaching &amp;         mentorship programmes: The KCL-pioneered minimally invasive BTX-A       injection technique       has been taught by the KCL team to more than 60 colleagues from around the       world, including       the UK, Italy, India, South Africa, the USA, Switzerland, the Netherlands       and Belgium (12).
Incorporation of KCL-developed BTX-A therapies into national and         international clinical         guidelines: KCL research has had a significant impact on informing       the clinical management of       OAB patients around the world.
KCL research (see [1] - [8] above) has       informed the treatment of       lower urinary-tract disorders in NICE guidelines (13) and EU consensus       panels (14).
This       research has been further incorporated into international guidelines       established by the Canadian       Urological Association (15) and the American Urological Association (16).
KCL-developed BTX-A therapies are approved by the FDA and the EU:       In 2012, the EU       recommended the approval of BTX-A for OAB treatment (17).
In January 2013,       the FDA       approved the use of BTX-A for OAB (18).
These approvals substantially       extend the reach of this       new therapy.
KCL researchers invited to advise on development of further         innovations: As a result of       Professor Dasgupta's discoveries and experience with BTX-A treatment, he       has been invited to       join the advisory boards of several companies actively developing new       surgical innovations and       drugs.
Examples include Allergan Inc., Intuitive Surgical, Pfizer and       Astellas (2008-2013).
Coverage of KCL research by international media: The exciting       impact of KCL's research       (see [5] above) into OAB syndrome has been featured by many media news       outlets.
This has       included national coverage by BBC Radio 4 and the Daily Mail, and       international coverage from       the Alpha Galileo Foundation, Nursing Times and the Times of India (24).
