     Context: Standard methods for assessing aircraft noise fail to       account for: firstly, the effects of       noise exposure on the conduct of everyday life; secondly, the       states of anxiety produced by the       expectation of noise even when it is not strictly audible; and thirdly,       the relationship of those       sounds classified as noise with other sounds heard as part of the       inhabiting of a particular       environment.
This research draws attention to the way acoustic data are       produced and used in       Japan, yet has wider applicability for other areas of the globe.
Pathways to Impact: Sound recordings were presented in a variety       of formats.
Firstly, a track from       [C] was featured in a CD distributed with the avant-garde magazine The         Wire (circ.
~30,000) [1].
Secondly, recordings were made available via the Sensory Studies       website [2].
Thirdly, a short film       was commissioned for the Al Jazeera programme `People and Power'       on the role of women in       citizens' anti-base movements in Okinawa [3].
Finally, an art installation       &#8212; `Air Pressure: Aircraft       Noise and Perceptions of the Environment' &#8212; was exhibited at the Whitworth       Art Gallery       (Manchester).
The Guardian newspaper noted the exhibition's directness: "Air         Pressure creatively         documents the cultural clash between the lifestyle of traditional         farming and the turbulent thrills of         international air travel.
Focusing on two families who defiantly         continue to farm at the end of         Japan's Narita Airport runway... as an artwork, its audio-visual impact         is more spectacularly         immersive than academically informative.
Dare I say it: the thrust and         roar of planes can be         uplifting after all" [4].
The Whitworth run (November 2011 &#8212;       February 2012) included a `Japan       Society for the Promotion of Science' (JSPS) symposium `Risky Engagements:       Encounters       between Science, Art and Public Health' (5-6th January 2012),       that included a two-hour open       session in the Gallery, attended by ~50 people who were able to make a       direct connection       between the immersive installation (and its related outputs) and the       questions raised around the       lack of accountability these scenarios often reveal.
The symposium brought       together Japanese       public health scientists with anthropologists and artists from the UK.
Discussion centred upon how       art-science collaborations (and `scientific communication') may be       structured to affect `bottom-up'       policy change [5].
The seminar also included Japanese academics involved       in the study of the       impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
As the UK President, Japan       Society for the Promotion of       Science outlines: "Through the conference the distinctive approach to         the position of social science         in the art-science interface that Air Pressure represented was made part         of a discussion about the         opening up in Japan of a new method of inquiry into environmental         problems."
This has already led       to concrete plans "to develop this research method further in a         multi-team member project across         the Asia Pacific" [6].
Soon afterwards, the sound film from the       exhibition &#8212; `Ki-atsu: The Sound of       the Sky being Torn' [4] &#8212; was accepted for competition at: ISEA 2012 (one       of 50 film works       selected from 1500 entries); Bideodromo 2012 (one of 69 works       selected from 467 films) and the       IX Media Art Monographic Show 2013 (Colombia).
It has also recently been       accessioned into the       permanent collection of the Haus f&#252;r Elektronische K&#252;nste (Basel).
(1) Primary Impact: Local authorities in Japan have adopted new ways         of promoting the         public understanding of acoustic science, with a view to enhancing         public debates on         aircraft noise.
In Japan, where the media report on aircraft noise       as a matter of national interest,       public meetings and events around aircraft noise have become nodal points       in the formulation of       aircraft operating policies, and have tested the evidential status of       acoustic data in ways that       directly inform legal cases.
As the UK President, Japan Society for the       Promotion of Science       confirms, with reference to his own foundational research: "this new         way of presenting acoustic         evidence, alongside personal testimony, has greatly assisted attempts to         breach a long-standing         impasse in negotiations over aircraft noise, involving citizens, local         authorities, the military and the         private sector" [6].
In April 2013 the exhibition was shown in two       locations and discussed at a       public event held at the science centre in Nago city (5th April       2012), with Cox interviewed by       Ryukyu Shinpo and the Okinawa Times &#8212; the latter quoting       Cox's aim "to express the context for         the noise, and to use the power of art to explore whether it is damaging         to everyday life" [7].
Okinawa Museum of Art and History (Naha City): In Okinawa, a group       of public officials led by       the senior environmental health official, organised and provided payment       for the installation to be       exhibited, and facilitated newspaper interviews with Cox.
The Head of the       Prefectural       Government's Department of Environmental and Community Affairs noted that       the event: "received         the support of the Prefectural Government... A large number of people         were able to experience         aircraft noise through visual media, enabling them to gain a vicarious         insight in to the way aircraft         noise affects living conditions.
This will help resolve issues of         aircraft noise in the future... By         expressing the aircraft noise that invades the farming community living         in the vicinity of Narita         Airport as an art film, viewers were able to familiarise themselves with         the issues of aircraft noise.
We hope that this experience will help inform the debate as we work to         improve issues of aircraft         noise from the US military bases in Okinawa" [8].
Additionally,       testimony from a member of the       Okinawa epidemiological survey &#8212; a specialist in the psychology of       disorders related to aircraft       noise and the traumatic memories of the war in Okinawa &#8212; noted how       visitors to the exhibition were       able to appreciate the portrayal of the farmers' lives, and the use of the       data-image from the       Nittobo microphone, also remarking that: "some people commented         that they hadn't realised there         were still people living like this in Narita... there were plenty of         people who asked for a similar         piece of art to be created from fieldwork at military bases like Kadena         and Futenma" [9].
The       publicity surrounding the exhibition led to a visit to the exhibition by       the Futenma district mayor,       who asked that Cox and Hiramatsu use the method of combining sound       measurements and audio-       visual recordings to describe the effects of Osprey helicopters, operating       out of the Futenma base.
Narita Bunka-kaikan (Cultural Hall): Narita City Council's       educational division sponsored Cox's       exhibition and distributed 8,000 leaflets about the installation to local       schools.
The leaflet       connected the research behind the installation to on-going questions       around the effects on public       health of aircraft noise continuing until late at night, and it encouraged       Narita residents to attend.
The exhibition was covered in Mainichi Shinbun (morning       circulation ~3.45million), which led to       visits from the main players in the current debate &#8212; including the mayor       of Narita city, anti-airport       protestors and local farmers.
Both the Mainichi Shinbun article       and testimony from the Narita       Prefecture Council note how the installation refocused the role of       measurement techniques in       estimating noise effects, away from their entrenchment of the political       positions of the affected       parties, and towards an appreciation of the environmental issues at stake       [7][10].
The Narita city       authorities have been in dispute with the community of farmers displaced       by Narita airport for over       forty years, and in the week of the exhibition the airport authority's       decision to extend the night time       flight curfew (from 11pm to 12pm) was being publically contested.
The       engagement of all parties       with the research behind this exhibition has helped address this impasse.
The Narita Prefecture       Council officer responsible for monitoring relations between airport       authorities, local residents and       acoustic scientists for the last thirty years affirmed that: "many         people were moved by the sincerity         of the Shimamura family and their devotion to farming the land...
I was         pleased that there were a         lot of people who travelled a long distance to see the film" [10].
Overall, these two exhibitions of `Air Pressure' have demonstrated that       the sponsoring officials       used the installation to effect the following changes.
Firstly, to extend       and re-interpret the         scientific evidence presented by acoustic scientists in public       meetings and court proceedings       over the last twenty years.
Secondly, to improve the accessibility of         evidence presented to varied       publics (citizen groups, government officials, lawyers, judges, the media,       etc.)
Thirdly, to add new         and rigorously evidenced dimensions to the ongoing assessment of the       impact of aircraft noise.
(2) Secondary Impact: The methods developed through this research       emerge from a social       scientific interface between art and acoustic science, and have had an impact         on how sound         data are understood in relation to noise pollution.
Crucially, this       led to a fruitful working       relationship with Nittobo &#8212; one of the two companies who       manufacture the sound monitors used in       Japan's domestic and military airports [D].
As the UK President, Japan       Society for the Promotion of       Science Research confirms: "The importance of the research was         acknowledged by Nittobo,         whose managing director asked permission to test a new prototype sound         monitor in a position that         we had identified on the site, where unmonitored noise from aircraft on         the ground was felt most         intensely by the local farmers" [6].
Whilst the research is of immediate consequence for the citizens of       Narita and Kadena seeking to       halt the extension of airport activity, it was also notable that the research         methods utilised have         a universal applicability.
Exhibiting `Air Pressure' at the 2012       ISEA festival (Albuquerque) &#8212; one       of the world's oldest and most prestigious electronic arts festivals &#8212; substantiated the significance       of the methods employed, and their public value.
The exhibition stood out       as an alternative to the       sustainability discourses that commonly shape narratives around mechanical       technologies and       their environmental effects.
The location of the festival allowed the work       on Narita to be brought       into dialogue with similar projects, such as one that dealt with the       problems of aircraft noise in       Tucson, Arizona.
General acclaim led to `Air Pressure' being displayed at       the Albuquerque       Museum of Art and History for an additional four months (November 2012 &#8212;       February 2013).
