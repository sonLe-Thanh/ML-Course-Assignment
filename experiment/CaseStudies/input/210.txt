     The research has had an extensive impact on the development of       methodologies in HRIAs and EHRIAs and on policy debate at international,       national and local levels, across a range of areas:     Impact on the use of HRIAs to assess international trade agreements:       Harrison's research was integral to the incorporation of the first ever       legally-binding human rights reporting process in an international trade       agreement.
He was commissioned by the Canadian Council for International       Co-operation (see 5b) to apply his research (3b) to the Canada-Colombia       context and his resulting paper, Conducting A Human Rights Impact         Assessment Of The Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement: Key Issues,       was a major influence on the policy debate, both in parliament and in       civil society campaigns.
He presented it to key parliamentarians and civil       society actors (via webcast seminars), gave evidence to the subsequent       Parliamentary enquiry into the Canada-Columbia Free Trade Agreement (FTA)       (see 5g), and was part of a small expert advisory group advising the       Canadian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the appropriate       methodology for the Canada-Colombia FTA reporting process (5b).
The       agreement concerning annual reports on human rights and free trade between       Canada and Colombia was signed in May 2010 and the free trade agreement       was implemented in 2011.
Harrison has since given evidence to       Parliamentary hearings in relation to the first year of the reporting       process (5b).
Harrison's work has also informed the development of policy on HRIAs       within the United Nations.
In June 2010 the UN Special Rapporteur on Food,       Professor Olivier De Schutter (5a), convened a meeting of experts in       Geneva to advance methodologies and thinking for undertaking HRIAs for       trade and investment agreements.
Harrison was commissioned to produce the       main background paper for the meeting, applying research in his 2008 and       2011 articles (3b and c) to the UN context.
He subsequently formed part of       a small expert group responsible for assisting the UN Special Rapporteur       in drafting the UN Guiding Principles of Human Rights Impact         Assessments of Trade and Investment Agreements (see 5a and f).
These       principles are now the key reference document for States that are       undertaking HRIAs.
Harrison has also provided research evidence to the UN Office of the High       Commissioner for Human Rights, having been commissioned to produce a major       study of the impact of international trade and investment agreements on       the protection and promotion of human rights.
The resulting Study on         Human Rights Trade and Investment (forthcoming) includes detailed       analysis and guidance for conducting an HREIA of a trade agreement (see       5a).
Impact on the methodology for conducting HRIAs of trade agreements:       Harrison's research has also been vital to a number of individual HRIA       studies conducted by the UN and civil society organisations including an       HRIA of the PACER-Plus trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand       and the Pacific Island countries; an HRIA of the EU-India FTA; a study of       the impact of PACER-plus on the Pacific Island of Vanuatu and a study of       the impact of intellectual property provisions in bilateral trade       agreements on farmers' livelihoods in three different developing       countries.
His research is referenced in all of these studies, and his       methodological insights have been utilised extensively (see e.g.
5e and       h).
In addition, his research findings on institutional arrangements for       HRIAs (3b) have been utilised as the basis for the work of the Alternative       Trade Mandate Alliance (a network representing over 100 member       organisations across Europe) in their campaign for a reformed EU Trade       Policy (5e).
Impact on the methodology for conducting EHRIAs of policy: As a       result of the work described above, CHIP was commissioned by the SHRC to       undertake a study which critically evaluated both equality and human       rights impact assessment across the full range of policy areas where       studies have been undertaken.
Human Rights Impact Assessment: Review         of Practice &amp; Guidance for Future Assessments (3c) led to the       Scottish Commissioner for Children and Young People reforming its       methodology for conducting EHRIAs.
It was welcomed by the Chair of the       SHRC as `an extremely valuable contribution to both to the         Commission's own work and that of other practitioners and civil society         groups working to eliminate and mitigate the negative human rights         impacts of policy and decision making' (5c).
The research is also the basis for on-going work between the Scottish       Government, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Society of       Local Authority Chief Executives, the Scottish Council Equalities Network,       the NHS/SG Health Directorate, Audit Scotland, the Association of Chief       Police Officers in Scotland and the Scottish Prison Service, including the       piloting of joint EHRIAs throughout Scotland.
Harrison has provided       research evidence to all these groups and has drafted Guiding Principles       based on his research for conducting future EHRIAs.
He is currently acting       as advisor to a project where the new approach advocated by his research       will be piloted in two local authorities in Scotland (Fife and       Dumfriesshire) over the next 18 months.
Leicestershire County Council have       also utilised the SHRC research as the basis for reforming their own EHRIA       process (5c).
Following this, the Joint Committee on Human Rights' Report on the         Implementation of the Right of Disabled People to Independent Living       recommended that the Government should publish an integrated human rights       and equality impact assessment of the likely cumulative impact of the       proposals on independent living, based on the methodology developed for       the SHRC (5c).
Impact on policy debate by conducting EHRIAs: The       two EHRIAs (3e and f) undertaken jointly with Coventry Women's Voices, an       umbrella organisation representing around 150 organisations and       individuals (including Coventry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre, Foleshill       Women's Training, Valley House, Coventry Haven, Unite the Union and       Coventry Ethnic Minority Action Partnership) in order to assess the impact       of the public sector spending cuts on the human rights of women in       Coventry, have enhanced public understanding of the issues, provided       research evidence that has stimulated debate both locally and nationally,       led to changes in policy, and inspired research by a range of voluntary       organisations (5d and j).
The three studies have been widely disseminated, with public launches       both locally and nationally, widespread media coverage, and over 15,000       downloads from the website.
The studies have been discussed in two UK       Parliamentary debates, with Geoffrey Robinson MP predicting that they       would be seen as a `landmark' (Hansard, 12 July 2011) and Yvette Cooper       identifying them as a model for future research on the impact of the cuts       (Hansard, 8 June 2011).
Councillor Ann Lucas, leader of Coventry City Council, commented that `the         reports have had a huge impact both in Coventry and nationally' and       identified that their key contribution was to `bring together all the         different effects of the cuts and demonstrate clearly how it is the         combined impact that is most devastating'.
She also commented: `I         am often down in Westminster and see both MPs and peers carrying around         copies of these reports with them and referring to them frequently -         they should be compulsory reading' (5j).
The research also informed the production of a toolkit for the Trades       Union Congress (5i) and has also inspired women's groups in Bristol,       Islington, Liverpool, Yorkshire and the North East (5d and j) to undertake       EHRIAs directly utilising the methodology in the Coventry study, which in       turn are having an impact across the country.
As Mott (5d), chair of       Bristol Fawcett Society noted, `[o]n the basis of the work done by         [CHIP], we were able to produce our own report on the impact of the cuts         on women in Bristol.
The report had a big impact in Bristol, was         referred to by officers in the drafting of their budgets, and has meant         that the Council is now more willing and able to engage with the issues         we have identified as they make their tough spending decisions.'
CHIP has been awarded an ESRC Collaborative Studentship Investigating       Cuts and Changes to Legal Advice Services (2012-2015) to continue this       work and the Barrow Cadbury Trust, an independent charitable foundation,       has funded a third report launched in 2013, assessing the human rights and       equality impact of the spending cuts on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic       women (5d and j).
