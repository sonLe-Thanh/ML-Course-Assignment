     Critical congenital heart defects are an extremely serious issue for       newborns, affecting around       1600 cases annually in the UK alone.
Up to one third of these are not       detected in basic hospital       screening practices, and these babies are at significant risk of serious       health complications and       death.
Through a portfolio of interlinked clinical and theoretical       studies, Dr Ewer's work has       provided extensive evidence of the clear benefits of pulse oximetry       screening, and this has had       major impacts on international policy and practice, as well as directly       for children and their parents       where the test has been implemented as a result.
This research was       described in a Lancet editorial       as 'a new milestone in the history of congenital heart disease' [1].
Impact on international policy       The Lancet paper (2011) and subsequent HTA report (2012) received       considerable international       media attention and Dr Ewer has subsequently been invited to advise       international policy makers       considering the implementation of PulseOx screening.
In 2011 Dr Ewer was invited as advisor to a working group of the         Secretary's Advisory         Committee on Heritable Diseases in Newborns' and Children (SACHDNC) in         Washington,         USA.
Following this meeting the group advocated the introduction of         pulse oximetry screening,         endorsed by the American Academy of Paediatrics, American Heart         Association and American         College of Cardiology [2].
As a direct result, the US Secretary for         Health and Human Services         recommended the addition of pulse oximetry screening for CCHD across the         US [3].
Thesenior         cardiologist leading the SACHDNC group described Dr Ewer's study as         having better design,         appropriate reference and clarity of cardiac defect definition which         meant that `his data were           instrumental in creating [the] recommendations' [4], and that his         work "tipped the balance of           evidence towards universal screening in the U.S.A" [5].
Dr Ewer recently advised Michigan State, and 7 states in the US are         currently performing         routine screening.
The majority of states are making progress towards         universal screening [6]       Following a keynote lecture by Dr Ewer in Sydney, Australia, a         state-wide PulseOx screening         policy is being developed.
Dr Ewer is currently advising Leiden University Medical Centre on a         pilot study to assess the         feasibility of implementing the pulse oximetry screening in the         Netherlands       Following a workshop on pulse oximetry screening in Beijing China in         April 2013, including key         representatives of Chinese national and regional screening committees,         the President of the         Children's Hospital of Fudan University, wrote to highlight that Dr         Ewer's "own advocacy role           has been crucial in convincing my organisation of the importance of           this technique in identifying           cardiac defects and saving lives", and that based on his work "my           team has been working on a           similar screening project... which is showing encouraging outcome for           those newborn babies           with severe congenital heart diseases".
[7]       The Vice-President of both Union of European Neonatal &amp; Perinatal         Societies and the World         Association of Perinatal Medicine commented that Dr Ewer's work "has           been fundamental in           prompting hospitals and policymakers internationally to consider           adoption of this technique into           routine clinical practice".
He also noted on behalf of the Spanish         Society of Neonatology that Dr         Ewer's role has been "crucial in preparing the proposal of a           national neonatal screening           recommendation... Our ongoing dialogue has already resulted in           preparing a national guideline           for Congenital Cardiac Disease Screening programme.
"[8]       The research was described in 2012 by the Irish Health Service         Executive and Royal College         of Physicians in Ireland as seminal research that "should be           undertaken in all Units across the           country", as it was at that time only used in 6 of the 19 units         [9]          Impact on UK practice and policymakers       In 2010 a national survey found that only 7% of UK neonatal units       undertook routine pulse oximetry       screening.
A survey of 204 units in 2012 [10] indicated significant       improvement, with almost 20% of       units now utilising pulse oximetry routinely.
In units which were not       screening, 70% were actively       considering it, clearly indicating a nationwide shift of opinion among UK       neonatologists about pulse       oximetry screening in their local units, with a substantial majority now       in favour.
Birmingham Women's Hospital adopted pulse oximetry screening under the       guidance of Dr Ewer.
Over a 3 year period (2010-13) there were 187 admissions as a result of an       abnormal screening       test.
This equates to approximately 60/year, just over one admission per       week or 0.8% of all births.
Of the 187 babies admitted 7 had a CCHD which had not been previously       suspected.
In addition, 5       other babies had a non-critical congenital heart defect which had not been       suspected.
Importantly,       of the 180 babies which did not have critical congenital heart defects,       many other serious health       conditions (including congenital pneumonia, sepsis, and pulmonary       hypertension) were identified       as a result of pulse oximetry screening, and in fact only 36/180 (20%) of       admitted babies had no       serious health issues.
This highlights important additional benefits for       pulse oximetry screening       beyond increasing identification of CCHDs.
Dr Ewer has also been actively involved in shifting opinion in the       central decision-making unit for       national screening programmes.
The National Screening Committee (NSC)       advises Ministers and       the NHS in the UK on all aspects of screening, and supports implementation       of screening       programmes.
Using research evidence, pilot programmes and economic       evaluation, it assesses       evidence for programmes against a set of internationally recognised       criteria covering the condition,       the test, the treatment options and the effectiveness and acceptability of       the screening programme.
Dr Ewer has been the key clinician involved in extensive discussions       advising the Newborn and       Infant Physical Examination (NIPE) programme within the NSC regarding       possible implementation       of pulse oximetry screening in the UK.
This has resulted in a UK public       consultation on `Screening       for Congenital Heart Defects', which highlights that `There is now         considerable research evidence         to demonstrate that pulse oximetry... increases the detection rate of         critical or life-threatening         CHDs at the newborn screening opportunity' and that `Routine         pulse oximetry is probably the most         promising additional newborn screening modality' under       consideration, for which Dr Ewer's work       provides the bulk of the underpinning evidence and rationale [11].
The       Director, Population Health       Science, Public Health England wrote in support of Dr Ewer's role in       triggering the NSC debate       and further commented "Without doubt the work that you led and the         team research output has         already led to considerable debate and change in the whole approach to         ante natal and newborn         screening, its value, culture and practice.
"[12]     International campaign groups       A key ongoing impact of this work has been its use by lobbying groups, who       have been very quick       to recognise the benefits of pulse oximetry for screening newborns and are       campaigning for its       routine use in national practice.
These groups all cite Dr Ewer's PulseOx       study as the most       important piece of evidence for their campaigns, and many national       charities such as the       Children's Heart Foundation, Little Hearts Matter, and Tiny Tickers have       outlined their gratitude for       the credence that Dr Ewer's work has given to their lobbying efforts with       NIPE and collaboration       with other congenital heart charities.
In particular, the Children's Heart       Foundation have provided a       letter of support stating that:"The extensive and compelling research         from Dr Ewer into the         effectiveness of Pulse Oximetry testing in detecting congenital cardiac         conditions has been crucial         to our understanding and work around the issue.
It has allowed us to         strongly make the case that         this test should be introduced for newborns in the UK.
"[13]     Internationally, campaign groups also commonly recognise the value of Dr       Ewer's work, including       http://pulseoxadvocacy.com/research/,a       US site to support parents to lobby for the use of pulse       oximetry, which cites the PulseOx study as one of "the most compelling       pieces of evidence" that       "should be part of any advocacy work".
