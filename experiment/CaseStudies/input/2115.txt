            With regard to Cunningham's work on Robert Grosseteste he has been         involved in reproducing and disseminating in the public domain material         on the subject of Grosseteste's life as well as his impact on the         history of thought.
He has been involved in the establishment of         international networks and has initiated and organised commemorative         events and academic forums.
In July 2009, Cunningham organised an international conference on Robert             Grosseteste, his thought and its Impact.
This conference         drew in an international field of scholars from America and Europe and         was well attended by members of the local community.
The proceedings         were edited by Cunningham and published in 2012 by the Pontifical         Institute for Medieval Studies.
Marcia L. Colish, Oberlin College, Ohio         reviewed this volume calling it `A distinguished collection of essays         offering original scholarship on Grosseteste's work as a translator,         commentator, and pastor...this outstanding volume makes a major         contribution to Grosseteste studies.'
This conference was also attended         by the International Robert Grosseteste Society, an organisation that         had been set up at a previous conference held at the institution and         organised jointly by Cunningham and a former colleague.
The Grosseteste         Society is a thriving academic organisation which does much to promote         public awareness of the life and works of Grosseteste.
Its intention is         also to bring to the public's attention an appreciation of Grosseteste's         important place in the history of intellectual development.
Its website         serves members and the general public by exchanging and publically         disseminating knowledge on the subject of Grosseteste.
It also provides         access to various primary and secondary sources relating to Grosseteste         and the medieval world in general as well as providing information on         related conferences, public lectures, colloquiums and events.
The 2003         conference had its proceedings published by the Pontifical Institute of         Medieval Studies in 2013.
With regard to Icelandic studies, Cunningham         has established international working relationships with Icelandic         academics and their institutions.
He read a joint paper with the         Icelandic scholar Vilborg Au&#273;ur Isleifdottir at the Reformation Studies         Colloquium, York University, in April 2008.
In May 2012 Cunningham delivered a public lecture on Grosseteste at         the Bishop Grosseteste University `Homecoming Event', an event that         celebrates the institution with alumni and members of the local         community.
In October 2012, he delivered the Annual Grosseteste Memorial         Lecture at Lincoln Cathedral.
In January 2013, he delivered a public         oration on Grosseteste on the occasion of his institution receiving         university status.
This oration was published later on the University         website.
In March 2013, he delivered a lecture on Grosseteste to the         Nettleham Historical Society and in June 2013, he delivered the Hosford         Memorial Lecture on the same subject to the Sleaford History Group.
He         also addressed the Hull Theological Society in October 2009 on the         subject of the Reformation in Iceland.
This paper is available on the         organisations website (see link below).
In October 2013, Cunningham         spoke on the subject of Grosseteste to the Lincoln branch of the Rotary         Club.
Media:     In May 2012 Cunningham brought Robert Grosseteste to the public's       attention by writing to the Vatican calling for his canonisation.
Cunningham argued publically that this canonisation never happened because       of historical anomalies which should, in the light of recent knowledge, be       discarded.
This was reported in the local newspaper (Lincoln Echo,       see link below) and in the national newspaper of the Church of England (Church         Times, see link below).
These papers ran stories on what was the       beginning of a campaign and the articles drew in a good deal of       correspondence.
Cunningham was also interviewed for BBC Radio Lincolnshire         and a story ran on BBC Look North (TV).
In 2013, in his capacity as an expert in Church history, Cunningham was       asked to write an article for the Lincoln Echo on the resignation       of the Pope (see link below).
This article was a summary and assessment of       the Pope's career.
