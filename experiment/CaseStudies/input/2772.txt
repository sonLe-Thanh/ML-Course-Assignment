     SOLE's impact has been transformative in terms of the range of       organisations and individuals who have been inspired or whose behaviour       has been changed.
Since 2008, Mitra has been invited to deliver on average       25 keynote speeches a year to different educational practitioner and       policy audiences in 27 different countries across all 5 continents.
Educators in schools and in a range of other global non-educational       organisations have been inspired, including: British Council, Google, The       Commonwealth of Learning, Cisco, John Templeton Foundation, Learning and       Teaching Conference, International Congress on Distance Learning, National       eLearning conference, Italian Foundation San Paolo, ICC International       Language Network, Distance Educators conference, Learning Futures, British       Computer Society, ICT (Information Communication Technology) in Education       Networks, Learning and Skills Improvement Service and Open Internet       Summit.
In 2010 Mitra also became one of the few people who have been       invited to give a second TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) talk (the       first in 2007), titled `The child-driven education', which has been viewed       more than 1.6 million times.
The innovative pedagogies arising from this       research on SOLEs have been trending on Twitter.
Mitra's TED Prize Talk       (2013) on SOLEs has been viewed over 1.7 million times on TED.com and       TED's YouTube channel and over 60 major press articles written about the       work (e.g.
NYTimes, TIME, BBC, Times of India).
The `SOLE Toolkit' on the       TED website, based on research carried out by Mitra, Dolan and Leat, has       been downloaded over 16,000 times and a number of blogs have been posted       on the TED website that evidence international impact, for example from       schools in Ontario, New York, Melbourne and Columbia (IMP1).
Mitra's research also inspired the multi-Oscar winning film Slumdog       Millionaire.
Vicas Swarup, the author of the book on which the film is       based, speaks of coming across a news report of how slum children had       begun using an internet facility entirely on their own (IMP2).
The 2013 TED prize is evidence of substantial international impact.
According to TED Director Lara Stein: "The TED Prize is a         forward-looking prize, and we award it to individuals who have         demonstrated significant achievement that the prize wish can build on.
Sugata has not only created a remarkable body of research around         self-directed learning, but he has support from teachers around the         world who are tapping into his methodology with great success."
Mitra has other awards for the impact of his research on schools.
In 2011       Learning Without Frontiers awarded Mitra its Special Achievement Award "to         an individual who has, in the opinion of the judges, had the most impact         during 2010 on radically improving learning or positively disrupting         traditional methodologies through the use of affordable, disruptive         technologies".
In 2011 Mitra was awarded the Klingenstein Leadership       Award for his current research which "is leading toward an alternative         primary education, using self-organized learning, mediation, and         assessment environments".
In 2012 Mitra was awarded the Advanced       Global Educator Award (2012) which "is presented to individuals who         have demonstrated unparalleled leadership in promoting and advancing         excellence in global and international education".
Many media       articles have referred to SOLE research, such as one in The Guardian 3       March 2009 entitled `Slumdog Professor', by Lucy Tobin.
Similarly, an       article was written by Matt Ridley, Wall Street Journal, December       2010 (IMP3).

SOLE research has had impact on schools, private companies and on leading       opinion formers.
There is evidence of impact on classroom practice and       student learning in Australia.
As a result of the work of the principal of       a primary school, New South Wales, Australia, this research has, reports       the principal, `influenced our pedagogy and resulted in positive         changes to the teaching and learning culture in our schools and is being         adopted and utilised in a growing number of schools in our region'.
The principal talks of `a change in mindset in terms of how they       (teachers) teach'.
Examples are given of impact on students: `student         enjoyment and engagement in their learning has increased' and as a         result `classroom misbehaviours are virtually non-existent during SOLE         learning'.
A SOLE Australia Network Wiki for online learning and       sharing has now been established (https://soleaustralianetwork.wikispaces.com/).
The principal has promoted this model of learning at numerous conferences       in both Australia and New Zealand.
As a result, he reports, `a variety         of schools from different settings are now enthusiastically trialling         SOLE'.
The primary school is now recognised as a pioneer of       self-organised learning and as a result attracts a continuous flow of       visitors from other schools across Australia.
The principal has been       approached by the largest school region in New South Wales to lead a SOLE       strategy across the region and provide training (IMP4).
Coronation       Public School (Canada) have started `Kids Got SOLE' (http://www.kidsgotsole.com).
The Director of `21st Century Schools', a US based education company       specialising in professional staff development and curriculum design has       shared research on SOLE to 25,000 subscribers globally.
She has been       inspired to study SOLEs in greater depth, altering her materials and       processes in line with the ideas of SOLEs, telling many others about       SOLEs.
She notes: `At 21st Century Schools we believe that Dr. Mitra's         work is invaluable, and we see it as fulfilling of our vision and         mission to promote his research to as many people as possible,         especially educators' (IMP5).
School impact of SOLE has also been national.
An Ofsted report on       Middlestone Moor Primary school, Durham, cites SOLE as evidence of good       practice (IMP6).
The Curriculum Leader for Design and Art at a       High School (North Tyneside) states: "the impact has been huge...whole         school CPD is being developed on SOLE and interwoven into our school         priorities".
This leader has set up a network group to share       practice across schools and promotes SOLE through presentations and       Twitter.
She says: "the biggest impact has been...the learning that is         achieved is outstanding and the levels of attainment much higher than         groups that are taught traditionally" (IMP7).
A classroom teacher who regularly used SOLEs between 2009-11, with a Year       4 classroom (8/9yrs) in an urban North East England primary school, in       partnership with university researchers Dolan, Mitra and Leat described       the impact on her teaching.
A diary kept for a year (2010) evidences in       detail the positive impact over time on her teaching practice, leading her       to become more reflective, more able to see all her pupils as `learners'.
She said: `I was able to see how the students would choose to learn         without any input from me.
It's more representative of what they're         like.
You feel like you know them a little bit better.
They're more         themselves, there's less pressure on them to perform, to do what they         think I want them to do...
It makes you think about how to operate in         other lessons, like if you need to be `on the case' all the time.
It         makes you think about why you teach in a certain style...It raises your         expectations of what they're able to do without your help.
You can         relinquish more control...It makes you reflect on your practice.
You         think about how you present non-SOLE lessons, how much time you give         them to talk, how much time you give them to follow their own learning,         how much structure is necessary' (IMP8).
The Director of Arts at a High School, Durham, said Skype in the       classroom implemented by Leat and Lofthouse (lecturer, 2003-on-going) had:         `huge impact on the development of a new facility which can be accessed         by the school and the community.
The particular teachers involved have         been amazed at some of the findings and have been surprised at students         handing in high quality work a lot earlier than requested due to their         interest and engagement during this research' (IMP9).
An unexpected impact concerns the use of SOLE techniques in corporate and       professional learning across all sectors, highlighted when Mitra won the       Leonardo European Corporate Learning Awards `Crossing Borders, 2012':       "Mitra has inspired education experts around the world to re-think       learning methods and to develop a new learning design for talent       management &#8212; in school education as well as corporate learning" (IMP10).
SOLE research has had a significant impact on leading opinion formers in       the UK, USA and around the world.
For example, references to Mitra's       research can be found in over 30 recent publications on the subject of       technology and education including: Mega-Schools, Technology and Teachers:       Achieving Education for All (2010) by Sir John Daniel; Free to Learn       (2013) by Peter Gray; Learning on Demand: How the Evolution of the Web Is       Shaping the Future of Learning (2012) by Reuben Tozman; Century of the       Child: Growing by Design, 1900-2000 (2012) by Aidan O'Connor; Imagining       India: and Ideas for the New Century (2013) by Nandan Nilekani.
