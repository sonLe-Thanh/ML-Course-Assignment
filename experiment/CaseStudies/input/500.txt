     During the assessment period, the group assisted many aerospace, defence       and transport       companies to optimise materials processing and component manufacture, and       enhance product       reliability.
Impacts from this interaction include:     a) the introduction of new manufacturing methods through design, plus       change of practice or       policy through greater understanding;     b) environmental impact due to new lightweight recyclable materials,       reduced energy processes       and CO2 emissions;     c) economic impact due to increase in competitiveness, market share,       reduction in energy costs       and better use of raw materials.
Impact by activity:             Intermetallics: our modelling was instrumental in the success         of the pan-European IMPRESS         [3d] project1 (2005-2010), for the manufacture and use         of intermetallics and developing a           process route for the melting and casting of f067&#8212;TiAl turbine blades1         which re-orientated materials         development for the next generation of Rolls-Royce aeroengines.
Quoting         Wayne Voice (then         RR section head) at the TiAl symposium, Birmingham 2010: "Within a         decade, high efficiency         aero-engines will feature lightweight TiAl instead of nickel superalloy         blades."
Casting of thin         blades requires high superheat; we devised a new method of           increasing superheat in cold         crucibles using static magnetic field damping (LMPC best paper award).
This was confirmed         experimentally by Consarc (the         furnace manufacturer) that patented the idea (2011)2.
In the         same framework, we modelled gas atomisation to assist the development of         novel Raney (NiAl)         metal powder catalysts.
These found use in hydrogen fuel         cells (Oy           Hydrocell Finland) and as         platinum replacement catalysts (Johnson Matthey).
To inform the general         public of these         environmentally important advances, a Materials           Challenge Exhibit was set up at the London         Science Museum and a web-streaming lecture by Pericleous on Modelling           the Melting and         Casting of           TiAl Turbine Blades was recorded by ESA.
&gt;This activity demonstrates (1)economic impact           for the companies mentioned, (2)Impact on             the environment with the production of lightweight           aerospace materials and low cost catalysts,         (3) Impact on society through public           engagement in a museum exhibit and a web lecture           informing the products of research.
Our multi-physics codes (PHYSICA, SPHINX) have been used         elsewhere: by Qinetiq for EM-         induction-assisted titanium forging; by ArcelorMittal (France),         licensed (2009) to improve         understanding of the continuous casting of steel plate (work that won         the Association Technique           de la Siderurgie award3), and to improve         efficiency of the Basic Oxygen Converter (2012); by           Corus (NL) for a novel levitation melting and evaporation process         of zinc in steel plate coating -         a process successfully sold to Pohang Steel in Korea (2009); by           Corus (UK), Wiggins Special           Metals and Rolls-Royce to understand defect formation in Vacuum         Arc Remelting for aerospace         quality steel and titanium ingots [3c] (2010).
&gt;This activity demonstrates economic impact           for Corus (development of novel coating           process) and ArcelorMittal (better understanding and optimisation of           steel production).
Primary aluminium production: our shallow-layer code MHD-VALDIS         (&#163;120k licence sales         2008-2013) computes MHD stability in aluminium production smelters,         helping organisations         worldwide with the design and optimisation of the latest production         cells: Rusal4(Russia), Dubal         (Dubai), Norsk Hydro (Norway), Wireless Technologies5         (US), GAMI and SAMI, China.
The         latter two (allied to Chinalco), compete for the           largest cells in the world at 500kA (2013).
Close         liaison with aluminium smelter designers reduces electricity use and CO2         emissions in this         energy-intensive process.
&gt;This activity demonstrates (1)economic impact           to Greenwich Enterprise Ltd, Wireless           Technologies and aluminium plant operators (2)Impact on the             environment due to reduction in           carbon usage and energy requirement in large aluminium production           plants.
Microgravity: models require accurate material properties.
Our         ability to model in detail the         dynamic interaction of externally imposed electromagnetic fields and         levitated metals attracted         the thermophysical property measurement community for high temperature         melts, under         terrestrial or microgravity conditions.
This led to collaborations with         ESA, NPL (UK), DLR         (Germany), SIMAP6 (France) and ASTRIUM7         (Germany).
We are currently the only UK         institution taking part in the European Space Agency ELIPS-3 [3h]         materials programme         (projects PARSEC, Thermolab-ISS, SOL-EML) in the company of NASA, JAXA         (Japan) and         DLR         (Germany).
As an outcome, Prof Pericleous was invited to make a case for         UK funding of         materials space research, to joint UK Space Agency/EPSRC meetings (July         15 and Nov 7         20128).
This successful appeal led to a           ministerial decision to make UK funding available for           ELIPS-4 projects.
&gt;This activity demonstrates impact on policy.
Titanium powder: TSB activity (project COLDMELT [3e]) in         collaboration with PSI9, gives UK a           lead in the production of titanium powder for aerospace components.
Dual frequency         electromagnetic fields are used to produce clean, inclusion-free         melt-stream for gas         atomization, using a contactless nozzle and a novel high-capacity         holding crucible.
The furnace         is still being assembled, but components of the design are already         exported to overseas         installations.
&gt;This activity demonstrates (1)economic impact for           PSI ltd in the production of a strategic           aerospace/defence material, income and employment generation 		          MMNCs: the production of light alloy         Metal-Matrix-Nano-Composites is seen as a way to reduce           the weight of transport and aerospace structures.
External fields         (acoustic, magnetic) assisting         the distribution of micro/nano particles, form the theme of FP7 EXOMET         [3g] that employs our         models.
Participating industrials include Volvo, EADS, Fiat, AVIO and         ALD.
A European patent           application has been submitted jointly with ALD and ESA1         to protect a novel contactless EM         vibration coil designed by us, for particle de-agglomeration and         dendrite fragmentation in liquid         metals during solidification.
