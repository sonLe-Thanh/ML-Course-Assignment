     The Raising Norse Spirits project is part of the CNS ethos of community       engagement and       Knowledge Exchange and represents an innovative collaboration between a       university cultural       studies research centre and a commercial business.
Highland Park       distillers had originally       considered the name "Valhalla Collection" for a new collection of       whiskies, but had not really       explored how to direct this idea or which gods, characters or symbols to       use.
While they had       gathered some basic information, it soon became clear to them that they       required considerably       more.
In view of this, the company sought to engage with the CNS to       provide research-based       advice and guidance with respect to their plans.
This initial engagement       has flourished       subsequently into a strong partnership.
In our initial role, we were able       to confirm that much of the       information originally secured by the company was actually inaccurate.
We       went on to provide       guidance on the choice of relevant figures, e.g.
starting with "Thor", who       was more generally       worshipped in settlement areas like Orkney and had a more drink specific       back story, than "Odin",       the king of the Norse gods, who was seen as an altogether more remote and       ambiguous figure.
"Freya" was also chosen to reflect the particular importance the Norse       gave to their womenfolk.
However, the underpinning research into the mythology of the Norse Gods       and their surrounding       stories and legend went significantly beyond the issue of selecting       suitable candidates for the       special collections and extended to the point where the Centre was able to       advise Highland Park       distillers on the colour and character of the whiskies that should be       produced.
Hence "Thor" is an       earthy, robust, very vivid whisky in keeping with Thor's status as son of       Earth and uncomplicated       hero of the Aesir whereas "Loki" is darker and more complex in character       as befits the archetypal       Norse mischief maker.
The whiskies that are being produced for the final 2       Gods in the current       series are being similarly designed and promoted, under the advice of the       Centre.
There has also       been close working with respect to the design, presentation and packaging       of the bottles, and the       motifs embossed on them, which have once again been specially created to       reflect the true       character and symbols of the Gods the whiskies represent.
The team therefore acted as research advisors for brand development,       product packaging design,       labelling, packaging and the website, for which the team have provided       content and games &#8212; engaging       customers not only in the product but the heritage of the Scottish island       on which it is       made, and giving Orkney's Nordic heritage an international reach.
The success of the range has been so great that the company is continuing       its engagement with       the Centre in an even closer relationship, and there is exploration       underway of options for new       whiskies using other characters and symbols from Norse mythology and life,       derived from the       Centre's research.
The product has attracted a high degree of global interest and "Thor" won       an IWSC Gold Award in       2012.
Gerry O'Donnell, Public Affairs Director for the Edrington Group,       which owns Highland Park       Distillery, noted in a letter of commendation to CNS that "The       international development of Scotch       whisky has been built on the success of distinctive brands.
Highland       Park's Valhalla collection       recognises the need to stand out from the crowd by creating an exciting,       premium initiative that       adds value to the brand".
The project further aimed to disseminate cultural knowledge and       understanding of the Viking       period through the marketing material available on the Highland Park       Valhalla website.The project       also aimed to improve cultural knowledge within Highland Park Distillery's       marketing team by       offering CPD opportunities for the guiding team in particular.
The project has achieved 3 key impacts so far:            The launch in 2012 of a limited edition (23000 bottles priced IRO         &#163;120) of the first Valhalla         whisky "Thor" with annual launches planned for the next three whiskies         in the range.
The         second, "Loki", (21,000 bottles) was launched in spring 2013 and the         third, "Freya" (19,000         bottles) will be launched in 2014.All bottles of "Thor" and "Loki" have         now been sold.
An enhancement of the role of cultural heritage research in the         development of cultural         heritage businesses, products and services.
The information provided by         the CNS was         absolutely fundamental in the development of the products in the         following ways:          a) The nature of the whisky itself was determined by the information we       were able to provide       re the antecedents, nature, defining features, and habits of the       particular god selected from       a short list of 20 profiles.
b) The packaging was also based on our information &#8212; Thor is the guardian       of ships and the       most popular god for sailors so the whisky was presented in a specially       crafted longboat       container made of oak.
c) The target area for "Thor" was identified by us using our knowledge of       Viking diaspora.
This       opened up new marketing areas to target such as Russia, which was founded       by the       Norse.
d) The background information has also been used to create concomitant       products such as       drinking glasses and to provide the information and character profiles       required by the       customers, including the supernatural aspects of the featured gods.
The development of knowledge exchange mechanisms to allow Highland         Park personnel at a         number of levels to access the information we have provided.
We will be         adding a knowledge         quiz and Did You Know?
Sections to the Valhalla whisky website and will         be accessing         metadata from this.
A system for metadata collection is in operation on         the site already, which         notes 30,000 hits so far..          "Thor" was chosen as the first launch to coincide with the launch of the       Hollywood blockbuster of       the same name.
The product was covered extensively in the press, receiving       excellent reviews, a       selection of which can be accessed below.
The team has recently been       approached by the       Edrington Group to undertake research to develop whisky products inspired       by "Mythic Beasts".
