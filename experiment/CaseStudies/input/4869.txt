     Surrey's research on the Archi dictionary and the lexical database of       SEN&#262;O&#358;EN were designed with specific community outcomes in mind.
The       positive effect on the language communities these projects have had will       contribute to the cultural enrichment through preservation of cultural       heritage.
Researchers at Surrey identified that the Archi community members would       benefit from a Cyrillic-based orthography rather than the standard       IPA-based orthography, and therefore produced a dictionary that would       better suit their needs.
This has had a major impact on the Archi       community, for the first time they have Archi written in a familiar       orthography: the languages of instruction at school are Avar and Russian,       both of which use Cyrillic.
They now have a dictionary where words for       culturally salient artefacts are supplied with pictures.
The dictionary       registers irregular word forms which are being ousted by regular forms,       and provides all the essential morphological information for each word,       such as grammatical gender, a feature that young urban speakers of Archi       have problems in mastering (their other main languages, Avar and Russian,       have the system of three genders, whereas Archi has four).
The result is the first trilingual digital dictionary of a Daghestanian       language, raising awareness of Archi both within Daghestan and throughout       the world (c, d, e).
At a local level, the orthography created has been       used by some speakers to write stories in Archi for the first time.
Similarly the project on SEN&#262;O&#358;EN makes recordings available to a wider       audience.
We provide transcriptions of recorded dialogues and a       3000-sentence database with orthographic and phonemic transcriptions,       interlinear glossing and translations into English.
The database also       contains lists of verbs and verb roots linked to the sentences and is       tagged for grammatical features using standard linguistic terminology.
The       recordings and database provide members of the SEN&#262;O&#358;EN speech community       with the chance to read and listen to their ancestral language from the       mouths of fluent speakers, and provide linguists with the opportunity to       explore this typologically interesting language.
For speaker communities we can identify two specific kinds of impact:       community skills development and cultural enrichment.
For the broader       public our work has involved cultural enrichment by production of       materials for schools, and through wider dissemination to non-specialist       audiences.
Community skills development            The community uses the new practical orthography developed for Archi         by the SMG and its collaborators.
This was achieved as part of a         community event in June 2007, when the school and key members of the         community were presented with copies of the dictionary.
Influential members of the Archi community have learnt how to use both         basic software and the specialized Sound Forge software, for editing         audio files.
The lexical database for SEN&#262;O&#358;EN resulted from a project which ran         during 2011.
It was presented to community members on Vancouver Island         in November 2011 and was well received with positive feedback in         relation to language revitalization (a).
Community cultural enrichment            Our work on Archi has raised the esteem felt by the speakers,         reinforcing their enthusiasm for their language (c).
Work on North West Solomonic was particularly welcomed by the local         community, as demonstrated by the letter from the Rorovana Joint Council         of Chiefs (b).
Public cultural enrichment     Complementing this work abroad we have promoted the understanding of       typology in the UK education system, by producing materials on the topic       for schools (see http://lagb-education.org/lagb-education-sessions ).
Several years of theoretical work provided the essential base for our       field research on endangered languages, including Archi, North-West       Solomonic and SEN&#262;O&#358;EN, complemented by a sustained relationship with the       communities.
Speaker communities have benefited by improvements to community skills       development and cultural enrichment.
Complementing this community work,       the University of Surrey has promoted the understanding of typology in the       UK education system, by producing materials on the topic for schools.
