     The aim of the Ibarra Real project was to revive a traditional prestige       Spanish font within a modern context and so to promote Iberian cultural       distinctiveness in the face of the increasing global dominance of English       language and culture.
Because of his record of research in the publishing       industry of the Spanish Enlightenment, S&#225;nchez Espinosa was engaged to       investigate and elucidate the historical context in which the Ibarra Real       font was first created and used.
The aim of this contextualisation was to       provide the historical, political and social rationale to support the       reintroduction of the font as an emblem of Spanish distinctiveness and to       validate the claim of the typeface to be truly representative of Spanish       culture.
By locating the original font within the political and cultural       environment of the period, S&#225;nchez Espinosa was able to create a robust       link between the new typeface and a period of high ambition and cultural       vision in Spanish history.
The font's cultural significance was conveyed to its intended users,       namely, publishers, typographers and the general public, through public       exhibitions and a companion book describing the history and use of the       typeface; these two elements also generated considerable publicity for the       project and attracted press attention, including trade journals, to       highlight the reintroduction of the font.
S&#225;nchez Espinosa played a key       role in the development and realisation of both the exhibition and the       book.
He was primarily responsible for selection and cataloguing of the       Imprenta Real items and artefacts that appeared in the exhibition and in       the book, and he contributed a major chapter to the book on the origins of       the font.
The particularity of the font was central to the agendas of the project's       funders.
The project supported Microsoft's ethical agenda which aims to       sustain linguistic and cultural diversity in national and regional       languages through localisation of its products.
The Marketing and       Operations director of Microsoft Spain, Enrique Fern&#225;ndez-Laguilhoat,       remarked at the launch of the project that it underlines Microsoft's       `strong commitment to the respect of the cultural identities' of the       countries in which it operates (http://tinyurl.com/bn2sw9m).
The Spanish Ministry of Industry and the Spanish International Cooperation       and Development Agency were also among the funders for the project; they       were also concerned with supporting and developing a       distinctive Spanish design industry in which Espinosa's contextualisation       was central.
The success of the cultural identity agenda has been remarked       upon by several commentators.
The prominent designer Enric Satu&#233; describes       the inclusion of the font in Microsoft's catalogue as 'without a doubt,       the best indication so far of Spanish participation in the international       graphic design scene' (Arte en la tipograf&#237;a: 25), and Cocoliso,       writing on the graphic design blog, Unos tipos duros, remarks on       the luxury of being able `to use a font which is truly Spanish'       (17.8.2010).
The graphic designer J.-M. Ribagorda observes that the       project's exhibition `connects design with culture and technology through       the enhancement of national heritage [and] the pursuit of formal identity       of the Spanish language' and acknowledges that it is `the Royal Spanish       Press, its historical contribution in the past, and its future       contribution' to the world of graphic design that binds the whole       narrative together (Unos tipos duros, 1 December 2009).
Ibarra Real has been included in the Microsoft font catalogue since March       2010, and its software can be downloaded for free for Windows, Apple Mac       and Linux.
Figures for Microsoft downloads are commercially sensitive and       have not been released, but the fact that some 4000 sites worldwide offer       it for download provides an indication of its reach.
In addition to the downloadable version, the font was intended from the       start to be rolled out as a classic font to print media.
Spanish and Latin       American book and graphic designers are already using the Ibarra Real       typefaces in a significant variety of genres.
For example, it has been       used in institutional publications such as the book for the Prince Felipe       of Spain's 2009 Prize for Management Excellence, Premios Principe         Felipe a la excelencia empresarial (2009), see http://tinyurl.com/cta7sct;       in academic publications such as K. Gregor and A.-L. Pujante, Macbeth         en Espa&#241;a. Las versiones neocl&#225;sicas (Murcia: Murcia University       Press, 2011); in creative and artistic publications such as the Chilean       Vicente Reyes's La isla (2011) and the recent bibliophile edition       of Sor Juana In&#233;s de la Cruz, Primero sue&#241;o (Valladolid: Gato       Gris, 2012).
It has been adopted by the main Spanish/Hispanic publishing       house, Editorial Planeta, for some of the annotated Renaissance classics       belonging to its series Espasa Cl&#225;sicos (for example, the recent       editions of Amad&#237;s de Gaula and Orlando Furioso), and for       their special editions, like the 3 volume Cortes y Constituci&#243;n de         C&#225;diz.
200 a&#241;os (2012), an academic collective work commemorating       the first Spanish constitution.
The Ibarra Real typeface and font have       also been used in the graphic image and text displays of other recent       exhibitions of historical artefacts, such as Corona y Arqueolog&#237;a en         el Siglo de las Luces (Royal Palace, Madrid, 15 April-11 July 2010).

The project's exhibition, Imprenta Real, fuentes de la tipograf&#237;a         espa&#241;ola, was shown at two major venues in Spain and Mexico with a       total recorded footfall specifically for this exhibition of 45,000,       namely:            The Royal Academy of Arts, Madrid (December 2009-February 2010): 9266         visitors.
Museo Regional de Guadalajara, Mexico (November-December 2010): 35222         visitors.
The exhibition in Guadalajara attracted large numbers of bibliophiles and       booksellers as it was timed to coincide with the International Book Fair       held in the city.
The Ibarra Real project has inspired similar projects, such as the 2010 Exp&#243;sitos,         La tipograf&#237;a en Buenos Aires, 1780-1824.
This project aimed to       reconstruct the typeface used in the Real Imprenta de Ni&#241;os Exp&#243;sitos, the       first printing house in Buenos Aires during the last years of the Spanish       colony.
A free downloadable book has been produced that contextualizes the       birth of this printing house, its political significance in relation to an       increasing Argentinean identity, its material production, and the steps       taken in the reconstruction of the font (see http://tinyurl.com/d2fsvkz).
