     The impact of Professor Stewart's research, finding solutions for the       problems preventing the       commercial use of high-gravity brewing systems (please see section 2       above), and the resulting       cost savings in the brewing and distilling industry are enormous.
To quote       a former Director of       Brewing Operations of a US regional brewery and Past President of the       Master Brewers of the       Americas[S1],     "The benefit of high-gravity brewing is something I've come to appreciate       throughout my brewing       career, and Professor Stewart clearly served as an authority and as an       elucidator into underpinning       effects of high-gravity brewing on yeast and in finished beer.
What we all take for granted today is that high-gravity brewing has       offered the most significant       efficiency and productivity gain for any brewery in the world.
It's been       the most important means to       increase plant capacity that brewing has ever experienced."
This same source [S1] has estimated the strength of US worts increased       from 15oP in 1993 to       20oP in 2008 and 21oP in 2013.
In his regional       brewery the starting wort strength of their flagship       brand went from 10.8oP in 1997 to 12.4oP in 2008 to       13.2oP in 2011[S1].
A second source has       supplied worldwide estimates for starting wort strengths of 14oP       in 1993 increasing to 17oP in 2008       reaching 18oP in 2013 [S2].
This increase and the resulting economic impact made possible by the       contribution of Professor       Stewart's research are difficult to measure.
However, one source [S3] has       indicated that a 50%       expansion of an 11.4 million hL/yr&#167;&#167;&#167; brewery built in 2007 in       the US would cost approximately 50       million US Dollars.
If one assumes this brewery made an       increase of 5% in wort gravity (and       assumes a linear interpolation of the above quoted expansion costs) the       savings of using HG-wort       to forgo capital expansion would be 5 million USD or 0.438 USD/hL.
In the US, the volume of beer       sold in 2011 was 225 million hL [S4].
If all US breweries increased the       wort strength by 5% this       would translate to capital savings of 98.6 x 106 USD or &#163;65       million.
It is notable that this cost       estimate is based on US beer production alone.
The world beer       market was 1,925 million hL 2011!
[S4]     Aside from direct savings in forgoing capital expansion by the use of       HG-wort, additional and       substantial savings result by the enhancement of sustainability in energy,       effluent, cleaning costs,       production flexibility and overall beer quality and stability.
These       savings are substantial but difficult       to quantify.
However, the savings in cleaning chemical costs alone       by the use of HG-wort       (therefore reducing vessels usage) has been estimated to range from 0.25       to 1.00 USD/hL produced [S5].
In addition, the world alcohol industry, totalling 825 million hL in 2012       [S6] has benefited from       Prof. Stewart's research into minimizing yeast stress (Cunningham and       Stewart, 2000) allowing       increased efficiencies in the ethanol fermentation process when HG       substrates are used.
The       resulting higher (fermenter) ethanol levels in turn, reduce the energy       required for distillation.
For       example, the starting wort densities of a major Scottish grain whisky       producer have increased 13%       from 1993 to 2008 and 1.9% from 2008 to 2013.
In the case of malt whisky,       starting wort values       have increased 3.5% from 1993 to 2008 and 1.7% in 2013 from 1993 values       [S7].
The Scotch whisky industry alone produced 3.48 x 106 hL (on a       pure ethanol basis) in the year       ending October 2012 [S8].
These increases and subsequent capacity savings       are not as dramatic       as in the brewing sector but still contribute very substantially to       companies bottom-line by reducing       energy expenditures in the distillation process.
Therefore, by even the most conservative of estimates, the research         undertaken a Heriot-Watt         University from 1993 to 2008 has resulted in worldwide savings of &#163;555         million&#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; in capital cost         savings of the brewing industries alone during 2008-2013.
&#167;&#167;&#167; hL = hectolitre (100 Litres).
&#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 1.925x10^9 hL* 0.438 USD/hL x 0.66 &#163;/USD.
