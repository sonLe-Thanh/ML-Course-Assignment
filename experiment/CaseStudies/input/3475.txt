     Active psychosis can lead to significant personal trauma and       socioeconomic costs that are exacerbated by repeated relapses, and is       ranked as the third most disabling condition worldwide after quadriplegia       and dementia.
Professor Gumley's work has had local and national impact on       psychosis treatment by supporting UK and Scottish government-backed       strategies to improve access to psychological therapies, and the       development and expansion of early intervention services in Scotland.
Psychological Therapies for psychosis     CBT is recommended by NICE guidelines for schizophrenia     Gumley's 2003 study on CBT1 was one of several randomised       controlled trials cited as evidence in the National Institute for Health       and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2009 clinical guidelines (CG82) for       schizophrenia.a The evidence formed part of a meta-analysis of       the value of CBT, based on which NICE recommended that CBT should be       offered to all people with psychosis, as this treatment reduces the rate       of hospitalisation.
The study was one of five trials used in the NICE       economic analysis, which concluded that CBT intervention for psychosis       saves &#163;989 (&#163;751 conservatively) per patient receiving 16 week       hospitalisation compared with standard care.a     This recommendation led to the NICE evidence being used to drive UK       government policy and support ministerial commitment to a 4 year plan       (`Talking therapies') launched in 2011 alongside the mental health       strategy `No health without mental health'.b,c The plan       committed the National Health Service to expanding access to       evidence-based psychology therapies for people with psychological       conditions, and in September 2011, an existing scheme (Increasing Access       to Psychological Therapies) was expanded to include `Serious Mental       Illness' (IAPT SMI).
"Since Professor Gumley's research forms a         significant part of the `evidence', his study has been scrutinized to         ensure the effective components are rolled out nationally."
&#8212;       (National Advisor to IAPT-SMI).b The IAPT-SMI programme ensures       that the NICE guidelines are implemented across England, to allow all       patients eligible for CBT to have access to this intervention.c     Development of a competence framework for psychological therapies     To meet the requirements of wider access, IATP-SMI commissioned a project       (co-ordinated by University College London, UCL) to determine what       competencies are required by therapists to deliver CBT and to develop a       competence framework for clinicians and commissioners of mental health       services.
UCL invited Gumley to become a member of the Expert Reference       Group (ERG) that oversaw the development of CBT competencies, due to his       clinical and research experience in developing and researching CBT.d,e     Gumley advised on developing a basic structure for the competence       framework.
Together with the ERG, he helped to identify the core and       specific competencies and training needed for therapists and services to       deliver CBT.
These competencies were extracted from evidence-based       interventions and treatment manuals, which included Gumley's research on       CBT that also underpinned his treatment manual for therapists (`Staying       Well After Psychosis', 2006),7 which sold 821 copiesf       between1st May 2008 and 31st July 2013.
The IAPT-SMI psychosis initiative has been implemented at two NHS       Foundation Trust demonstration sites (Lancashire Care and South London and       Maudsley) since November 2012.g      Widening access to psychological therapies in Scotland     The Scottish equivalent of IAPT is `Widening Access to Psychological       Therapies', the basis of which is a guidance document called `The         Matrix: A guide to delivering evidence-based Psychological Therapies in         Scotland', which is published jointly by the Scottish Government and       NHS Education for Scotland (NES).h In 2008 and 2011, Gumley       contributed to the schizophrenia section of The Matrix,       synthesizing the most up-to-date evidence on schizophrenia treatment,       including his own research on CBT for relapse prevention.
This information       now underpins the current drive to improve access to CBT, as implemented       through NES.
The Matrix is a cornerstone of the psychological       therapies implementation strategy at Scottish government level and is used       extensively in service planning and as a benchmark for the delivery of       evidence-based care.j     Operationalising psychological therapies in early intervention           services for psychosis     The Glasgow ESTEEM early intervention service     ESTEEM aims to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis, improve       patient recovery and prevent relapse.
It provides a multidisciplinary       approach to treatment, tailored to each of the 489 16-35 year olds seen       each year who have experienced a first episode of psychosis.
Gumley has       advised ESTEEM since its inception in 2002.
His research has both drawn       upon the service and led to changes in practice at the service: `The         impact of the research has been to enshrine the value of collecting and         exploring clinical outcomes as part of the service framework...and has         helped to operationalize [sic] complex, theoretically driven         interventions in such a way that has clinical utility for an NHS mental         health service' &#8212; ESTEEM lead.i     Gumley's research demonstrated the importance of facilitating emotional       support following a first episode of psychosis; this informed the       development of the ESTEEM service, which since 2010 has placed attachment       and emotional recovery at the heart of the service model.
Although not all       patients receive CBTp (as not all patients need it), each patient has a       care plan that takes into account his or her attachment relationships, and       thus the patient's ability to engage with therapy.j Since 2008,       Gumley has trained all 65 healthcare staff within ESTEEM in attachment       theory and its use for developing individually tailored strategies for       emotional and relationship-based adaptation to psychosis.
In 2012, Gumley presented the results of an evaluation of the outcomes of       the ESTEEM service, from a study conducted by Gumley and funded by the       Chief Scientist Office8, to the NHS GC&amp;C health board.
The       report clearly showed the value of a dedicated service over a       community-level service.
The findings `proved to be enormously valuable         during service review and subsequently contributed to the decision to         expand the service across the whole GG&amp;C [Greater Glasgow &amp;         Clyde] area.
It also sets the standard for other services to consider         and demonstrate effective outcomes.'
&#8212; ESTEEM lead.j     Early intervention included within Scottish Government mental health         strategy     In response to Mental Health Strategy consultation documents circulated       by the Scottish Government in 2011, Gumley presented the ESTEEM evaluation8       to the Head of Mental Health in the Scottish Government.
The data led the       Scottish Government to commission an independent review by Information       Services Division Scotland, to corroborate these findings by performing a       Scotland-wide check of psychiatric admission figures for 18-24 year olds       by region, showing the lower admissions in Glasgow.k Gumley's       research on developing and demonstrating the efficacy of early       intervention services led directly to a policy commitment to include early       intervention delivery within the Scottish Government's Mental Health       Strategy for Scotland (2012-2015).l     `The research undertaken into the benefits of early intervention in         respect of first episode psychosis is the sole reason the commitment was         included within the strategy...we were persuaded by the data and         similarly were able to use the research to support a direct commitment,         focussed on the outcomes achieved for this client group.
We are         currently taking forward the commitment through data review which will         be the basis for further intervention and engagement with local boards.'
