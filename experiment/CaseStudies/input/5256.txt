     Cultural Life: In our `Framework for Impact' (see REF 3a)', we       identify the value of using a wide range of media types in order to extend       the impact of the department's research.
In this case study, publication,       feedback and reviews in the public sphere (particularly through the       national press) are significant areas of dissemination-leading-to-impact       for the enhancement of the cultural life of the wider community.
Readings and performance relate to our FI's strategy of accessing       a wide range of communications media.
These include live events and other       media such as radio and podcast.
Atkinson's ticket-selling readings with       audiences of 100-200 include Aldeburgh Poetry Festival (2008); The Times       Oxford Literary Festival (2009); StAnza Poetry Festival (2010); Desert       Nights Rising Stars Literary Conference USA (2011); Rosario International       Poetry Festival, Argentina (2012) [5.1]; Granada International Poetry       Festival, Nicaragua [5.2], The Hay Festival (2013).
In two instances       quantitative impact indicators are available in the form of viewing       figures: Cuirt International Festival of Literature, Ireland (2013) (167       views) [5.3] Whitworth Gallery Manchester (2011) (500+ views) [5.4].
Performances       include a range of events at Hay Festival; demonstrating a strategy of       targeting an important literary and cultural festival to enhance the       cultural life of an audience already interested in the arts [5.5 a-c].
Radio         appearances include Marggraf Turley's second appearance on BBC Radio       3's The Verb (9/2/2008); an extract from Francis's Mandeville       broadcast in Radio 3's Traveller's Tales (13 &amp; 16/1/1113) and       Barry for a documentary on sound poet Bob Cobbing (Radio 4, 20 &amp;       26/3/11) which was Time Out magazine's `Pick of the Week'       (17/3/11) [5.6], indicating a secondary impact level in terms of its       dissemination.
Reviews in the national press also demonstrate the       reach of the Contempo group's poetry and therefore their       impact-through-dissemination.
(e.g.
Atkinson, Observer, 2012;       Francis Observer, Guardian, Sunday Times, Sunday         Telegraph (2008 and 2013) [5.7 a and b]; Marggraf Turley, Western         Mail (2010) Prizes and nominations provide a clear       indication of esteem which do, of course, help to increase audience       awareness and reach.
Atkinson's Catulla was shortlisted for Wales       Book of the Year.
Marggraf Turley was voted 2010 Wales Book of the Year       `People's Choice' award winner for Wan Hu's Flying Chair.
[5.7c]       As a vote, this clearly is indicative of a quantitative impact.
Education: The educative role of the Contempo group's work is       evidenced in two main ways, firstly through the impact generated by       dissemination in public media and secondly through specific education       events such as writing schools.
Additionally, analytical writing from the       group has also generated educational impact by being readily accessible       and popularly read.
[see Barry, 3.2]     The Guardian's publication of Atkinson's poem       `Autobiography without pronouns' (8/4/2013) provides evidence for the       educational impact generated through dissemination.
The guided reading of       Atkinson's poem provided by Rumens on The Guardian website       generated 116 shares and 332 comments on The Guardian's Web forum       [5.8] and led to dialogues between readers responding to the guidance       offered by Rumens, as users developed the critical analysis for       themselves.
`Hic7ubique's' comment (08/4/13) `I'm stuck on ohms...
I can't       make any sense of...' answered by `Bysshe 22' and `irussell' on the same       day with possible explanations from scientific vocabulary and wider       reading gives a sense of the educative forum created here by the users.
`Parisa 1's' `Like.
Like much.
"everything in slow-mo"= super cool Poem       has lovely atmosphere &#8212; transports.
Refrain from using 'I' is difficult!'
(08/04/13) and `I tend to think that emotions (can) inform our lives - in       literature, music, movies, poetry etc.
When I read this poem, it doesn't       really make me go all emotional &#8212; cry or anything like this but it does       still move me' (09/04/13) generated a number of responses and discussion       around the issue of how the poem engaged with the emotions of the reader.
For example, `BillyMills' (09/04/13) answered, `Genuine question.
What do       you find moving about it &#8212; apart from the things that move?
Maybe she's on       her way to meet a new love and start a wild affair, prompted by the       seafront prophecies.'
Here the users are developing views on emotional       responses to art forms (eg poetry) and the impact this has on a life,       clearly indicating how the impact pathway from poetry that is informed by       a critical perspective on a poetics of the lived-in body, can result in       public discussion of emotion and the use of the first person.
The educational impact generated (out with the academy) through writing       schools such as Teifi Writers, Carmarthenshire, and Ty Newydd Writers'       Centre, Gwynedd, allow the Contempo group (Atkinson, Davies, Marggraf       Turley) to communicate their research-informed writing perspective to       writing workshops.
The organiser of Teifi Writers comments on the impact       of the input of the Contempo group in the following way: `we have the       benefit of the academic insight of the tutors who generously share with us       their knowledge of writers and literature, combined with their experiences       as writers who are part of the contemporary writing scene and who       themselves are constantly thinking about what to write and how to write       it.'
[5.9] And, testimonial evidence from a student now studying Creative       Writing at University following a Ty Newydd Writing school with Atkinson       demonstrates the ways that these non-university educative events can       impact on individuals' decisions to commit to further study.
