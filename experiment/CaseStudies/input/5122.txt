     KCL research showing that most people at the end of life want to be cared       for and die at home       has influenced healthcare professionals, funding bodies, policy makers and       the general public.
Such research has promoted the re-orientating of health and social care       services to be more       sensitive to users' needs, improving the quality of end of life care for       people in many countries.
This has included the targeting of certain underserved groups in society       to improve their access       to end-of-life care planning.
The adoption by governments of new       strategies and programmes,       as championed by KCL research, is now enabling more people to die in their       preferred place.
Changing awareness and strategy, leading to place of death as a core         policy measure:       Achieving home care and death, if preferred, in advanced illness has       become a core part of the       Department of Health's (DoH) End of Life Care Strategy.
In 2008, KCL       researchers were part of       a DoH advisory group that produced a report which cites the majority of       the above       references.
[9] Additionally, the National Audit Office used KCL research       to highlight the need       for home care.
[10] As a result, the DoH commissioned the development of       the End of Life Care       Intelligence Network (ELCIN) to "improve the collection and analysis of       information related to       the quality, volume and costs of care provided ... to adults approaching       the end of life".
[11a]       Among resources provided is a 2011 ELCIN-commissioned report authored by       KCL       researchers (and containing the above references) regarding local       preferences and place of       death in England.
The report concluded that "maximum impact is derived from focusing future       investment and       service developments in extending and improving care at home and in       hospices".
[11b] Place of       death has become a key measure reported in ELCIN locality and regional       profiles.
In their       Mapping Tool, they use the format developed in KCL studies, reporting       profiles for local       areas.
[11c]     Changing where people die and better meeting their preferences:       Over the past few years the NHS has developed a National End of Life Care       Programme to       implement the End of Life Care Strategy by "working with health and social       care staff,       providers, commissioners and third sector organisations across England to       improve end of life       care for adults".
[12] That adoption of end of life care strategies, as       championed by KCL       research, is changing where people die, as has been shown in recent KCL       analysis of place of       death.
These found that the trend of a reduction in home deaths is showing       a sustained       reversal, with increasing numbers of people dying in their place of choice       [12a], and a reduction       in hospital deaths.
[12b] The latter concluded that "the increase in home       and hospice deaths       suggests that the National End of Life Care Programme has enabled more       people to die at       their preferred place of death."
Shifting the focus of charities, patient-based organisations and         funding for care:       As well as government-based health services, several independent       organisations and patient-based       charities use KCL research on place of care and death.
The 2012 `Independent Palliative Care Funding Review', an independent         report for the         Secretary of State for Health, sought to develop a "per-patient funding         mechanism (for         palliative care)".
This report (which cites Gomes 2008 and Higginson         2009) was based on         work commissioned from KCL and its partners.
The KCL work was used to         project that by         2021 hospital deaths could be reduced by up to 60,000 a year, with a         reduction in         associated costs, while delivering "optimised provision of services         outside the hospital         setting".
[13a]       The King's Fund, an independent charity, cite Gomes 2008 in their 2011         report `Issues         facing commissioners of end-of-life care' when discussing how more         people dying at an         older age in 2030 will "undoubtedly have a significant impact on the         level and intensity of         provision that is necessary and will require change in the way that         services are         commissioned".
[13b]       The National Council for Palliative Care, an umbrella charity, cites         KCL research in their         reports including `Commissioning End of Life Care', `A 2030 Vision', and         `Policy         Roundup'.
[13c]          An independent report [14] into the effect of the KCL work, which       involves review of policy       documents and interviews with policy experts, shows how the research       galvanised action and       thinking as exemplified by this quote:            "For me one absolute tipping point was in 2011 when I was exposed           to the work on           preferences compared to actual place of death for particular groups in           England.
...
It was           readable and linked to the strategy (and) ... highlighted the           preferences of older people &#8212;           how they wanted to get into hospice but didn't get into hospice.
I was           struck by the disparity           between my beliefs and this data."
(6(p14, RP6)       The review concludes: "The early Cicely Saunders Institute [KCL]           research was one key           source of evidence that enabled key figures to embark on public debate           and discussion of           death and dying in a new way.
...
There is no doubt that the work of           the Institute was often           dominant in the use of evidence over preferences and that this often           drove the public           debate."
International reach:       KCL research and experts have also been used by international bodies for       help in their work.
Achieving place of care and death is recommended in the World Health       Organisation's 2011       publication `Palliative care for older people: Better practices' aimed at       European policy makers.
Professor Higginson was selected as Senior Editor on this report and it       contains the majority of       the KCL references detailed above when discussing this       recommendation.
[15a] In Portugal, the       Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (a major international charity) is       developing a programme of       home care support at the end of life in response to KCL work and evidence       on people's       preferences.
In 2011 the Foundation established a formal partnership with       the Portuguese       Ministry of Health to fund four pilot projects delivering home palliative       care.
[15b] In Australia,       Care Search, a palliative care knowledge network, cites Gomes 2008, when       listing "inadequate       family support and/or community-based palliative care services" as a       "limiting factor for patients       who wish to die at home".
[15c]     Public reach and Government reach:       Findings from KCL research received extensive press coverage, most       recently of the reversal       of trends in place of death, e.g.
The Huffington Post [16a] and the Daily       Mirror [16b], among       others.
Recently (8/11/12), the House of Lords debated `NHS: Death at       Home' and KCL       research was highlighted by both Lord Low of Dalston and Baroness Finlay       of Llandaff, to show       evidence of the persisting gap between preferences and reality for place       of death, and the       socially and culturally patterned disparities.
