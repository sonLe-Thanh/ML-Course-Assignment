     Dr Simon Gallimore FREng (now Chief of Global Aerothermal Technology and       Senior Fellow of       Thermofluids, Rolls-Royce plc, and Chairman of the Aerodynamics National       Technical Committee)       commented: "Research in Cambridge's Department of Engineering has made         a critical contribution         to the success of the several generations of the Trent aero engine.
The         groundbreaking work by         Nick Cumpsty and his team changed the way that compressor blades are now         designed in Rolls-         Royce.
The impact was first felt in 2002 and will continue to be felt as         future generations of         engines make use of the technology.
"[3]     The research established "sweep" and "dihedral" as the standard terms for       movements parallel to       the compressor aerofoil section chord line and movements normal to it.
More importantly it gave       designers a simple mental model for how "sweep" and "dihedral" affected       the aerodynamic of the       flow.
For the first time this made 3D design of compressors relatively       simple, which facilitated the       uptake of the technology by industry; in Gallimore's words, "the         research allowed industrial         designers, for the first time, to undertake 3D compressor design in a         time scale which was         acceptable within an engine programme.
"[3]     Before the research, compressor blades were designed and manufactured in       a number of 2D       sections and thus were not able to fully exploit the 3D shape of the blade       to improve performance.
The DoEng research made it practically possible to measure and model 3D       viscous flow in       multistage compressors in such a way that 3D designs could be evaluated       within timescales       suitable for industrial development.
The research gave Rolls-Royce this       understanding, proposed       a new shape for the blade and provided the tools for refining the design       further.
The knowledge was transferred to Rolls-Royce primarily through DoEng       academics working       closely with Rolls-Royce engineers, and through PhD students and staff       being employed by Rolls-       Royce after the fundamental underpinning research had been completed       (including Cumpsty, who       became Chief Technologist of Rolls-Royce in 2000).
The impact of the       research began before the       2002 paper was published, as the first compressor blades designed       according to the new       methodology were certified and flight-tested, entering service in the form       of the Trent 500 engine       earlier in that same year.
All subsequent generations of Rolls-Royce Trent       engines (Trent 900,       Trent 1000, Trent XWB) have also made use of 3D compressor blade design       technology.
The impact during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2013 can be       quantified in two main ways:       (a) in the fuel burn savings (and carbon emissions savings) achieved by       the engines in service       during that period; and (b) in the size and value of Rolls-Royce's order       book for the relevant       engines, for which fuel efficiency and emissions reduction are the key       selling points.
Fuel burn and carbon emissions savings.
According to Gallimore, "3D         blading achieved         combined efficiency gains for both high pressure and intermediate         pressure compressors of         approximately 1%.
This translates to an engine specific fuel consumption         [SFC] reduction of about         0.8%.
1% of specific fuel consumption reduction represents a fuel         burning saving of USD 240k per         aircraft per year and a reduction in CO2 emissions of 765 tonnes per         aircraft per year.
"[3] By the       end of the assessment period, 214 aircraft powered by 3D-bladed Trent       engines were in operation:            The Trent 500 powers all Airbus A340-500/600 aircraft; 130 in service         as at 31 July 2013.
[4]       The Trent 900 is one of the engine options for the Airbus A380; 56         Trent-powered aircraft in         service as at 31 July 2013 (China Southern Airlines 5, Lufthansa 10,         Malaysia Airlines 6,         Qantas 12, Singapore Airlines 19, and Thai Airways International 4).
[4]       The Trent 1000 is one of the two engine options for the Boeing 787         Dreamliner; 28 Trent-         powered aircraft in service as at 31 July 2013 (All Nippon Airways 20,         LAN Airlines 3 and LOT         Polish Airlines 5).
[5]          The annualised fuel burn savings from these aircraft in service at the       end of the period are       therefore estimated to be approximately USD 40 million (240*0.8*214), with       CO2 emission       reductions of approximately 130k tonnes (765*0.8*214).
123 of these       aircraft (104 A340s and 19       A380s) were in service throughout the assessment period;[6,7] on the       simplifying assumption that       the other 91 aircraft entered service linearly in each of the intervening       years, the fuel burn saving       achieved in the whole period can be estimated as approximately USD 145       million, and the       reduction in CO2 emissions as approximately 460k tonnes.
Rolls-Royce order book.
In a highly-competitive market focussed on       fuel efficiency, the levels of       improvement offered by breakthroughs such as Cumpsty's represent a key       competitive advantage;       the gain offered by this technology equates to almost one full       year's-worth of the industry's average       efficiency gains over time.
[8] In the citation for the award to Gallimore       of the Royal Academy of       Engineering's Silver Medal in 2006, his introduction of these techniques       is credited with enabling       Rolls-Royce to grow its wide body aircraft share from less than 20% to 50%       (figures quoted from       the reference to the award in section 3).
The benefits to Rolls-Royce's order book have continued during the       assessment period, and are       most clearly demonstrated in the case of the Trent XWB (which will power       all Airbus A350s as they       enter service from 2014 onwards).
Rolls-Royce markets the XWB as "the         world's most efficient         aero engine flying today... [with] the lowest carbon emissions         of any widebody engine".
[9] As at 31       July 2013, Rolls-Royce has an order book for the Trent XWB of more than       1400 engines.
[10]       Although the company does not publish the value of this order book, an       estimate can be made       using announcements on the value of specific orders.
For example, the       order for 25 aircraft from       Air Lease Corporation on 4 February 2013 cited a list-price order value of       USD 1.1 billion (GBP       714 million) for 50 engines.
[11] This suggests that the whole Trent XWB       order book, at list price, is       worth approximately GBP 20 billion.
If the order book for other 3D bladed       engines (88 Trent 900s,       450 Trent 1000s) [4,5] is valued at the same rate, the list-price value of       the order book for all such       engines rises to over GBP 27 billion, a very significant proportion of the       Rolls-Royce Civil       Aerospace Sector's total order book of GBP 56 billion.
[10] (If one takes       the alternative view that       orders placed between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013, rather than       outstanding order book at       the end of the period, should be considered, the figures are 36 Trent 500       engines, 128 Trent 900       engines, 270 Trent 1000 engines and 832 Trent XWB engines, with a       list-price value around GBP       18 billion).
[12]     Impacts beyond Rolls-Royce.
3D design and manufacture of       compressor blades is now       standard across the industry, with all major aero engine manufacturers       (Pratt &amp; Whitney and       General Electric) and land-based gas turbine manufacturers (Siemens,       General Electric and       Mitsubishi) using 3D design methodologies, and the language to describe       them, which are very       similar to that developed and published by DoEng and Rolls-Royce.
In       addition to its role in the       underpinning research, DoEng has continued to play a role in the       dissemination of the 3D design       methodology to the industrial community by means of the Cambridge       Turbomachinery Course, the       world's leading gas turbine course, which runs once every four years; in       2008 this attracted 92       delegates from 19 companies and government agencies from 11 countries, and       in 2012, 97       delegates from 20 companies and government agencies from 8 countries.
