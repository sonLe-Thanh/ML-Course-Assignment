     The research carried out by the LSHTM team as part of the Hib Initiative       directly contributed to a       large number of low- and middle-income countries deciding to introduce the       vaccine, reducing their       paediatric death and disease burden very significantly.
The research LSHTM did within the Hib Initiative allowed health       ministries in developing countries       to establish the disease burden of Hib and make evidence-based arguments       in favour of       introducing a suitable vaccine.
The resulting figures show the very       significant rise in Hib vaccine       take-up.
While in 2005, only 91 out of 193 WHO member states (47%) were       using Hib vaccine, this       number had risen to 163 out of 193 (84%) by 2010.5.1 The       greatest increase occurred in GAVI-       eligible countries, with an increase from 24 (33%) in 2007 to 71 (97%) out       of 73 countries by June       2013.
In India and Nigeria, Hib vaccine is used only regionally.
According to the 2013 WHO report on GAVI progress, 153m children were       vaccinated with Hib       through GAVI support during 2000-2012, which has prevented approximately       658,000 deaths.5.2       Deaths prevented in GAVI countries during the period 2008-2013 are       estimated as 509,000.5.2 In       2011, the GAVI Alliance committed to vaccinating a further 224m children       with Hib vaccine by       2015.
The example of Mozambique (which introduced the vaccine in 2009 following       a country-specific       study supported by the LSHTM team to aid decision-making) impressively       illustrates the impact of       Hib vaccine adoption on a country's death and disease burden in a rural       high-HIV epidemic area.
Among children under 1 and under 5, significant reductions occurred in       rates of invasive Hib       disease (91% and 85%, respectively) and very severe pneumonia (29% and       34%, respectively).5.3       Radiologically-confirmed pneumonia incidence fell by 33% in children under       2.
Another pertinent example is Bangladesh, which also introduced the Hib       vaccine in 2009, citing       advocacy by the Hib Initiative as a catalyst for action for its adoption.5.4       The measure is expected to       save 20,000 lives in Bangladesh per year.5.5     A number of other countries specifically studied by the LSHTM team to aid       decision-making also       introduced the Hib vaccine within the impact assessment period.
These       included Pakistan (2008),       Uzbekistan (2009) and Vietnam (2010).
Work in India is ongoing as the       country slowly moves       towards full implementation, with implementation strongly recommended by       local authorities.5.6     Apart from their direct research input into the Hib Initiative, the LSHTM       team also actively helped       promote awareness and understanding of their findings among       decision-makers at country and       international organisation level.
They actively sought to change country       policy,5.7 with Griffiths       presenting the findings at no fewer than nine high-level international       gatherings between 2008 and       2012.
These included, among others:            a meeting involving the Indian Ministry of Health and WHO in 2008,         which discussed proposed         plans for estimating the cost-effectiveness of Hib vaccine in India       a meeting with officials from the Belarus Ministry of Health in Minsk         in 2009, where Griffiths         again reported on cost-effectiveness       a presentation at WHO in Geneva in 2012, where Griffiths highlighted         that the vaccine has         been shown to be cost-effective for all countries, and is likely to be         cost-saving in Africa.5.8           Since 2008, other team members have been engaged in similar advocacy work       based on the       research.
Mulholland has spoken at 15 international meetings in major       plenaries as well as at       smaller regional and country meetings, and Edmond built a trusting       relationship with decision-       makers in Mongolia (2007-2010).
The GAVI Alliance calls the Hib Initiative a `success story', stating       that `By pooling the knowledge       and expertise of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,       LSHTM, and the CDC, the       Hib Initiative used a combination of collecting and disseminating existing       data, research and       advocacy to help countries build a case for adopting the Hib vaccine.
'5.9       The Deputy Chief       Executive Officer of the GAVI Alliance has affirmed that `the success of       the Hib Initiative program       can be seen by the excellent uptake of Hib vaccine by GAVI eligible       countries during the relatively       short period of the project.
LSHTM played a major role in this project,       particularly in the areas of       gathering, synthesizing and generating the epidemiology and economic       evidence'.5.10
