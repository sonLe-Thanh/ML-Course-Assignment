     Gray's research projects have enabled a broad access to, and engagement       with, FFF Studies, which `cross over' boundaries of age, gender, class and       nationality.
Gray's consistent advocacy of FFF and their relevance to all       in society (rather than simply Disney fairytales for children) is evident       throughout each of the three main pathways to impact i.e.
events,       consultancy and collaboration, media engagement.
The main beneficiaries       are:            Public, not-for-profit and commercial arts/creative media         organisations       General public of various age, gender, class and nationality          Universal Pictures and the viewers of Snow White and the Huntsman       Gray's work was consulted by the Film Director Rupert Sanders, who then       appointed Gray as a Mythic and Folklore Advisor to the production of Snow         White and the Huntsman (2012) (which took an estimated $170M at Box       Office; IMDB).
In this role, Gray built upon his own research outcomes to       help the filmmakers ensure they presented a nuanced and sympathetic       interpretation of the source material, free from `Disney-esque'       inheritances (the darker/grimmer nature of the film was picked up by some       reviewers and commentators although this cannot be directly attributed to       Gray).
Specifically, Gray's impact can be identified in the naming of the       dwarves in the film, wherein the choice led directly from his       consultation.
They were related to Ogham, the ancient Celtic `Tree       Alphabet' in which letters are associated with certain trees and have a       symbolic value) these are names used in the film and identified by Gray's       original research and picked up by reviewers.
In terms of the viewer response, the University's research office       conducted an open online survey promoted through Twitter and relevant       online forums.
Out of 156 responses 86.8% indicated they were more likely       to read Grimm Fairy Tales after having seen Snow White and the         Huntsman, 81% believed films based on Fairy Tales encouraged people       to engage with the originals, and 50% of all respondents believed that the       Academic Advisor helped make the film better.
The Folklore Society, Association of Scottish Literary Studies,           South Downs Society       Promoting the generic crossover of FFF is crucial to enabling greater       access and engagement, as demonstrated by the joint conference hosted by       The Folklore Society and the SCFFF on `Folklore and Fantasy' (April 2012).
This built upon the annual event staged by the long-established Folklore       Society and doubled the number of speakers and attendees, the surplus       (&#163;1.2k) was covenanted to SCFFF to fund future public events; FLS       described the event as " a great success academically as well as         financially".
The Association of Scottish Literary Studies       (educational charity that aims to promote the study, teaching and writing       of Scottish literature) marked the first RLS Day on 13 November 2012 by       making available a free ebook of Stevenson's Fables with an       Introduction by Gray (hard copies were also distributed at the 2013 MLA       Convention in Boston).
Gray was an invited consultant on the Heritage       Lottery Funded `South Downs Songs Project'.
National Theatre, Royal Opera House, Pallant House Gallery and           Bishop Otter Gallery       Gray's position as a valuable academic commentator on the public       interpretation and reproduction of fairytales is further secured by       separate invitations from the Royal Opera House (ROH) and National Theatre       to contribute to their online commentary.
Gray was invited by the ROH to       write a piece on Massenet's fairytale opera Cendrillon (June 2011).
More       significantly perhaps, in July 2013 the Digital Content Producer at the       National Theatre invited Gray to appear in a short film alongside Phillip       Pullman `looking at the elements of a fairytale, its history and the       appeal of this type of storytelling' designed to coincide with the stage       adaptation of The Light Princess, based on George MacDonald's story.
Filming was in July, however broadcast and subsequent press attention       falls after 31/7/2013 and outside of the REF period.
In 2011 Gray was       instrumental in bringing the illustrations of Mervyn Peake to an       exhibition at Pallant House Gallery and the Otter gallery (attracting on       average 55,000 and 16,000 visitors a year respectively).
These exhibitions       coincided with the Peake conference held at the University in July 2011       which attracted 70 participants (including 45 from outside the University       as well as Sebastian Peake, Mervyn Peake's son and inheritor of the Peake       estate).
The exhibitions received positive reviews from The Argus       (purports to reach 48,212 readers daily), and was covered by BBC South       Today (estimated 600,000 viewers daily based on 2010 figures) (Gray gave       an interview and reading in this piece).
Impact on public understanding and awareness: National media coverage       Gray's public impact resonates with a growing public interest in FFF.
In       the first instance the media occasionally sought a soundbite from Gray.
Now he occupies a role as a significant public commentator on matters       relating to FFF and is increasingly someone to whom media writers and       producers (repeatedly) go to for an in-depth/academic perspective on a       whole range of FFF matters and projects and thus enriching the quality of       the piece and stimulating further response.
The SCFFF's JISC Mailing List,       website, Facebook and Twitter pages all facilitate engagement with the       general public.
Often the catalyst for engagement is an interview with       Gray in a newspaper or radio programme, e.g.
his interviews about folklore       on the Simon Mayo show (BBC Radio 2; 15.1M listeners per week in Dec 2012;       17th Dec 2012 and 15th Jan 2013) prompted an email       exchange with a practising fantasy author seeking advice, while his role       as Mythic and Folklore advisor to Universal Pictures `Snow White &amp;         the Huntsman' (see below) prompted an email correspondence with a       group of teenagers in Houston, Texas, about a project on `Cinema and Fairy       Tales' (there are other similar examples, with correspondents from Glasgow       to Sydney &#8212; see evidence base).
The interviews and media pieces themselves       constitute impact as they extend the range and quality of evidence typical       in public discussion about FFF: for example, Susie Mesure in her       Independent article reflected on an interview with Gray, writing, ".....         the scramble for grim entertainment reflects a growing desire for         escapism, drawing parallels between today's uncertain economic climate         and the period 200 years ago when the Grimms were writing."
Similarly, Gray's views were elicited to provide greater depth to an       article about `Bogeymen' (BBC online News Magazine, 24/12/12).
The       widening public interest is apparent in newspaper coverage such as the       globally syndicated Guardian piece on Gray's latest research, a       first fresh reading of Stevenson's manuscripts since the 1890s), which       restores the form that Stevenson had vainly demanded.
Progress on this       edition is regularly published online through the EdRLS blog which not       only informs scholars and the general public about       developments in RLS research, but also involves them through       online discussion responding to Gray's commentary on the Stevenson       manuscripts.
