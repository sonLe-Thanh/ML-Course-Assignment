     The strong track record of the MRI group in the development of gradient       coil technology for       magnetic resonance scanners led to the sponsorship by Magnex Scientific       (manufacturer of       magnets, gradient coils and shim coils for MRI) of a CASE studentship for       Poole under the       supervision of Bowtell.
Poole's Ph.D. project, which commenced in       2004, focused on the       development of insert gradient and shim coils for use in high-field MRI of       the human head.
The       IBEM approach was developed as part of this work, so as to allow the       design of coils wound on       surfaces that fit more closely to the head than the body-sized cylinders       used in most MRI systems.
From 2005-2006, Poole developed a versatile suite of algorithms and       subsequently an IBEM       software package for designing gradient and shim coils on       arbitrarily-shaped surfaces.
This software was demonstrated to our collaborators at Magnex Scientific       during regular project       meetings in 2006 (by this time, Magnex had been bought by Varian Inc.;       Varian were then bought       by Agilent in 2010 for $1.5bn; the manufacturing base has remained in       Yarnton, Oxfordshire       throughout the changes in ownership).
It rapidly become clear to Varian       that the IBEM software       offered much greater versatility than the coil design programmes that they       were then using.
The       facility to design and produce coils on gapped or split surfaces generated       particular interest.
To       demonstrate the potential of the IBEM software, Poole worked with Dan       Green (Varian) to       generate novel, gapped, designs of shielded gradient and shim coils for a       prototype hybrid       PET/MRI system.
These coils could not be designed using the software that       Varian were using at       that time.
Subsequently, Varian constructed these coils and supplied them       commercially to Adrian Carpenter       and colleagues at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre in Addenbrooke's       Hospital (2008), paying a       3% royalty to the University of Nottingham.
Bowtell and Poole       published a paper [2] jointly with       Carpenter's group and the Varian collaborators, describing the novel coil       designs and the first       experimental tests of their performance in the hybrid PET/MRI system.
Having seen the value of       the IBEM approach, Varian extended the agreement with the University of       Nottingham in 2007, and       this now allows them to use Poole's advanced design software, provided       that they pay a 3%       royalty on any coil sales arising from its use.
Since 2008, Varian, and       subsequently Agilent, have       used the software to design a number of coil systems, including short head       gradient coils for ultra-high       field imaging, and gapped systems for use in combined radiotherapy/MRI       systems.
Agilent's       Research and Development Manager for Gradient Coils [A] describes the       impact on their business:     "The ability of the software to account for complex gradient coil         geometries allows us to explore the         more challenging design aspects of bespoke and integrated systems, for         instance hybrid MRI/PET         and MRI applications in radiotherapy.
Agilent's entry into these new         markets has resulted in some         &#163;2.8 million in new system sales since 2009.
We also offer some unique         solutions to our customers         in the university research sector; often their challenging requirements         can only be met by the         flexibility of the IBEM software.
Sales for these upgrades are of the         order &#163;600k since 2009.
Exploitation of these new markets would not have been possible without         Nottingham's research         into complex gradient coil design."
In 2009, Bowtell established a new collaboration with Paramed       Medical Systems (Genova, Italy)       who sell `open' MRI scanners.
As described in Section 2, open MRI scanners       offer several       significant advantages over the conventional tubular design including:       better patient experience,       particularly for the paediatric, anxious or larger patient; weight bearing       and postural diagnostics in,       for instance, the upper neck (cervical) and lumbar spine cases (see       figure); the potential for real-time       monitoring of surgery.
The Paramed systems are based on permanent (0.15T)       and MgB2       superconducting (0.5T) magnet technology, offering a cheaper alternative       to whole body scanners.
A Paramed scanner (MROpen; see Figure) was recently installed in the `Upright       MRI Centre', a       private healthcare centre opened in Leeds in September 2012.
Scanners of this type use bi-planar gradient coils that are mounted on       the magnet pole pieces and       so are in close proximity to large amounts of highly permeable iron.
The       new collaboration, which       also involved researchers at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in       Genova, focused on adapting       the IBEM approach to take account of the nearby magnetic material when       designing coils, and was       driven by Paramed's need to incorporate active magnetic shielding of their       coils so as to improve       system performance.
Following Paramed's purchase of the IBEM software, it       was modified, in       collaboration with Bowtell and IIT researchers, and has       subsequently been used in a number of       development projects and products at Paramed, including their core product       lines, the MROpen       (see figure) and MRJ3300 (now known as MRInspire) scanners.
Paramed have       implemented new       design processes as a result of the IBEM software which affect their       complete product range (that       currently provides a turnover of &#8364;8M/year) and will support future       projected growth.
These details,       and the associated commercial advantages which result, are highlighted by       the Research and       Development Manager at Paramed [B]:     "The availability of the IBEM software, modified by IIT and Paramed         during and after collaboration         with Nottingham School of Physics and Astronomy (since 2009), helped us         to build a new design         tool for optimizing gradient coil performances in presence of iron,         which is an extremely important         advantage for MRI system design"     In summary, our numerical methods for the optimisation of gradient coils       have been adopted by       manufacturers of MRI equipment to enhance performance, functionality and       patient care, thus       generating impact in the economy and healthcare.
