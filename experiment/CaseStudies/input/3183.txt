     Our industrial collaborator PERI (now FLSmidth Inc) has worked in       collaboration with the Swansea team for many years on a range of problem       areas, although the main thrust has concerned heap leach modelling and       simulation of commercial operations in the USA, Peru, Chile and Australia.
The Swansea team focussed on the development and validation of the core       simulation tools to capture all the significant chemical and physical       behaviour: PERI provided expert knowledge on the physics and chemistry of       the processes.
PERI also led close working with our industrial partners to       capture the operational process data, use it as input to the process model       and then provide operational advice back to the clients.
These industrial       partners are all major international mining and minerals corporations and       include Freeport-McMoRan, Rio Tinto, Newmont Gold and Barrick Gold; all       are quoted on one of the London, New York or Australian stock exchanges.
Our conventional collaborative working practice with PERI have typically       involved:       a) The PERI industrial client/collaborator (IC) needing to develop a       design for or optimise an existing operation especially in the light of       changing conditions (e.g.
the properties of the ore body are evolving and       usually becoming more challenging);       b) The Swansea Team developing a validated simulation tool that then       embeds all the physical and chemical phenomena in the numerical model;       c) The IC bringing facilities for engineering design, experimentation and       testing;       d) PERI managed the client interaction, developing all the user       interaction supporting software, and provided high level expertise on the       chemistry and engineering of heap leaching processes;       e) Model validation proceeding as a joint effort amongst the IC, PERI and       the Swansea team;       f) Process analysis and optimisation initially as a joint effort, though       eventually PERI assume responsibility for the training of IC personnel in       using the simulation software so that they can embed the technology within       their own organisation.
Each of the main heap leach modelling projects indicated above (delivered       at Swansea) were carried out in close collaboration with PERI and its       primary clients (Rio Tinto, Freeport, Newmont Gold, Barrick, etc).
A       particular complexity of the heap leach process, from the modelling       perspective, was that the heap actually grows over time &#8212; it is       constructed from layers of crushed ore (typically 10m deep covering a       kilometre or more square), which are added every couple of months over an       extended period of years, and so sources of the liquid solution change       with time as do those of injected air (where used).
Moreover, over time       the initial properties of the ore body change as does the ambient climate.
Capturing this complexity is vital to the process as planning engineers       need to evaluate a range of potential heap development options in order to       optimise production rates and ore body recovery.
This means that not only       does the core model have to be able to account for this complexity, but       the ability to define this evolution in time has to be made accessible to       its users.
The PERI clients have extensive advanced laboratory facilities       for column based as well as small heap experiments to provide data to       parameterise and validate the computational model provided by the Swansea       Team.
The modelling work typically underwrote either the decision making       concerning the planning of future operations or the optimisation of       existing ones.
These industrial operations were multi-million$ ventures       where small improvements can make huge differences to the financial       outturns &#8212; for example, the principal metallurgist at FLSmidth Inc       (formerly PERI) responsible for heap leach modelling, states that the       engineered heap at Freeport-McMoRan which was designed using the advanced       simulation tools, `... demonstrated production yield improvements of         roughly 25% dynamic recovery.
Over a one-year period, an additional 25         million pounds of copper was produced from the Engineered Heap.
At an         average copper price of $2.34 per pound in 2009, this equates to         approximately $58 million dollars in additional revenue'.
The       independent evidence for this is recorded in J M Ekenes and C A Caro,       Improved leaching recovery of copper from low grade chalcopyrite ores, CD         Proceedings of the Annual SME Meeting, February 2012, Seattle, WA,       paper no 12-099, where the Freeport- MCMoRan engineers outline the       development of their Engineered Heap operational strategy which yielded       significantly improved recoveries on a full-scale industrial heap in       Arizona.
These economic impacts have been achieved since the late 2000s,       and this quote relates to just one industrial project.
