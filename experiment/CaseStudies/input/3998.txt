     Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a method of       communicating that       supplements the ordinary methods of speech and handwriting where these are       impaired.
There are       316,000 people who are known to need AAC support in the UK (around 0.05%       of the population)       but there is widespread inequity of provision.
Many people are missing out       on specialist provision       including the use of powered communication aids (source Shining a         Light on Augmentative and         Alternative Communication).
MMU research has raised awareness of AAC       nationally and       internationally and researchers have contributed significantly to       improving the evidence base,       increasing funding, and enhancing service provision.
Impacts on the improving the evidence base in the UK and         Internationally     MMU researcher Janice Murray was a key contributor to the Big Lottery       funded Communication-         Matters Research Matters [A, B] project which resulted in       the development of two products: the         AAC Knowledge website (http://www.aacknowledge.com)       and The AAC case study template         and database.
The AACKnowledge website went live in December 2012       and had generated 5000       unique hits (by July 2013).
The website was developed in response to       research that found that the       majority of those who work in the AAC field do not have access to       scientific evidence or an       academic knowledge base.
The website was developed through comprehensive       end-user       engagement with researchers, practitioners, parents and families and       commissioners and therefore       had impact embedded into the project from its outset.
ISAAC (The       International Society for       Augmentative and Alternative Communication) has officially recognised the       website and promoted       it internationally across its network of 50 countries.
As a result, MMU       researcher Murray is now       Chair-elect of ISAAC's governing body (Chair from 2014-16) and helped them       in turn to gain       recognition within the UN as a specialist organisation awarded       consultative status in complex       communication needs and AAC.
As the Chair of Communication Matters says, "The         AAC         knowledge website is an innovative and ground breaking tool.
This was a         particularly timely piece         of work in the light of changing political policy with regard to how AAC         services will be delivered in         the future.
The importance of this work has been acknowledged by the         international network         (ISAAC) who has agreed the release of peer reviewed article submissions         to be uploaded to the         site" [C].
As further acknowledgement of MMU's role in widening understanding and       access to AAC       research, Murray was invited to chair an independent AAC research panel to       advise on national       AAC research imperatives.
MMU has been entrusted with maintaining the       content on       www.aacknowledge.com for the       near future, recruiting a Research Associate, under Murray's       supervision to manage this task.
Impact is being developed through the uptake of an AAC case study       template and database that       was funded as part of the research.
The case study template provides an       open access resource so       that AAC professionals and practitioners can capture data and share       approaches to different AAC       challenges.
Since launching in May 2013, a bank of 35 case studies has       been established.
These case studies are considered to be the foundation of a world leading       resource in terms of       data access and content as the data can be explored by anyone that submits       an ethically approved       research proposal around AAC issues.
By August 2013 there had been 13       requests for information       and 3 fully approved applications to access the data for live projects and       109 "hits" on the freely       available case study template.
The template had been used a further 33       times generating 31       elements of unique data.
Although these numbers may seem small, this       really does amount to       significant progress in this research area.
As the Manager of ACE Centre,       a national AAC charity,       says: [D] "www.aacknowledge.com and the case study template         are essential now and for the         future in ensuring continued investment by the Government in AAC         services and provision.
These         resources are the start of a necessary process to systematically capture         a wide range of evidence         on the impact of AAC on people who need this equipment and services and         will be of significant         benefit to service providers, commissioners and ultimately children and         adults who need and use         AAC"     Communication Matters has its annual conference in September 2013 and is       due to re-publicise       these resources (typical attendance 400 delegates); it has also recently       publicised the resources       through its E-News which has a distribution list in excess of 3.5K.

MMU research has had a major impact on recognition for AAC amongst UK       policy makers leading       to a significant additional total Government investment of &#163;6.5M in AAC       funding and services.
In       2008 John Bercow, speaker of the House, published a "Review of services       for children and young       people (0-19 years) with speech, language and communication needs".
The       report led to the       appointment of a Communication Champion.
MMU researcher Murray worked       alongside the       Government-appointed Communication Champion to map services and provision       required for AAC       in England and Wales.
In March 2012, Murray led a joint delegation to a       House of Lords reception       that resulted in on-going discussions with politicians [E].
These       discussions led to &#163;2.5 million DfE       grants for AAC services in England and Wales.
In 2012, the Scottish Government launched "A Right to Speak: Supporting       Individuals who use       Augmentative and Alternative Communication".
Murray's advisory role to the       Scottish Government       informed the development of the report and ultimately resulted in the       creation of a &#163;4M pot for AAC       provision in Scotland.
