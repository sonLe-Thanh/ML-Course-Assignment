     Prior to this research, there had been no recognition that picking up       mice by the tail caused problems for the welfare of the animals or for       research in which animal stress is an important confounding factor.
On       publication, the key initial 2010 paper [1] generated considerable       interest.
It featured in Nature News [12], a NC3Rs press release       newsletter, a Wellcome Trust press release and was recommended by Faculty       1000.
It won the SGK sponsored NC3Rs prize, which is awarded to the lead       author for the best original contribution to scientific and technological       advances in 3Rs within the last two years [13].
Subsequent research on the       practicality of using handling tunnels and impact on reduction in animal       anxiety was featured in The American Scholar in August 2013 [14].
As a direct result of the research, a number of important guidelines have       already been changed.
Presentation of the findings at a Universities Federation for Animal         Welfare meeting in 2009 prior to publication, led to immediate reference         to the new findings in the 8th edition of the UFAW Handbook         on the Care and Management of Laboratory Animals, a definitive guide         across the EU [3].
Revision of the new Procedures with Care open-access web         resource (a joint venture between the Institute of Animal Technology and         NC3Rs) showing recommended practice for administration of substances to         laboratory animals [4,5].
Presentation at a joint RSPCA / UFAW meeting on animal welfare in 2010         attended by animal care personnel from industry and academia led to         changes to RSPCA recommendations for handling laboratory and pet mice         [6-8].
In addition to this, Professor Hurst is working with AstraZeneca [9] and       with Cancer Research UK [10] to investigate practical implementation of       the new handling methods in their animal facilities through collaborative       studies.
Professor Hurst has given talks to many additional audiences to promote       uptake, including:            CPD training session at AstraZeneca (2011) leading to further         collaborative research to investigate practical implementation in their         animal facilities.
CPD training course for the Swiss Laboratory Animal Science         Association, which runs courses on animal care issues (obligatory CPD         attendance for Swiss scientists using animals) in November 2011.
As a         result, officers of this association now teach the use of these handling         methods in training sessions for mouse handling [11].
Workshop at the Institute of Animal Technicians Congress, March 2012,         attended by technicians from industry and academia.
Training session and talk to animal care personnel at GSK in February         2012 (Stevenage and Ware, also recorded for transmission to their US         sites).
As a result, GSK purchased new handling tunnels to be trialled         across their sites from April 2012 to give further insight into the         impact of the new methods.
The GSK animal welfare officer (Joanna         Cruden) submitted a report of this training visit for publication in the         Laboratory Animal Science Association forum newsletter to encourage         wider uptake across the community       Training session to personnel at Novartis (Basel) in November 2012.
Talk at Tecniplast, a large cage manufacturing company in Varese,         Italy (June 2011).
Talk at a symposium organised by the Fondazione Guido Bernardini which         promotes 3Rs practices in Italy (June 2011).
Seminar at MRC Harwell, an international centre for mouse genetics and         home to the Mary Lyon Centre, one of the large mouse facilities in the         UK (February 2012).
Talks given at several meetings of the National Centre for 3Rs in the         UK, attended by biomedical researchers and animal care personnel in         industry and academia, representatives of animal welfare charities and         Home Office animal's inspectorate (April 2009, January 2011, June 2011,         July 2012).
The major beneficiaries of this work are:            all mice kept in research animal facilities and supply establishments         (improved animal welfare); over 3 million mice are used annually in Home         Office licensed procedures in UK alone and many more kept for unlicensed         work and breeding &#8212; globally this is many times greater;       all staff who have to handle laboratory mice (improved biosecurity,         practitioner utility and satisfaction);       the public concerned about the welfare and use of these animals,         influencing public support for the continued use of animals in         biomedical research (improved animal welfare and social approval of         necessary research);       scientists and those benefitting from the broad range of scientific         research and testing where stress caused by handling can causes a         confounding response in the animals, reducing the reliability of data         (improved data reliability for industry and academic research, providing         economic benefits and faster research progress);       charities and regulators promoting refinement and reduction in the use         of animals in research, or promoting better care for companion animals         (improved animal welfare);       pet mice and their owners, and veterinary surgeons involved in their         treatment (improved animal welfare, biosecurity and utility).
