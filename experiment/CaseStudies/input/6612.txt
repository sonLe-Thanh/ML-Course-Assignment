              The work has helped shape and extend the research agenda for Historic         Scotland and English              Heritage in terms of the following:                        How do traditional buildings perform?
There is now consistent research           and measurements concerning the heat loss of traditionally-built           (solid) walls [1],           which is addressing the lack of reliable data available to policy           makers planning for climate change impacts on the performance of           historic and traditional buildings.
What measures can be applied to improve energy efficiency without           detriment to the building fabric?
Research is in progress looking at           the performance and risk of different measures for insulating           traditional buildings [2,3].
For example, the Historic Scotland and Glasgow City Council Energy           Efficiency for Pre-1919 Historic Buildings Pilot Project is intended           to assess the robustness of a range of insulation solutions and the           risks of refurbishment due to moisture in traditional tenement           buildings.
In Glasgow this will have a significant impact on advice           given by the City Council to homeowners and social landlords.
How should assessments and measurements be carried out?
The work has           developed test methodologies adopted by other contactors for Historic           Scotland (see Case Studies 3,6 &amp; 7 http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/technicalconservation/conservationpublications/refurbcasestudies.htm).
The Historic Scotland &amp; English Heritage publications and         presentations of our research outcomes have acted as a catalyst for         others.
For example, the Society for the Protection of Ancient         Buildings, following advice from Dr Baker, has pursued a complementary         programme of investigations on thermal performance of different         vernacular constructions[4].GCU's         research along with others has increased interest in the refurbishment         of traditional buildings and has resulted in the formation of the         Sustainable Traditional Buildings Alliance (STBA) of which GCU is a         member.
One of the main issues to come out of the research is the         discrepancy between the heat loss of solid walls as measured in situ and         the standard calculated values, which tend to underestimate the thermal         performance of traditional walls and consequently the energy rating of         the building.
The consequence of this gap needs to be more widely         understood within retrofit processes.
The STBA has brought this to the         attention of the UK Government Department for Energy &amp; Climate         Change (DECC), since the energy rating of the building before upgrading         affects the financing of the energy efficiency measures which may be         implemented in the Green Deal (the UK Government's scheme for energy         saving in homes and businesses).
These concerns have resulted in DECC         re-evaluating its understanding of how the Green Deal should be         implemented in traditional buildings.
In 2012 it commissioned the STBA         to identify existing research and guidance that could (a) aid the         responsible design and decision-making process for the Green Deal in         older and traditional buildings and (b) identify gaps in knowledge where         further information and guidance could help optimise the delivery of the         Green Deal in these properties.
We contributed as experts to the STBA's         submission regarding heat loss estimates,moisture         risk analysis and internal wall insulation and STBA's research report         'Responsible Retrofit for Traditional Buildings'[1].
This has been developed into a software tool which will be launched         in2013.
Following the STBA submission, DECC is commissioning a major, long term         research programme on understanding the performance of solid wall         insulation (SWI) in the UK housing stock, in order to address the issue         of predicted energy savings based on physics-based models in the         domestic sector being greater than those seen in practice (https://online.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk/Common/View%20Notice.aspx?site=1000&amp;lang=en&amp;noticeid=758256&amp;fs=true).
The successful contract is worth &#163;1.5-2 million.
The mismatch between measured and calculated heat loss in some         traditional walls has now been addresses in software for U-value         calculations (BuildDesk http://builddesk.co.uk/software/),         which now enables mortar joints to be added to walls constructed from         stone.
The results of the calculations now give better convergence with         measured values - however the problem is often that the precise details         of a wall construction are unknown.The test methodology for carrying out         in situ thermal performance measurements (U-values) [5] is cited as         guidance for carrying out such measurements by the Technology Strategy         Board (TSB) for building performance evaluation studies in innovative         buildings: Richard Miller, TSB head of sustainability, said: "The         government has set the chal enging target of an 80% reduction in carbon         dioxide emissions in the UK by 2050.
With 45% of the UK's CO2 emissions         coming from buildings, we need to stimulate innovation towards achieving         these goals.
A key challenge is to ensure that building designs lead to         physical buildings that perform as intended."
