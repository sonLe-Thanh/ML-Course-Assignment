     The underlying research into the benefits of design for manufacturing       industry has been augmented by the action research components of the       provision of business support to SMEs in the West Midlands.
The work has       been funded through agencies charged with stimulating economic growth,       particularly the former regional development agency Advantage West       Midlands (AWM) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
Research       findings and lessons learned have been combined with the priorities of the       funding streams relating to supporting business growth to develop and       deliver projects that help companies to change processes as well as       developing new markets and products.
The region and project client base is extensive in terms of geographical       spread, array of products and services as well as a variety of markets.
The SMEs assisted include individual start-ups, designer-makers through to       larger manufacturers employing 150 people or more.
Sectors include a range       of consumer products such as: furniture, furnishings, textiles, carpets,       glass, ceramics, lighting, jewellery and silverware, fashion, clothing and       accessories, leather goods, giftware and artworks.
For all, design and       marketing were seen as key in adding value, as a counter to conventional       business wisdom which concentrated in price cutting for competitiveness.
Experience of these collaborations points to a progression of design       competencies.
This starts from zero innovators, where there is no use of       design and the company manufactures to customer designs through low and       medium innovators to high innovators where design is an integral part of       the company's strategy (Burns and Ingram, 2008).
The business support services developed through the projects to develop       the necessary competencies to move through this progression include:            websites of design information;       individual reports tailored to company needs and covering topics such         as marketing; competitor analysis; trends evaluation; and design         process;       exhibitions promoting the design credentials of the region;       workshops to help companies realise strengths and weaknesses and build         networks for growth; and       the creation and support of collaborative groups of companies.
The quantitative measures of impact include funding awarded over a         sustained period, businesses assisted and jobs and sales created.
For         example, Design Knowledge Network (total value &#163;2.6m over five years)         was part-funded by AWM and ERDF.
Between 2003 and 2008, the network         assisted over 70 companies through 180 business assists, generating         &#163;2.5m of sales and nearly 70 jobs.
[Ref 1, Ref 2]       In 2009 further funding totalling over &#163;3m from AWM and ERDF was         secured.
Building on previous achievements and experience, Interiors         &amp; Lifestyle Futures helped businesses in the West Midlands to find         new high-value markets and create profitable and collaborative         partnerships with other businesses.
To date Interiors &amp; Lifestyle         Futures has worked intensively with over 300 companies, created 21 new         businesses and built a network of over 400 companies.
[Ref 3, Ref 4, Ref         5]       As well as these hard measures of impact, the projects have also         achieved a significant number of softer outcomes where impact is         evidenced through a shift in business focus and behaviour.
Glassdomain has benefitted from a long-term strategic partnership with         BIAD.
Originally a glass and glazing business, the company took part in         a Knowledge Transfer Partnership from 2003 to 2006.
It used BIAD's         design expertise to diversify and form a breakaway company.
Further         support has included membership of Furniture West Midlands (a network         for the region's furniture companies facilitated by Kathryn Burns from         2003 to 2007) as well as support through the Interiors &amp; Lifestyle         Futures project.
Now Glassdomain's activities centre on a showroom         appropriate for its target market of architects and specifiers and it         has won a number of national design awards.
Projects include fitting out         of prestige locations for design-aware clients, including corporate         suites in Wembley Stadium, television companies and hotels.
(http://www.glassdomain.co.uk)         [Ref 6]       As well as help targeting individual businesses, Interiors &amp;         Lifestyle Futures has assisted clusters of companies.
Of particular note         is its work with many businesses within the region's glass industry.
This encompasses consultancy and practical assistance with collaborative         activities.
For example, in 2010, `Bring on the New' involved West         Midlands' glass artists working with other makers, both from the UK and         abroad, to create original pieces and learn from each other.
In 2012, Interiors &amp; Lifestyle Futures joined the selection         committee for `Back to the Future' exhibition where 23 glass artists and         makers created new work to celebrate the 400th anniversary of         the region's glass industry.
This attracted 7104 visitors and made sales         of &#163;4,900.
[Ref 7 and Ref 8]       Finally, many of the companies helped by Interiors &amp; Lifestyle         Futures took part in the week long 2012 Birmingham Made Me expo.
This         major exhibition and series of events celebrated Midlands design         innovation and manufacturing.
Interiors &amp; Lifestyle Futures         companies showcased their work in a dedicated space in the Mailbox, a         high-end Birmingham retail complex, which also houses the region's BBC         studios.
