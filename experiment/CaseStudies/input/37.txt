     Drug abuse in sport is a significant global problem.
Exogenous GH was       banned by the IOC as long       ago as 1989, but it has continued to be used because of the lack of a       reliable anti-doping test.
The       2012 WADA-approved test for exogenous GH is the culmination of many years       of multidisciplinary       work, in which statistical research conducted at Kent played an essential       role, and represents a       significant breakthrough in the fight against drug abuse in sport.
The       impact lies both in improving       the integrity of sport, for the benefit of the millions of people who       follow it, and in discouraging the       use of exogenous GH, thereby reducing the associated health risks for       sportspeople.
The difficulty of devising a sensitive test for exogenous GH       administration is evidenced by the       range of official bodies which have become involved with or have supported       the research, and by       the amount of conference time devoted to the topic.
One test (the       "isoform" test) for GH was       approved and has been in use since the Athens Olympics in 2004, but it has       had little success in       detecting dopers, and it is widely regarded as very easy to evade.
This       feature has motivated the       intense interest in developing a more sensitive test [5.7].
The US Anti-doping Agency (USADA) views this area as sufficiently       important and long-lived that       after the 2004 Annual Symposium (Dallas,       on Detection of Human Growth Hormone Abuse), it was       again the topic of the 2011 event (London,       on Detection of Growth Factors).
Two members of the       GH-2004 team gave invited talks at the Dallas meeting and three members       gave invited talks at       the 2011 London meeting (Holt, on Overview of the GH-2000 biomarkers         method; Bassett, on       Development and application of the discriminant function in the GH-2000         biomarker test; Cowan,       on The marker method: Inter-lab study).
These Symposia are "aimed       at bringing together anti-       doping experts from around the world ... to inform and shape meaningful       anti-doping research       programs for the future" [5.9].
The 2011 London meeting "gathered       over 100 scientists, laboratory       directors and sports administrators, representing renowned entities such       as research institutes,       international sport federations, universities, the World Anti-Doping       Agency, the International         Paralympic Committee, professional sports leagues, and the London         Olympic Organizing         Committee", with participants from almost 30 countries [5.9].
Interactions between the GH-2004 team and various anti-doping agencies       are also evident through       their contributions to a special issue of the journal Growth Hormone         and IGF Research that       covered medical, legal and social aspects of GH abuse in sport [5.10].
The UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD,       then part of UK Sport) expressed interest in the project in late       2006 [5.5], having perceived a need for a more sensitive test of       GH administration.
UKAD have       given practical support (for example, supplying athletes' blood samples       when permitted for       research purposes) [5.1].
The GH-2004 project was funded by WADA       and USADA [5.6].
The robustness of the biomarker test in the face of potential legal       challenges was established by       the end of 2011 and formal approval by the UK Accreditation Service to       conduct the test was       achieved in early July 2012.
The announcement of the introduction of the       new test led to much       press comment; the Chief Science Officer of USADA, Larry Bowers, described       it as "a terrific day       for anti-doping when you can put a test like this in place" [5.8].
The test was used formally for the       first time in the run-up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and       successfully detected two         cases of GH doping in the Paralympic Games, leading to the       disqualification of the powerlifters       involved and their suspension for two years [5.1, 5.2, 5.4].
The leader of the GH-2004 project confirms that the "test has been       endorsed by the World Anti-Doping         Agency and was introduced for the first time at the 2012 London       Olympic Games resulting       in two Russian powerlifters being disqualified at the Paralympic games" [5.3].
Summary: The statistical research at Kent has had a significant       impact on the 2012 Olympics and       on the integrity of sport in general, through the design and validation of       a new internationally       recognised test to detect exogenous use of GH.
