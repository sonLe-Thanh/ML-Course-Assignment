     This body of research has influenced policy and informed policy debate       and public discourse in the area of adolescent sexual health by       dissemination of research findings through press reports, public events       and invited presentations.
It has raised awareness amongst policy-makers,       public bodies, commentators and NGOs working in the area of adolescent       sexual health.
The research has been used, in particular, by numerous NGOs       both to hold existing policy makers to account and in their submissions to       consultations on proposed policy changes both in the UK and overseas.
The       research has directly influenced the withdrawal of a policy proposal in       Ireland.
Organisations such as the Family Educational Trust (UK), the Iona       Institute (Ireland) and the Family Research Council (USA) have used       specific empirical evidence in the research to underpin the policy advice       they provide in submissions to Parliamentary Enquiries and other policy       reviews.
For example, policymakers in Ireland have received revised advice       from the Irish Law Reform Commission regarding provision of contraception       to minors.
Commentators in the print, broadcast and online media have drawn on the       research for public policy debate about which interventions are most       effective at reducing teenage pregnancy rates in many countries including       the UK, Ireland and the USA.
Influencing policy in the Republic of Ireland     In 2010, the Irish Law Reform Commission [B] proposed to amend the law in       Ireland such that minors from the age of 12 could access contraceptive       services under some circumstances without parental consent partly on the       grounds that this would contribute to a reduction in pregnancy rates       amongst this group.
The Iona Institute submission to this consultation [C]       drew extensively on Paton's research (in particular findings in [1], [2]       and [3]) to argue against the basis for the proposed change.
This was       supported by print and broadcast media uptake of Paton's work to highlight       the issue and stimulate public debate, notably in the Irish Herald (28th       March 2010), the Irish Times (27th March 2010) and the Pat       Kenny programme on RTE 1 [J] which included an interview with Paton.
In the response to the consultation, the Irish Law Reform Commission       revised their original recommendation regarding parental consent for       contraception for minors [D, pages 102-3].
Mr David Quinn, Director of the Iona Institute has commented:     "The Iona Institute submission to the Irish Law Reform Commission on         the provision of contraception to minors drew extensively on Professor         Paton's research on teenage pregnancy.
The submission was the only one         to our knowledge which set out the evidence showing that providing         contraception to minors does not reduce the pregnancy rate among         teenagers.
Professor Paton's presentation of the submission in Dublin         was attended by members of the Law Reform Commission and almost         certainly influenced their decision to alter their original         recommendation that underage teenagers be provided with contraception         without parental permission."

Informing policy debate and public discourse     In the USA, findings from [3] and [4] have been cited in on-going policy       discussions over the Health and Human Services (HHS) proposals to mandate       contraception coverage in all health insurance schemes.
Selected examples       include The Washington Post [G], citation in the Family Research Council's       submission the Health Subcommittee Hearing [B, page 5] and in the National       Review Online [K].
In the UK, findings from the research programme have been used to subject       proposed changes in public policy to public scrutiny.
Both 2008 and       2010-12 have seen significant UK Government reviews and consultations on       sex education policy, focusing in particular on proposals to make sex and       relationships education (SRE) content statutory for schools.
The findings       in [2], [3], [4] and [5] were cited and discussed in submissions to these       consultations by several NGOs, including the Family Education Trust, in       opposition to the proposals.
As a result of the consultations, the       proposed change to SRE did not come onto the statute book, an outcome that       seems likely to have been partly informed by representations made by these       groups which referenced the research.
Dr Trevor Stammers of the Family Education Trust comments:     "Professor Paton's research has had a significant impact in shaping         public debate on policy relating to adolescent sexual health both in the         UK and overseas.
His work has presented a significant challenge to         Government policy on teenage pregnancy in the UK.
The Family Education         Trust (FET) has made extensive use of his research in our submissions to         Parliamentary Inquiries and in policy briefings.
I am aware that several         other organisations and commentators have similarly drawn upon his         research when subjecting proposed changes in policy in this area to         critical scrutiny."
[F]     Paton was invited to present his research at the 2009 Battle of Ideas       debate on sex education, a consultation on Sex Education Policy at the       House of Commons chaired by Bob Blackman MP in October 2010 and to submit       written evidence [A] to the Inquiry into Teenage Pregnancy (2012) being       Chaired by Amber Rudd MP.
He subsequently provided oral evidence to the       Inquiry (16th October 2012) and appeared on Newsnight (19th       December 2012) to discuss the recommendations of the Inquiry.
Most       recently, the research has been cited by submissions to the 2013 Scottish       Parliament Inquiry into Teenage Pregnancy by several NGOs including CARE       and the Christian Medical Foundation.
Paton's research in [4], [5] has featured widely in a range of media       outlets, notably:            BBC Wales TV programme `Week in, Week out' (June 2011) that critically         examined the Welsh Assembly plans for free provision of emergency birth         control centred on a discussion of Paton's research [3] [4] including an         interview with Paton.
Radio 5 Live Gabby Logan show (1st February 2011)       Sunday Times (29th January 2011)       Daily Telegraph (30th January 2011 [H] and 25th         August 2012)       Toronto Globe &amp; Mail (3rd February 2011)       Times of India (31st January 2011)       Times Education Supplement (24th August, 2012)          Paton's research has had a lasting effect on public discourse in the       broad area of reproductive health.
Further examples include periodic       reference to the research in teenage pregnancy statistics and sex       education articles in The Independent (29th February 2012) [I]       and BBC News Channel (26th April 2012).
Paton has given invited       contributions and keynote speeches to the Westminster Health Forum Keynote       Seminar (March 2009, about 150 attendees including MPs, Peers,       representatives from local authorities, NGOs, health authorities), Family       Education Trust Conference (June 2009, attended by about 100 members of       the organisation), Anscombe Centre for Healthcare Ethics Conference (June       2010, about 50 attendees including individuals and representatives of       organisations with an interest in bioethical issues) and the Anglican       Mainstream Conference (May 2011, attended by about 50 members of the       organisation).
In each case, proceedings of the meetings were disseminated       to the broader membership of the respective organisations and (in the case       of the Westminster Health Forum) also to policymakers.
