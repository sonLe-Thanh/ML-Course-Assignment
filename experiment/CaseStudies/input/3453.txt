     Directly Influencing national curriculum policy and practice in           Scotland       University of Glasgow research as part of the AiFL and ARIA programmes,       particularly the research reported in Hayward et al, (2005);       Hayward and Spencer, (2010); and Gardner et.
al, (2010), are clearly       reflected in the Curriculum for Excellence assessment strategy and       supporting guidance.
Under CfE, the central importance of assessment of       and for pupils' learning is now emphasised.
The research shaped the new       Curriculum by placing 3 key issues at the heart of CfE assessment policy       and practice, namely: the emphases on self- and peer-assessment as means       of developing learners' reflectiveness about their own learning; the       importance of developing teachers' professional understanding of       assessment matters and professional action on them; and, crucially, the       need for initiatives to demonstrate educational, professional and systemic       integrity.
Building           the Curriculum 5: A Framework for Assessment (2011) sets out       the Scottish Government's assessment policy and guidance.
The Framework       directly references seven research projects and publications to which       Hayward was a key contributor, demonstrating a high level of influence of       the research on assessment within the national curriculum guidance.
Additionally, Hayward and Spencer's research on reading and assessment       directly affected national assessment policy and practice.
Hayward and       Spencer (2006) identified a lack of provision for testing inference and       evaluation skills in reading.
Following meetings with the research team,       Scottish Government officials agreed to evaluate these skills in the       Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy (SSLN), which monitors       performance in literacy and numeracy at P4, P7 and S2 [1].
Two further projects, commissioned by the Scottish Qualifications       Authority (SQA), Scottish Government and a local authority (Highland       Council) in 2008, identified ways in which formative assessment could       promote higher attainment in SQA high stakes examinations and examined the       crucial contribution of the learner through self- and peer-assessment.
This research for the Highland Council has informed both SQA support for       practitioners and the development of policy and practice in that       authority.
Shaping National Education Policy and Guidance to Teaching           Professionals       Assessment at Transition (AaT), led by Hayward, influenced education       policy and practice in a range of ways.
The research team presented       emerging research findings to representatives from Scottish Government and       Education Scotland (the public body tasked with supporting quality and       improvement in Scottish education) in a series of stakeholder seminars in       late 2011 and 2012.
These policy seminars were used as a forum to explore       policy debates and build commitment amongst members of the policy       community to the project findings.
The Scottish Government subsequently       published the findings on its website.
The final AaT report, written in a style intended to communicate clearly       with different communities, was well received by education policy-makers       and professionals, resulting in major impacts on policy and practitioner       development in Scotland.
As well as receiving positive public endorsement       from Education Authorities [2], the project findings were used to       influence national policy and guidance in a number of ways.
For example,       the AaT report demonstrated that teachers lacked knowledge and confidence       about how best to assess the progress made by their pupils, in general,       and how best to evidence attainment of a curricular level.
These findings       were directly addressed by Education Scotland's 2013 publication Assessing           Progress and Achievement of Levels in the 3-15 Broad General Education,       which specifically advised schools and teachers on these matters.
The Scottish Government, following consideration of the problems of       progression and of evidencing attainment outlined in the AaT report,       tasked Education Scotland to identify significant aspects of learning in       each curricular area, develop progression frameworks (rubrics) for these       and bring together annotated exemplification of pupil work to illustrate       attainment of a curricular level in terms of these rubrics.
This was a       major recommendation of the research.
The research team contributed to the       project planning with senior Education Scotland staff; George MacBride       (Hon.
Senior Research Fellow 2006 -present) from the AaT team also       participated in the project [3].
Education Scotland also used the AaT       research findings in their project work with mathematics practitioners       across nearly all education authorities in Scotland.
In this context, the       research served as an evidence base for Education Scotland's in-depth       review of pupils' responses to the 2011 numeracy survey of the Scottish       Survey of Literacy and Numeracy [4].
Stimulating Practitioner Debate and Influencing Strategy and           Practice       The Times Education Supplement Scotland, the market-leading       education publication in Scotland, reported on the AaT work in August 2012       and followed this up in September         2012 with a 4-page feature on the research which reported that the       issues raised by the AaT findings were of relevance to every teacher in       Scotland.
The report has stimulated discussion and changes in practice in       local authorities across Scotland, as exemplified by:            Hayward presented findings to all head teachers in Glasgow; DVD of the         presentation sent to every Glasgow school and screened at a `Learning         Day' to every teacher in Glasgow; all teachers required to implement the         findings into their professional learning programme [5].
Falkirk Council's Curriculum Support Officer used the report for         discussions with headteachers; the Council used findings to revise         advice to schools on assessment, profiling and reporting [6].
The Quality Improvement Officer for Aberdeen City Council used the         report to clarify difficulties in assessment at stages of transition;         the QIO issued the report to all primary and secondary headteachers with         whom she worked to inform their practice [5].
In addition to web dissemination, more than half of Scotland's         Education Authorities (17) specifically requested the full AaT Report         from the University of Glasgow.
International Policy Influence: Informing Policy Developments in           Norway       Policy-makers and practitioners in Norway used the assessment research       findings as an evidence base to develop their Education policy [7].
Hayward presented the research to the Norwegian Education Directorate in       Oslo on 23 October 2012 as part of the Norwegian Assessment for Learning       4-year programme (2010-14) involving more than 400 schools.
Hayward was       invited to Norway as an expert on the basis of her `... more than 20         years of expertise in assessment issues'.
Reporting on the       implementation of the project, the Norwegian Directorate drew on the       findings of Hayward and Spencer (2010) and AaT to inspire many of the       changes effected by the Norwegian programme.
The related OECD Report Building           Trust and Accountability: the Assessment for Learning Programme in           Norway also cites the work of ARG, with which Hayward was       significantly involved, as influencing Norwegian policy direction on       assessment.
The DVD of Hayward's presentation in Oslo is a key feature of       the Directorate's Assessment         for Learning web resource designed to aid and inform the work of       teachers and practitioners across Norway.
