     Branney's work to disseminate his research on men's use of healthcare and       their treatment decisions to clinicians meant that a very specific       healthcare need &#8212; information for men on penile cancer &#8212; was identified       and a project team assembled to address this need.
From the start of the       project the aim was to produce a resource that could inform men, their       families and their clinicians about this condition.
While the team       initially comprised of clinicians and researchers in Leeds, it was       apparent that the resource produced would be of value nationally and so       the team was expanded to include Bullen (Aberystwyth), who had done some       earlier work on penile cancer, and Ziebland (Oxford), from the research       team behind Health Talk Online.
Health Talk Online is a resource used by       people with the condition, their families and carers and clinicians.
The main output from the project is a resource for Health Talk Online.
This includes downloadable videos of 27 men talking about their       experiences of penile cancer and an information resource on the condition.
The men who participated in the study identified the information they       wanted to make available.
This included signs and symptoms of penile       cancer, the treatment options, recovering from surgery, and some of the       concerns that men have such as how to tell other people about their       cancer, using the toilet, the effect on sex and relationships, and the       impact of surgery on men's sense of masculinity and confidence.
This       resource was launched in the summer of 2012 and has already received over       237,000 hits and 22,000 views.
A launch event took place at the Royal       Society on 23/10/12 and was attended by academics, relevant charities and       the general public.
To further disseminate the results of this research and increase public       awareness of penile cancer Branney and the team produced an art       installation that forms a travelling exhibition.
This includes quotes from       the interviews illustrated by art from one of the patients and       grantholders who is also an artist (Edwards).
This exhibition has been       installed in several venues in the UK:            Biannual Conference, International Society of Critical Health         Psychology, Bradford University, 22nd-24th July 2013.
St. James' Hospital, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, 3rd-14th June         2013.
Aberystwyth University, 22nd-26th April 2013.
World Cancer Day &amp; the first week of semester 2 teaching, Leeds         Metropolitan University, February 4th-8th 2013.
Aston University, October 26th 2013.
It is typically installed for several days and open for the public to       view, sometimes accompanied by a series of presentations.
Branney has also talked about the research on the Radio 4 programme       Inside Health.
A whole programme was dedicated to Penile Cancer and the       work of Branney and his team was central to the programme.
This was first       broadcast on 24/10/12 and is available on the BBC iplayer.
This programme       led to further interest in the research, and several articles and       editorials have been written that include reference to his research, e.g.
Ally Fogg, When is it OK for a cancer campaign to be sexy?
Comment is         Free, The Guardian, Wednesday 24th October, 2013         http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/24/cancer-campaign-sexual-hook        Making men think about cancer, Yorkshire Evening Post, Wed 7th Nov         2012       Penile cancer module gives men forum to shout about it, Clinical         Focus, Primary Care Today, November/December 2012, p. 31          The beneficiaries of this research are therefore:            Men with penile cancer who can now access a resource that provides         information, answers their questions, helps reduce their feelings of         isolation, and helps them talk to others about their cancer.
It can also         help them talk to their clinicians about their treatment options;       The families and friends of men with penile cancer who can use the         resource to help them talk about the condition and its effects;       Clinicians, who gain insight into what it is like to be diagnosed with         and to live with penile cancer;       Students (e.g.
medical students, nursing students, psychology         students) who can visit the website to gain insight into living with         this condition.
Men more generally who are more aware of penile cancer and its signs         and symptoms and so may seek help earlier should they have this         condition.
