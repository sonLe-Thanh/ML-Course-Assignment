     BEAST software has been widely used in non-academic contexts to       provide analysis of the       evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of infectious disease agents       such as viruses and       bacteria.
The impact varies from direct application of BEAST to resolve       specific questions of       infectious disease dynamics with commercial or other impact, to using the       understanding derived       from this research to inform large-scale public health policy.
Overall,       BEAST has some 1500 users       including commercial users.
This case study highlights impact in a number       of different contexts.
Impact on public policy and services: Rambaut led a workshop at the     Centres for Disease     Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) in 2008, teaching BEAST to virologists.
CDC     is the US national public     health institute that works to protect public       health and safety     by providing information to enhance     health decisions and policy.
BEAST is now installed on the CDC central     high-performance     computing facility and is widely used throughout the CDC for public health     assessment [a].
For     instance, the Head of surveillance at the HIV/AIDS prevention division of     CDC states that:     "it has been a crucial tool for our routine work in HIV and related       viruses for improving public       health".
[a]     The CDC trains its staff in use of BEAST for public health surveillance,       risk assessment and       response [b].
Training courses which including the application of BEAST       are also being provided       for health surveillance and disease control organisations on behalf of WHO       and the FAO/OIE       (Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation/World Organisation for Animal Health)       [b].
Influence on public health policy and advisory committees: BEAST       has been used to inform       public health decision making at early stages of an epidemic or outbreak       when little other       information is available, most notably in public health assessments and       approaches taken by the       World Health Organization (WHO) during and after the 2009 human influenza       (H1N1 `swine flu')       pandemic.
The 2009 Fraser et al.
Science paper [5] was published relatively early       in the outbreak.
The 2011       WHO Report `Strengthening response to pandemics and other public-health         emergencies' [c] cites       the publication of this paper as a key event in their process of       assessment for the severity of the       outbreak.
The paper used BEAST to estimate the time of most recent common       ancestor and thus       the start date of the outbreak and the basic reproductive number (R0)       for pandemic influenza       A(H1N1) from genetic sequence data of the virus.
The paper also used other       epidemiological       analyses and estimates of the initial outbreak, international spread, and       viral genetic diversity to       make an early assessment of transmissibility and severity.
The analysis       produced using BEAST       provides part of a full preliminary analysis contained in this key paper,       and the subsequent impact       from the paper includes elements directly derived from BEAST as well as       from other aspects of the       research.
For instance the reproductive number R0 was       explicitly referenced in the WHO document       `Considerations for assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic'       published in the WHO Weekly       Epidemiological Record (WER) on 29 May 2009 [d].
This summarized the data       available to WHO to       date including the modelled data from BEAST, addressed how countries       should respond in view of       the emerging epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of       the pandemic virus, and       noted that WHO provides such information `to allow countries to tailor       their response measures as       needed'.
A subsequent issue of WER [e] `summarizes some of the key       observations ... that may       inform preparations being made for the winter influenza season'; this       again references paper [5]       and the A(H1N1) reproductive number as a key piece of information relevant       to such preparations.
Rambaut's 2008 [2] and 2009 [4] Nature papers on human influenza A       dynamics (primarily H1N1       and H3N2), and also paper [5], were cited in the 2009 WHO Report on "Acute       Respiratory       Infections" [f] which discusses WHO policy on influenza vaccines and       analyses the nature of the       2009 epidemic (including the virology) and its implications for future       policy.
Impact on outcomes in criminal and civil litigation: Analysis       using the BEAST software has       been used in international court cases.
The expert report for a large       criminal case in Valencia,       Spain where an anaesthetist was convicted of infecting hundreds of       patients with hepatitis C virus,       used BEAST in determining the likely nature and timing of the infection,       which was important       evidence in determining responsibility [g].
BEAST analysis was also used       in expert witness       testimony in a patent dispute brought in Norway for fish virus vaccines       between Intervet       International and Pharmaq AS, where the use of BEAST demonstrated the       genetic separation of       two virus strains at the core of the case [h].
Impact on society and culture; enhanced awareness of health issues:       Rambaut maintained a       public website during the swineflu pandemic of 2009 [ http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/groups/influenza/ ]       on which he published all available current analyses of the pandemic,       including analyses using       BEAST (e.g.
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/groups/influenza/wiki/8fa90/Outbreak_molecular_epidemiological_analysis_4_May_2009_-_Andrew_Rambaut.html).
This site was frequently used by journalists [i] and Rambaut was       interviewed for or quoted in more       than 20 general interest, news and popular science publications including       'Wired' magazine       (http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/swinefluupdate/),       the AAAS News       (http://news.sciencemag.org/2009/07/pandemic-h1n1-virus-canadian-pigs-smells-odd)       and       `LiveScience' (http://www.livescience.com/3668-swine-flu-evolved-unnoticed-years.html).
The 2009       Nature paper [4] was quoted in international news media including the       China Post       (http://www.chinapost.com.tw/health/infectious-diseases/2009/06/13/212080/H1N1-flu.htm)       and       United Press International (http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/06/11/Swine-flu-development-timescale-analyzed/UPI-42611244736329/).
Rambaut maintains an ongoing blog       http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/       with news and data on epidemics including the outputs of BEAST       analyses which has a wide public audience; for instance on 3rd       April 2013, the site had 3,600 hits in       one day after Carl Zimmer (Science writer, journalist, columnist at NY       Times) tweeted:     @carlzimmer: If you like watching science unfold in real time,         check out this #H7N9       flu         evolution wiki http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/influenza_H7N9       Data uploaded ASAP
