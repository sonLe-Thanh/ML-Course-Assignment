     The research provided strong clinical evidence that skills training in       the management of insulin therapy was effective in an outpatient setting       and led to the creation of a 5-day outpatient based course with       accompanying materials for use on UK patients.
This has led to a paradigm       shift in the approach to the management of Type 1 Diabetes from hospital       based, doctor/nurse centric care to user centred self-management that has       delivered the following impacts:     Change to clinical guidelines     Publication of the paper in the BMJ plus the subsequent responses from       the UK diabetes community prompted NICE to include within the scope of       guidelines on management of Type 1 diabetes a review of the literature on       diabetes related education.
The guidelines state in paragraph 7.3 "NHS         trusts, primary care organisations and general practices should ensure         that responsibility is clearly defined for offering and providing         educational programmes for people with diabetes and for considering         referral to the DAFNE programme as one option for people with type 1         diabetes" [S1].
Paragraph 1.4 of the same NICE guidance, states "It is considered that         the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) programme may be a         suitable option for individuals with type 1 diabetes, being one means of         enabling people to self-manage this condition."
[S1].
In addition, in `Understanding NICE guidance &#8212; information for people       with diabetes, and the public' it states on pages 6 and 7: "What has         NICE recommended?
NICE has recommended that all people with diabetes         should be offered structured education, provided by a trained specialist         team of health professionals.
NICE considers the team should include a         diabetes specialist nurse" [S2].
It also goes on to say "The DAFNE (short for Dose Adjustment For         Normal Eating) training course is one example of a patient-education         model for people with type 1 diabetes.
A DAFNE course lasts 5 days and         teaches groups of people to tailor their insulin doses according to the         amount of starchy foods they eat and their lifestyle.
DAFNE is a         `structured' programme."
[S2].
DAFNE is also the only structured skills training course for adults with       Type 1 diabetes that meets the requirements of a Department of Health       report from the Patient Education Working Group [S3].
To quote       Rosie Winterton MP (Minister of State for Health Services in 2005), "The         DAFNE and DESMOND (Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing         and Newly Diagnosed) education programmes provide a nationally-led,         evidence-based approach for type 1 and type 2 diabetes" [S3,       page 3].
Current clinical status     The Department of Health initially funded a roll-out across the country       to 10 additional centres within the Expert Patient Programme and DAFNE is       now delivered by 75 specialist diabetes services in the UK, Northern       Ireland and the Republic of Ireland [S4].
Based on the number of       acute Trusts delivering diabetes services (patients with Type 1 Diabetes       are cared for in secondary care), this represents around 35% of secondary       centres [S5].
Since 2008, more than 25,000 adults with Type 1 diabetes have completed a       DAFNE course in the UK [S6] representing approximately 15% of       adults with the disease in England and Wales (figures estimated from those       contained in [S7]).
Currently, there are 550 courses offered every       year, with around 4000 new DAFNE graduates.
DAFNE has also been exported to Australia (as Oz DAFNE), being delivered       in 14 centres including New Zealand.
Teams from Spain, South Africa,       Nigeria and Kuwait have recently travelled to the UK to observe DAFNE and       receive training.
The numbers of graduates in other countries with growing       DAFNE programmes since 2008 are as follows: Australia, New Zealand and       Singapore (2697), Kuwait (159) [S8].
Economic impact     DAFNE has delivered cost savings to the NHS estimated by NICE to be &#163;48       million per year nationally [S9].
