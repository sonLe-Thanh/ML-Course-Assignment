     PARN research on governance was undertaken when most professional bodies       were governed       by large representative Councils.
Getting them to give up sovereign power       in favour of a smaller       strategic Board usually requires more than logical argument in print, it       requires evidence of what       others are doing and in many cases explanation in person.
This was       achieved through the       triennial benchmarking surveys and by presentation of the results and the       Cupped Hands Model       at PARN conferences and at Council meetings [b, c, e, f, g].
Often years       and several reform       proposals intervene from research awareness to changing governance       structures.
PARN is not       alone in suggesting governance reform, though most recommend simply       cutting down the       existing Council size.
Many Councils recognise the need to change from       their own experiences.
However PARN has provided a clear way ahead and, according to one       professional body       representative, a combination of `reassurance, reinforcement and       inspiration' [a].
Two of five participating in the original research project adopted the       Cupped Hands Model:             Association of Business Recovery Professionals (R3) adopted in         2003 [a].
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply is switching to         cupped hands in November         2013.
In 2012 other PARN recommendations were implemented: Nominations         Committee and Remunerations Committee.
'We made bigger changes because         of         [PARN's] recommendations.'
[b]          Many others have adopted a dual structure as suggested by the Cupped       Hands Model.
In 2003,       PARN estimated from a survey of 119 UK professional bodies that 15% had       adopted this       structure.
This had risen to 25% by the 2012 survey.
Among those reporting       to have been       influenced by PARN in their governance reforms are:             Institute for Archaeologists attributed the idea of changing         governance structures to         PARN publications, conferences and consultancy.
Cupped hands will be         presented for         membership approval in October 2013.

Several professional bodies were influenced by other aspects of the       governance research:            Changing election procedures by introducing selection rather than         relying solely on         election.
This led to bringing in `some extremely influential executives         from across the         industry ... which improved our credibility considerably' and         introducing special interest         groups in addition to branches at Institute of the Motor Industry;         [e] adopted 2001, 2006;         continued strategic reviews 2010, 2013.
Changing election procedures and having committees to support         governance rather than         to match staff functions including nominations committee 2009.
Peer         review 2011- British           Institute of Facilities Management [f].
Appointments committee and wider constituencies for election and to         `balance the         elected members of the Council with some nominated and selected         members'- Institute           of Hospitality [g] 2006.
Creation of Nominations committee and Assurance committee &#8212; Nautical           Institute [j]         2012/13          PARN has encouraged professional bodies to take up or improve CPD       programmes, to make       CPD compulsory with associated monitoring and sanctions for       non-compliance, and to measure       participation by outputs rather than inputs.
Associated with these       outcomes, PARN has       benchmarked how professional bodies have been supporting CPD by guidance       notes, templates       for reflection and planning, mentoring schemes, as well as audit and       assessment.
Between 2003       and 2012, adoption of compulsory CPD increased from 13% to 28% amongst UK       professional       bodies and output based CPD from 15% to 31%.
PARN has influenced CPD by:            Encouraging setting up a CPD programme in 2002 at Institute of the           Motor Industry [e]       Providing evidence on the importance of CPD and of making it         compulsory which was         adopted in 2009 by Institute for Archaeologists; [c]       Moving to widening CPD activities and concentrating on reflection         rather than counting         hours at Association of Accounting Technicians who referred to         [2]; [i] 2007/8         Helping to resist reverting to the recommended FSA measure of 35 hours         and continuing         to measure by outputs at Chartered Insurance Institute who         referred to [2] in a         consultation exercise to its members [h] 2009.
The impact of PARN research and networking activities can be regarded as       far wider than       changes in professional body policies for which direct evidence is       provided.
Impact on members       or registrants at professional bodies benefiting from more strategic       professional bodies and       availability of evidence of their efforts at CPD is harder to identify,       but could be generated by       surveying them.
More important is the derived impact of PARN on the       competence of       professionals benefiting clients, patients and employers by receiving more       up-to-date and       competent professional services.
