     Professor Speirs' translations of Weber and Nietzsche are having       sustained and demonstrable impact upon educators, students, the general       public, and on the publishing industry in the UK and abroad.
The range of       impacts upon these groups includes: contributing to economic prosperity in       the publishing industry through sales; influencing education through       inclusion in numerous teaching bibliographies outside the submitting HEI;       and informing wider public understanding in a number of fields as a       reliable source for a number of non-academic publications, resources and       other writings.
These are outlined in more detail for each translation       below.
The economic impact is evident from receipts and sales (for       details, see below).
The economic impact mainly arises from the educational         impact (evident in the international adoption of both texts in many       educational courses of different kinds), which in turn reflects the       perceived reliability of the translation and explanatory apparatus.
The       consistently high annual sales figures confirm the widespread uptake of       both texts not only in the UK, but across the world, especially in the US.
The translations/editions of both Weber and Nietzsche are cited or listed       as standard works of reference in many other books in their respective and       related fields, so that the social and educational impact is       multiplied through the readership of these books in turn.
In this way each       edition/translation has enhanced public understanding of cultural         capital or of civil society.
