     Although the majority of craniosynostosis cases are considered       non-syndromic (occurring as an       isolated incident), 15% of craniosynostosis cases are associated with       specific syndromes and       around 23% of all cases (syndromic or non-syndromic) now have a genetic       diagnosis, 38% of       which were identified by the Clinical Genetics Laboratory in Oxford.
This       research has led to the       development of genetic tests for accurate diagnosis, improved clinical       management, and enhanced       quality of life for patients and their families worldwide.
Accurate Genetic Diagnosis       The Clinical Genetics Laboratory's determination of 14 genes relating to       craniofacial syndromes       has led to the development of the first genetic diagnostic tests for these       syndromes, now available       in multiple laboratories around the world.
The GeneTests website,       hosted by the National Centre         for Biotechnology Information, USA, lists 34 laboratories in 15       different countries offering tests for       mutations in the FGFR2 gene alone6.
In the UK eight       genes discovered by the Wilkie lab have now       been approved for genetic testing, including ERF and TCF12,       through the UK Genetic Testing         Network gene dossiers process7.
These tests provide a       range of safe and accurate diagnostic       options including: pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis,       and ultrasound scanning.
Data from the Clinical Molecular Genetics Society Audit, showed       there were 127 prenatal       diagnoses in the UK for craniosynostosis between 2010 and 20118.
The Oxford Medical Genetics       Laboratories tested 260 new patient samples (for craniosynostosis       syndromes) between 2010 and       2012 (174 from the United Kingdom and 86 abroad)9, representing       a small sample of the total       tests carried out worldwide each year.
Improved Clinical Management       The great significance of prenatal diagnosis for craniofacial syndromes on       a case-by-case basis is       shown in a 2007 study of five cases of suspected Apert syndrome, confirmed       prenatally by FGFR2       mutation analysis.
While three of these pregnancies were terminated, it is       important to note that       two families chose to continue with pregnancy.
In such cases, the accurate       prenatal diagnosis       allows swift clinical responses, such as early referral to specialists,       better communication with       families, a more precise long-term prognosis, and improved clinical       management10.
The effect of accurate genetic diagnosis for improved clinical outcomes       is exemplified in a further       study from the Clinical Genetics Laboratory, which was published in 2009.
This study shows that       patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (related to the TWIST1       mutation) have a 42% recurrence       rate of intracranial hypertension following standard surgical       intervention.
As a result, it is now       recommended that all patients with syndromic features should be tested for       TWIST1 mutations in       order to prevent the recurrence of intracranial hypertension following       surgery11.
The following       supplementary commentary from senior plastic surgeon, Scott P. Bartlett,       M.D.
Division of Plastic       Surgery, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, reflects increasing       realisation among clinicians of the       importance of genetic screening as a management tool12: "This         is an important article.
I hope those         who deal with this area will read it closely and share it with members         of their craniofacial team who         do not have access to this publication."
12     Improved Quality of Life       Craniosynostosis is a common condition causing illness and uncertainty for       thousands of patients       and their families worldwide.
Accurate genetic diagnosis offers definitive       explanations for these       often misdiagnosed, misunderstood, and mismanaged disorders.
The following testimonials represent a small percentage of the thousands       of individual lives       affected by this research:     Quote from the mother of a boy accurately diagnosed with a mutation in       ERF:       "When Charlie was finally diagnosed it came as a relief that somebody         had listened to us and was         able to put a name to the problem.
I always suspected that something was         wrong despite tests         coming back normal."
13     Email to Professor Wilkie from a young woman with a mutation in TCF12:       "After letting things settle and sink in over the weekend, I would just         like to say a quick a huge         thank you for speaking with me on Friday, and completely putting my         prospective future of having         children in a completely different light.
For this, I cannot thank you         enough.
"14     Email to Professor Wilkie from a family involved in the group's ERF       study:       "I have finally read the reports and information on the Internet and         have been meaning to email         you just to thank you and your team for your hard work in helping find         answers for families like us.
Thank you to you and your team for giving us a name for (my sons)         problems... in some ways it         has definitely made a difference in how we feel about it all, a lot of         things with (my son) make         sense now and the problems he has had in the past and still experiencing         now..." 15
