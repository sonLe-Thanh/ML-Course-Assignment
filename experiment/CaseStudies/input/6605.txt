     In 2003, Ecebs was an advanced software technology small-to-medium       enterprise company with fewer than 20 employees that specialised in       smartcard software development and solutions.
It created rapid development       technology that could be deployed across an all encompassing range of       smartcard applications (including payment, ticketing, contactless systems,       authentication, and healthcare), which were exploited within a variety of       organisations, ranging from large blue chip companies and government       departments to specialist firms.
The impact of our work for Ecebs included [S3]:            a significant improvement in the company's competitive position         [S1,S2] in this domain and creating new business opportunities.
a revitalised and broadened product (and patent) portfolio developed         from a much greater appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of         techniques and technologies deployed in biometric systems (e.g.,         hardware constraints, data representations, algorithms; applicable         standards) together with the emerging security attack scenarios.
sharper more focused branding and marketing borne out of greater         visibility in the market place as an originator of biometric solutions         rather than a value added reseller       a much stronger understanding of the external competitive and         technological environment and in particular the strengths and weaknesses         of competitor product offerings       a comprehensive set of product development and technology learning         resources that were used to increase the expertise and develop new and         existing staff       a understanding of other opportunities in the area of biometrics and         software development, allowing the company to build on further         innovative product concepts (eg the utilisation of biometric profiles         beyond the traditional identity authentication applications).
In 2007 Ecebs was acquired for &#163;18.7m by Trainline Investment Holdings       Ltd (today known as TheTrainline.com)[S4], an online rail ticket service       provider, and in 2012 sold on to Bell ID (2012), a global provider of       smart card/contactless/mobile solutions for an undisclosed sum[S5].
On       purchase Bell ID noted that "Ecebs' solutions are used extensively       throughout the UK and are now reaching international markets."[S6].
Both       acquisitions included Ecebs' employees, products, and intellectual       property.
Ecebs continue to trade and are still pursuing identity authentication       products and services based on using the 'Feedback in Biometrics' series       of applications for identity authentication [S3], but have now dropped the       'Secure Pupil Response Testing' applications " given the (strategic)       direction (they) are heading" [S3].
Beyond the impact for Ecebs our work [1,2] is cited in two books that are       widely used by both practitioners and educators as comprehensive reference       sources within the field: The Handbook of Fingerprint Recognition       (cited in Chapter entitled "Securing Fingerprint Systems" Springer, 2009)       and Pattern Recognition, Machine Intelligence and Biometrics       (cited in Chapter entitled "Fingerprint Identification &#8212; Ideas,       Influences, and Trends of New Age", Springer, 2011).
Our work in [P1] has been cited in the search report for the patent       application entitled "Logo or Image Recognition" by Yahoo Inc. (2011)       [S7].
