     Company Development       As a direct result of research carried out in Physics at Imperial College       London, MV has been established as a robust (12 years and counting) UK       technology company, generating &#163;3.4M (&gt; &#163;1.2M equity, &gt; &#163;1.5M       contract and &gt; &#163;660K grant funding) in inward investment for       the UK over the 2008-2013 REF period [A-E].
A further &#163;2.6M of UK         equity investment has been injected into the economy via MV in this       period [A, B] and it has consequently been able to provide &gt; 50 person       years of employment for its own, primarily PhD-level, UK-trained staff.
MV       has further supported a variety of skills enhancement activities,       including EPSRC KTS project costs for two PDRAs seconded from and a MV       Principal Scientist seconded to, the Physics Department, and MBA fees for       another MV Principal Scientist.
This represents a direct economic impact       through investment funding for new activities, jobs created and protected,       turnover associated with new and improved services, and priority shifts in       expenditure and reallocation of budgets.
Further details are given below.
In addition, MV has played a significant role in providing momentum for       the fledgling UK plastic electronics industry [F, G].
In particular, it       has focused attention on the opportunities for plastic electronics in the       medical diagnostics sector, which had not previously been recognised.
MV's       BioLED&#8482; technology can also address multi-billion pound detection markets       for homeland security/biodefence [E], environmental monitoring including       water quality, and animal health including bovine TB.
In 2008 MV had developed its first prototype devices, being the focus of       an article in The Engineer [C, H] and a September 2008 visit by       Phil Willis MP, then Chair of the House of Commons Innovation,       Universities and Skills (IUSS) Committee, as part of the Committee's       Engineering Inquiry [C, I].
In February 2009 Peter Woodford, a diagnostics       industry veteran of 35 years standing, including 15 years with Roche       Diagnostics, joined the company as Chairman, saying "I am excited by         the clear potential of Molecular Vision's technology platform" [J].
In September 2009 MV raised an additional &#163;2m in a round led by Imperial       Innovations to further the commercial development of the BioLED&#8482;       technology platform, with Innovations CEO Susan Searle commenting "Point-of-care         diagnostics is becoming increasingly important in the provision of         patient care and through its innovative technology, Molecular Vision is         well placed to provide healthcare professionals with highly advanced         solutions" [A].
A significant contract with L'Oreal was also       announced [D] and MV joined the European Defence Agency PathoID-Chip       project as a sub-contractor to Microfluidic ChipShop with a budget       reallocated from Nanoident [E].
MV further participated from January 2010       in the EU Photo-FET project (FP7-ICT 248052 Integrated Photonic         Field-Effect Technology for Bio-sensing Functional Components),       completed at the end of 2012 [K].
In 2010 MV additionally launched the       development of its CardioPlex&#8482; fluorescence based triple test for cardiac       markers myoglobin, CK-MB and Troponin-I.
CardioPlex&#8482; was co-funded by       Acrongenomics and was successfully demonstrated in 2011.
In February 2011       Dr Chris Hand, another diagnostics industry veteran with 20 years prior       experience, including founding, floating and selling Cozart plc, was       appointed MV CEO [C].
He, together with Abingdon Health Group colleagues,       subsequently raised funds to acquire a 50.1% stake in MV as part of a       wider &#163;3M deal that saw Imperial Innovations also invest in Abingdon       [A-C].
Most recently, agreements have been put in place with a leading       European pharmaceutical company and a large multi-national chemical       company to co-develop point-of-care diagnostic tests in the UK [B].
Healthcare Benefits       The novel microanalysis technology that MV has pioneered offers a step       change opportunity for point-of-care in-vitro diagnostics [B].
In       particular MV's BioLED&#8482; platform provides a simple-to-use, portable,       low-cost, rapid, quantitative diagnostic tool.
It allows efficient,       accurate, multi-analyte measurement in a generic format that can utilize       absorption, turbidity, fluorescence, phosphorescence and chemiluminescence       detection schemes with existing assays on blood, saliva and urine samples       and at the cost of a few pounds, i.e.
some 1000-fold cheaper than the       typical bench-top readers with which it competes in terms of sensitivity       and accuracy.
It is anticipated that these tests will become a routine       tool in general practice.
The availability of such devices would directly       address key objectives of health providers in the UK, Europe and the US,       notably: (i) reduced treatment time; (ii) improved quality of treatment;       (iii) reduced inequality of treatment by extending the facilities       available to remote surgeries; and (iv) improved ongoing care via       home-based preventative and post-treatment monitoring of at-risk patients       [L].
The cost-performance profile of the BioLED&#8482; platform is also well       suited to addressing the growing development of stratified medicine and       personalised health and beauty products.
The disruptive nature of MV's       technology was recognized by the Abingdon Health Group, which acquired a       majority shareholding in MV in March 2012.
Dr Hand, Abingdon founder and       CEO, states "I believe that the Molecular Vision technology offers us         a current and future competitive advantage in the diagnostics sector.
It         allows us to expand current markets, and with similarities to our         previous activities at Cozart, allows us to create new, currently         untapped markets for the benefits of the user, the patient and the         healthcare system" [B].
