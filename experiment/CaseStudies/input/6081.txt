     The CREATE's research has changed policy discourse around access to       education and influenced DFID, Commonwealth Ministers, AusAid, World Bank,       UNICEF, UNESCO and Education International.
DFID's 2010 Education Strategy Paper (2010) adopted the `Zones         of Exclusion' model to frame policy on access, quality and skills [see         Section 5, C1, C6].
This was an impact of the presentation of research         findings to DFID advisors at their retreat in Chennai in 2009.
In         addition, CREATE's research helped DFID's Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha         Abhijan programme in India for secondary education to secure &#163;80 million         UK-aid funding in 2011 [C1].
In 2012 members of the team contributed         directly to the design of a &#163;250 million education programme in Ethiopia         (Chris Berry, Head of Profession, DFID, 1 September 2013).
As a result of delivering the opening plenary to the Commonwealth         Ministers' meeting in 2012, Lewin was appointed senior technical advisor         to the Commonwealth Ministerial Working Party on Education.
The         Commonwealth Framework, co-authored by Lewin, adopts the CREATE         `expanded vision of access' and matrix of goals, indicators and targets.
This was endorsed by the 53 member-states and presented to the UN         High-Level Panel on the MDGs.
It is used for advocacy across the UN         system to reform the MDGs and is widely regarded as being of the highest         quality [C2, C7].
Making Rights Realities (R1) was the centrepiece of the 2011         UNICEF global advisors' retreat in New York and was projected on their         global Intranet.
This was a result of inputs to the design and         theorising of the UNICEF 25-country Out-of-School studies in 2010 using         the CREATE models [C3, C5].
One of many results is that `We have         successfully used the (CREATE) framework and completed the first-ever         comprehensive household-based study on exclusion in education in DRC.
We         found that there are 7.3 million children out of school ...' (Cecilia         Baldeh Chef d'Education, UNICEF, 9 May 2013).
UNICEF has subsequently         commissioned an 11-country study on access and equity in the Arab         region, and an East and Southern Africa Situation Analysis from Sussex.
CREATE research findings are informing the Learning Metrics Task Force         of UNESCO Institute of Statistics, which is adopting its `yield         coefficient' to help the Global Partnership for Education to monitor         educational progress across 54 countries [C3, C8].
Australian Aid's education policy paper `Promoting Education         for All' was explicitly shaped by CREATE's Zones of Exclusion and         findings on silent exclusion, over-age children and drop-out.
The         `expanded vision of access' was adopted as one of the `three pillars'         that shape Australian aid [C4].
AusAID organised two workshops with its         education advisors based on CREATE during 2012.
As a result of this (i)         the zones of exclusion were integrated into the AusAID Performance         Assessment Framework, (ii) three countries have piloted using the zones         for management and monitoring, and (iii) the Pacific Ministers' meeting         mandated the University of the South Pacific to replicate CREATE in the         region [C4, C9].
Work on strategies for the expansion of access builds on Lewin's work         as senior advisor to the World Bank's Secondary Education in Africa         programme [R5].
Software was developed to model student flows and costs.
In CREATE it has been used in three states in India and has shaped the         largest programme of expansion of secondary schooling in the world under         RMSA [C1].
The work on financing also includes projects on the impact of         privatisation on access.
Lewin is an advisor to Education International,         which has 30 million affiliated members, and is co-author of their         10-year strategic plan, using findings from CREATE.
The impact of this         work is evident from the invitation to debate privatisation in         educational development at the All-Party Parliamentary Group on         Education in the House of Lords [C10], and in the recent policy paper on         privatisation published at the G20 meeting in Moscow in September 2013         [C10].
The impact of CREATE can be summed up by users of the research: `The six       zones of exclusion described in the conceptual framework for CREATE have       now entered the literature and are a standard part of the dialogue between       international aid agencies and countries.
The plans and actions of DFID,       the World Bank, Commonwealth agencies, AusAID, UNICEF and Education       International have been strongly influenced by CREATE's work on zones of       exclusion' [C5]; `The "zones of exclusion" conceptualisation alone was       worth the investment.
It has changed the whole discourse' [C1].
