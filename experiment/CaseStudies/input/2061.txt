     Opera has a reputation in the UK for being `high-brow' and intimidating       to new audiences, especially the young.
Attracting a younger demographic       is essential to the future of the genre as well as being a significant       factor in boosting audience numbers in the short term.
New works are       notoriously difficult to commission and stage, with ticket sales often       failing to recoup the costs involved.
Scottish Opera designed the Five:15 project (2008-10) to address       both challenges: to reach out to new audiences; and to teach a new       generation of artists the skills needed to create opera, thus securing its       future in Scotland and beyond.
The project invited well-known Scottish       composers and writers who were new to opera to write 15-minute `shorts'.
It was thought that this taster format, coupled with the fact that the       operas were in English, would provide an accessible introduction to the       art form for younger people.
This unconventional approach was complemented       by the choice of venue, with Scottish Opera convincing venues that do not       usually stage opera &#8212; such as theatres and universities &#8212; to add the shows       to their programmes.
Strachan's storytelling expertise and her experiments with narrative form       made her an ideal participant in the project, and the recurring themes of       identity and gender politics in her novels were of particular interest to       the composer and production company in selecting her as librettist.
The engagement of artists who were new to opera added a freshness of       perspective and approach to these works, as well as offering a hook to       attract a more diverse audience.
Five:15 enabled Scottish Opera to       discover significant new talent, some of whom (Strachan included) were       subsequently invited to create longer operas.
Sublimation       Strachan was invited to take part in the Five:15 programme in its second       year, teaming up with composer Nick Fells to create Sublimation.
The piece was performed as one of the five mini- operas in Elphinstone       Hall, Aberdeen, (15-16 May 2010), Oran Mor in Glasgow (17 and 25 May) and       the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh (20-22 May), reaching combined audiences       over its nine performances of 1,791 people and selling out completely for       all its shows.
The piece was well- received, with reviewers noting that `In         Strachan and Fells' Sublimation, a skilfully layered text         overlays a personal crisis that is at once modern and timeless', and       media coverage reaching an estimated 311,000 people.
The programme was       supported by education outreach events; Strachan took part in an opera       study day coordinated by Scottish Opera and the Department of Adult and       Continuing Education at the University of Glasgow.
The event was open to       the public, with approximately 20 workshop participants engaging in a       facilitated discussion with Strachan, Fells and the novelist Bernard       MacLaverty (also a librettist for Five:15) as part of the day-long       session.

Miranda Sinani and Lee Bisset in Sublimation (from http://zoestrachan.com/libretti.html)          Sublimation was chosen from the five 2010 productions for a guest       performance at Cape Town Opera, with performances in Rondebosch between       21-27 November 2010 to a total audience of 1,646.
Cape Town Opera was       inspired by the Five:15 concept to develop its own successful Five:20       project for nurturing new opera in South Africa.
The Lady from the Sea       Scottish Opera built upon the Five:15 project by inviting a selection of       the writers and composers who had worked on the project to collaborate on       longer pieces, to be performed as part of the festivities to celebrate 50       years since the company's foundation.
Strachan was invited to collaborate       with Craig Armstrong (composer for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet,       Moulin Rouge and The Great Gatsby) to create a full length       opera based on the Ibsen play The Lady from the Sea.
The Lady         from the Sea was an innovative co-commission between Scottish Opera       and the Edinburgh International Festival, and had its premier at the       Edinburgh International Festival on 29 August 2012.
The opera was       performed on 29 August and 1 September at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh,       and on 8 and 9 September 2012 in Glasgow's Theatre Royal.
Total audiences       were 1,813.
It was a critical success, with reviewers in The Times,       The Scotsman and The Independent praising Strachan's       libretto particularly, and The Herald writing: `If you don't         know Ibsen, but get Austen, you'll love it, although Zo&#235; Strachan's         libretto is more explicit and emotionally direct than anything either of         them wrote.
As a concise, lucid and poetic text it is exemplary and the         narrative she, [Craig] Armstrong, and choreographer Kally Lloyd-Jones         have put together with director Harry Fehr could hardly be bettered.'
The work won a 2012 Herald Angel Award for cultural excellence.
Both these works have been successful in reaching younger and       non-traditional opera audiences.
Pre-performance discussions and Q&amp;A       sessions were held in both Edinburgh and Glasgow, free of charge and open       to all.
The Independent noted in its review of The Lady from         the Sea that Scottish Opera's Five:15 programme and full-length new       operas have worked to great effect: `This freshness and         open-mindedness is paying off with an audience which, for the most part,         has to pay full fare on the bus.
The Lady from the Sea whets the         appetite for what they will do next.'
