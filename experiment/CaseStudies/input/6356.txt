     PSEL research into [redact 2 words] fluid dynamic interactions has       uncovered crucial performance gains that contributed directly to       widespread British sporting success in all the Olympic games from 2008       onwards, raising the international profile of British engineering       excellence and helping inspire greater public interest in sport.
Dr's Wright and Prince are founding member's of British Cycling's (BC)       `secret squirrel club ' and led the wind tunnel testing recommending       changes that achieved significant performance gains when first rolled out       in 2008 and then again in a more challenging 2012 Olympics.
BC's       Brailsford stating `We have done a huge amount of work with the wind         tunnel in Southampton and have come up with some cool stuff'       [5.1,5.2].
BC won 14 gold medals in 11 days of Olympic competition in 2008       and 2012.
BC Head of Research and Development praised Southampton [5.3]       for 'Their world leading experimental capabilities, innovation and         technical expertise in the area of cycling aerodynamics and engineering         are outstanding `.

PSEL research informed the design, by two of Turnock's doctoral students       of `Arthur', the sled used by skeleton racer Amy Williams in the 2010       Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
The sled and the students' use of the wind       tunnel was the major contributing factor to Williams becoming the first       British individual gold medallist at a Winter Games for 30 years [5.5].
Research techniques honed through PSEL's expertise in maritime       engineering underpinned the design of the systems used to test 38 of the       45-strong British Swimming team for London 2012.

British Swimming's lead technical advisor, ex.
World Champion Jonty       Skinner confirmed that `its really educated people' [5.6].
Similar       interventions by PSEL in a diverse range of sports including sailing,       rowing, and kayaking made contributions to sports that helped win 34       Olympic Gold medals in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 games.

All of PSEL's work with elite British Olympic athletes came under an       "innovation partnership" with UK Sport.
In 2012 PSEL was awarded a       prestigious Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education,       prompting Dr Scott Drawer, UKSport's Head of Research and Innovation to       describe PSEL's work as `critical'[5.7, 5.8] and that `I wish to         congratulate the University of Southampton for the fantastic work they         have done in the field of sports engineering, in particular with our         Olympic athletes' [5.8].
British Olympic success led to global media coverage of PSEL's       engineering expertise [5.9, 5.10], reaching both NBC in the USA and       Russian TV enhancing the reputation of British engineering at home and       overseas.
The design of Amy Williams' skeleton sled in the aftermath of       her victory in 2010 followed the world's press interview of Blackburn at       Williams's post-race press conference[5.11-5.14].
In 2012, media coverage       of the swimming research [5.9, 5.10] had reached an estimated audience of       3.5 million people worldwide.
This positive publicity serves to attract UK       school students to study engineering at university with typically 50% of       Southampton's Mechanical, Aerospace and Ship Science UCAS applicants       citing Formula 1, sailing and cycling as motivations for applying.
Through       his links with PSEL Olympian of 2004 and now cycling commentator, Chris       Boardman gave an inspirational lecture at the University in May 2012 to       300 17-year-olds from schools less likely to send students to university.
Longstanding research at Southampton has upheld the outstanding       reputation of British engineering in the worlds of sailing and motorsport,       benefiting the UK economy.
The research engineers at the WU (Claughton,       Prince, Wright, Scarponi) provide consultancy services worldwide,       achieving a turnover of [redact 1 word] from 2008 to 2013.
They optimised       the sloop Kokomo, which in 2010 won the award for best sailing       superyacht at the International Superyacht Society awards.
In 2009, the       engineers contributed to the successes of the top three finishers in the       Jacques Vabre transatlantic race and assisted the Challengers, Defender       and Race Management in the run-up to the 34th America's Cup in       2013.
The University supplies the sailing and motorsport industries with       high-quality graduates.
There are 40,000 skilled jobs in the UK motor       sport industry and its supporting industries, including 25,000 engineers,       with a turnover of &#163;7 bn per year.
A UoS graduate [5.15] leads the Red       Bull racing team that won the F1 championship in 2010, 2011 and 2012       states `The University of Southampton continues to produce graduates of         the highest quality that are amongst the best new young talent coming         into this highly competitive industry'.
And.
`I recognise the         quality of Southampton's engineering graduates, the facilities provided,         the broad and the world-leading research undertaken by your academics in         areas related to aerodynamics and performance'.
