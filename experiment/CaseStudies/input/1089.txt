     The application of PODDS research has had economic impact and has       promoted efficient and effective asset management.
It has also had an       impact on policy and practice within the water sector.
The impact is based       on a fundamentally new concept to describe the processes of discolouration       in drinking water distribution systems, together with the delivery of       operational management tools.
The impact of the research has been well       appreciated by [text removed for publication], as evidenced by the       following quotes:     "...the conceptual approach and resulting tools and techniques from         the discolouration research from the University of Sheffield have         contributed to a step change in culture and practice in the [text         removed for publication]" [S1, [text removed for publication]].
"...provide testimonial to the impact of the University of Sheffield         discolouration research... ranging from a shift in general perception of         the processes and mechanisms involved to full scale adoption of the         PODDS modelling approaches and tools.
Impacts from day to day         operational practice and the on-ground to long term strategic.
Improvements to overall levels of customer service and serviceability         levels, leading to reduced levels of discolouration contacts.
Improvements to operational efficiencies.
Particularly evident through         application of PODDS for trunk main applications."

Process:     Delivering impact from PODDS has been a long process, but has been a key       ambition from the outset.
Organisations in the water sector have been       actively engaged with a view to influencing both policy and practice,       including running bespoke dissemination and training events.
Notably in       2004 and 2007 invited presentations were made at UK Water Industry       Research (UKWIR) technology transfer workshops.
The former was       instrumental in gaining UK water supply sector support, the latter to set       best practice standards for inclusion in Distribution Operation and       Maintenance Strategies submissions in water company Asset Management Plans       2009.
Perhaps the single most influential factor in ensuring impact has       been the strategy for, and success of, industry consortium funding.
This       has ensured the generation of knowledge, tools and techniques that are       practicably applicable and include wide spread programmes of fieldwork for       validation.
Impact on practice and policy:     The PODDS concept, tools and techniques feature in the majority of water       companies `Distribution Operation and Maintenance Strategies', submitted       as part of their 5 year Asset Management Plans to OFWAT.
These sensitive       strategy documents are highly confidential and hence cannot be directly       referred to here [S1], however:     "PODDS research has had an impact on all Distribution and Operation         Maintenance Strategies (DOMS) and Asset Management Plan (AMP) documents"       [S1, [text removed for publication]].
This indicates that there has been a consequential change in culture,       planning and practice.
Engineering consultancy companies use PODDS to       facilitate the design and planning of operational and maintenance       activities and for strategic asset management planning.
For example [S2]       provides exemplar evidence of the use of PODDS modelling by [text removed       for publication] to help [text removed for publication] provide resilient       supply options following the flood risk to [text removed for publication]       when 350,000 customers were without mains water supplies for up to ten       days.
"Application of PODDS-style strategies, typically by controlled flow         increases, enables networks to remain operational thereby minimising         both operational costs and discolouration risk" [S2]     [S3] provides evidence of the development and review of a strategic       discolouration investment model by [text removed for publication] also for       [text removed for publication].
[S3] is based on the PODDS concepts, with       Boxall acting as a consultant.
Commercial software used to model distribution networks has also been       impacted.
For example Infoworks&#174;, one of the most used       commercial packages in the international water industry, now calculates       and provides shear stress as per the PODDS model [S4].
When substantial undertakings with potential water quality implications       are necessary, or when `major' events occur, water companies are required       to report to the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI),demonstrating planning       and due diligence.
PODDS has been a feature in such reports since 2005.
[S5] provides an example of the use of PODDS modelling to defend and       explain a recent major discolouration incident occurring in [text removed       for publication] to the DWI; 760 discolouration contacts were received       over three days, covering an area of approximately 60 square kilometres.
Initially such application of PODDS research was directly facilitated by       the researcher team.
However, the knowledge and tools, with support from       bespoke training given by the PODDS research group, are now embedded       within water companies.
PODDS has become part of the usual business       process within many water companies [S1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
[S6] provides an       example of the use of PODDS modelling and fieldwork (using PODDS based       equipment) by [text removed for publication] modelling team to plan major       trunk main operational activities.
This work forms the basis of reports to       the DWI for undertakings relating to 20 particularly strategically       important and high risk trunk mains.
"PODDS model was initially run so that the operational conditioned         state of the system could be determined.... Modelled discolouration         responses were then produced" [S6].
Economic impact:     One of the few examples where a water company, Wessex Water, has been       able to make monetary saving figures available shows immediate one-off       saving of &#163;0.6M on two schemes; one with an initial estimated cost of over       &#163;1M, a 63% saving, and one where an estimated spend of &#163;2M was deferred       indefinitely by operations costing only &#163;0.04M [S7].
The 4, 7 and 6 km       lengths of the trunk mains in these examples represent a tiny percentage       of the trunk main in Wessex Water.
Extrapolation of the values suggests       multi million pound savings as well as service improvements and risk       reduction [S7].
These figures relate solely to large trunk mains; economic       impacts associated with local distribution infrastructure are       un-quantified.
Equivalent savings and benefits are being made by other       PODDS consortium member companies and beyond [S1, 7, 8, 9].
"PODDS has changed the way Wessex Water thinks about managing the risk         of discoloured water... providing alternative cost effective options..."       [S7]     "...led to a fundamental change in the way [text removed for         publication] understands and now operates our strategic and distribution         networks in relation to the identification of risk and, therefore,         prevention of discoloured water... a key business and regulatory         driver... a key measure of the quality of service we deliver to our         customers" [S8]     "PODDS theory has also created a change in mind-set in our asset         strategy...directly supports the delivery of OFWATS serviceability         targets..." [S9]     The UK water sector is widely regarded as internationally leading and       customer focused due to its privatised nature, as recognised by [text       removed for publication].
"[text removed for publication] are internationally leading and I am         aware of international interest in and impact from the research from         countries as diverse as the Netherlands to China" [S1, [text removed for publication]].
The adoption of PODDS concepts can be viewed as a critical factor in       helping water companies improve the service they provide to customers, by       ensuring water is clean and safe to drink.
The extent and scope of       adoption of the PODDS concepts, and the implementation of tools and       management approaches that use the approach, has been a key factor in       ensuring that the quality of this essential service is delivered at least       cost.
Over the five year water industry review period since 2006 the       number of consumers contacting their water supplier to report a problem       with the quality of drinking water, comprising 80% discolouration issues,       in their home or workplace has fallen by one- third [S10].
While many       factors contribute to this reduction, PODDS is recognised as one of the       most influential factors, through its widespread application and inclusion       in water company Distribution Operation and Maintenance Strategies.
