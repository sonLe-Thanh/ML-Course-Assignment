     2,000 Blackfoot Elders, ceremonialists, teachers, and youth (c.5% of a       tribal population of       approximately 42,000), and over 50,000 museum professionals and visitors       in Alberta and across       the UK, benefited from project impacts.
Impacts derive from knowledge       about Blackfoot culture       transmitted as the result of research activity (a) within Blackfoot       communities and (b) from       Blackfoot people to museum professionals and visitors.
What is important       about the impact is not       simply the numbers of people who participated in the project, but the fact       that the project activity       was the first of its kind, enabled access to early heritage objects after       a century of their absence,       encouraged change in museum procedures and policies to facilitate future       projects involving object       handling, and that Blackfoot perspectives were communicated to over 50,000       non-Blackfoot       museum visitors (via exhibitions) and to museum staff from all major UK       museums with Blackfoot       collections (via the conference).
Impacts on Blackfoot people     47 handling sessions with heritage objects were arranged across all four       Blackfoot communities,       involving 500 people.
None of these individuals had ever seen, much less       touched, pre-1850       heritage items before these workshops: there are few early objects in       regional museums.
The       provocation of touch and the presence of iconic heritage objects (also       understood as ancestors)       enabled participants to share with each other knowledge about Blackfoot       history, arts, rituals, and       social practices.
Given the assimilation policies from 1885-1970, which       fostered the removal of       heritage objects to museums, such knowledge is held patchily across       Blackfoot society, and       traditional arts (quillwork, tanning) are endangered.
Handling sessions       facilitated learning about       heritage, affirmation of narratives of shared history, confirmation and       dissemination of cultural       knowledge&#8212;thereby strengthening personal identity and well-being, and       increasing social       cohesion among participants.
[C1-C5 in section 5] That such       reconnections and strengthening       processes happened at all after a century of absence of such objects, and       were felt by participants       to have profoundly important results, was highly significant and symbolic       to Blackfoot people.
Youth: all four Blackfoot-run high schools, and both Blackfoot         community colleges,         participated in the handling sessions.
For youth, touching `the real         thing' during these         sessions prompted engagement with traditional arts, discussion of values         and gender roles,         and pride in heritage.
[C1(Whitford interview),C2,C3,C4] The         development of associated         educational programmes teaching tanning and quillwork to high-school and         college classes         [C3,C6] has contributed to the survival of these endangered arts         and further strengthened         Blackfoot culture: these associated programmes involved c.1500 students,         approx.
50% of         students in each Blackfoot school as well as students from four urban         schools with         Blackfoot student enrolment.
All ten (100%) Blackfoot primary and         secondary schools used         posters and the project website for their own art projects (ongoing work         2010-13).
Blackfoot         community colleges developed courses and video lectures, 2010-13 (c.80         students in 2         community colleges).
The shirts have also become a focus for degree         credit courses at         Blackfoot community colleges.
[C4] In communities with high         unemployment, low         educational levels, and high rates of mental health issues, students         were inspired to         continue higher education: "It was like a life-changing event... made me         want to further my         education, and to research First Nations archives and I may someday be         the head of a First         Nations museum!"
(follow-up interview with college student, handling         session participant).
[see also C2 (same individual); C5, p.147]         Adults expressed grief at cultural loss and determination to         preserve culture.
In a follow-up         interview, Robert Rides, a Blackfoot participant stated: "These war         shirts, they stimulate the         memory that some of our people have put away in a closet and closed the         door on."
As         indigenous scholar Sherry Farrell Racette (2008, p. 60) notes, "The         process of rediscovery         and recovery [from colonization] includes work with museum collections."
This addresses         psycho-social problems stemming from unresolved grief from historical         events.
Shared         affirmations of grief and determination to retain culture supported         strengthened identity and         relationships.
[C5, esp.
pp.
143-5]         All participants: the project prompted an unusual level of         discussion about cultural heritage         amongst community members from different families who otherwise seldom         interact.
Access to ceremonial leaders with specialist knowledge about culture and         history was         increased (especially important for families affected hardest by         residential school);         collective historical experience was affirmed (in opposition to         mainstream historical         narratives);[C1, Pard interview] and participants experienced         life-enhancing inspiration         (e.g.
students deciding to become museum curators, artists deciding to         focus on Blackfoot-         only designs in their work).
All of these benefits strengthened social         relationships,         community cohesion, and Blackfoot identity.
[C1-C6]         Ceremonial revival: Contact with shirts resulted in Blackfoot         people reviving a ceremony to         transfer the right to own sacred shirts after decades of dormancy         following colonial         suppression in 1920.
Such processes of reclamation also fulfil the         purpose of moving from         mourning to action in decolonization.
Two ceremonies to transfer the         right to own hairlock         shirts were held in the Galt Museum (June 2010), with c.175         participants.
This stimulated         significant interest in further ceremonies by the wider Blackfoot         population.
[C3,C5]           Impacts on museum professionals and museum audiences     Through (a) three public exhibitions in both the UK and Alberta (at the       Glenbow and Galt       Museums, April-Sept 2010, and the PRM, Feb-Sept 2013 (with total visitor       numbers of over       50,000); (b) the Blackfoot Shirts Project Conference, March 2011, Oxford       (involving Blackfoot       people, UK museum professionals, and postgraduates); and (c) the 'Making       Museums' award-winning       (UK national Clore Award for Museum Learning, 2010) schools event at the       PRM (Feb-March       2010), involving 300 schoolchildren.
Through these opportunities,       Blackfoot knowledge,       culture, and perspectives were shared with museum staff and public       audiences, resulting in       considerable impacts, including:             The development of new techniques for the conservation of         porcupine quills and hide in         preparing fragile objects for handling; and the development of new ways         of facilitating         handling sessions with fragile objects.
[C7]         Museum professional training: the UK conference involved 12         Blackfoot people and 15         curators and conservators from 10 UK museums with Blackfoot collections,         enabled the         dissemination of cultural perspectives and knowledge gained from the         research and         influenced museum policy and procedures nationally,[C7,C8,C9] as         demonstrated by the         Senior Organics Conservator, National Museums Liverpool, who stated in         an email         following the conference: "It will certainly impact on my approach to         all First Nations         material but also gives me pause for thought about the potential for         engagement with all of         our collections by relevant communities locally as well as worldwide."
The project was used as a national model for UK museum         engagement with source         communities in the Museums Association's `MUSEUMS CHANGE LIVES'         campaign.
This         is the UK national Museums Association's forward plan `for the increased         social impact of         museums' on society.
[C9] It has also led to a follow-on         Leverhulme-funded project bringing         Blackfoot people together with museum collections at Cambridge and         Exeter, and further         training of museum staff.
Thus it generated relationships which led to         further research and         motivated museums in the UK to better care for and interpret their         collections.
Visitor feedback: There was an unusual amount of positive         visitor feedback on the         exhibitions, e.g.
: "Reading and looking and listening to the story of         these shirts returning to         the Blackfoot community almost brought me to tears.
This is a wonderful         project and I hope         inspires many similar connections with the peoples and cultures that the         objects in         museums like Pitt Rivers represent.
