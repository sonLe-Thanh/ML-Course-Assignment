     Dickens     In 2012 Pulham, Boyce and Rousselot adapted their research to exploit the       cultural capital of the       Dickens bicentenary, expanding the region's awareness of Portsmouth's       significance in his life and       writings.
Drawing on Dickens's work and their own research, they prompted       recognition of       marginalised groups (both Victorian and contemporary) using accessible       publications and       websites, as well as a series of public talks and events to promote public       engagement:     Pulham (with historian Brad Beaven) used local archives to produce:             Dickens and the Victorian City (2012), a booklet sold in the         museum shop and other outlets         including Amazon.co.uk.

Launched in July         2012 (1892 unique visitors from Dec 31 2011-July 31 2013).
Pulham , Boyce, and Rousselot arranged a series of public events which       included:            `Literature Caf&#233; (Dickens talks at a local venue: March, April and May         2012 respectively)       `Afterlives: Mrs Dickens in Fact and Fiction' (6 July 2012), an `in         conversation' event with         authors Lillian Nayder and Gaynor Arnold [90 attendees]       A performance of Dickens' Women by Miriam Margolyes (8 July         2012), in collaboration with         the Portsmouth Grammar School [300 attendees].
Introductions to a series of Dickens adaptations screened at a local         cinema (2May, 16May,         13 June, 30 Nov. 2012), in association with the Portsmouth         Film Society; final screening:         Scrooge (1951) held to raise funds for the CRISIS Christmas         appeal, resulting in a         donation of &#163;96.32 [overall number of attendees at screenings: 187] .
These events engaged the public and promoted understanding of important       Victorian issues such       as patriarchy and poverty.
Feedback obtained at the Dickens' Women       event indicates that the       performance encouraged the audience to revisit the writer's work.
Comments       include: `Inspired to       read more Dickens', `inspired me to see Dickens' writing in a new light'.
Feedback collected at the       Scrooge screening showed that many audience members had also       attended other Dickens events       we organised, and showed a similar reconsideration of the author, as the       following comments       demonstrate: `I have learnt a lot of things I didn't know about Dickens',       `greater enjoyment of       Dickens', `very inspired' and `it's made me want to find out more on the       Victorian period'.
Tennyson       Exploiting their research on Victorian celebrity culture and its       transatlantic reach, Boyce and       Finnerty have rebranded Freshwater as a hub of nineteenth-century cultural       activity, inhabited by       figures such as Tennyson, Julia Margaret Cameron and Lewis Carroll.
Boyce       and Finnerty       collaborated with Farringford House, the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust       (JMCT) and Dimbola       Lodge Museum, the Tennyson Society and the Local Studies Library, Isle of       Wight to promote the       region's cultural heritage and produce artefacts to develop regional,       national, and international       public engagement including:             Tennyson's Celebrity Circle (2011), an accessible guide aimed         at a general readership,         sold online, at Dimbola Lodge Museum, Freshwater Post Office, the Watts         Gallery, Surrey,         and the Tennyson Research Centre, Lincoln.
An online multimedia interactive map of Freshwater launched June 2012         (www.tennysonscelebritycircle.port.ac.uk)         (2518 unique visitors from Dec 31 2011 - July         31 2013).
On the basis of their research Boyce and Finnerty were asked to become       advisers to the JMCT       and the West Wight Partnership, resulting in the following changes and       initiatives:            Consultation on the conversion of their interactive map into a new         tourist trail and         associated leaflet, sponsored by the West Wight Partnership.
The Dimbola Lodge caf&#233; has been renamed `The Mad Hatter at Julia's         Tearoom', exploiting         the connection with Lewis Carroll;       A two-part exhibition, `The Wonderland of Alice' (2013) has been         mounted, aimed at         enhancing the museum's appeal to families;       A board member of the JMCT writes a regular blog in which the impact         of Finnerty and         Boyce's research has been discussed, and she has published a book         inspired by the         research: Gail Middleton, The Freshwater Circle Through the Looking           Glass (Tricorn         Books, 2013);       The celebrity angle has inspired a contemporary exhibition, e.g.
`She         Bop-a-Lula' (June-         Sept 2013, portraits of contemporary female celebrities);       Special events such as the `Celebrity Circle Walk and Tour' (22 June         2013), at which Boyce         and Finnerty gave a lecture, have been organised.
Boyce and Finnerty's research has been instrumental in encouraging the       region's re-engagement       with its Victorian Literary Heritage and has enhanced the area's touristic       value.
Publicly available       resources (such as the booklet, website, and map) have been vital in       raising awareness of the Isle       of Wight's cultural significance, and in sustaining public involvement.
In       addition their research has       influenced the JMCT's activities, prompting them to expand the focus of       Dimbola Lodge Museum's       events, helping them to exploit the commercial value of Tennyson's       celebrity circle, and to adapt its       significance for contemporary visitors.
