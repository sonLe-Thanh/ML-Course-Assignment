     This case study illustrates how the research of the Explosion and Fire       Research Team (EFRT) has benefitted the UK's leading nuclear       decommissioning and reprocessing company, Sellafield Ltd, through the       provision of technical expertise and knowledge that has enabled the       Company to manage effectively aspects of its decommissioning operations       where potential hydrogen explosion hazards may exist.
Nuclear plants pose many challenges in relation to hydrogen safety.
An       uncontrolled release of hydrogen (generated through radiolysis and       corrosion) in a plant enclosure with a suitable ignition source could       result in an explosion with potential loss of human life, significant       infrastructural damage and environmental impact due to radioactive       contamination, for example, as occurred at Fukushima in 2012.
In this context, Sellafield Ltd (formerly British Nuclear Fuels Ltd), the       UK's pre-eminent nuclear decommissioning and reprocessing company,       approached the ERFT (1999) because of their modelling and experimental       expertise in the area of Flammable Gas explosions.
In recognition of the potential safety risks associated with hydrogen in       its decommissioning and reprocessing operations, Sellafield established a       Hydrogen Working Party in 1995 with overall responsibility for the       technical guidance and advice on hydrogen safety matters to all Sellafield       sites and its accountability to government regulatory agencies.
The       research of the EFRT has, and continues to make, a major contribution to       the scientific understanding, direction and activities of the Hydrogen       Working Party (HWP).
The HWP has met over 100 times in total, including 34       times since 1 January 2008.
It is made up of Sellafield plant safety and       design managers and engineers with Professor Nolan and Dr Steve Graham       (National Nuclear Laboratory) as the only two external members of the HWP.
Nolan remains the only formal academic representative on the HWP, and       other members of the EFRT attend on a regular basis to present on specific       matters.
In this context, EFRT staff were the primary authors of Sellafield's       Hydrogen Technical Guide (HTG), first issued in 2002, which continues to       be expanded and updated on the basis of the latest research findings by       the EFRT, for example, with a guide to the assessment of ignition       probability carried out since 2008 [1-3].
The HTG remains the Company's       standard for the management of hydrogen safety and is applicable to all       existing and new facilities.
The HTG also provides the national regulator       (Office for Nuclear Regulation) with the necessary assurances that       Sellafield can manage its hydrogen safety affairs effectively and with       confidence; even a minor incident can result in a plant shutdown with       significant cost implications.
Key areas of impact that EFRT staff have contributed to through their       involvement with the HWP and the HTG since 2008, are:            Ignition and flammability research applied to Sellafield's Magnox         Swarf Storage Silo (MSSS) [4] retrieval project (2010): The EFRT         research provided the HWP with greater understanding of (i) the effects         of partial inerting/flammable limits on ignition; (ii) interpreting and         applying international inerting standards to develop an operable         ventilation design; (iii) mechanical ignition mechanisms and developing         probability assessments; and (iv) hydrogen release and dispersion         mechanisms from the waste in MSSS.
The savings involved in installation         and operating costs over the proposed fully inerted system and through         an earlier start/quicker retrieval programme is estimated by Sellafield         to be greater than &#163;500 million [5].
Ignition probability applied to Sellafield's Silo Direct Encapsulation         Plant [6] (2010): The EFRT's work provided a detailed understanding of         all ignition mechanisms and developing probability assessment associated         with this plant.
The saving to the Company is estimated to be greater         than &#163;50 million through reduced engineering requirements [5].
Benefits to other projects since 2008, including: (i) the development         of a safety case to allow the floc retrieval process to continue         following submersible pump blockage; (ii) development of a safe method         for sludge header closed pipe flange removal; (iii) a flask passive         ventilation design; (iv) a hydrogen instruments engineering standard;         (v) a strategy for sealed ion exchange cartridge hydrogen management,         and (vi) allowing the feasibility of employing water mist explosion         mitigation strategies on the MSSS plant to be evaluated [7].
Collectively, these projects are estimated to have saved Sellafield in         excess of &#163;100K through allowing alternative less costly options to be         developed and justified [5].
The HTG is widely used internally within Sellafield Ltd, with         approximately 60% of the 10,000 staff regularly referring to the Guide         to successfully deliver work, including safety assessments, new         engineering projects and project planning.
The HTG has been used as the         core of over 100,000 man-hours training and CPD on hydrogen hazard since         2008 [5].
A senior member of the Flammable Gas Centre of Expertise at Sellafield         Ltd referred to the HTG as "The Bible", and has confirmed that the HTG         has attracted interest from the Department of Energy in the US [8] where         no equivalent exists [5].
The investment in contract research made by Sellafield in the above       research carried out by the EFRT since 2008 has been just over &#163;1M.
In       2011, Sellafield selected and now sponsor the EFRT as its Centre for       Expertise in Flammable Gases under a 5 year contract worth &#163;500k.
The EFRT       also continue to receive contract research commissions from individual       plants at Sellafield for specific issues.
