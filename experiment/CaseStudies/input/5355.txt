     Impacts include: health and welfare, public policy and service       Main Beneficiaries include: public, government and public policy makers     Since the publication of WHO recommendations and guidelines on sodium       intake in 2003 (as part       of WHO Technical Report Series 916) and 2007 (Prevention of         Cardiovascular Disease), Imperial       College researchers and others have published a significant body of       scientific evidence concerning       sodium intakes in adults and children worldwide (research ref.
6), and the       associated risks of high       blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.
In response to the new       research, Member States and       international partners requested WHO to review the guidelines on sodium       intake for adults, and       also for the first time to generate a guideline on sodium intake for       children.
At the same time,       guidelines for potassium intakes for adults and children were requested as       there were none       previously.
The 2012 WHO guidelines [1, 2] have set the world standards on sodium and       potassium intakes in       both adults and children, and are a template being used by governments,       policy makers and       industry for reductions in sodium and increases in potassium intakes       worldwide [3, 4].
Both       guidelines cite Imperial College-led research.
The guidelines recommend a       reduction in sodium       intake to &lt;2 g/day sodium (5 g/day salt) in adults to reduce the       worldwide burden of high blood       pressure, heart disease and stroke, and a reduction in sodium intake to       control blood pressure in       children (intake to be based on the energy requirements of children       relative to those of adults) [1].
For potassium, WHO recommends an increase in potassium intake from food to       reduce blood       pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart       disease in adults with a       suggested potassium intake of at least 90 mmol/day (3510 mg/day); and an       increase in potassium       intake from food to control blood pressure in children (intake to be based       on the energy       requirements of children relative to those of adults) [2].
As noted in section 2, the WHO guidelines were developed by the Nutrition       Guidance Expert       Advisory Group (NUGAG) Subgroup on Diet and Health (Geneva, March 2011 and       Seoul,       November 2011) with substantial intellectual input from Professor Elliott       and other subject-matter       experts, using the WHO evidence-informed guideline development procedures       and the Grading of       Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.
The guidelines       drew on results of systematic reviews and meta-analyses undertaken by WHO       staff and their       consultants working with the subject matter experts, including Professor       Elliott.
Meetings of       NUGAG and its subject-matter experts including Professor Elliott were held       to agree on study       design and inclusion/exclusion criteria for the supporting meta-analyses,       which were subsequently       published in the peer-reviewed literature (research refs.
4, 5).
These       publications in BMJ (2013)       provided the science-base for both guidelines; as noted in the BMJ       papers "WHO agreed with the         publication of this systematic review in a scientific journal as it         serves as the background evidence         review for updating the WHO guideline on sodium intake for adults and         for the establishment of a         guideline on sodium intake in children [for establishing the WHO         guideline on potassium intake]         and should therefore be widely available."
The author contributions       state that Professor Elliott and       colleagues "provided substantial intellectual input on research methods         and interpretation of         results.
All authors read, provided input on, and agreed the final draft         of the manuscripts" (research       ref 4, p8; 5, p7).
WHO Member States have agreed a target 25% reduction in premature       mortality from Non-Communicable       Diseases (NCDs) by 2025 through enactment of 9 voluntary targets,       including a       global target of 30% relative reduction in mean population intake of       salt/sodium by 2025.
The       report adopting the Global Monitoring Framework and Voluntary Global         Targets for the Prevention         and Control of NCDs dated 27 May 2013, following the 2011         Political Declaration of the United         Nations High Level Meeting on NCDs, cites the WHO sodium guideline       [3; page 43] and both the       sodium and potassium guidelines as relevant WHO tools to achieve the       targets [3; page 47].
A joint       technical meeting convened by WHO and The George Institute for Global       Health was held in       Sydney, Australia, in March 2013 (attended by Professor Elliott as a       subject-matter expert and       Chair of session) to agree methods to take forward salt reduction and       iodine fortification strategies       in public health.
The report of that meeting [4] cites both the WHO sodium       and potassium       guidelines, based on the work of WHO staff, Professor Elliott and       colleagues, as key documents       "to help develop and guide national policies [on sodium and potassium]         and public health nutrition         programmes".
Imperial College-led research has also influenced US CDC efforts       underpinning the US       government strategy for monitoring population-wide sodium intakes.
Thus       our demonstration of the       use of spot urines as a valid, low-cost alternative to 24-hr urine       collections for monitoring       population sodium intakes (research ref.
6) has had impact on the US CDC       approach to use of       biomarkers for monitoring sodium intakes in the US population [5, page 13;       6].
INTERMAP and       INTERSALT are cited by CDC as being among the top ten resources on sodium       reduction and       biomarkers [5, page 14 and 15].
CDC's own research using INTERSALT       equations developed by       Imperial College (research ref.
6) concludes "[INTERSALT] equations         could be used with a single         spot urine specimen to monitor temporal trends in population mean sodium         intake among young         US adults... as part of a national surveillance system critical to         evaluating US efforts to reduce         sodium intake" [6].
CDC is now taking this forward in its approach       to evaluating sodium intakes in       the US population.
Specifically it is using spot urines collected in the       National Health and Nutrition       Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine trends over time in sodium intakes       in the US adult       population [7].
