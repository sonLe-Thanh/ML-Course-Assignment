     The deployment of the SAI&#169; (led jointly by Hope at the University of       Portsmouth and Gabbert at the University of Abertay) has had a significant       impact on the policy and operational activities of several UK and overseas       police forces.
The SAI&#169; and research underpinning its development, use and       efficacy have been incorporated into investigative training for police and       other law enforcement agencies in the UK, US, Europe and Australia.
Implementation of Policy       Since 2009 [9], continued evaluation and implementation of the SAI&#169; with       witnesses in UK and international police forces has established that SAI&#169;       provides both practical and evidential benefits to the police during       investigations [8].
End-user evaluation has demonstrated that the SAI&#169; can       be used simply and efficiently with minimal demand on resources, to obtain       high quality information from victims and witnesses [1-4, 6, 8].
This has       led to policy change with respect to (i) training, (ii) day-to-day       investigative practice and (iii) operational mandates for major incidents.
For example, the SAI&#169; has been adopted by Greater Manchester Police (GMP)       and forms part of their major incident policy [1].
The SAI&#169; also formed       part of the North East Counter-Terrorism unit response strategy for mass       witness/terrorist scenarios during the 2012 Olympics [e.g.
South Yorkshire       Police, see 8].
Improved Cost Effectiveness of Public Service       While research focused on the memorial impact of implementing the SAI&#169;,       end-users have identified significant cost savings and resource       efficiencies associated with the use of the tool in a number of major       incidents.
For example, earlier this year (2013) GMP noted an actual       saving of &#163;600 on a fatal traffic incident and project potential savings       of &#163;228,069 per annum based on an analysis of similar incidents [1].
Similarly, South Yorkshire police calculated savings between &#163;12,739 and       &#163;88,602 on a recent major two-year long enquiry (2011-2013) [4].
Incorporation into Professional Training.
Since 2009, the UK-based research team have jointly delivered over 20       training sessions relating to the SAI&#169; and its underpinning psychological       research principles for police forces in the UK and internationally,       including at the European police training college, CEPOL (2011 &amp;       2012).
Furthermore, the SAI&#169; has been incorporated into investigator       training in the UK, US, Norway, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia [see       1, 2, 3, 6, 8].
Over 1,000 officers in Greater Manchester Police [1], over       500 in the Netherlands [3], and approximately 1,500 Norwegian police       officers [2] have received training in the SAI&#169;.
Changes in Law Enforcement Practice.
In 2012, the original programme of research, and subsequent knowledge       transfer [c], was highlighted as a successful example of impact in the UK       context in an External Evaluation Report of case studies commissioned by       the Economic and Social Research Council [5].
The SAI&#169; is currently       approved for use in five UK forces and two international forces and is       under evaluation in approximately eight other UK and six international       police forces.
To date, use of the SAI&#169; has made an important contribution       to a number of live investigations of incidents including serious       road-traffic incidents, violent assaults, robberies and shootings [see 1,       2, 3, 6, 8].
As such, our research has been used by professionals in their       work and the SAI&#169; has led to important changes in practice (several Case       Studies are outlined in Hope, Gabbert &amp; Fisher, 2011; also [8]) by       providing detailed initial accounts, enabling the efficient prioritisation       of witnesses, and facilitating the identification of additional witnesses.
Legal professionals have noted that use of the SAI&#169; addresses a number of       legal concerns relating to eyewitness accounts [e.g.
facilitating accounts       in the witness's own words; see Hope, L., Gabbert, F.,       Heaton-Armstrong, A., &amp; Wolchover, D. (2012).
The Self-Administered       Witness Interview.
Criminal Law and Justice Weekly, 177).
The       international reach of the SAI&#169; in operational settings is evidenced by       invited publications in practitioner outlets (e.g.
Hope, L., &amp;       Gabbert, F. (2013).
Capturing Eyewitness Testimony using the       Self-Administered Interview.
Home Team Journal, Official Publication         of the Singapore Police).
Wider Applications and Societal Benefit       Field evaluations have also generated support from charities concerned       with the delivery of justice for victims.
For instance since 2010       RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, has been actively       campaigning for the SAI&#169; to be standard procedure for obtaining evidence       relating to road-traffic-accidents [7].
We have also written for this       sector in an invited submission to the Journal of the Institute of Traffic       Accident Investigators (Hope, L. &amp; Gabbert, F. (2011).
Protecting       Eyewitness Evidence: What can the Self Administered Interview (SAI&#169;)       contribute to the investigation of road traffic incidents?
Impact, 19,       15-18).
Commercial Development for Industrial Accident Investigation       The success of the SAI&#169; in domestic policing contexts has led to the       development of the Self-Administered Witness Interview Tool (SAW-IT&#174;) for       use in the investigation of industrial accidents.
This tool has been       available for licensing through commercial partnership with a UK /New       Zealand-based company since May 2013 [10].
