     Farndale's triple-helical peptides and peptide toolkits have been in       continuous demand since their       first publication, ie from 1995 and 2006 respectively.
They have been       synthesized and distributed       widely by Farndale to industry and hospitals for diagnostic development       and drug-discovery,       leading to the following impacts:     Impact on health and well-being:     Healthcare guidelines     Since the discovery of CRP by Farndale, CRP is included as one of the new       extended panel of       platelet agonists for the diagnosis of rare platelet defects using light       transmission aggregometry in       the BCSH "Guidelines for the Laboratory Investigation of Heritable       Disorders of Platelet Function"       of August 2011 (Ref.
1, Section 5).
Diagnostics     A CRP-peptide (CRP-18/i) has been included as a platelet agonist to         activate GPVI in a Phase 4       clinical trial, sponsored by Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, and       completed in 2010, on       platelet function in diabetic patients (NCT01035320)       (Ref.
2, Section 5).
Using CRP-XL from the Farndale lab the University Medical Center Utrecht,       NL, have developed a       novel platelet activation test that uses anticoagulated unprocessed       blood to determine platelet       function, which has now been tested in blood of thrombocytopenic patients       (Ref.
3, Section 5).
A number of hospitals are using CRP in routine evaluations of patients       with bleeding disorders: At       the University Hospital Linkoping, Sweden, CRP is included in the flow         cytometry protocol for       patients' blood samples; this is most important because collagen       preparations do not work in flow       cytometry.
Since 2008 50 patients have been tested per year.
Both at the University Hospital Vienna (Panzer et al), and at the       Department of Cardiovascular       Sciences, KU Leuven (Freson et al), patients with a GPVI mutation that       explains a history of       bleedings were identified using CRP.
In Vienna, CRP has also been used       successfully to assess       the responsiveness of platelets that were induced by treating patients       with chronic immune       thrombocytopenia with Eltrombopag, a recently FDA approved medication for       these patients (Ref.
4, Section 5).
The company BioData Corp sells CRP as a diagnostic reagent (see also Impact         on Commerce,       Ref.
11, Section 5).
Drug development     Portola Pharmaceuticals (San Francisco, US) have used peptides from the       Farndale lab in the       development of a novel assay to monitor the pharmacodynamic activities         of novel platelet inhibitors       for in-house drug development (Ref.
5, Section 5).
The biopharmaceuticals company Trigen Holdings AG purchased CRP-XL       material from the       Farndale lab in 2006 for their drug discovery programme.
Trigen's       follow-on company,       AdvanceCor, currently conducts Phase II trials (NCT01042964) on Revacept,       a dimeric form of the       extracellular domain of GPVI, as an anti-thrombotic.
The key discoveries       on Revacept had       occurred before Trigen bought the CRP peptide from the Farndale lab;       however, the AdvanceCor       CEO testifies to the value the research findings on CRP and GPVI from the       Farndale lab have had       for the further development of the drug since 2008 (Ref.
6, Section 5).
The biopharmaceutical company Regado Biosciences (Durham, US) have used       Farndale's CRP-XL       as a tool to determine the pharmacology and specificity of some of their       preclinical platelet       receptor antagonist leads.
One of these leads, REG3, a specific GPVI       inhibitor, is planned to enter       Phase 1 clinical trials in 2014 (Ref.
7, Section 5).
Impact on commerce:     Commercial income has been generated in the University       (Ref.
8, Section 5)     a. through services provided: The Farndale lab operates a small       Research Facility, which produces       and distributes specific peptides to the academic and commercial research       community worldwide.
The major products are CRP, GFOGER and related sequences, and Collagen       Toolkits.
Since 2008       &#163;137k of income has been generated through the sale of the above peptides       by this facility.
b. through consultancy: Farndale has non-exclusive consultancy       contracts with the companies       Biokit (Barcelona) and Diagnostica Stago (Paris), acting as an advisor for       the development of an       assay for a VWF diagnostic kit.
Since 2008 over &#163;20k has been generated       through this       consultancy work.
c. through licensing of patents: The key OSCAR-binding motifs were       protected with a patent       (WO2009GB02382         20091006) and licensed exclusively to NovoNordisk in 2010 for high       throughput screening and drug development, generating to date over &#163;105k       in licensing fees.
Industry has invested in R&amp;D, has adopted a new technology or           process and/or has           commercialised a new product: Development of drugs,         reagents and assays since 2008       The drug development company Portola Pharmaceuticals (San       Francisco, US) have used       Farndale's CRP peptide for research into the structure and function of GP       VI on platelets (Ref.
2,       Section 5).
The developer and distributer of clinical diagnostic systems Biokit         SA (Barcelona,       Spain) have invested into the development of an assay for VWF for the       diagnosis of the bleeding       disorder von Willebrand disease, based on the interaction between the VWF       A3 domain and a       collagen sequence identified in the Farndale lab.
They have used collagen       peptide samples       synthesised in (or commercially synthesised by CRB Billingham, UK, and       evaluated by) the       Farndale lab (Ref.
9, Section 5).
The global healthcare company Novo         Nordisk A/S (M&#229;l&#248;v,       Denmark), in collaboration with Farndale, is using peptides derived from       the Toolkit program for       characterisation of potential therapeutic targets and as a tool for       establishing CMC (Chemistry-Manufacturing-Controls) 	  assays (Ref.
10, Section 5).
The company BioData         Corp sells CRP under       the brand name Collagen SRP&#8482; (Ref.
11, Section 5).
