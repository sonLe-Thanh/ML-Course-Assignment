     The impact has been the communication of new discoveries and theories       about the structure of the universe to the public and young people beyond       the academic world.
These include (i) the discovery of the acceleration of       the universe and Barrow's research to explain it, and (ii) Barrow's work       on the evidence for very slow variations in the fine structure `constant'       of physics over billions of years and his research to describe this.
The       impacts listed are entirely the results of Professor Barrow's research and       its dissemination.
Publication of this work on the cosmological constant was the main       scientific news story of the week in Nature, online publication 23/2/11       http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110223/full/news.2011.105.html.
This quest to understand the expansion of the universe, the cosmological       constant, and the evidence changing constants of Nature has been widely       presented from 1999-2013: in talks, radio broadcasts (BBC, RAI),       interviews, newspapers (Daily Telegraph, La Repubblica) and magazines       (Standpoint, Scientific American) and books (Cosmic Imagery, 2008       and The Book of Universes, 2011).
These included 24 public       lectures in London 2008-11 during Professor Barrow's appointment as       Gresham Professor of Geometry, and his lectures at the British Science       Festival as President of the Physics-Astronomy section (2009) and of the       Mathematics section (2012).
Both Presidential Lectures (The Origin and         Evolution of the Universe and Expanding Minds and Expanding         Universes) covered Barrow's cosmological research.
Expanding         Minds and Expanding Universes was rated `excellent' by all audience       survey respondents and highlighted as `informative and entertaining' [1].
The audiences included school students, general public, teachers,       journalists, and amateur astronomers.
Barrow talked about his research at many events around the world for       paying audiences, including Hay (2011 capacity audience 500+), Frome (2012       capacity audience), Lichfield (2012), Ilkley (2011 capacity audience),       World Science Festival, New York (2009 capacity audience + online       transmission), Edinburgh (2008 capacity audience), Cambridge (2011), Genoa       (2012 capacity audience 600+), the Royal Institution London (2011 x 2),       Bath Scientific and Literary Society (2013).
Professor Barrow's BBC radio 4 appearance on In Our Time       `Mathematics and the Universe' on 11/2/10 reached 2.2 million listeners       and 30,000 online listeners [2] (it is still listened to a few hundred       times per week).
Downloads from the BBC Podcast archive occur at 24,000       per annum for this programme.
Professor Barrow is the only scientist awarded the Faraday Medal of the       Royal Society (2008), the Kelvin Medal of the IOP (2009) and the       Christopher Zeeman Medal of the LMS and the IMA (2011) for the public       communication of science, physics and mathematics.
He is the only person       since 1652 to have held two Gresham professorships in different subjects       (`Astronomy', 2003-7, and `Geometry', 2008-12).
The Italian edition of Barrow's book Cosmic Imagery received the       Merck-Serono Prize, the principal Italian literary prize for non-fiction,       July 2011, and The Book of Universes received the 2012 Antica       Pignolo Literary Prize at La Fenice, Venice, Italy in November 2012.
On 6/3/12 Barrow made a joint presentation on La Musica del Vuoto,       talk plus performance about the vacuum in cosmology and physics, its role       in explaining the acceleration of the universe and the musical analogues       of silence and timing, with the leading Italian contemporary pianist,       Ludovico Einaudi, at the Auditorium Parco Musica, Rome on 6/3/12 selling       over 1000 tickets, and over 150,000 views on the dedicated webpage [3].
Articles by Barrow and article-interviews about this research have       appeared in the online e-publication PLUS (www.plus.maths.org)       for the general public, media, teachers and age 16+ school students: A         Matter of Gravity (1/3/06 - 6647 page views) What is dark         energy?
(24/08/09 - 5287 page views), Are the constants of         Nature really constant?
(31/5/09 - 4252 page views), What         happened before the big bang?
(23/3/09 - 29,221 page views), Does         infinity exist?
(2/7/12 - 21,035 page views) [4].
The Book of Universes (2011) is translated into Hungarian,       Turkish, Italian, German, French, Chinese, Czech, Polish, US, and Japanese       and Cosmic Imagery (2008) into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Russian,       Czech, Japanese, Korean, and US [5].
Barrow's Gresham public 24-lecture series of which four were in period,       attracted capacity audiences of 240 at the Museum of London plus 11,149       online views [6].
Barrow co-authored an invited Scientific American article Inconstant         Constants about the work on varying constants in June 2005.
This was       also selected for inclusion, in extended form to take into account new       work, in a special Scientific American issue entitled `A Matter of Time',       Spring 2012 [7].
On 27/5/13 Barrow gave the two opening talks on the Cosmological         Constant at the Stockholm International Workshop for Science Writers       organised by George Musser (Senior Editor, Scientific American magazine)       to inform science writers about cosmology [8].
