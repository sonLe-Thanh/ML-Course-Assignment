     The underpinning research described above has provided the key evidence       base to inform national and international strategy on the treatment of       HIV.
Our work provided an initial understanding of the molecular basis of       drug resistance, and was pivotal to the development and implementation of       sequence-based resistance testing across the NHS, along with the       establishment of a national surveillance scheme.
With more appropriate       first-line therapy, based on individual resistance patterns, the       subsequent risk of drug failure due to resistance has been reduced,       leading to an overall reduction in resistance.
Transmitted drug resistance       in the UK has fallen from over 15% of new infections in 2000-2, to fewer       than 10% in 2007 and onwards [a] representing a reduction of 300       new infections with such resistance per year.
Our work is referenced widely in treatment guidelines around the world.
The British HIV Association recommend, based on our evidence of       significant levels of transmitted resistance, that drug resistance testing       is undertaken BEFORE initiating therapy [b] Our data represent the         first such demonstration in the UK in 2001, leading directly to a change         in national guidleines.
The International AIDS Society-USA       guidelines also cite our research and named input in support of their       recommendations on the mutational definitions of antiretroviral drug       resistance [c].
Through a linked biological-epidemiological approach to measuring drug       resistance, we have established the national surveillance structure, on       behalf of Public health England.
In 2011, we provided evidence to the       House of Lords Select Committee on HIV and AIDS, the report from which       stated; "It is essential, though, that treatment does not cause         longer-term harm.
If a person fails to stick to a regime of         antiretroviral drugs, it can lead to the development of drug resistance,         as has been seen with antibiotics.
Were such resistance to become         widespread, treatment efforts would be hampered in the long-term.
This         is closely monitored.
The United Kingdom has the largest resistance         database linked to clinical data in the world, to ensure that any         problems are quickly identified.
With no vaccine and no cure, it is         important that surveillance systems robustly monitor and contain the         risk of emerging antiretroviral resistance (see paras 227 to 228)" [d].
In 2012, UCL led a major Seminar on the "Impact of HIV drug resistance in       the resource poor world" in conjunction with the WHO in Geneva, 2012 [e].
This was the first such meeting to include both generic and proprietary       drug producers, to establish the future of rational drug treatment for the       developing world.
As a consequence, in 2013, the World Health Organisation       (WHO) changed its surveillance strategy to better guide appropriate       interventions in the developing world.
Based on our findings from the UK       population, WHO established a monitoring function, in parallel with the       rollout of antiretroviral therapy [f].
As one of five such       specialist Laboratories worldwide, we supported this monitoring.
In light       of our recent finding of an increase in transmitted drug resistance in       Eastern Africa, the WHO has altered their surveillance approach towards a       more feasible and cost-effective approach of those individuals starting       therapy.
We are currently in the vanguard of a major policy change within       the WHO regarding recommendations for first and second line therapies for       the developing world.
This will affect 35 million infected individuals,       with the likely impact being the introduction of viral quantification       monitoring to guide switch from first to second line therapy.
This is       evidenced through a joint publication with WHO (e) and reference to our       work in the 2013 revised WHO Guidelines [Chapter 7 ref 165 g].
