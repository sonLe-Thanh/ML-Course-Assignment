     Pollitt's published research led to his appointment as an external       economic advisor to Ofgem 2007-2011.
He was directly approached for the       role via Ofgem's membership of the Energy Policy Forum, a CJBS network       established to facilitate knowledge exchange between corporate members and       the Energy Policy Research Group (EPRG), of which Dr Pollitt is an       Assistant Director.
In September 2007 Dr Pollitt presented a talk on       `Regulatory electricity networks in an age of rising real prices' to the       EPRG/CEEPR (Centre for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, MIT)       London Conference.
Ofgem then commissioned research based on this       presentation (Ref 1 above).
This work became a primary reference       for the RPI-X@20 Review, which commenced in March 2008.
Pollitt's critical       assessment of the state of current regulation spurred Ofgem to action.
Ofgem's Chief Executive references the Pollitt paper in initiating the       review (Source 1).The Review investigated the best way to regulate       energy network companies to enable them to meet the challenges of       delivering the networks required for a sustainable low-carbon energy       sector.
In his March 2008 speech launching the RPI-X@20 Review, the Ofgem       CEO commented that `leading regulatory thinkers including Littlechild,         Doucet and Michael Pollitt (Ofgem's in-house consultant) have been         advocating quite different approaches to regulation recently' (Source         1).
He cites Refs 1-5 above.
The RPI-X@20 review resulted in a proposal for a new system of regulation       called RIIO - (Revenue=Incentives+Innovation+Outputs), which is now being       implemented for the regulation of electricity and gas transmission and       distribution networks.
In its Decision Document, Ofgem (Source 2)       suggests that the `RIIO framework rewards companies that innovate and         run their networks to better meet the needs of consumers and network         users.
It does this by setting longer eight-year price controls,         offering incentives focused on delivering results, and expanding by &#163;500         million the Low Carbon Network Fund to encourage the growth of smart         grids'.
Ofgem (Source 2) also describes one of the key       elements of the RIIO model as: `delivering outputs that reflect what         consumers want from energy networks and meeting the needs of a         sustainable energy sector'.
This is to be achieved by a greater       element of customer engagement with more structured use of input from the       purchasers of network services.
This picks up directly on the negotiated         settlements arguments of Pollitt and Littlechild in a low carbon       context.
Another key element of RIIO, according to Ofgem, is `having         the option to give new entrants responsibility for delivery of some         large infrastructure projects where this can help with timely and lower         cost delivery'.
In particular, there is now an explicit possibility       to competitively tender the procurement of new network assets if       distribution network companies are not seen to be competitively procuring       assets themselves.
This picks up on Pollitt (Ref 1, 2).
In Ofgem's       current thinking document of October 2009, there are references to       Pollitt's work on introducing competition into electricity distribution       network services, based on lessons from telecoms (Source 4).
During the course of the RPI-X@20 Review, Ofgem also conducted the fifth       electricity distribution price control review, to decide prices associated       with the &#163;4.5bn p.a.
of charges collected from users of the lower voltage       electricity distribution grids from April 2010.
This provided an       opportunity for the early implementation of the some of the ideas being       fed into the RPI-X@20 process.
One of these was Pollitt's recommendation (Ref         1) for a greater emphasis on large scale experimentation, in       the face of the decline in R+D which accompanied privatisation and the       increased need for innovation.
The fifth distribution price       control review (2010-2015) introduced a Low Carbon Networks Fund (LCNF),       which increased by 500% consumer funded research and development by       electricity distribution networks from &#163;20m to &#163;100m p.a.
The LCNF allows       for larger demonstration projects to trial new technologies on GB       electricity networks.
Most of these projects are decided upon via a       competitive process.
This fund has now been initiated, with most       distribution utilities setting up future networks units to bid for and       manage LCNF projects.
Ofgem is already implementing the RIIO approach in its ongoing review of       transmission price controls.
A notable feature is the emphasis on       engagement with consumers and users.
Ofgem CEO comments that `The Judge         Business School's regulatory Unit is respected internationally as         possibly the leading institution in economic regulation.
[...] Their         views and models are sought across the globe.'
He confirms Pollitt       and Littlechild's involvement in the re-writing of the regulatory model `provided         credibility to this very significant project' (Source 8).
Littlechild's work on constructive engagement for UK electricity was       taken up by UK water regulators.
Further work was commissioned and has       been acted on by the water regulator in Scotland (WICS), who were advised       by Littlechild.
In April 2009, the Cave Review (Source 6) noted       that `recent analysis has discussed the potential role of "negotiated         settlements" in the regulatory process' (para 5.32) and referenced       Littlechild (Ref 6).
It recommended this approach in the UK water       sector (developing the earlier work on electricity).
This view was       endorsed by the Walker Review (Source 7) and the Gray Review (Source         5).
All three Reviews were commissioned by the Government.
Meanwhile       Ofwat initiated its own review in October 2010 and stated that `the         thinking in this document has been informed by [...] research we         commissioned from Professors Stephen Littlechild and Catherine Waddams'       (p 1).
In the light of this review, Ofwat decided to put much greater       focus on customer engagement in the forthcoming price control reviews (Source         5).
The Chief Executive of WICS commented: `the research into constructive         engagement and negotiated settlements carried out by Professor Stephen         Littlechild was compelling.
[...] As a direct result of Stephen's         research and his unstinting support, we have agreed a role for a         Customer Forum in Scotland.
[...] Customers are already benefitting from         the interaction between Scottish Water and the Customer Forum' (Source         9).
