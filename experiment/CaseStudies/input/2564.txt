     We have prioritised reaching out to user groups and wider audiences in       clear and accessible       terms through short articles and web pieces (listed in Section 5) and at       workshops, training       sessions and CPD courses.
The significance of, and value attached to, our       work is seen in the       invitation to write-up our research for the practitioner-focused Policing       journal.
The editors wrote:       `We believe that your article contained much that would be of direct value       to senior public order       commanders', and one of the reviewers noted: 'This is a very useful paper       that may help USA       police move beyond the current situation' (4 January 2013, on file at       University of Edinburgh).
Other examples include:     Public Order Policing workshop, May 2010 (corroboration sources:       sections 5.1, 5.2 &amp; 5.3)       Our research (item 5 in section 3) highlighted the desire for, but also a       lack of awareness about,       liaison-based policing styles.
We therefore organised an academic and       practitioner workshop       discussing current trends in public order policing and identifying lessons       to be learned from       existing research.
Over 50 delegates attended from eight police forces,       the Scottish Police       College, and nine UK universities, highlighting the reach of our research.
Presentations from       police officers &#8212; from command, public order and negotiator perspectives &#8212;       and academics       generated lively discussion on these issues and how best to implement the       more `facilitative'       approaches.
A workshop participant from Sweden's dialogue police was       subsequently invited to       Lothian &amp; Borders Police's negotiator training course.
The workshop       was funded by University of       Edinburgh's Public Policy Network (see REF3a) and the Scottish Institute       for Policing Research       (SIPR).
SIPR collated feedback on the event, including the following       comments on Gorringe &amp;       Rosie's presentation and the workshop as a whole: `I would like to         work with these individuals at         our forthcoming events &#8212; clear overlap in our aims &#8212; we could assist         with demonstrating practical         issues in dealing with protest from a Policing perspective and allow         them to draw independent         conclusions.'
`A thought provoking seminar on how we move forward in         public order policing.
Having a combination of academics, public order and negotiators brought         healthy debate' (see       section 5.1 below).
Advising police operations before an event       (corroboration sources: section 5.3)       The workshop facilitated greater access to policing operations, and its       significance was clear when       we were invited to advise Lothian &amp; Borders Police during the       preparation, planning and debriefing       of a `liaison operation' which helped facilitate a largely peaceful       Climate Camp in 2010 (item 3.5 in       section 3).
We advised on the policing approach, the leaflet to be       distributed to protestors and the       clothing to be worn by liaison officers (in our earlier research, we       encountered liaison officers       wearing plain clothes, meaning protestors were unable to identify them and       saw them as spies).
We stressed that liaison officers should be clearly identifiable       (recommending that they wear their       police uniforms, but also high-visibility vests with the words `Liaison       Officer' prominent on them)       and maintain lines of communication with protestors and also be able to       respond to demands:       `Safe to say your input has been hugely valuable not least the comments         you make below &#8212; all of         which we'll take on board.
This is new and interesting ground we are all         breaking together and I'll         look forward to seeing how it all progresses in the future' (Lothian       &amp; Borders Chief Inspector,       August 2010, on file at University of Edinburgh).
Afterward we provided       feedback on the operation       and suggested possible ways to improve for future events.
Subsequently, in       2013, we were       consulted by officers seeking to establish a liaison unit with student       activists in South Edinburgh.
Debriefing commanders during and after an event (corroboration       sources: section 5.3)       In 2009 we debriefed key police liaison officers after the NATO       Parliamentary Assembly and       provided feedback on dialogue-based models of policing; in 2010 we were       invited to observe (and       comment upon) key stages from planning to post-event briefing of       Strathclyde Police's handling of       the Papal Mass in Glasgow, submitting a formal report.
In 2011 we studied       the policing of protests       at the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference in Sheffield, including the       planning stages.
We       provided dynamic on-the-day discussion and briefing with both South       Yorkshire's `Police Liaison       Team' and their Silver Commander (who has since co-authored an account of       the event with Stott       and Gorringe).
On the day we drew Silver's attention to the dangers of       relying on CCTV for       information and discussed with him how to improve the safety of liaison       officers in the crowds.
Contributing to police public order training (corroboration       sources: sections 5.2 &amp; 5.3)       In 2011 we provided several sessions to Public Order Commanders in Lothian       &amp; Borders Police       and Strathclyde Police and to Lothian &amp; Border's Police's newly formed       Public Order Working       Group.
About 25 Public Order Bronze Commanders attended the session in       Edinburgh, about       75% of relevant staff.
In Strathclyde we addressed two training sessions       totalling around 40       commanders, about 80% of relevant Strathclyde Police staff.
In September       2011, the Assistant       Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police wrote: `The universal feedback         from the Commanders was         very positive, with much comment made of the engaging style of the         presentations, which made         the Commanders think about alternative viewpoints and the potential         impacts of their actions upon         protestors in various situations ...
I look forward to further         collaboration opportunities' (On file at       University of Edinburgh).
The training course organiser has summarised our       contribution as       ranging from an overview of `the latest crowd dynamics theories to         demonstrating the practical         application of them in a most pragmatic and objective manner.
Such         inputs have been imparted to         Public Order Commanders in the past as valued updates in the field of         working with crowds in         Command refresher courses that I have run and I am very keen to continue         with this relationship'       (On file at University of Edinburgh).
We also addressed rank and file public order officers in Lothian &amp;       Borders Police at their annual       training refresher session attended by 80 officers, and contributed to a       course aimed at police       professionals run by the University of Liverpool.
Around fourteen of the       participants (almost all of       whom were operational police officers) took the module as part of a degree       and five police officers       (mostly at or above Superintendent rank, and all with extensive       operational experience) took the       course as CPD.
This session led to an invitation to observe and offer       feedback on the policing of       the Liberal Democrat Conference in Sheffield in 2011.
Contributing to wider debates (corroboration: articles cited in       this paragraph and section 5.1;       section 5.3)       Finally, our research has informed both practitioner and wider debates.
In       2011 our analysis of the       challenges to protest policing after the Millbank disturbances appeared in       Police Professional, a       key resource for senior officers across the UK.
In 2013 Gorringe, Kominou       and Rosie briefed the       UN Special Rapporteur on rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and       association.
Item 3.5 in       section 3, together with a paper by Stott, Scothern and Gorringe, appeared       in a special `liaison'       issue of Policing, and item 3.6 featured in the companion volume       to the Stevens Commission on       the Future of Policing.
We have also written for the British Sociological       Association's blog, the       Australian academic forum The Conversation, and the SIPR         Newsletter.
Routledge made item 3.2       freely available online from August 2011 in its "UK riot culture &#8212; what       does research say" initiative.
There have so far been 477 article views.
There has been significant media coverage of this research.
Gorringe was       interviewed on BBC       Radio Wales 2010 following the student demonstrations and appeared on BBC       Newsnight       Scotland's riot coverage in 2011.
We were interviewed by I Avgi (a       major Greek daily) in       November 2010 on protest policing in the UK and contributed to, or were       cited within, reportage on       the riots in The Guardian, Revista 22, S&#252;ddeutsche         Zeitung, Canberra Times, The Times, The           Hindu, and O Estado de S.Paulo.
Rosie has linked the above work on policing to his work on sectarianism       (reported in the National       Identity Case Study) in a November 2011 presentation to Lothian &amp;       Borders Police and especially       in his role (outlined in the National Identity Case Study) on the Scottish       Government's Advisory         Group on Tackling Sectarianism, which involves, inter alia,       discussing the policing of parades and       marches with local councils, police forces and community representatives,       and advising the       Scottish Government on the topic.
