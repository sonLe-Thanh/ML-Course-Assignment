     Hildrew's research on changes to ecosystem processes and lags in recovery       following freshwater acidification a-f is having an impact on       data interpretation, policy making and environmental management at       regional 1,4, national 2,3,6,7 and EU 7,8       level.
Impact since 2008 has principally been facilitated in two ways:     (i) Via the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network (UK AWMN) 2.
This network was set up by the UK Government when it entered into       international commitments to reduce emissions of SO2 from UK       sources.
The network, of which Hildrew is a key member, monitors and       conducts original research on sites across the UK (22 lakes and streams,       primarily in the north and west but including less well known areas of the       south-east identified as susceptible by research at QMUL).
This network       has been used by a range of international ecological surveillance       programmes (see below).
(ii) Via Defra, who use evidence provided by the UK AWMN &#8212; and in       particular the 20 Year Interpretative Report, produced in 2010 (Chapter 6       of which was principally authored by Hildrew) 3 &#8212; to influence       policy in the UK and EU (see below).
For both (i) and (ii), Hildrew is one of the principal leads on the       research into the ecological responses to deacidification a-f       and was responsible for all the data on invertebrates and key data on       fish.
Hildrew's research has had substantial impact, via these routes, in       at least three different ways:     1.
Provision of evidence on which the policy and practice of         organisations concerned with managing the natural environment is based     The UK AWMN supports a number of organisations responsible for       environmental management of UK surface freshwaters in relation to the EU's       Water Framework Directive and sub-Directives on priority substances and       the Habitats Directive.
The organisations charged with responsibility for       ensuring water quality under the EU's Water Framework Directive (which       became UK law in 2003) include the Environment Agency (formerly England       and Wales), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Environment       and Heritage Service of Northern Ireland, Natural England, Natural       Resources Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Forestry Commission       (with respect to `forest and water guidelines').
The AWMN provides support       for these organisations and so assists them in meeting their statutory       obligations under this legislation 2, which in turn informs       management practices.
For example, the data and interpretations provided by Hildrew et al.
in the 20-year UK AWMN report3 (Chapter 6) resulted in a       recommendation within Natural Resources Wales to reconsider their sampling       regime for monitoring the effects of acidification on invertebrate       communities in the Welsh `model' lakes, as part of the Water Framework       Directive Lake Surveillance Network1.
The UK AWMN is such an important resource (see 2 and 3 below) that it has       recently been tasked with widening its scope to include other `long-range'       environmental stressors in the uplands (most evidently climatic changes,       but also deposition of metals and nitrogen &#8212; as agents of pollution and       eutrophication rather than acidity).
Thus, from 2013, the decision has       been taken to `rebadge' it as the Upland Waters Monitoring Network (UWMN).2     2.
Provision of data to inform and influence environmental policy           decisions and debates     Through the UK AWMN, Hildrew contributes vital invertebrate and fish data       (and interpretation of these data a-f) to a number of national       and international environmental surveillance programmes as evidenced by       their website 2, which states that UK AWMN     a) "contributes data from six sites to the UNECE [United Nations       Economic Commission for Europe] International Cooperative Programme       [ICP] on the Assessment and Monitoring Effects of Air Pollution on         Rivers and Lakes (ICP Waters) at the Focal Centre, NIVA, Oslo, as well         as the ICP on Integrated Monitoring (two sites)".
The role of UNECE       is described and expanded on in 3., below.
b) That "Data from four AWMN sites are contributed to the UK         Environmental Change Network, the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research         Network (LTER Europe) and the International Long Term Ecological         Research (ILTER) programme".
c) That "Data from the AWMN has also been used to provide information         on acidification status of Scottish rivers to NASCO (North Atlantic         Salmon Conservation Organisation) to demonstrate improving status and         was explicitly mentioned as an important source of data in the recent         NASCO implementation plan for Scotland" 4.
In addition, Hildrew's research on ecological hysterisis in ecological       responses b,c,f, along with additional QMUL data on recovery       of fish populations from a stream in East Sussex, has been cited in the       2012 `Review of long-range, transboundary air pollution (RoTAP)' report 5,       which was produced by NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) for       Defra, Scottish Government, Welsh Assembly Government and Department of       the Environment in Northern Ireland.
The report, which examines the       available scientific evidence on the effect of air pollutants in the UK,       is directly aimed at influencing policy (as evidenced by the accompanying       `RoTAP Summary for Policy Makers' document) 5.
Thus Hildrew's research, reported through the UK AWMN and Defra, has       substantial reach across the UK and EU by allowing the efficacy of       international environmental policies to be tested.
Such research is       critical in the environmental arena where changes may be slow but       substantial.
3.
Contributing to the maintenance and modification of emissions           policies across the EU.
Evidence gathered through the UK AWMN has acted as a key driver in       drafting and modifying international legislation.
Hildrew's research has       benefited policy and the environment by providing part of the body of       evidence to test the effectiveness of emissions reductions with respect to       the principal EU and UNECE legislation on acid deposition and surface       waters in the UK 2.
To quote Environment Minister Lord Henley       and the UK Government press release 6 on the 2010       Interpretative Report from the UK AWMN: 3     "This report shows the impact of 20 years of Defra policies to tackle         acid rain and the environmental damage it causes.
It also demonstrates         the opportunity we have to build on this success through forthcoming         international agreements that will allow us to return damaged rivers and         lakes to a healthy state where fish such as trout and salmon can         flourish."
"...whilst the waters are recovering, there is still a long way to go         before the plant and animal communities are restored to full         health....meaning that further emission reductions may be         necessary....... Defra is playing a key role in a number of         international agreements such as the EU National Emission Ceilings         Directive and the Gothenburg Protocol" 6     Emissions targets across the EU were indeed updated in May 2012 through       revision of the Gothenburg Protocol (CLRTAP) 7 and a recent       review of the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive by the European       Environment Agency (2012) states that a revision of this legislation is       expected imminently:     "While acidification has been markedly reduced.....an assessment using         present knowledge" (referring to adverse impacts on biodiversity)         "indicates that neither the acidification nor eutrophication objectives         have been met.
The European Commission is currently reviewing the EU's         air policy and...... is expected to propose a revised NEC Directive by         2013 at the latest".
8     Thus, evidence gathered and interpreted by Hildrew for the UK AWMN and       conveyed through Defra and UNECE, ultimately helped to justify the       modification of EU emissions policy.
