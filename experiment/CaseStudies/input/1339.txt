     Impact on Agency policies/policy development/advice:     This research has had a substantial impact on health and welfare, helping       in particular vulnerable patient groups and informing decisions by       relevant regulatory bodies and industry.
Food Standards Agency says that       this project (Source [S] 1) has provided them with `a wealth of new       information' [S2] regarding how nut allergic consumers use the food label       and other information to inform their decision making and about what the       issues are for them when eating out.
This was identified as a contribution       to the evidence used by Defra in conducting EU level negotiations.
This       research has also had impact on public policy and services.
Sue       Hattersley, Head of Food Allergy at the FSA, said: 'This research shows       the importance of clear allergy labelling on food products' [S3].
This       evidence informed the development of regulations that will affect the       practice of all food manufacturers and retailers as well as the purchasing       practices of nut allergic consumers.
Specifically, in the FSA summary of       the project, sent to all delegates in of the Food Allergy and Intolerance       Research Programme Review meeting (November 2012)[S2], the FSA states       that:            They regard the methodology developed in the shopping basket task as         novel and say that this method is likely to inform future research on         consumer decision making in relation to pre-packed food.
Accordingly,         they have shared details of this methodology with other relevant         Government Departments       The findings have informed work to develop management         thresholds/action levels for cross-contamination of pre-packed foods         with allergenic foods &#8212; the research has informed the Agency's thinking         further regarding the likely need to try and move away from the phrase         `may contain' if and when such thresholds are rolled out because of the         preconceptions regarding interpretation of the phrase in addition to         many disregarding it entirely.
The work has been used to inform EU negotiations on the new Food         Information Regulation (FIR).
The findings of the research were shared         with DEFRA who are leading on the UK negotiations on the FIR,         highlighting the need to ensure consumers are pointed towards the         ingredients list as the primary source of allergen information because         other information (e.g.
the allergy advice box) is not always present.
The FIR (now published) [S4] has included a requirement for allergens to         be in highlighted text in the ingredients list so this should help to         address this issue.

The results of the `eating out' part of the research will inform the         Agency's guidance to UK industry regarding provision of allergen         information for foods sold non-prepacked which is a new requirement of         the FIR.
The finding that many nut allergic consumers refer to the allergy         advice box as the first point of allergen information has informed the         Agency's correspondence with industry where we now specifically         emphasise the importance of manufacturers ensuring that the allergy         advice box matches the ingredients list as regards allergens present.
In an open meeting of Northern Ireland Food Advisory Committee (July       2011) the research was summarized as providing [S5] `insight into consumer       views about all aspects of food choice, labelling, and most particularly       around "may contain" type labelling.
It has helped the [FSA} Agency to       have a better understanding of the patterns of food consumption by groups       of food allergic consumers.
This information is being used to inform       Agency dietary advice to consumers with nut allergies and to input into       ongoing European discussions on the Food Information Regulation'.
Hazel       Gowland, Food advisor to the Anaphylaxis Campaign, notes how the research       has `helped her campaign for easily visible understandable labels,       improved information provision and better allergen controls in catering,       general food allergy awareness among food handlers and clarifying the       needs of food allergic people travelling.
I feel more authentic and       evidence-endorsed in the messages I am communicating' [S6].
Policy debate       has been moved forward by the research evidence in this case.
Findings       appeared in the FSA survey protocol on advisory labelling [S7].
Barnett       presented this work at TO7 Programme reviews for the FSA in 2010, 2011 and       2012 and as an invited speaker at the Anaphylaxis Campaign Corporate       Conference (2011) [S8].
The research programme is cited by the FSA in       their research specification for future research as an example of research       `informative in drafting tender documents and the conduct of proposed       research' [S9] Findings of the study were reported in the leading online       trade journals Foodmanufacture.co.uk, covering the food and drink       manufacturing [S10], Food Science and Technology (published by the       Institute of Food Science and Technology)[S11] and RSSL, serving the food,         drink, pharmaceutical,         healthcare, biopharmaceutical and consumer goods industries [S12].
