     The transport sector is responsible for approximately 22% of the world's       global energy consumption.
This is expected to double over the next two       decades.8 Two thirds of the world's liquid fuel will be       consumed by diesel engines.
As all diesel fuel cavitates within the fuel       injection equipment (FIE) before being burned, fuel injectors represent       the key technology for meeting current and forthcoming emission       regulations imposed on all types of internal combustion engines (ICE).
This was recognised recently by AVL, a world-leading engineering group.9     The experimental findings and computational tools for cavitation       developed at City have influenced the design of the FIE and combustion       systems developed by Toyota (Japan), Delphi (UK) and Caterpillar (CAT)       (USA), three of only five FIE manufacturers serving the entire automotive       industry worldwide.10, 11, 12 City's cavitation model is       currently adopted by these companies as a design tool for developing new       injectors.
Delphi have commented as follows:     `[City's work] has assisted us in assessing the predictive capability         of CFD [computational fluid dynamics] codes simulating cavitation,         applying new models into our designs, obtaining better understanding for         complex flow phenomena such as valve motion, high pressurisation effects         and cavitation erosion.
The results obtained as part of these projects         helped our research &amp; development team to develop better         understanding of the flow processes in Common Rail Injectors for car         engines.
Furthermore, the investigations on cavitation and erosion         prediction will contribute to the design of more durable injectors for         the truck engine market, a necessary pre-requisite for future market         expansion.
The results from the CFD tool developed by your team have         been used by our engineers to help guide design for the development of         new injectors.
It helps our R&amp;D team to understand a number of         phenomena and gives ideas to further explore and enhance our own         results.
'11     The development of engines is a complex process requiring integration and       performance optimisation of various components developed through testing       procedures over many years.
Confidentiality is required by industry which       complicates the isolation of City's contribution to the final engine       performance output.
However, to demonstrate our impact, the three examples       provided below summarise the technical solutions to specific problems that       were developed and the feedback from the companies with whom we have       worked.
Example 1: Concept design of automotive Diesel engine injectors         (Toyota Motor Corporation)       Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) supported an experimental project on the       visualisation of cavitation in optically accessible real-size nozzle       designs.
We investigated the physics of multiple fuel injections, a       technique currently implemented as the standard approach for emission       control.
The findings are the first to demonstrate the inter-relationship       between multiple injection shots and this discovery allows industry to       control injection shots more accurately.
Denso, a partner of the Toyota       Group, is currently manufacturing such nozzles on the basis of City's       research findings, as demonstrated in their recent research publication.13       Compared to previous designs, such engines demonstrate an increase of       approximately 15% in overall thermodynamic efficiency and a more than       threefold reduction in soot and NOx emissions prior to the application of       after-treatment devices, thereby delivering environmental benefits       alongside economic benefits to the company.
The Director of the Advanced       Technology Division, Toyota, comments on the work undertaken with City: "Toyota's         role is to develop combustion systems and to demonstrate and request the         necessary specifications to the nozzle to realise our combustion         concept.
There was much contribution from the collaborative study to         design the combustion system.
[...] There are many advantages in a low         compression ratio; e.g., higher power density, better fuel consumption,         low NOx keeping low level of smoke.
[...] The results obtained through         our collaborative research were very helpful for the estimation of fuel         spray behaviour including its stability caused by some of the cavitation         phenomena.
[...] Better understanding of the nozzle flow including         cavitation phenomena made it possible to estimate the location and the         quality of the mixture inside the cavity.
..it is hard to evaluate your         contribution quantitatively.
However, I can argue that the current         Toyota combustion concept couldn't [have been] created without our         collaboration.
I hope my comments demonstrate the importance of your         research to the success of Toyota's automotive engines.
"10     Example 2: Cavitation damage of the CR200 series injector in         heavy-duty Caterpillar/ Perkins engines.
In 2005, Caterpillar/Perkins faced a severe cavitation erosion problem in       one of their newly launched engines equipped with the CR200 series       injector nozzle.
While in serial production, customers observed severe       problems of excess smoke and even engine failure resulting from in-nozzle       erosion and subsequent damage.
Experimental and simulation work performed       at City across a series of projects in partnership with Caterpillar (the       most recent being an EU Industry Academic Project running 2012 to 2016)       provided a new modified design of the CR200 nozzle tip3 that       featured a grooved needle.
This design proved to be durable and with no       detrimental effect on the overall powertrain performance (power output and       exhaust emissions).
Caterpillar has recognised the importance of this       design, as indicated in their comments below, and the nozzle is currently       under production.
`The CFD code developed by your team together with the experimental         validation carried out at City helped our engineering team to develop         better understanding of the flow processes and cavitation and erosion         minimisation.
As a result, we were able to enhance the design of CAT         fuel systems products, primarily fuel injectors.
These products meet and         exceed our customer expectations by maximizing product values through         superior durability and reliability.
The simulation methodology for         cavitation and cavitation erosion has been implemented in our internal         CFD code and is currently used by our engineers to support the design of         advanced heavy duty fuel injectors, which enable CAT engines to combine         the benefits of ultra-high injection pressure and fully flexible         injection for optimised combustion across the engine speed range and to         meet the stringent emission regulations.'
Caterpillar Large Power       and Growth Markets Division12     Example 3: Power generation Diesel engine injector (Caterpillar Fuel         Systems)       In 2006, Caterpillar installed a new Diesel engine in a small village in       Alaska with about 400 inhabitants, living in an extremely cold climate.
The 1MW Diesel engine was the only power source to cover the electricity       needs of the local community.
After a few days of operation excess       cavitation damaged the engine.
New injectors had to be installed every few       days, resulting in excessive operational costs to Caterpillar and serious       psychological impact to the local community, which faced repetitive engine       failures and blackouts.
Experiments and simulations performed at City have       provided a long-term solution to this problem through a new injector       design.
The new engine has been in continuous use since this time,       providing stability of power supply and consequent benefits to this       resident community and to other users of the engines with these injectors       installed.12     The impact of City's research in injector nozzle design on the automotive       industry is significant and longstanding, helping to reduce pollution and       improving engine efficiency while also bringing associated economic       benefits to the industrial partners involved in the work.
Cavitation       research is now being applied to marine engineering through projects       funded by W&#228;rtsil&#228; (a market leader in diesel and natural gas engines,       propulsion systems and power plant solutions in the marine and energy       markets) and BAE Systems.
