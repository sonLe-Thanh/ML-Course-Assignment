     This case study provides an illustration of how research has resulted in       a feature rich e-commerce platform delivering organisational and economic       impacts to a world leading publisher, Faber Music Ltd (FM).
Founded by       Benjamin Britten in 1965, FM is a publisher and rights owner of classical,       contemporary and educational music as well as representing authors,       artists, and composers.
In 2008, FM recognised the need to embrace the latest digital and web       based technologies to improve operational and business performance and to       extend its product offering and deliver novel services [1,2].
Through the       proactive endeavours of the University's Knowledge Transfer Centre, a KTP       partnership (KTP007073, &#163;128K; 2008-11 [2,3]) was established in 2008 to       develop and implement a collaborative digital platform based upon LSBU's       OO research and expertise to meet the defined developmental and commercial       objectives of FM.
The KTP had to accommodate and meet the challenges       presented by the changing business and technological environment and to be       future proof.
Key challenges for the KTP were to deliver web-based       solutions that: (i) enable digital rights management, (ii) tracking of and       managing rights and royalties payments, (iii) territorial copyrights, (iv)       managing exchange and tax rates and (v) manage payments to e-partners.
Overall, these areas represent millions of independent transactions, since       the sale of a &#163;2 sheet music score on average involves 6 independent       transactions.
Independent Consultants established in an interview (2013) with the       Digital Director at FM, "that we needed to provide a much-needed         platform through which third-party musicians could license their         arrangements via digital channels.
As no such system existed, this         innovation would remove the hassle associated with licensing for digital         sheet music" [1, 2].
The resulting e-commerce platform, developed through the KTP       collaboration, was deployed in 2009 by FM.
This has had significant impact       on FM's business [1,2].
It has:            Created a new revenue stream &#163;40K in 2008/9, rising to &#163;260K in         2011/12 and is budgeted to produce &#163;400K in 2013/14 and increase         exponentially thereafter, with increased profitability;       Led to the creation of a new post within FM, that of Digital Director.
"Given us an electronic distribution model that gives us wider           reach and a lower cost of distribution" as a result of not needing         to produce and store physical materials;       "Put us in a stronger cash positive position as people pay on           download and copyright owners get paid quarterly, improving our           overall profitability";       Identified and reduced illegal (intentional and unintentional)         downloads;       "Provided us with a mechanism to obtain and exploit market trends           and understand our partners and customer needs better";       Increased directly and indirectly FM's customer base and international         reach;       Created an e-Partners scheme linking other related businesses and         customers to FM [4].
The Digital Director in June 2013 commented in relation to e-business and       the collaboration with LSBU: "it is fair to say that we were out of         touch with our contemporaries, now we are cutting edge" [1,2].
She has also stated that: "What we now have, as a direct result of the         KTP project, is a highly effective e-Partners scheme; we have 45         partners on our e-partner scheme, of which 35 are new business partners         for Faber".
The novel e-partners scheme allows other rights owners       (artists, radio stations and exam boards) to arrange and deliver content       via a formal association with FM worldwide.
The reach of the e-Partner scheme, the first of its kind in this market       sector, is illustrated by FM's new and enhanced links with [5]:             Marketing partnerships: for example, with bands (Queen, Elbow);         theatre (Love Story, Sister Act); music forums (Music Radar, Cleartabs);         Radio Stations (Classic FM); Music Apps (Guitar Buddy); Composers (Carl         Davis) and Warner/Chappell Music, which provide FM and its partners with         a more extensive digital library for distribution and retail [5];        Sheet music publishers: for example, Boosey and Hawkes is the         largest specialist classical music publishing company in the world.
The         e-partners scheme provided their first digital content distribution and         sales platform;        Music Arrangers: for example, PDF Brass [6] a one man business,         involved in composing, arranging and distribution of music joined as an         e-partner in 2009, since which its revenues and reach have increased 10         fold.
The proprietor acknowledged that bands are known to create         cohesion in small communities such as in Africa, and is a mechanism for         social inclusion and prosperity;        Education Music Services: Sing Up [7], a national competition         set up under the last Labour Government, has, as a result of its link         with FM's e-partner scheme, been able to acquire and distribute digital         music and teacher notes to over 90% of the 20,000+ English infant         schools.
A representative of Sing Up indicated that this would not have         been possible without being an e-Partner.
Singing is known to improve:         (i) numeracy and literacy, (ii) increase IQ by an average of 7 points;         (iii) increase pupil concentration; (iv) promote self- confidence, and         (v) improve social skills [7,8];        Music Shops: Chappell of Bond Street was the first e-partner to         use their own e-commerce platform for a seamless integration of two         platforms to enable customers to purchase content from all e-partners         [4].
The platform has allowed FM and its e-partners to mitigate media piracy       by eliminating price differential, as seen by the purchaser, but       delivering original, quality products (correct arrangements and lyrics)       and legal ownership.
"The project has gained external recognition from the public, our         customers, our competitors and the industry," says the Digital       Director.
"Faber is really pushing the boundaries when it comes to         digital exploitation" [1,2].
An unforeseen but significant benefit resulting from the research has       been to allow (via the KTP) FM to challenge illegal download websites [9].
The significant outcome of this is that FM has negotiated a $1million       revenue payment from an illegal download site [1,2].
