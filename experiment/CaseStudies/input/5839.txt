     Three linked elements generate the impact of this project: the impact of       Marcus's films themselves, as he develops his techniques for exploring       time, place and trauma; the impact of his exploration of other filmmakers'       techniques through the interviews of The Director's Cut and the       archive that it creates for future researchers; and the impact of The         Director's Cut's associated events, particularly the public       masterclasses at Aberdeen's art cinema, The Belmont Picture House, and the       Junior Director's Cut competitions which encourage schoolchildren       to become involved in filmmaking.
The films of the In Time of Place project have led to over 40       invited talks, keynotes and public talks with audiences in the fields of       Architecture, Divinity, Film and Visual Culture, History, Jewish and       Holocaust Studies, Memory Studies and Philosophy, underscoring the       research project's interdisciplinary significance.
Public screenings and       talks have included the Irish Film Institute in Dublin (2009), and public       lectures in Antigonish and St. John's, Nova Scotia (2010) in tandem with       Remembrance Day and the anniversary of Kristallnacht, and a screening and       talk for archivists at the Museum for the History of the Polish Jews in       Warsaw (2011).
The Cemetery (2010) was selected for screening at       the largest annual documentary conference in 2013, VEXX in Stockholm, and       was followed by a discussion of its experimental ethnography that was       chaired by the VEXX conference director and involved leading documentary       theorists, including Bill Nichols (1991, 2001), Michael Renov (1993, 2004)       and Catherine Russell (1999), while The Memorial was the only UK       entry selected for screening at the largest annual international film       conference in 2012, organized by the Society for Cinema and Media Studies       in Boston.
The Director's Cut has attracted significant local attention, not       only in terms of the numbers regularly attending the events, but in terms       of its high profile in the local press.
The Aberdeen Press and Journal,       for instance, in reporting on Nicolas Roeg's participation, stated: `film       fanatics gathered in their hundreds in Aberdeen last night for a special       presentation by a world leader in international cinema' (April 2008).
Roeg       directed the landmark films, Walkabout, Don't Look Now and The         Man Who Fell to Earth.
In covering The Director's Cut event       with Sir David Attenborough, the same newspaper recorded that, `a hugely       popular series of talks celebrating the art of the filmmaker reached a new       high yesterday as one of the world's most famous naturalists was welcomed       to the fold' (July 2008).
The impact of the series can be measured in part       by its longevity - commencing in 2007 it has increased in frequency and in       popularity in each succeeding year and major events are planned for 2014       and 2015 - as well as by its transfer to other parts of Scotland e.g.
the       2010 Glasgow Film Festival invited Alan Marcus to stage a Director's         Cut at the Glasgow Film Theatre featuring Academy Award-winning       director Kevin Macdonald (Touching the Void, Last King of Scotland),       which was subsequently broadcast on BBC Radio.
These impacts are enhanced by the practice-based offshoots of The         Director's Cut in the masterclasses held in the Belmont Picturehouse       to give local filmmakers the opportunity to learn from visiting directors,       and in the Junior Director's Cut filmmaking competitions,       organised in conjunction with Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire schools in 2009       and 2012.
The Director's Cut has also developed significant       external partnerships which include the Norwegian Embassy, Glasgow Film       Festival, Scottish Screen, Creative Scotland, Picturehouse Cinemas, BBC       Radio and BAFTA Scotland, many of whom have used the series to promote       their own public engagement agendas, as well as with Aberdeen City       Council, which selected In the Birch Grove (2012) and In Place         of Death (2008) for a special screening and workshop in       commemoration of Holocaust Memorial Day.
The City Council has also       commissioned a series of documentary films on local artists, made by       recent graduates of the University and overseen by Marcus, as part of its       bid to become `City of Culture'.
