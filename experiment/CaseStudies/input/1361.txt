     In September 2012 Rossiter composed a list of all the local schools which       offer A-level English,       including contact emails of A-level English tutors where possible.
He       contacted all of these schools       and tutors asking if they would be willing or interested in bringing their       students to a university       lecture and seminar/workshop on the subject of Shakespeare.
Following this       initial contact he was       able to create a shortlist of interested parties, and then used that       shortlist to compile a list of       Shakespeare texts being studied at those schools.
Rossiter was thus able       to write each lecture in       accordance with the texts being studied by those students in attendance.
For example, for the       lecture on Shakespearean comedy on 28th February the schools in attendance       were South Sefton       Sixth Form College (40 students), Belvedere Academy (40 students) and       Range High School (25       students), and the texts being studied by each were The Merchant of         Venice, Measure for         Measure, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Much Ado about         Nothing.
The lecture was thus based       on these comedies.
Following the lecture there were four seminars on each       of the aforementioned       plays, so that each group of students could focus upon the text they are       studying relative to the       information received and knowledge gained via the lecture.
Some of these       seminars were taught       by colleagues in the English Department at Hope.
Likewise, for the Shakespearean tragedy lecture on 25th February, the       schools in attendance were       Gateacre C.C.
School (15 students), St Margaret's Academy (27 students)       and Litherland High       School (11 students), and the texts being studied by each were Oedipus         Rex, King Lear and       Macbeth.
Again, the lecture discussed all three plays before the       seminars focused on specific       plays relative to specific groups of A-level students, and colleagues from       Hope contributed to the       seminars.
The seminar discussions were triggered by a handout which emphasised the       moral good of       literature via excerpts from the texts discussed in the underpinning       research, and concluded with a       questionnaire comprised of the following questions:            How informative and/or interesting did you find the lecture?
How informative and/or interesting did you find the seminar?
Do you think the event has enhanced your understanding of Shakespeare,         and specifically         the area of Shakespeare you are studying?
Do you think the lecture and seminar discussion will aid you in your         exams and essays in         any way?
What improvements would you suggest to the structure and/or content of         the events?
What future events would you like to see (for example, on specific         texts)?
Any Other Comments          The various responses to these questions can be divided roughly into       three themes: (i) impact       effecting changes in behaviour, attitude and understanding, (ii) practical       impact upon the student's       own written work, and (iii) the impact of experiencing university-level       education.
In relation to (i) participants disclosed that ideas which previously       seemed unclear or complicated       are now much clearer following the events they attended, and that their       understanding and focus       had developed significantly; in particular they were now aware of `other       points which aren't taught       in school' (questionnaire response).
In relation to (ii) participants       noted that they now had new       information concerning the origins of dramatic conventions and discovered       a wealth of new       terminology which could be utilized in their writing.
In relation to (iii)       the overwhelming response       was enjoyment, and a sense of accessibility.
Following the initial lectures and seminars, a follow-up series was       organized, whereby Dr Rossiter       travelled to the schools to provide lectures and seminars to A-level       students in a familiar       environment.
These events took place in early July and involved Range High       School in Formby,       South Sefton Sixth Form College in Litherland, and Bellerive FCJ Catholic       College in Toxteth       (Princes Park) &#8212; Bellerive hadn't attended the original lectures but       gladly took part in July.
Again       the response was overwhelmingly positive, in particular from students who       had attended the       lecture series as AS-level students, and had now taken their exams, and       were preparing for A2-level       texts.
At Range High School the session was on The Merchant of Venice,       at South Sefton the       text studied was Macbeth (for students who had attended the Measure         for Measure sessions       previously) and at Bellerive the session was on Macbeth also.
The       sessions were again measured       by means of a questionnaire which added the following questions to those       already listed:            Has the seminar affected your view of studying English Literature at         University?
If so, how?
Do you think studying Shakespeare is `good for us'?
If so, how?
Questionnaires were completed by 26 students at South Sefton Sixth Form       College on 2 July and       by 8 students at Bellerive Catholic High School on 4 July.
Approximately       20 students attended the       follow-up session at Range High School on 1 July.
The responses showed a shift from not considering English at university       to definitely considering it.
This is significant in that certain of the areas in which the schools are       situated, such as Litherland       and Toxteth (Princes Park), are some of the most deprived in the UK.
According to the Litherland       Ward Profile for 2012 `53.2% (5,781) of Litherland residents live in areas       in the most deprived 10%       nationally'.
According to the Princes Park Ward Profile, shockingly,       `93.6% of the ward falls into the       most deprived 5% nationally', and `Three fifths of the ward (60.1%) is in       the most deprived 1% of       areas nationally', which is five times the city-wide average.
For students       from these areas to now       be considering studying English at university-level is a sign of the       efficacy of the project.
The responses also highlighted areas students and teachers would like to       see covered by future       events, whilst the preliminary contacts also produced a list of schools       which have no A-level       departments, but would be interested in GCSE-level events.
Both of these       factors will be crucial in       sustaining the involvement of the English Department with local schools,       and maintaining the       relationships between the university and the local schools over the coming       years.
The public lecture in the case study was given on the opening night of       Liverpool City Council's In         Other Words Literary Festival (23 April-19 May), which took place       across a series of venues in the       city of Liverpool.
The A-level schools who attended the earlier lectures       were invited to this event,       and to the wider series of lectures of which this was part (which Rossiter       helped to organize).
There was significant public turnout for the series.
The event was       advertised in the Liverpool Echo       newspaper, online, and via a leafleting campaign targeting key venues in       the city.
The event was       focused on why we still read Shakespeare, given that it took place on the       anniversary of his birth       and death, in conjunction with other literary-themed events in and around       the city.
This lecture was       the first in a series of five public lectures given at Liverpool Hope by       members and affiliates of the       English Department, thereby highlighting the wider culture of public       dissemination of research at       Liverpool Hope, and its success has led to the organization of a follow-up       series (drawing on a list       of interested parties who provided contact details following the first       series) to take place in 2013-14.
As with the `Shakespeare for Schools' project, the intention is to       maintain these relationships,       and the groundwork for this has now been successfully undertaken.
