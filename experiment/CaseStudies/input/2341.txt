     Professor De Ste Croix's UEFA-funded research project, designed to       explore the effects of football match play on neuromuscular function and       injury risk in youth female footballers (in 2012), was important due to       increasing numbers in female participation in football and the increased       risk of injury in female players.1,3 Based on the findings of       the project, De Ste Croix was commissioned by the Football       Association (FA) to work in partnership on further research to inform       current practice in youth injury prevention.1 By working in       collaboration with FA Centres of Excellence (CoE) the application of De         Ste Croix's research is directly impacting individuals at risk of       injury (girls aged 8-17 years who have been identified as `at risk'       groups).
The intervention programme that is underway with 12 CoE (circa       1000 girls) will be expanded to all 32 CoE (circa 2500 girls) in 2014.
This outreach work is looking to identify girls classified as at risk of       injury and to provide individualised training programmes to reduce injury       risk.
This is the first national deployment of an intervention programme       directed at all girls participating in an FA CoE, and aimed at reducing       injuries of youth female footballers.
Simultaneously, De Ste Croix       was also awarded a research grant from FIFA (the world governing body of       football) to build upon the findings of the UEFA-funded study, the remit       of this research being to `contribute to the world football family'.
This       research is current, evolving and aims to explore the chronic effects of       football match play on neuromuscular readiness to re-perform in female       youth footballers.
This research will inform and develop the current       globally accepted pre-habilitation programme (FIFA 11+) which is       used by over 30 million footballers worldwide.
The current 11+ programme       has not been developed with paediatric populations in mind and therefore       is not deemed appropriate.
This applied research on injury risk and       prevention in children is underpinned by De Ste Croix's expertise       in child neuromuscular functioning.
The national and international reach       of this work is significant with 29 million girls and women participating       in football worldwide (source: FIFA `The Big Count').
Informing/Changing Practice:     The above research has also led to De Ste Croix working directly       with a number of professional/elite football clubs across Europe       including: FC Barcelona, SL Benfica, Athletic Club Bilbao, Bristol City       and Bristol Ladies Academy.
In turn, the research has started to change       embedded pre-habilitation/training practice in a relatively short space of       time in professional football clubs around the world, directly impacting       on around 1300 players.1,2,3,4,5 A member of the FC Barcelona       medical team states that: "... this improvement in ACL prevention is a       direct result of the new training protocols introduced following Mark's       research.
The medical staff at the club are also now more knowledgeable in       the area of physical mechanics as a result of the research put forward by       Mark.
".5 An additional impact that De Ste Croix's       research has had at FC Barcelona is an increased understanding and empathy       of pre-habilitation training for the women's team by the mainly male       medical staff.
This has impacted on the women's team by increasing the       focus and attention given to the female players by the medical staff at       the club.5 As a direct result of De Ste Croix's       research Bristol City have also increased the time spent on neuromuscular       training programmes with its youth players, with the ultimate aim of       reducing non-contact injuries.2 Based on the research of De         Ste Croix, Bristol City have re-designed and implemented an       innovative pre-habilitation programme with all of their youth players       (ages 8-21 years) with a focus on the principles of movement control and       neuromuscular activity.
This has led to Bristol City commissioning De         Ste Croix to evaluate the effectiveness of this change in practice.
Others, including a female team in the USA, have changed their practice by       implementing injury prevention work towards the end of training sessions       where fatigue is present.2,3 Head of Women's Soccer at Rider       University, New Jersey (USA) notes that: "We implemented a change in       policy ...
This change was a direct result of the research undertaken by       Mark and Gloucestershire.
".3 A physiotherapist at Athletic Club       Bilbao states that based on the research of De Ste Croix the club       have introduced a new training programme for their male youth players that       incorporates injury prevention in relation to muscle fatigue.4       This change in practice is a direct result of De Ste Croix's       research indicating that fatigue induces a large increase in injury risk.
The Football Association have also changed their policy by implementing       prevention programmes with National youth teams from 13 year-olds upwards.1       Previously such programmes were restricted to the senior teams but the       Head of Physiotherapy for the FA (Women) has stated that work by De         Ste Croix has "... proved the applicability of certain training       methods to younger age groups.
We have now implemented specific exercises       with the U13s and upwards that we used to employ with the senior team       only.
This is a policy change that has occurred as a result of the work       with Gloucestershire.
".1     Reducing Injury Risk     Screening players for injury risk is an important part of reducing injury       incidence.
As a direct result of the research undertaken by De Ste         Croix FC Barcelona and Athletic Club Bilbao have implemented       screening protocols using isokinetic testing with the specific intention       of reducing ACL injury.4,5 Although most of these professional       organisations have only recently changed their practice there is growing       evidence that this change has had an impact by reducing injury incidence.2,3,4,5       This work has included collecting injury incidence data as well as       mechanism data related to relative risk to help identify youth players at       risk.1,2,4 A physiotherapist at Athletic Club Bilbao notes: "We       have implemented these testing techniques into our training programmes for       various groups already and we are checking injury levels and will have the       data soon.
We are confident that the incidence of ACL injuries will be       reduced.
".4 FC Barcelona have confirmed a reduction in ACL       injuries (1 in 2013), and that the potential for that injury was       highlighted in the screening tests adopted following a change in practice       based on De Ste Croix's research.
This change in practice has also       had a direct impact on the player as the medical team confirm that the       injury was easier to treat with less rehabilitation time required.5       Data from the FIFA funded research exploring the chronic effects of       fatigue accumulated during match play on injury risk and neuromuscular       readiness to re-perform is being used to inform and change training loads       and recovery strategies in youth footballers.2 Bristol City       Football Club are using these data to inform their practice in       implementing the FA's promotion of the new Elite Player Performance Plan       (EPPP), which advises on training hours for youth players.2 The       Academy Head of Sports Science and Medicine at Bristol City states that       the club's implementation of current FA policy is taking into account De         Ste Croix's research that age, maturation and fatigue for each       specific player is considered in devising and implementing their youth       training programmes.
This is supported by the FA who state that the direct       improvements in training and recovery practices in elite youth sport that       are being implemented based on this research will, over time, see improved       health and well-being in sporting youth populations.1 The FA's       head physiotherapist for women's football concludes that: "... as a direct       result of Mark's research we have found that we can influence the       prevalence of ACL injuries by implementing preventative measures at a       younger age range.
