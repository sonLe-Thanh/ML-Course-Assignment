     In terms of reach and significance, the impact of the Lecturer       Self-efficacy Project was virtually immediate for the four participating       institutions drawn from the GuildHE/CREST group.
These included the host       institution, Bishop Grosseteste University, as well as the University of       St. Mark and St. John, Newman University and St. Mary's University       College.
Both Bishop Grosseteste and St. Mark and St. John incorporated       findings and recommendations arising from the quantitative phase of work       directly into discussion and debate surrounding research strategy,       resource deployment, recruitment policy and the provision of professional       development for staff in the areas of research capacity building and       strategic decision making.
Other beneficiaries of the research included       all other members of the GuildHE/CREST initiative as a collective body       where the research was disseminated at regular research seminar events.
Such has been the strength of the collaboration between BGU and CSU in       Australia that Sharp and Hemmings have each been awarded internally       competitive research support funding for short study visits to each       other's institutions and to work with the GuildHE/CREST initiative.
This       mutually beneficial relationship and work to date has resulted in several       research outputs in peer reviewed international journals and dissemination       by other means as indicated including a web page devoted to the Project at       the GuildHE:            Sharp, J.G.
and Hemmings, B.
(2012) Researcher self-efficacy.
Available at: http://www.crest.ac.uk/en/about/researcher-self-efficacy/researcher-selfefficacy.cfm.
Within the UK, the GuildHE/CREST initiative has confirmed that the       website has received 195 hits since its construction.
The Lecturer       Self-efficacy Project has also attracted international interest from       universities in the United States, Malaysia and the Middle East.
Through the GuildHE/CREST initiative, interest in the whole field of       lecturer self-efficacy and `research-led' teaching stimulated further       discussion and debate leading to the publication of an important and       influential book of source materials for those institutions who might       consider themselves `teaching-led' but looking to become more       `research-informed'.
The book was co- edited by Prof. John Sharp and       contained an article outlining findings and recommendations from the       Project:            Miller, A., Sharp, J.G.
and Strong, J.

The publication was part-funded by HEFCE with distribution to HEFCE       itself, RCUK, the Higher Education Academy, the Department for Business,       Innovation and Skills, the Wellcome Trust, the Leverhulme Foundation and       other charitable organisations, and Vice-Chancellors at all major UK       universities.
The progression of work from quantitative to qualitative and its       application to `second-career' academics has taken the Project from a       measured understanding of the relationship between qualifications, gender       and career stage into a growing understanding of the experiences of       research for colleagues working in similar environments.
Findings beyond       national boundaries appear broadly similar in nature resulting in broadly       similar considerations and recommendations cutting across cultural       boundaries.
Considerations and recommendations have included a focus on       the induction, training and support available to all staff, but       particularly `second' and `early career academics' and research mentoring.
This progression, which included recognition of the unique doctoral       journeys experienced by `second-career' academics, was rewarded with a       small grant from the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education to the       University of St. Mark and St. John with Sharp and Hemmings as academic       consultants:            Couper, P., Evans, J., Sharp, J., Miller, A. and Lea, S. (2012) Leadership,           management and the part-time doctoral experience for `second career           researchers'.

As this particular project has evolved, dissemination and impact has also       been made possible with further support from the GuildHE/CREST initiative       in the form of an important and influential doctoral supervision and       support seminar:            GuildHE (2013) Managing part-time doctoral study: a one-day event for         part-time PhD students.

Funded by GuildHE and LFHE.
All Project work to date, reflecting the on-going collaboration between       UK and Australian institutions and the GuildHE/CREST initiative,       culminated in a competitive travel award to Sharp, now Adjunct Professor       at Charles Sturt, to disseminate details of the Project with Dr Brian       Hemmings to 70 faculty members and doctoral candidates, including one       keynote presentation:            Doctoral Research (2013) Travel grant awarded by Charles Sturt         University to support research visit ($5000AUS, RIPPLE).
The Lecturer Self-efficacy Project is a continuing work in progress with       future dissemination planned for the UK's first lecturer self-efficacy       conference at the University of Chichester in August 2014.
