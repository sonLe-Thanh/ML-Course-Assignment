     Offender Rehabilitation: Research by Winder et al.
is of       national significance producing tangible differences in offender       rehabilitation through the reform of sexual offenders in treatment in       England and Wales.
Reach: The Sexual Offences, Crime and Misconduct Research Unit       assisted the steering group responsible for designing and validating all       sex offender programmes in England and Wales.
Members included the Head of       Evidence and Offence Specialism (National Offender Management Service),       the Head of Probation Programmes in England and Wales, and Clinical Leads       for all sex-offender behaviour programmes.
Effect: The unit's research has strongly influenced sex offender       treatment nationally.
"We took considerable account of SOCAMRU's         research findings and thinking on this topic in our recent (2010-2012)         redesign of treatment programmes for sexual offenders.
The research         developed and carried out by SOCAMRU, in collaboration with colleagues         at Whatton prison, on sex offenders who deny their offences .. convinced         us to change the policy we have had for the last 20 years to exclude         "deniers" from treatment programme .. and had a general impact was on         our whole approach to treatment of sex offenders" [Evidence 1b].
"The research has led to changes not only in a local level, but has         had national implications (e.g.
denial work by Winder and Blagden has         changed national policy for working with deniers &#8212; previously a group         excluded from treatment" [Evidence 1c].
Offender Mental Health: Slade's research conducted after       moving to NTU extends earlier work to predict potential suicides       [Reference 3, 4].
Reach: Slade's research on suicide has influenced policy decisions       at HMP Brixton and Thameside.
"As a result of your (Slade's) PhD         research and training event, the psychology team have implemented the         learning into everyday practice" [Evidence 2b].
It has also assisted       the development of new arrangements for the delivery of clinical       psychology services across the Scottish prison estate.
[Evidence 2a].
In       2013 Slade delivered three workshops on `Self-harm and suicidal behaviour       ` to relevant professionals.
Effect: Slade has influenced the new mental health policy at HMP       Thameside by creating "new local policy arrangements within mental         health services across a number of prisons and is also being used to         shape new service provision ... and consider new ways of delivering         services to assist in transferring prisoners with acute mental illnesses         to hospital in a more efficient manner" [Evidence 2b].
Offender Management: Hamilton's Boundary Seesaw Model       has had a major impact on the Forensic Division at Nottinghamshire       Healthcare Trust.
This model and other ideas explicated in Hamilton (2010)       were developed into a full training programme to develop staff's critical       appreciation of boundary management and risks.
"The BSM was approved         as the framework for training led by Laura Hamilton" [Evidence 3a,       minute 3.8 p.3].
Reach: Hamilton's work is core to the Trust's Clinical Boundary       Procedure ratified in 2012,13 [Evidence 3b].
The Boundary Seesaw Model       is now the predominant training model across the Forensic Division at       Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust (the largest UK forensic division, with       over 2500 staff), and has become standard practice in specialist units       outside the Forensic Division at Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust:       Millfields Medium Secure Unit (2008), Oswin Medium Secure Dangerous and       Severe Personality Disorder Unit (2009), Meadowview, Private Low Secure       Unit (2010), High Secure Hospitals Nurses Forum (2010), Broadmoor High       Secure Hospital (2011).
In 2013, approval was given to include the Boundary         Seesaw Model in the Department of Health and Ministry of Justice's       nationally commissioned Knowledge and Understanding Framework training       programme which supports more effective work with personality disorder       [Evidence 3e].
A section on boundary management was also commissioned for       the Named Nurse Workbooks [Evidence 3d]; the core training process for       newly qualified nurses across Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust.
This work       is referenced in NICE clinical guideline 77 (2009).
Effect: In 2011 the BSM "formed the basis of Nottinghamshire         Healthcare Trust's (Forensic Division) management of professional and         workplace Boundaries procedure.
It has been adopted as the core-training         model.
Hamilton was asked to return to clinical practice to oversee the         development of training, training for trainers and roll out."
[Evidence 3a,c].
As of July 2013 782 members of staff have been trained in the BSM and       further training is scheduled with a view to training the whole of       Forensic Division (N=2653).
An introductory training package (Level 1       Core) piloted with early adopters across the Forensic Division received       positive evaluations from participants and stakeholders.
A new role of       Boundary Lead (all senior clinicians) ensures the delivery and development       of the BSM training.
Level 2 training is currently under development.
There is clear impact on practice [Evidence 3b to e].
