     Context: By challenging conventional wisdom on racial segregation,       through an explicit strategy of       `myth busting', the research has helped to inform and shape policy debate       within Government,       improve public understandings of segregation, and transform thinking       around ethnic and       neighbourhood diversity.
The evidence base generated has shaped the       practices of prominent       race equality NGOs, in campaigns promoting alternative frameworks for       understanding race,       segregation and migration &#8212; challenging the public concern with ethnic       integration, and redirecting       focus to the problem of ethnic inequality.
At a more detailed level, local       authorities are, adopting       Finney and colleagues' methods for population estimation as they monitor       and plan for population       change.
(1) `Myth busting' in public understandings of segregation: The       book that showcases this       research [D] was deliberately titled `Sleepwalking to Segregation' after a       speech by the (then)       Commission for Racial Equality Chief Executive, Trevor Phillips.
Crafted       purposefully to target, as       its key audience, individuals and organisations politically involved in       race and diversity issues, the       book directly examines (and rebuts) common myths about race and         migration (e.g.
`Britain       takes too many immigrants', `Minorities do not want to integrate',       `Minority White Cities').
Firstly, by       providing an evidence-based challenge to common myths about segregation       (including a `quick       reference summary' of myths and counter-arguments), the book was designed       to open up a space       for public debate and to provide an effective tool in campaigns promoting       alternative       understandings of race, segregation and migration.
Secondly, the       book provoked considerable       media and public interest on publication, including coverage in the       international, national, local and       community press; including BBC regional TV and radio, Channel 4 TV and       online.
The work also       received coverage in magazine and popular journal articles, and in online       commentary with public       and policy audiences, including: Geography, for Geography       teachers; Significance (Royal       Statistical Society); and the Institute for Race Relations website [1].
(2) Informing political debate and shaping government policy: In       the national policy context       the work has been presented to a House of Commons Select Committee, during       the current       Parliament, by Jon Cruddas MP who used `Sleepwalking to       Segregation...' to illustrate the paucity       of evidence for problems of segregation, and to suggest that policy       efforts be better directed to       social concerns such as deprivation.
He notes that he used the book's "robust         and accessible"       arguments in Committee to "highlight the dangers of political debate         ignoring evidence in favour of         popular opinion", and subsequent to his appointment to the Shadow       Cabinet as Labour's Policy       Coordinator (15th May 2012), notes that he has employed the       research in order to address his       `current concerns' around child poverty and `family wellbeing', within the       Labour Party's Policy       Review, recognising that the book: "illustrates the presence of ongoing         disadvantage for minorities         in Britain and demonstrates how myths about race and segregation         stigmatise communities, which         in turn exacerbates overall inequality...Your work showed me that,         despite popular rhetoric that         situates ethnic diversity as the cause of social problems, the         evidence...demonstrates the reality of         ethnic integration.
These are particularly important insights, as in my         view they demonstrate that         our attention in Parliament is better focused on poverty and social         inequalities."
He adds that he       also uses the book as a "resource in responding to local constituents         and organisations who are         concerned about increasing ethnic diversity...to challenge inaccuracies         in commonly held views         about migration and ethnic integration" [2].
Andrew Stunell MP confirms that the book provides "an         accessible, useful and robust summary of         evidence about race and local population change.
In May 2010 I was         appointed as Parliamentary         Under Secretary of State at the Department of Communities and Local         Government... one of my         specific responsibilities... was developing the Government's approach to         integration and social         cohesion, leading [to] the publication of the DCLG report         `Creating the Conditions for Integration'.
This has underpinned Government policy-making and funding programmes in         social cohesion         since.
It is right to record that Dr Finney's book provided a valuable         resource during that process...       [subsequently] the Deputy Prime Minister has asked me to lead a working         Party developing         proposals on Social Cohesion, Integration and Migration for our 2013         programme for government.
Once again it has been invaluable to have the facts and perspectives of         Dr Finney's work available         to inform my thinking," further stating that the book provides "an         essential counter to the heated         rhetoric on these topics that characterises current race debates"       [3].
(3) Shaping the practice of prominent race equality NGOs in campaigns         promoting         alternative frameworks for understanding race, segregation and migration:       Groups working       on race relations and race equality have benefited from the work's       prominent evidence-based       intervention, as the basis for campaigns to challenge and redirect public       and policy debate.
The         Runnymede Trust has used the work as evidence in their recent       campaigns for a need to       (re)focus policy debate and practice on ethnic inequality and       discrimination rather than residential       segregation.
Runnymede's Director comments that "Having your evidence         to hand has allowed us         to challenge assumptions about trends in neighbourhood population         change, such as about `White         flight'", noting the work has "directly helped the cases we have         put to high level political circles         about appropriate policies for community cohesion and ethnic equality.
Your research has become         increasingly important in countering policy approaches which seek to         privilege `integration' over         equality... provided essential evidence, in accessible formats, for our         campaigns to shift political         and public debate from concern with segregation and self-segregation to         more pressing issues of         ethnic equality.
Your work has made a central contribution to high         profile debate around ethnic         segregation and opened up the opportunity for us to stimulate further         debate on Runnymede's         priorities".
The work has also been directly used as evidence in       Runnymede reports [4].
The North of England Refugee Service (NERS) has used the work's       demonstration of how       myths about race and migration gain currency in its ongoing campaign to       challenge negative and       inaccurate media reporting of migrant populations.
Their use of the       research as "evidence to         challenge myths of race and migration" has been "directly useful         for NERS to provide accurate and         balanced information about migration.
The evidence provided by your work         has helped us to         challenge mis-reporting of asylum and refugee issues.
The intervention         of your work in race         debates has provided a hook for our longstanding campaign to generate         new thinking on asylum         and raise the level of public debate".
NERS has employed "the         statistics and evidence in your         book... in awareness-raising talks across the North East... [and] in         multiagency meetings of         migrant and asylum/refugee service providers from government, private,         voluntary sectors in the       North East to emphasise the broad processes of minority integration and         mixing.
I also ensured         that key members of staff at NERS had copies of the mythbusters section         of your book so they         could equip themselves with the facts about population change and ethnic         integration in Britain" [5].
(4) Assisting local authorities to assess the drivers of population         change.
Findings on the       drivers of local population change and ethnic diversity were drawn upon by       Salford City Council       in the development of strategies for the management of neighbourhoods with       high population       turnover.
Their Equalities Officer confirms that they "have...         incorporated learning from publications         such as 'Sleepwalking to Segregation'?
into our consideration of         community cohesion at the local         level" [6].
Several local authorities, including Manchester,         Glasgow, Bradford, Rochdale,         Oldham and the Greater London Authority (GLA) have received invited         presentations on the         innovative demographic methods devised by this project,       incorporating them into the       monitoring and reporting procedures for population estimation which inform       local service planning       for diverse communities.
For instance, an Intelligence Analyst at Manchester         City Council (MCC)       comments that "Your evidence about decreasing residential ethnic         segregation and dispersal of         minorities from settlement areas has informed us and helped to         anticipate local population changes         and thus contributed to the development of our strategies for addressing         ethnic equality and         managing local population change' and has provided "information         about local population change         that we did not previously have and that is not available elsewhere...
The Census 2011 Briefings         on Dynamics of Diversity and the accompanying local Area Profilers are         an invaluable resource,         summarising the recently released Census data on ethnicity for local         areas.
The availability of         these expert analyses to local government is particularly welcome at a         time when research         capacity in local government is reduced" [7].
Similarly, a Senior       Analyst working at the Greater         London Authority Intelligence Unit, comments that: "Your analyses         of national patterns and         trends in ethnicity and migration have provided important contextual         understanding for our work         locally" and provided evidence about residential ethnic segregation       and dispersal of minorities       which has "helped to corroborate our own studies into ethnic diversity         and support policy making"       [8].
(5) Ongoing Impact: Finney and colleagues are now recognised as       expert commentators on       issues of race, segregation and diversity.
This was evident when the 2011       Census data on       ethnicity was released in December 2012, with early analysis published by       CoDE.
As an ESRC       Centre, CoDE is anticipated to have substantial ongoing impact over the       coming years, with an       impact strategy that includes: media work (including around politically       salient issues, such as       `white-flight'); partnerships with non-academic organisations (including       Runnymede); Cumberland       Lodge seminars with politicians and policy makers; and involvement in       political party conferences,       etcetera.
Finney has taken a prominent role in the CoDE Census       Briefings (part funded by the       Joseph Rowntree Foundation) that have established CoDE as a voice of       authority on matters of       Census analysis, ethnicity and inequality.
Some recent examples of       engagement include Finney       being invited to provide expert commentary by a number of media outlets       including regional radio       (BBC and independent) and national television (Channel 4 News), alongside       speeches at policy       seminars, such as by Just West Yorkshire (February 2013).
