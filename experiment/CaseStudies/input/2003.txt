     Gateway technologies for HPC to which the CPC have contributed through       underpinning research, have created impacts by: (i) allowing users to       focus on their HPC and HTC requirements independently of computational       infrastructure, through user-friendly portals that liberate user       productivity; (ii) facilitating efficient and seamless engagement with a       wide range of interoperable computational resources, both hardware and       software, that can be owned or leased; and (iii) creating and       automatically orchestrating the desired computational workflow on the       chosen infrastructure.
This has led to: very efficient use of resources; improved support of       products and services within industries and organisations based on the       application of HPC; affordable resource usage by businesses, communities       and individuals; and better universal understanding of the advantages of       HPC and HTC and how to realise them.
Thus, self-evidently, the research includes         work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the         public and voluntary sectors (including citizens); to the         invention of generation of ideas and artefacts such as P-GRADE which         have led to substantially improved insights by the end-users; and the         use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce         substantially improved products and processes.
Most of the impacts described below have been physically realised via the       P-GRADE Gateway implementation, which incorporates all the gateway       technologies referred to above.
Economic impacts       In the following companies, the gateway technologies have been used directly       to improve existing products, processes and services:       (2007-present): Correlation Systems Ltd (Israel).
(2008-present): Simsoft Ltd (Turkey).
(2008-present): E-Group Ltd (Hungary).
In the following companies, the new gateway technologies have been used within         the companies' own research programmes to improve existing         products, processes and services:       (2010-present): Cloudbroker Gmbh and Scale Tools Ltd (Switzerland);       4D Soft Ltd (Hungary); Atos Origin Sociedad An&#243;nima Espa&#241;ola (Spain);       Simul8 Corporation (UK); MaatG (Spain); Sony Europe Ltd (UK); Worldwide       Computer Company Ltd (Charity Engine); MoSGrid (Molecular Simulation       Grid), with: Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Origenis GmbH, BioSolveIT       GmbH, COSMOlogic GmbH &amp;Co. KG, GETLIG &amp; TAR, TURBOMOLE GmbH,       Schrodinger GmbH, and Oracle Deutschland (all Germany); IDGF (Stichting       International Desktop Grid Federation), with: Holografika Ltd (Hungary),       Unilever (Global).
(2013-present): CloudSigma AG (Switzerland); ASCOMP GmbH       (Switzerland); Ingeniera Y Control Electronico SA (Spain); 2MoRO Solutions       SARL (France); Podoactiva SL (Spain); Saker Solutions Ltd (UK); Eurobios       (France); Charles Robinson (Cutting Tools) Ltd (UK).
Performance has been improved in companies through highly skilled         people having taken up specialist roles that draws on their research       in new gateway technologies: Dr C Reynolds (OxFORD Asset Management); Dr Y       Zetuny (JP Morgan); Dr Ariel Goyeneche (UBS).
Impacts on public policy and services       In delivering a public service the new gateway technologies       have been adopted in the following organisations:       (2010-present): Academic Medical Center (AMC) Amsterdam       (Netherlands); Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) (Italy); Stichting       AlmereGrid (Netherlands); Erasmus Medical Center (Netherlands); Charite       Medical Center, Berlin, (Germany); IDGF (Netherlands); Renderfarm.fi       (Finland).
The development of services of benefit to the developing world, in       particular desktop grid computing, has been informed by the research:       (2010-present): the technologies have been transferred to       institutions in China, Taiwan, Ukraine, Russia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan;       IDGF worldwide desktop grid community.
Changes to education have been informed by research:       (2006-present): P-GRADE is used as a teaching tool in other HEIs       (eg.
Cranfield, Edinburgh, Westminster, HEIs in Hungary) and for PhD       training courses in the UK and worldwide.
Also, Desktop grids are       extracting additional value from existing multiple software license       procurements in universities (eg.
Westminster, Brunel and Portsmouth).
Finally, several National Grid Initiatives deliver public support services       for education based on P-GRADE, including those in: UK, Ireland, Croatia,       Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Australia,       HP-SEE (High-Performance Computing Infrastructure for South East European       Research Communities), BalticGrid,US Open Science Grid, TeraGrid, Swiss       BioGrid.
Impacts on society, culture and creativity       The work of the following charitable organisations has been influenced         by the research:       (2010-present): Charity Engine (UK).
Public interest and engagement in science and technology has been         stimulated by the research: (2010-present): IDGF       (Netherlands); Academica Sinica (Taiwan); Healthgrid (UK); INTECH Science       Centre &amp; Planetarium (UK).
