     Temkin's work on the prevalence of rape myths in the legal process has       effected change in a       number of ways that mitigate the risks of stereotyping.
In the court       itself, juries are now instructed       differently in ways which recognise Temkin's research.
Her work is       sought-after in training judges       and barristers and informs Ministry of Justice policy.
She has generated       debate around `real rape'       stereotyping across disciplines and among practitioners in jurisdictions       outside the UK, and has       generated a general public debate by her television, radio and newspaper       interviews (this is all       more particularly detailed as follows:     &#8226; Impact on trial process rules     The Crown Court Benchbook (the manual for trial judges) was       amended to include warnings to       the jury about the issue of stereotyping.
In Chapter 17 of the 2010       edition, Section 1, `Alerting       the jury to the danger of assumptions', contains illustrative directions       to juries that take account       of research findings, including those of Temkin.
Chapter 17 explicitly       refers to `Research by       those who are expert in the subject' and, on p. 356, footnote 646 cites       the `Justice Gap' book       [see Section 5, C1].
&#8226; Policy impact     The `Justice Gap' book led to a request from the Scottish Parliament to       submit evidence to the       passage of the Sexual Offences Bill 2008 (26 September 2008).
The Ministry of Justice appointed Temkin as peer reviewer for the       Ministry of Justice (2010)       Research Report Providing Anonymity to Rape Defendants: An Assessment         of Evidence.
Temkin provided a detailed analysis which demonstrated that key areas of       research had been       omitted from the draft report.
Temkin also set out the arguments for       retaining the present law,       which does not grant anonymity to defendants.
Most of these arguments had       been missed in       the draft.
She also set out the historical and psychological evidence.
[C2]     The final report concluded that there was not enough evidence to support       a change in the law in       accordance with Temkin's research findings; the consequence of this has       been that the law has       remained unchanged.
&#8226; Reshaping practitioners' attitudes     The primary end-users for Temkin's research are practice professionals       involved in the criminal       trial process for non-consensual sexual offences.
These include judges,       barristers, solicitors       and a range of expert witnesses drawn from medical, psychological, social       work and police       professions.
Temkin has undertaken training programmes for judges,       prosecutors and other       relevant professionals to highlight rape myths, as indicated below.
The       training examined the       key role of attitudes to rape in the processing of rape cases by the       criminal justice system.
In       particular it analyses rape myths, what they are and how they work.
The       purpose of this is, first,       to encourage those involved in the processing of rape cases to examine       their own attitudes,       which may influence the way they handle rape cases.
Second, the purpose is       to encourage the       challenging of rape myths when these are utilised by the defence in rape       cases.
Members of the       public who sit on juries may well harbour stereotypical ideas about rape       and, if these       stereotypes are encouraged in rape trials, this may affect their outcome.
This type of education       is therefore geared towards achieving fairer results in rape cases.
Training programmes have included:            `Rape Myths and their Implications', Sexuality and Sexual Health         Section, Royal Society of         Medicine, 14 March 2008.

Since 2010, Temkin has been a Member of the Board of the Diploma in the       Forensic and       Clinical Aspects of Sexual Assault (DFCASA), Society of Apothecaries of       London.
The Diploma       is concerned with the training of the forensic medical examiners (FMEs)       who are responsible for       the medical examination of male and female sexual assault complainants who       report to the       police.
These examinations are necessarily crucial to the legal process.
There has been       growing evidence that FMEs were inadequately trained and therefore failing       at this task.
Therefore the setting up of the Diploma to educate FMEs and raise the       standards of medical       examinations in this area was a very welcome development.
The Board's task       was to assist in       the setting up of the Diploma by proffering advice and support.
The       Diploma is research-based       so that the best treatment for victims can be given.
Jennifer Temkin's       research and advice have       assisted the creation of this Diploma along with that of other members of       the Board.
&#8226; Challenging the public perception of `real rape' (and thereby           correcting misperceptiions         about rape in the public mind and shaping the on-going debate about           sexual assault)     Temkin discussed her research and urged reform and changes in public       attitude to rape in a       range of radio and television interviews.
Examples include BBC, ITN       and Channel 4 News, Sky         News, Panorama, Dispatches, BBC Radio 4 World at         One, Law in Action, Woman's Hour, The         Moral Maze, File on Four, Radio 5 Live.
Temkin has also explained and canvassed her research online: `Rape Myths:       Why We Still       Believe Women "Ask for It"', The Times online, 11 September 2008       (with B. Krahe).
The `Justice         Gap' book received a detailed review in The Guardian, 1       April 2008.
Web blogs and other fora that discuss rape issues have used Temkin's       research in support of       arguments in favour of reform [C4].
