     This case study is an example of the impact of research on Professional       Practitioners and Services and specifically the development and       implementation of new guidelines for improved, cost effective delivery of       mouth care in children with cancer.
These first ever mouth care guidelines       are still in effect today and continue to be disseminated and communicated       widely through the 21 CCLG cancer treatment centres, associated bone       marrow transplant units (BMT) and beyond into shared care hospitals,       children's hospices and the international cancer community (1-3).
The       guidelines are included in the BMJ Evidence Centre as part of best       practice (4).
An audit of the uptake and use of the guidelines carried out in 2010 (5)       by the CCLG revealed that:     (i) the CCLG-PONF guidelines were being used in 19 of the 28 (68%) CCLG       centres and associated BMT units;     (ii) consistent advice was given by nurses to patients/parents on basic       oral hygiene, and this advice was commensurate with guideline       recommendations;     (iii) 90% of centres advised use of fluoride toothpaste (vs 45% prior to       the guidelines);     (iv) few therapies outside of the guideline recommendations were being       used;     (v) use of Nystatin, the preferred treatment at the time, had reduced by       40% (vs baseline); the guidelines recommended zero usage of Nystatin on       the grounds that it was systemically ineffective.
This reduction therefore       represented a significant step in achieving this zero-use objective.
A further survey (6) undertaken in 2013 by Independent Consultants,       conducted interviews with 7 senior nursing staff at 5 of the 21 cancer       centres.
Interview participants were all in post prior to the introduction       of the guidelines, oversaw their implementation and are currently managing       the delivery of treatment regimens for children.
Key findings from this       survey showed that:            When asked to rate the usefulness of the guidelines (scale from 1: no         use at all to 10: very useful) the average score against the following         four categories was: (i) evidence-based, 9.5; (ii) practical and         implementable 8.5; (iii) clearly communicated, 8.5; (iv) clinically         efficient, 8.
One Centre commented that the guidelines pushed the         perceived boundaries, resulting in greater patient comfort through the         more acute treatment periods.
When asked to score the benefits (scale from 1: no benefit; to 10:         very beneficial) following adoption of the guidelines all of the         criteria scored very positively, the average scores were: (i) general         prevention/reduction of mouth sores, 8; (ii) patient comfort, 8; (iii)         reduction in mouth infection, 7.5; (iv) reduction in hospital stay, 7;         (v) reduction in medicines, 9; (vi) better mouth care/hygiene, 9.
Several respondents stressed that a compromised mouth interfered with         normal recovery processes due to patients not eating and drinking as         they should.
Those specialist cancer wards interviewed no longer prescribe         Nystatin.
Prior to the introduction of the guidelines this was routinely         prescribed for all children undergoing cancer treatment except those         with brain tumours.
A course of Nystatin in children undergoing cancer         treatment would typically be 4 doses per day every day for 3 out of         every 4 weeks for six months.
A bottle of 30ml of Nystatin         (Non-proprietary) costs &#163;15.44 (7) and will serve approximately 20 doses         (5 days of treatment), so the average cost of Nystatin per child is         &#163;386.
Cancer Research UK data (8) estimates that 1600 new cases of child         cancer are diagnosed each year of which 25% are brain tumours, so about         1200 children would, prior to the introduction of the guideline, have         had a course of Nystatin.
Some children would have more than one course         if treatment was prolonged through extra cycles.
Based upon these         figures, complete cessation of Nystatin treatment represents a potential         minimum saving to the NHS of &#163;463,000 per annum, &#163;2.315 million over 5         years.
Children receive better mouth care, oral pain is reduced, and the         number of children returning to hospital for management of oral         complications as a result of mouth infection between cancer therapies         has reduced significantly.
Staff interviewed for the survey suggested         that re-admission due to complications of mouth infections has reduced         from 10% of children to 5% since the guidelines have been in use, a         reduction of 60 re-admissions per year.
On average a re-admission is 2         days costing &#163;1100.
The guidelines have saved &#163;66,000 per annum         (&#163;330,000 in 5 years) through reduced re-admissions as well as enhancing         child and parent quality of life.
A clear and immediate benefit described was the promotion and         importance of normal oral hygiene and the subsequent translation of this         in to the home environment through emphasising the cleaning of teeth and         keeping the mucosa healthy for the child with cancer and the rest of the         family.
Interviewees spoke about "instant impact", and the guidelines "got rid         of any surplus medicines/treatments which were not good for the         patient".
Respondents were unanimous that not using unpleasant tasting         oral products with children was beneficial.
Training and education of staff, supported by materials produced by         the CCLG/RCN Working Group, assisted with dissemination, and enabled the         risk stratification of oral care to have an impact: "no longer do         clinicians prescribe what they `think' is the right thing to use, and         therefore only children who need additional care at the outset, such as         BMT, receive it".
Education of parents has also been formalised, with staff mentioning         use of guidelines with parents.
"The guidelines were         empowering..........informing parents on what to look out for/how to         treat before it's left too long and the child is required to go back in         hospital for however long".
The guidelines are in use throughout the UK and beyond.
A 2013 workshop       at the International Society of Paediatric Oncology conference held in       Hong Kong revealed that delegates, from for example China, The       Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, USA and Canada were aware of the UK       guidelines and they had informed more local guideline development work and       thus influenced care internationally.
Gibson has continued to lead CCLG/RCN Working Group in gathering the       research-based evidence and further refining the guidelines.
The updated       guidelines are expected to be released in 2014.
In addition, Gibson has       participated in many international projects related to mouth care, with       respect to her internationally recognised expertise in this area (9-10).
