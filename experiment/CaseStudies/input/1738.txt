     Our research in the context of teachers' professional learning has ena       led teachers to de elop a critical understanding of their role as mentors       and to enact this role effectively in the practice setting.
The       development of the TISSNTE Needs Analysis tool was achieved through active       engagement with over 100 practitioners across the 12 European countries       involved in the TISSNTE project.
Teachers with responsibility for CPD and       Local Authority staff took part in the piloting and evaluation of the       survey questionnaire and interview schedule.
The outcomes of the TISSNTE       needs analysis exercise informed the development and delivery of a one       week Intensive Course on Mentoring (http://www.tissnte.eu/docs/IC/IC-overview-oo-2.pdf)       held in Budapest (12-17 October 2008).
It was aimed at practising teachers       supporting novice teachers in their professional development in the early       stages of their career.
The event was attended by 30 teachers from 13       European member states, who had received financial support from their       respective regional National Bureaus.
As evidenced in participant       feedback, the course contributed to teachers' and teacher educators'       professional learning by enhancing sensitivity to no ice teachers' needs,       facilitating a critical understanding of the complexity of the mentoring       role and developing skills and strategies employed in the effective       support of novice teachers.
These include: classroom observation,       monitoring of progress, evaluation and assessment of competence and       providing constructive feedback.
A further benefit of the TISSNTE research       was that the materials and resources produced for the Intensive Course are       used by the University of Lisboa (Portugal) to assist teachers in       supporting novice teachers' professional learning in schools.
On the basis of the EU and TDA funded research Jones received a number of       invitations to deliver key note lectures (Finland 2010; England 2013) and       run seminars/workshops (Norway, 2008; Hungary 2012) aimed at education       practitioners from education, health and social work.
The participants of       these dissemination and professional development events reported benefits       in terms of an increased awareness of the complexity of the mentoring       role, the wide range of strategies and skills that effective mentoring       requires and the reciprocal benefits accrued for themselves as individual       practitioners as well as on a departmental and institutional level.
For       example, a teacher educator, who attended the ESRC HEI KT Seminar on       Hybridity, Creativity and `New Professionalism' University of Chester,       June 2012 (http://www.chester.ac.uk/node/14086) requested permission       (email sent on 02.09.2012) to use the resources developed by Jones in 4       training workshops attended by 120 novice teachers.
An invitation was received from the CPDUpdate Editor to report       the key findings of the TDA funded research on the Impact of ITE       Partnerships on Schools.
CPDUpdate is a widely circulated magazine       amongst education professionals in schools.
One of its aims is to present       research findings in a digestible, easily accessible form to practitioners       (http://www.teachingexpertise.com/publications/cpd-update-80).
(See Jones, Campbell, McNamara &amp; Stanley, Developing professional       learning communities &#8212; the hidden curriculum of ITE mentoring, May 2009,       Issue 116, pp.
6-9).
Regionally, the research has informed the mentor training and development       programmes attended by education professionals, such as the modules       available within the Advanced Educational Practice (AEP) programme and the       free standing units of the Pick &amp; Mix programme.
Thus the research has       influenced the professional practice of over 100 individual classroom       practitioners, senior managers and teaching assistants in primary and       secondary schools and shaped the development of departmental and whole       school initiatives.
Examples include:            Enhanced mentoring coaching support for ne ly qualified teachers at         Merchant Taylors' Boys' School (Crosby);       Following completion of the Mentoring and Coaching module in 2011, a         teacher from Bebington High School (Wirral) was promoted to his school's         leadership team and set up a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) forum         with a long-term objective to develop a multiple mentor network with the         aim of improving the quality of teaching and the school's Ofsted         nspection result       Implementation of active listening skills as part of an effective         mentoring strategy employed in supporting adolescents at Notre Dame         Catholic College (Liverpool).
Formal participant evaluations indicate the extent to which participants       have benefited from these programmes:            All 3 participants from Clare Mount Specialist Sports College         attending the `Mentoring skills for Teaching Assistants' training         session in Fe ruary and June 2013 stated that it had had a `significant'         `good' impact on their understanding of the mentoring concept and its         application in the practice context.
97% (28/29)of the teachers attending the `Outstanding Mentoring'         session in Fe ruary 2013 stated that it had deepened and clarified their         understanding of hat constituted `outstanding mentoring' as defined y         Ofsted.
97% (31/32) of the participants completing the A P Mentoring and         oaching modules rated the professional relevance of the course as either         `good' (3), `Very good' (14) or `excellent' (14) and reported         `significant'/`Very significant' impact in relation to their own         professional de elopment, teaching skills, pupils' learning outcomes and         practice ithin their institution They reported benefits in relation to         their personal/professional development and their practice within the         school as well as learner development.
The course had enabled them to         extend their range of mentoring and coaching techniques, for example,         the use of `clean language' in feedback, hich resulted in improved         student responses in class and getting students to talk more and         generally improved relationships between teaching staff and students.
The coaching techniques acquired by school staff attending the LJMU         programme led to the introduction of peer mentoring and staff focus         groups for collaborative planning and development of learner support in         the school's professional development programme.
Feedback from the 16 teachers who completed the LJMU Mentoring and         Coaching module delivered at Notre Dame High School, Liverpool, in 2011         as part of the school's continuing professional development programme         indicates benefits accrued in relation to: informing professional         practice (12/16).
As particular benefits were highlighted: stronger         relationships with peers and pupils (6/16), mentoring techniques used         with pupils (8/16) and staff (6/16) and improved communication skills         (9/16).
This is what the participants said:          "I am able to use some of the mentoring techniques from the course with       pupils in the classroom, especially around listening and questioning "     "I have a deeper understanding of the mentoring process My new knowledge       now allows me to understand pupils better and access their needs at a       higher level "     "There has been an impact on our pupils from the staff who have engaged       in this course Some pupils have become more cooperative and open with       feelings and emotions."
"I now use learning communities more extensively within my role to focus       staff and encourage professional dialogue."
