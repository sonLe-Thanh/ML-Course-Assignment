     Our work on the Hall Technique has, through a structured approach to       assessing its effectiveness and generalisability, led to its       implementation and widespread adoption.
The impacts have been:     Enhancement of child dental patient experiences:            The clinical trial of use of the Hall Technique in general practice         found it to be preferred by children, parents and dentists [ii].
Its         high success rate and child acceptance has been corroborated through         clinical audit in Sheffield Dental School [1] and the Community Dental         Service, Glasgow [2].
Adoption of the Hall Technique as best practice:            In the wider international arena, Evans and Innes were         invited to Australia (Victoria and Tasmania) in 2010, New Zealand in         2011, Holland in 2011 and 2012 and Germany in 2013, to teach the Hall         Technique, and participate in discussions around its implementation in         these countries.
Two studies (FEAST HB in New Zealand in collaboration         with Dr Foster-Page at Otago University and The Australia Hall Technique         study with Professor Calache, Director, Clinical Leadership Education         and Research, Dental Health Services Victoria, The Royal Dental Hospital         of Melbourne) are also investigating use of the Hall Technique in         specific clinical environments prior to its adoption.
Both of these         studies have already generated positive initial findings and been         presented at conferences.
A pan-European study [3] found the Hall Technique to be the favoured         option by half of postgraduate students for treatment of decay in a         dentally-anxious child patient, evidence that it is becoming a standard         treatment option for specialists.
The Hall Technique was included as part of a national guidance         document published in April 2010 [4].
This has been formally adopted in         other countries including New Zealand and Poland.
Despite development work only beginning ten years ago, the technique         is taught as a standard part of the undergraduate curriculum in 15 out         of 16 undergraduate Dental Schools and all 18 Dental Therapy Schools in         the UK [5].
A survey of Scottish specialists [6] found 75% were using the Hall         Technique daily (45% frequently) and 65% stated that it would be their         first choice of treatment for a child with significant caries.
The E-Den Project (a joint NHS Education/tri-collegiate initiative)         commissioned an online teaching module on the Hall Technique as part of         its postgraduate training [7].
Improved child dental patient clinical outcomes:            Our randomised trial showed reductions in pain and infection and         reduced need for general anaesthesia extractions where the Hall         Technique was used as compared to standard treatment in general practice         [v].
Preformed metal crowns use has increased in Scotland over the last 10         years, from less than 600 in 2000-1 to over 7000 in 2011-2 [8].
Supporting change in philosophy of caries management and informing         debate:            The recently updated Cochrane systematic review has included the Hall         Technique in the comparison of biologically-orientated strategies         (stepwise, partial and no-caries removal), with complete caries removal         for managing caries in both primary and permanent teeth, concluding that         there were significant advantages to less invasive strategies such as         the Hall Technique [9].
An independent commentary concluded the Hall Technique was "an         effective, non-invasive treatment option ... [and] ... improve[d] pulpal         health and patient benefit from the smaller cavity size, no need for         local anaesthesia and a less traumatic procedure from the point of view         of child behaviour management" [5].
There has also been great interest in the Hall Technique         internationally, with a number of overseas senior clinical teachers and         public sector clinical dental directors visiting Dundee Dental School         specifically to find out more about the appropriateness of adopting the         Hall Technique.
These have included Professor E. van Amerongen and Dr H.         van Schrik (ACTA, Netherlands), Dr D. Butler (Tasmania, Australia), Dr         N. Blanksmann (Nijnmegan, Netherlands), Dr D. Marshall (Hawke's Bay, New         Zealand), and Professor T. Beckmann (Minnesota, USA).
NIHR-HTA issued a funding call (07/44/03) to investigate the impact         and benefit to children of fillings compared to no fillings.
However,         our competitive bid for inclusion of the Hall Technique as the basis for         an additional arm (http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hta/074403)         was accepted and funded, confirming the potential of the Hall Technique         as a restorative option for children.
This is a multi-centre UK-wide         randomised control clinical trial led by Innes, Clarkson,         Douglas and colleagues [10], designed to inform national policy and         teaching.
The Hall Technique has been core in informing the debate on whether the       "drill and fill" approach for managing caries in permanent teeth is still       appropriate.
It is set to have a significant impact on the oral health of       children by offering a simple method for managing caries, which is       applicable in general dental practice and preferred by children compared       to current methods.
