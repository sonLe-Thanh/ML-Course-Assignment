     Brandon and the series of UEA studies have had a direct and significant       impact on child protection policy and practice since 2008, with a reach       across the UK and internationally.
Findings from the two earlier studies (References         1, 2, 5, 6, 7) have continued to influence current policy and       practice alongside the third study (References 3, 7) and the most       recent study (Reference 4).
The pathways to impact have       been primarily through the publication and dissemination of the Biennial       Reports (References 1, 2, 3, 4) to all Local Safeguarding Children       Boards by the DCSF/DfE, the incorporation into required procedure and       practice nationally and locally and the role of Brandon in dissemination       and consultation on policy, practice and procedure, nationally and       internationally.
Journal articles (References 5, 6, 7) have       broadened the reach, especially internationally.
Beneficiaries are at all       policy and practice levels.
National impact             Government Policy: findings influenced the 2010 edition and the         2012 consultation edition of Working Together to Safeguard Children         in England.
The Brandon et al.
(2008, Reference 1)         recommendation for greater numbers of health visitors was taken up in         the 2009 Laming inquiry report, as well as four other references to the         studies.
Significant material from the studies was used in practice         guidance for Safeguarding Disabled Children (2009).
References         to these studies appeared in the three Munro Review Reports.
Brandon was         invited to give oral evidence to the Government Select Committee on the         Munro Review recommendations (October 2011) and to advise civil servants         about changes to Serious Case Review reporting in the Working Together         guidance being drafted (March 2012).
Brandon presented at UK `Four         nations' events on the development of child death review work         nationally.
&#8226; Contribution to social work reform: The NQSW Guide         for Supervisors of Newly Qualified Social Workers (2009) draws heavily         on Brandon et al (2008 Reference 1) The Social Work Task Force         Interim Report (2009) uses UEA Serious Case Review evidence about         supervision.
This evidence led to consultation with the General Social         Care Council and Children's Workforce Development Council on         implications for social work education.
Practitioners: National Government distribution of UEA reports         (2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, References 1, 2, 3, 4), reinforced by         two annual rounds of nine regional practice-focused seminars throughout         England in 2008 and 2009.
Brandon has given keynote addresses at Local         Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) conferences in England, Wales,         Scotland and Northern Ireland.
`Case Studies' in the reports advise         practitioners on how to link findings to practice.
Many LSCBs have UEA's         Serious Case Review reports on their website.
UEA has organised national         practice focused conferences in London and through the `Making Research         Count' network.
The Metropolitan Police Service (Child Abuse         Investigation Command) introduced a Child Risk Assessment Model using         UEA biennial studies' risk factors in 2011.
The Lead Officer's report to         Child Protection Committees in Scotland (2011), commended Brandon et al         for their `excellent research report' on child development knowledge         from Serious Case Reviews to all practitioners this report was initially         published in 2011 and incorporated into the 2012 biennial report           Reference 4).
Non-governmental groups: The NSPCC used evidence from the         Serious Case Review studies for its 2010 restructuring into seven         themes.
In 2011 their All Babies Count campaign used UEA's         findings in their campaign leaflet illustrating the ways in which         infants are at risk of serious harm.
The report on which the campaign         was based, mentioned the `hugely influential' Brandon et al report (Reference           1).
The 2013 NSPCC report How Safe are Our Children?
uses         the most recent study (Reference 4) substantially as a guide to         its messages about child death and the level of risk children face.
Society: Brandon played a significant role and led national         debate on protecting children from abuse - particularly in the context         of the death of `Baby P', through media interviews e.g.
Radio 4, Radio         5, local radio, BBC TV News, News 24, ITV News, Sky News, Guardian,         Telegraph, Daily Mail, New Statesman and professional press, e.g.
Community Care and Nursing Times.
International impact     Australia            Brandon and Thoburn were asked to advise the State of Victoria's         Minister for Families and Communities (March 2008).
Consultancy for New South Wales (NSW) Ombudsman Office about child         death review processes (April 2011) resulted in changed definitions of         neglect in NSW.
Presentation about child death through maltreatment to         Melbourne Judiciary (August 2010).
The keynote address and Masterclass at the 3rd Australasian         Child Death Review Conference in Sydney in 2012, together with previous         consultation, resulted in a significant change in policy- the         involvement of the child's family in the child death review.
This change         is being implemented in Victoria (and considered in other states).
Round Table events at La Trobe and Melbourne Universities in September         2007, 2010, and Melbourne University's Centre for Excellence 2010 and         2012.
