International press coverage       The hardback edition of The Richard Burton Diaries was published       in October 2012 and engaged a global audience.
It generated extensive       pre-launch publicity amounting to 120 items of press coverage from 1 Aug -       8 Oct 2012 including articles in the Wall Street Journal, the Hindustan         Times, and Le Figaro (C2).
On publication Williams fronted a       series of international `launch' events beginning at the Cheltenham       Literary Festival (13 Oct) before an audience of 800.
In the US, the       volume was launched at New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (16       Oct) and the British Consul General's Residence in Los Angeles (18 Oct)       (C3).
Press coverage was sustained with launch events in Singapore (7-9       Nov), Vancouver (21 Feb 2013) and Toronto (23 Feb), and by the publication       of the paperback edition (May 2013).
Williams used the publicity surrounding the launch events not only to       encourage sales of the Diaries, but also to draw public attention to the       new perspective on Burton promoted in the volume.
He gave a live interview       on NBC's `Today' show (16 Oct) with viewing figures of 5 million and       recorded 14 telephone interviews about the Diaries for US radio programmes       (27 Nov) including the Jim Bohannon show which was syndicated across 300       US radio stations (C4).
Between 13 October 2012 and 12 April 2013 he gave       a total of 16 talks, lectures and presentations about the Diaries to       public audiences, focusing particularly on what they reveal about Burton's       literary interests and aspirations.
His activities were noted in the Welsh       Assembly as significant not only in enhancing Burton's reputation and       legacy, but in helping `to raise the profile of Wales abroad' (C5).

Economic impact on the creative sector       As a result of this sustained publicity, sales of the Diaries had exceeded       50,000 by September 2013 (38,626 hardback; 9,500 paperback; 5,800 e-book)       with a cumulative recommended retail price of over &#163;1,100,000, making it       `Yale University Press' best-selling title of 2012' (C6).
With this level       of public interest in Burton's life and career so plainly demonstrated, a       number of film and television companies commissioned new programmes about       the actor.
A new biopic entitled `Burton and Taylor', was written and       produced by BBC4.
As one national newspaper television reviewer noted, `With         the release last year of Burton's candid, vivid diaries, it's a story         that was begging to be told on screen' (C7).
First broadcast on 22       July 2013 it attracted 1.26 million viewers.
A 30-minute BBC Wales       documentary, `The Richard Burton Diaries', was produced in consultation       with Williams who provided the producer with access to the manuscript of       the Diaries prior to its publication.
It was first screened on BBC1 Wales       on 12 Nov. 2012, attracting an audience of 97,000, and BBC4 schedulers       also took the opportunity to repeat the BBC Wales documentary immediately       after the `Burton and Taylor' biopic on 22 July when it attracted 611,500       viewers, and again on 23 and 26 July, to viewing audiences of 121,000 and       141,600 respectively (C8).
The week in which the biopic and the       documentary were screened saw a spike in sales of the book, which entered       the Amazon top 100.
With the paperback edition only in print since May       2013, and with and the sale of rights for a German translation to Haffmans       and Tolkemitt for publication on 16 Oct. 2013, the buoyant retail       performance of this title in the publishing sector is set to continue.

Generating new thinking and influencing creative practice       The new and more nuanced view of Richard Burton's life and career to       emerge from Williams' editing of the Diaries, has influenced the way       Burton has been portrayed, written about and remembered.
Dozens of press       reviews of the hardback edition have appeared since October 2012 in which       reviewers acknowledge that they offer a new slant on Burton.
The New         York Times Book Review noted the more studious side of his character       as a feature `of real interest in that Burton was almost as good a         writer as an actor, read as many as three books a day ... bought         countless books on every conceivable subject.'
In The Times,       meanwhile, the reviewer wrote that Williams' edition of the Diaries       revealed Burton as `someone who is reflective and thoughtful and         someone who engaged intellectually with the world around him' (C9).
These new perspectives, revealed in the Diaries by Williams' research, and       subsequently in his public talks on the subject, have fed directly into       recent depictions of Burton.
The actor who played Burton in the BBC4       biopic, `immersed himself in Richard Burton's recently published         diaries' in preparation for the role (C10), and reviews of the drama       attributed its relatively sympathetic portrayal of Burton to, among other       things, the availability of the Diaries, providing access to Burton's own       perspective on events (C11).
iv.
Commemorating Burton       Initiatives to commemorate and celebrate Burton's career were also boosted       by the publication of, and press interest in, the Diaries.
One Assembly       Member, addressing the National Assembly for Wales on 23 October 2012,       predicted that the publication of the Diaries, and the associated US       publicity, `will enhance the campaign to get a star for Richard Burton         on the Hollywood walk of fame' (see C5).
This campaign was run by       the Cardiff-based Western Mail newspaper, and its co-ordinator       noted the timely impetus provided by Williams' edition of the Diaries       which, `placed Burton and his work at the forefront of peoples' minds         once more' and `brought the man and his stories to a whole new         generation of fans' (C12).
The campaign reached a successful       conclusion on 1 March 2013, just five months after the Diaries' launch,       when the Burton `star' was unveiled next to that of Elizabeth Taylor on       Hollywood Boulevard.
