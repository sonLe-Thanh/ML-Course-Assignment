     Our research led to a substantial change in the treatment of acute       ST-elevation MI in the NHS.
Primary angioplasty has replaced thrombolysis       as the standard treatment.
This has resulted in improved outcomes for       people with ST-elevation MI.
Impact on policy     In 2008 the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)       was updated to set out the new national strategy using primary angioplasty       instead of thrombolysis [S1].
We reported our research directly to the       Department of Health CHD Policy Team and as a result the update cited our       independent research (pages 10-11) that concluded that national roll-out       of primary angioplasty was feasible and likely to be cost-effective.
NHS       Improvement was then tasked with facilitating the national roll-out of       primary angioplasty for patients with ST-elevation MI [S2].
Impact on practice            Treatments provided: National audit data show that following our         research, primary angioplasty replaced thrombolysis as the standard NHS         treatment for people with ST-elevation MI.
The Myocardial Infarction         National Audit Project (MINAP) is a national audit of management of MI         in England, Wales and Northern Ireland [S3].
According to the Tenth         MINAP Public Report published in 2011 [S4], 82% of patients in England         who received any reperfusion treatment between April 2010 and March 2011         received primary angioplasty compared to 63% in 2009/10.
Increases were         also seen in Wales (22% to 30%) and Belfast (59% to 99%).
An interim         report on the national roll-out of primary angioplasty published by NHS         Improvement in 2010 [S5] and based on MINAP data showed that between         2008 and 2010 the proportion of patients in England receiving any         reperfusion treatment who were treated with primary angioplasty         increased from 42% to 73%.
Patient management pathways: In accordance with findings from our         economic analysis the model for providing primary angioplasty proposed         by the National Service Framework and promoted by NHS Improvement         involved direct transfer of patients to the catheter laboratory of         specialist hospitals.
This represents a substantial change from previous         practice of taking all patients with MI to the nearest hospital         emergency department.
According to the MINAP report [S4] 75% of patients         that were treated with primary angioplasty in 2010-11 were admitted         directly to a specialist hospital with a catheter laboratory in England,         79% in Wales and 60% in Belfast.
Achieving time targets: In 2010-11 90% of eligible patients in         England, 68% in Wales and 87% in Belfast were treated with primary         angioplasty within the target of 90 minutes of arrival at the heart         attack centre [S4].
Furthermore, 81% of eligible patients in England,         75% in Wales and 90% in Belfast were treated with primary angioplasty         within 150 minutes of calling for professional help.
The findings of the         organisational evaluation assisted the process of implementation and         helped to ensure that time targets for providing primary angioplasty         were achieved.
Impact on patient outcomes     After our findings were reported and implemented through the National       Infarct Angioplasty Pilot in 2007, mortality from ST-elevation MI in the       NHS fell from 10.6% in 2006-2007 to 8.7% in 2010-11 [S4].
Randomised       trials have shown that primary angioplasty reduces mortality compared to       thrombolysis, so although other factors may have contributed to this       improvement, it is reasonable to attribute some of the improvement to       increased use of primary angioplasty.
Economic impact     An impact assessment based on our cost-effectiveness analysis was       undertaken by the Department of Health in 2008 [S7] and estimated that       over three years the policy would cost &#163;44.4 million and would yield       &#163;337.9 million in benefits, measured as discounted quality-adjusted life       years (QALYs) to patients and monetised on the basis of an estimate of       social value of a QALY at &#163;40,000.
Impact on older patients     Primary angioplasty has not been restricted on the basis of age and       reductions in mortality have been seen in older people with ST-elevation       MI.
In-hospital mortality reduced from 30.1% in 2003 to 19.4% in 2010 in       those aged 85 or more (relative risk = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.38-0.75, P&lt;       0.001) [S6].
Impact on the wider clinical community     Although implementation of primary angioplasty is driven by national       policy, we believe that it is important to engage the clinical community.
Thus, in addition to publications in clinical journals outlined above, we       have produced an overview of our findings for ambulance paramedics [S8]       and have engaged directly with clinicians through presenting our findings       at clinical conferences, such as the College of Emergency Medicine Annual       Scientific Meeting [S9,S10].
