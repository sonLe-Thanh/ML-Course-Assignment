Providing expert advice to governments, thereby influencing policy         and/or practice: The       Corpus and associated research [A, B, E] has       significantly benefitted Cadw, highlighting serious       heritage protection, conservation and display issues and impacting on       management policies [1,6].
Fieldwork (1997-2010) published in the Corpus indicated poor       monument protection (e.g.
lack of       scheduling, church redundancy, theft, vandalism, weathering, vegetation)       which was instrumental,       through Cadw, in forming the National Committee for Recording and         Protection of Early Medieval         Inscribed Stones and Stone Sculpture (2002-10; chair, Edwards 2004-,       meetings biannually),       responsible to the Ancient Monuments Advisory Board (AMAB), and included       representation by the       Church in Wales, Diocesan archaeologists, the Welsh Archaeological Trusts       (WATs), NMW and       Cadw.
When the AMAB ceased the Committee was reformed independently to       embrace Welsh       medieval sculpture to c.1540 (2012-, chair, Edwards).
The Corpus       `present condition' statements       gathered during fieldwork were used to complete a graded `At Risk List' of       monuments (2008-10),       part of Cadw's Welsh Historic Environment Strategic Statement: Action         Plan (2009-11) [1, 6].
Cadw use this with the published Corpus in their on-going review       of scheduled monuments and it       informs Cadw grant-aid decisions with emphasis on safeguarding monuments       most at risk.
Also       highlighted by Corpus research were problems with the narrow legal       definition of a `Scheduled       Monument' resulting in vulnerable monuments, e.g.
portable sculpture       fragments, remaining totally       unprotected.
As a result Cadw (with Historic Scotland) commissioned and       received positive legal       advice on widening scheduling criteria originally envisaged as part of the       never enacted       parliamentary Draft Heritage Protection Bill (2008).
Priorities       for future work on early medieval       inscribed stones and stone sculpture in Wales, particularly their       archaeological context, were       adopted in the 2009-11 Wales Research Framework Review, which       guides Cadw/RCAHMW       policy [7].
Protecting and interpreting cultural heritage for audiences external         to the academy,         developing stimuli to tourism: The Corpus and related       research [A-E] has impacted on       protecting and interpreting Welsh cultural heritage benefitting different       audiences in Wales and       globally.
Products of Corpus research, including images taken       especially by RCAHMW, are being       put on the RCAHMW Coflein (National Monuments Record) website and       results have begun       impacting on site entries on the Archwilio database website, the       Historic Environment Records for       the WATs, thereby reaching a very wide audience [2, 8].
Edwards's       publications [B-C] resulted in       her co-curating an exhibition (with popular catalogue) on Edward Lhuyd in       the National Library of       Wales, Aberystwyth (29.06.-21.08.2009), commemorating the tercentenary of       his death and       bringing together manuscripts from international collections (4 specially       conserved from Trinity       College Dublin) for the first time since.
The reach of this impact on       public awareness is signified by       the audience of 3184 recorded visitors, including from Australia, across       Europe, Japan, Korea, the       USA, with very positive responses in the Visitors' book e.g.
`a remarkable       man whose       achievements it is good to be reminded of'.
A touring version was shown in       Oswestry Public       Library (Shropshire) near his birthplace (12.2009-01.2010) [3].
Corpus and related research [A-E] resulted in       Edwards lecturing widely (2008--2013) to       community and non-academic audiences across Wales, in England and Ireland       e.g.
Current       Archaeology, Archaeology Festival (Cardiff, 02.09); Royal Society of       Antiquaries of Ireland (Dublin,       03.09); George Arbour Stephens Lecture, Carmarthen (01.12), with audiences       of over 100 at each       [4], and Oswestry and Border History Group day-school (10.10), with       an audience of over 250.
Popular articles include `Wales after Rome', Western Mail, Welsh       History Month, 14.05.13 (print       circulation 25,500 + website).
Rediscovery of a lost monument in Corpus         II resulted in extensive       media coverage e.g.
Fox News 18.06.13.
Edwards was consultant to       Touchstone (2010-11),       which reported to Cadw on better interpretation of early medieval       Christian monuments for tourists       and communities in Wales, now being implemented through heritage walks and       `pilgrimage' trails       via Cadw's Pan-Wales Heritage Interpretation Plan (launched       4.12.12) seeking to improve physical       and intellectual access to heritage sites to a wider range of visitors and       promoting heritage tourism       [9].
Corpus related research [D] led to the Project         Eliseg excavations (local partners Llangollen       Museum), a Cadw Guardianship monument leading to improved conservation [1].
They have had       wide community and media impacts through open days (e.g.
Festival of       British Archaeology /       Llangollen International Music Festival fringe 2010, 350 visitors       approx.
), radio/TV/newspaper       coverage (in Welsh and English, e.g.
BBC, S4C, The Leader) and       far-reaching website coverage       e.g.
BBC north-east Wales; blogs (Antiquarian's Attic; Facebook; You       Tube).
The 2011 project film       posted on Past Horizons Archaeology TV has received 24,242 views       (to 31.07.2013) [5].
