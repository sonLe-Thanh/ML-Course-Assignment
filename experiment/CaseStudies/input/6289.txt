     In 2004, BookTrust painted a bleak picture of the short fiction form in       the UK, stressing the predominance of the novel and the declining share of       mainstream publications of short story collections.
Yet the report also       recognised a tentative new trend: the form's re-emergence in the       independent publishing sector.
In October 2010 MacLeod established the       website Thresholds International Short Story Forum, with its name evoking       `brinks of discovery', as well as the `thresholds poetics' that are often       considered key to the short story form.
The site's primary aim was &#8212; and       is still &#8212; to create an open platform where short story writers, editors,       publishers, students and academics can `meet' for an exchange of ideas and       mutual support.
The site has become a valuable resource for writers with       information about prizes, calls for submissions, as well as tips and       guidance on writing from esteemed writers.
Thus Thresholds has created a       vibrant community of those interested in the short story form, from       Literature and Creative Writing students to editors, teachers, academics,       writers and readers of short fiction.
Since its launch Thresholds has       attracted over 154,000 visits (to 31/7/2013) and 1,113 registered members       worldwide; growth in visit numbers from 2011/12 to 2012/13 was 74% and       13/14 figures indicate that this is set to continue).
It has a Facebook       discussion group with 750 members, a membership that grows weekly, and       nearly 1,800 `followers' on Twitter (as well as a lively twitter feed).
Thresholds distinctively combines an awareness of contemporary       developments in the short story, a real sense (and evidence) of day-to-day       engagement with its members and followers, and the new, commissioned       content which reflects MacLeod's particular approach to the form.
The beneficiaries are:            Short story writers;       Those involved in supporting the short story literary form (literary         organisations, columnists and commentators);       The wider interested public.
The impacts, as described and evidenced below, are:            Individuals who become inspired and act on the basis of engagement         with Thresholds e.g.
start writing, renew writing efforts, take a         different approach to with their writing;       Individuals whose success is influenced by their engagement with         Thresholds;       Individuals who experience the satisfaction of new skills, new         literary knowledge, and/or new connections because of their engagement         with Thresholds;       Enhanced activities of those who support the short story form e.g.
Charleston/Small Wonder; Asham Award, Arvon Foundation, national news         media.
The site features a range of material commissioned by MacLeod: stories,       talks, masterclass interviews, and articles by acclaimed writers,       academics and editors.
It also features blogs, reviews and author profiles       submitted by members.
An up-to-date list of writing competitions,       submission opportunities, conferences, festivals, and funding applications       is available on the site, as well as other short-story-related resources.
Thresholds' `Friend and Partner organisations' include The Charleston       Trust, The Sunday Times, The Royal Society of Literature, The         London Magazine and the Arvon Foundation.
Original and new content       on the site includes (but is not limited to) 24 author profiles, 11       interviews (including Joanna Trollope and Hanif Kureishi), 13 writing       exercises, 94 `we recommend' entries, 97 entries in the discussion section       (48 on the short form, 40 on writing stories, 17 on submitting), of which       ~90% has been contributed by people outside of the Thresholds team.
According to a recent Thresholds members' survey (June 2013) (Number of       respondents =61), 62% of the respondents currently describe themselves as       a `writer', 15% as student, 5% as literary professional and 3% as       academic.
66% of respondents visit the site at least once or twice a week       (24% more than 3 times a week), with 97% of respondents visiting at least       once a month.
The survey revealed that the three most popular areas of the       site are the stories, features and submission deadlines.
Nearly 60% of       respondents have submitted `a story, essay or article' after reading of a       call for submissions at Thresholds; over a third state (35%) that they       have had `a publication or writing success' as a result.
Successes       reported by respondents include broadcast on Radio 4, PhD funding awards,       a variety of competition long-listings and short-listings, a performance       of a member's story by the renowned WordTheatre, and assorted       publications, including publication at Thresholds (39%).
Furthermore, many       respondents confirmed that various sections of the site had helped them to       develop their own short-story writing i.e.
Features (51%), Interviews       (44%), Masterclass podcasts (16%).
In terms of stimulating other types of activity 45% of respondents said       that the info on Thresholds, Thresholds Facebook or Thresholds at Twitter       encouraged them to attend a short story event, literary festival or       literary conference.
10% of respondents applied for a job, a bursary or a       fellowship after seeing it advertised on Thresholds or Thresholds       Facebook.
Thresholds has introduced its members to new short story fiction       and expanded the range of short story writers read by its members as       confirmed by over 80% of respondents.
Respondents took the opportunity to       provide a range of qualitative feedback (around 200 individual comments)       which was overwhelmingly positive and constructive.

4).
Enhanced activities of those who support the short story form            Dr. Jose Varghese, editor, Lakeview Literature Journal, India: `We         started getting international submissions because our creative writing         contests were publicised in Thresholds &#8212; and that was one reason why we         thought of bringing out such a good international journal.'
Comma Press to Thresholds: [T]hank you so much for coming all the way         to London and conducting such a thoughtful and in-depth interview [with         author Hassan Blasim].
We really appreciate your time, and all the help         and support Thresholds has given us in the past.'

'; I         `love that it's international.'
Vibrancy and interaction: `I love Thresholds.
So many websites become         dormant or start "recycling" things, but Thresholds always feels         fresh.
'; `I particularly like the fact that it's so regularly         maintained; it's the place to go for current [] short story news.'
Contribution to the form: `a wonderful forum for what is often a         poorly publicised art form, so it's important in spreading the word         about writers and texts';`The essays/features are brilliant &#8212; it is very         well put together with v. informative features on writers and         collections.
';          In addition, by way of evidence of Prof. MacLeod's impact on the short       story form in wider terms, she has promoted the short story and Thresholds       at a range of public events during the REF period.
For example, her       invited talk and panel discussion at the Sunday Times Literary Awards       (March 2013) which was described as a highlight by one VIP and globally       renowned writer, "... a real highlight for me.
As is seeing the short         story rise in the public consciousness the way it has the last few years         ..".
Similarly, an award-winning literary journalist described       MacLeod's talk as `THE BEST overview of short story writing I've ever         heard'.
