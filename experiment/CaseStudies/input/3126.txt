     The use of thickening agents in packaged food materials is widespread and       as the global market for pre-packaged foodstuffs is worth in excess of       US$3 trillion, developments in thickening technology are of considerable       economic benefit to manufacturers and processors.
The range of thickeners       that is in current use is generally based upon polysaccharides (starches,       vegetable gums including xanthan gum), or proteins (collagen, gelatin).
Thickeners are selected depending upon their suitability in specific       applications, related to differences in texture, appearance, taste and       responses to chemical and physical conditions.
The research of UoN has       resulted in the creation of two new forms of xanthan gum (Hydraxan and       Thixate) which will benefit industry by overcoming problems with       unmodified xanthan gum, and enabling the formulation of foodstuffs with       enhanced taste, texture and nutritional properties.
This research has been       enabled by the close partnerships that the University has with the       industry.
Hydraxan     As a result of the recognised expertise of the Food Science group at the       University of Nottingham, CSM supported three research projects to a value       of &#163;500k over the period 2002-2004 with a focus on optimum delivery of       functional ingredients.
UoN had a long-established interest in developing       a new class of food additives/ingredients using expertise on extrusion and       hydrocolloids and this led to the development of Hydraxan.
Production       trials with Dupont (a major ingredient manufacturer) held in 2008, were       successful.
In a statement, the Senior Principal Scientist, Hydrocolloids       Science at Dupont stated that 'In 2008 Danisco (now DuPont) entered         into an agreement with Nottingham University to evaluate proprietary         technology relating to a novel formulation of Xanthan gum, cf.
the         patent application which is jointly owned by the University         WO/2006/065136 regarding 'Water-Dispersible Xanthan Gum Containing         Composition".
The objectives of the trials were to demonstrate that the         novel readily dispersible xanthan could be made from DuPont xanthan, to         see if the process could be scaled up and to provide kg quantities of         the material for further application trials.
These objectives were met         in full" (Source 1).
Work to scale up production has been a key focus of work with Hydraxan in       the commercial sector.
The patent was granted in 2010 in several       countries, including the UK, and on 9th October 2012 was       exclusively licenced to Biopolymer Solutions Ltd, an East Midlands SME.
The technology has been given a boost as a result of further recent DEFRA       LINK funding "Development of physically modified hydrocolloids for       enhanced taste perception" (start date March 2012) and work is currently       being carried out by CP Kelco, a US company with major expertise on       xanthan.
In a statement (2013), the Distinguished Research Fellow of CP       Kelco said "Over the last six months we have collaborated with the         staff at the University of Nottingham to understand Hydraxan; a new form         of xanthan developed by the University.
CP Kelco intends to collaborate         with the University of Nottingham and the French company Clextral for a         large scale trial in early 2013.
This trial is intended to provide a 100         Kg or larger sample of Hydraxan for commercial trials.
The Hydraxan         process developed at the University is intended to provide a different         texture as compared to the unprocessed xanthan gum.
Our work with         rheological properties and optical microscopy indicates that a Hydraxan         solution is composed of varying amounts of molecularly dispersed polymer         along with another phase of swollen but still associated particles or         soft bits of gel.
Compared to other composites, Hydraxan is unique since         the composite is formed of a single material; some of the thickening         comes from molecularly dispersed xanthan and some comes from highly         swollen small particles" (Source 2).
Further process scale       up work with Clextral (a major extruder manufacturer) (Source 3)       to levels of 50kg/hr was successfully completed in January 2013.
250kg of       xanthan was processed showing that the structural transformation       discovered by the University had occurred in the process and that product       structures can be tuned by varying the process conditions.
Work on       performance in sauces is being driven by Dovedale Foods, another East       Midlands SME, who are streamlining production processes, making high       quality production accessible to the SME community (SMEs make up 90% of       the UK food manufacturing sector).
Although the use of Hydraxan is at an early stage the food industry       considers it to have major potential in both human and animal foods.
A       statement from the Physical Chemistry and Gels Manager at Mars Petcare       confirmed that "There are a number of factors that inhibit higher usage         of unmodified xanthan in our processes and products.
This modified raw         material would help significantly to overcome those issues and that is         why we are interested to pursue it further" (Source 4).
Thixate     The catalyst for the development of Thixate was a request by Reckitt       Benckiser (a pharmaceutical/healthcare company) to use UoN expertise on       hydrocolloids to understand an observation of the unusual behaviour of       xanthan in a major product system (underpinning research project f).
While the initial work [C] has not yet been exploited the patented       opportunity would have value in over the counter markets worth $33bn.
The       initial work was extended to the very important and novel area of       xanthan-particulate blends &#8212; termed `Thixate'.
It has been possible to       integrate the two innovations by blending the "current" molecular xanthan       with the novel particulate form prepared by the extrusion process.
Patents       have been filed by UoN on the work and in-product studies are currently       being undertaken by Eminate (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the University       of Nottingham).
This collaboration has led to a third patent being filed       and negotiations are underway for uptake by Dupont (Source 1).
In       a statement (2013), the Managing Director of Eminate stated "Over the         last 24 months, Eminate has been working with Dr Tim Foster at the         University of Nottingham to develop one of his patents (related to         xanthan) into a commercial product.
Building on the underpinning         research work completed by Dr Foster and his research group on the         fundamental science, the Eminate-led team has now developed a series of         prototypes in a product range under the brand name Thixate.
This range         is a series of foods and drinks which contain the Thixate ingredient as         described in the patent and have been shown to provide consumers with a         feeling of satiety and reduced calorie intake at the next meal" (Source         5).
Additional opportunities expanding the thixate technology into       controlled release of nutrients and drugs have been identified, which       product range is one of the core components of Eminate's commercial       strategy, providing "commercially-viable, innovative ingredients for         health" (Sources 5,6).
The Thixate technology will be       applied to use of concentrates for distributed manufacture of food, closer       to the consumer; to cut down on waste and decrease distribution costs of       foods containing high volumes of water.
Work in this area resulted in the       IChemE Award for Innovation and Excellence in the Food and Drink sector in       2009.
