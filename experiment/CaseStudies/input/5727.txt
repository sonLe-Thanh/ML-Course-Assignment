     Data Assimilation is an essential part of the Met Office forecasting       procedures [C].
However, a significant problem faced by the Met Office is       that of assimilating data in the presence of atmospheric inversion layers       or other fine structures.
Misrepresenting these layers in the       computations, leads to spurious correlations between observed data and the       underlying physical structures.
This has a negative effect on the       assimilation of data (for example from radiosondes) into the forecast,       degrading the forecast performance.
The nature, and societal impact, of       this problem is described in the following two quotes from publications       authored by Met Office personnel.
A common problem in forecast case-studies is the misrepresentation of         inversions and stratocumulus layers in the assimilation due to         inappropriate background error covariances, e.g.
smooth and broad         vertical correlation functions which do not allow accurate fitting of         high resolution radiosonde soundings.
This inhibits the ability to         diagnose realistic stratocumulus layers and boundary-layer structures       which then results in poor forecasts.
An example of the         impact of this problem in the Met Office NWP system happened in December         2006 when poor visibility at Heathrow led to significant           travel disruption during the Christmas period.
In this         instance radiosonde observations were not able to improve the analysis         of the inversion and so the fog was not accurately forecast.

Accurate         representation of the boundary layer in NWP models is important for         instance in the forecasting of fog or icy roads.
Met Office       Publication [B]     To address this problem, Budd and his team at Bath have been working with       the Manager of Data Assimilation R&amp;D at the Met Office and his       colleagues, to develop cheap and reliable methods to better resolve the       atmospheric features and increase the accuracy of the data assimilation       methods.
In a series of collaborative (and partly Met Office funded)       projects [D,E,F], they combined the PMA algorithm, developed at Bath and       described in [2-6], with the Met Office data assimilation software.
This       work used the adaptive mesh transformations generated by the PMA       algorithm, to rescale the spatial coordinates used in the data       assimilation calculation.
This rescaling meant that the vertical       correlations of the background error covariance matrix in the inversion or       ground boundary layers were much better resolved.
In particular this has       improved the ability of the assimilation system to accurately use       high-resolution information like radiosonde soundings.
A key breakthrough       in this work was the incorporation of an appropriate monitor function of       the potential vorticity atmospheric state (as described in [4,5]) into the       rescaling algorithm.
The PMA algorithm has proved especially appropriate,       flexible and robust for this procedure, and has been particularly suitable       when dealing with real meteorological data, which can be very noisy.
The development of adaptive grids based on the parabolic Monge-Ampere         equation at the University of Bath provides an affordable technique         which can be tuned to meet the challenges of real data.
It works through         a monitor function, which can be chosen to meet a variety of user         requirements, and can be smoothed to ensure the resulting grid can be         safely used in an operational environment.
[G] Letter from the       Manager of Data Assimilation R&amp;D at the Met Office     Adaptive data assimilation software, based directly on the research at       Bath described in Section 2, was first incorporated into the operational       data assimilation code for the Met Office 4km grid UK models in November       2010 [A,B].
Operational codes make forecasts every six hours [H] and the       operational codes, incorporating the PMA algorithm, have been used to       forecast the UK weather for the last three years.
More advanced Met Office       codes based on the results in [6] are being developed and are forming part       of the ongoing Data Assimilation research at the Met Office.
The application to data assimilation is particularly suitable for this       technique, as the resulting grid is only used to define spatial       correlation structures, not to apply a flow solver.
As a result         this technique has been used in our operational UK analysis for         the last 3 years and an extended formulation will be       incorporated for trialling within the next 12 months.

A direct consequence of this work is an improvement of the Met Office       forecasting skill in terms of the so-called UK Index (which is a measure       of the forecasting skill of limited-area NWP models over the UK and is       based on forecasts of selected parameters and for a selected set of       positions verified by comparison with available station observations       across the UK at 3- to 6-hourly intervals).
... the adaptive mesh transformation led to positive impact in the         forecast skill of UK models both in winter and summer.
Analysis RMS         errors are reduced with respect to radiosonde, aircraft, SEVIRI and         ground GPS observations for both periods.
Background RMS errors are         reduced with respect to aircraft, surface and ground GPS observations         for both periods and also with respect to radiosonde observations for         relative humidity in the lower part of the troposphere and for potential         temperature around the inversions.
These results are consistent with the         change in the monitor function structures coming from the updated         normalization procedure and recalculation of the adaptive mesh within         the nonlinear minimization procedure.
These led also to improvement of         the background state in the full cycled analysis/forecast system and         therefore to better representation of the vertical structure of the         boundary layer.
For these reasons this new version of the adaptive mesh         transformation was implemented operationally in the Met Office data         assimilation system in July 2011 for UKV and UK4 models.
Met Office       Publication [A]     Obviously, the improvement of the Met Office forecasting skill has       economic and societal impacts.
In particular, the enhanced resolution of       the ground boundary layer, provided by the PMA algorithm, has led to an       improvement in the accuracy of the prediction of fog hazards and road       temperatures.
These temperature predictions are used, for example, to       provide input for the Met Office OpenRoad software [J] that is       employed to advise local councils on ice hazards and the need (or not) for       road gritting.
The improvement of 2m temperature forecasts is relevant for the Met         Office OpenRoad system which provides 24 hour forecasts of road state to         companies and local authorities to help maintain essential road         services, mainly in winter.
For this reason, the adaptive mesh transform         was implemented operationally in two Met Office high-resolution         limited-area models (UK4 and UK1.5) on 2 November 2010.
Met Office       Publication [B]     A new method of adapting computational grids to the expected solution         is now being exploited in the high resolution analyses used to drive the         short-range forecasts for the UK.
Particular benefit is found in         predicting low-level temperatures, which is very important for         maintaining the road network in a safe condition and for predicting fog.
[K] Email from the Manager of Data Assimilation R&amp;D at the Met Office     In the winter of 2011/12, the Met Office provided OpenRoad based       forecasts for over 350 routes in the UK.
The use of OpenRoad reduces the       impact of cold weather on road networks, in particular on road safety,       and, via more accurate forecasting of road temperatures, leads to a more       cost-effective use of grit supplies (gritting can cost a council in the       order of &#163;10k to &#163;15k per day).
Moreover, since salt is a corrosive       substance, avoidance of gritting when it is not necessary, leads to       savings for road users in general and to a reduction of damage to the       transport infrastructure in particular.
In the USA, it has been estimated       that the total costs, including these indirect ones, of using salt are       three times greater than the direct costs.
But even this is likely to       underestimate the total costs, as environmental damage caused by salt run       off into the ecosystem is not taken into account.
