 Landry's research has had impact by influencing Turkish cultural policymakers, creating new opportunities for tourism, promoting awareness of Ottoman history internationally, and benefitting cultural providers through collaborations.
Influencing cultural policymakers in Turkey The Ottoman equestrian angle initially engaged Turkish policymakers and the business community.
The 2009 Evliya &#199;elebi Ride was sponsored by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism as beneficial for international tourism, by the Turkish Jockey Club and Zetino!lu Yem (a feed company) for promoting Turkish equestrianism, and by Avis-Ko&#231;, K&#252;tahya Porcelain, G&#252;ral Porcelain, and the Joukowsky Foundation for raising awareness of Ottoman heritage, including the traditional arts of Bursa silk and K&#252;tahya ceramics reported by Evliya.
The 2009 Ride's international significance can be most clearly seen in its having proved `crucial' to the `successful case' put by the Turkish National Commission of UNESCO for making Evliya a `Man of the Year' for 2011.
[5.1] As a Commission member states, `When an international team of scholars recognises the importance of an Ottoman in this way, it becomes clear to all' how Evliya `is truly a figure deserving international status and recognition'.
[5.1] The Ride prompted UNESCO to support two major international conferences in 2011, in Ankara and Paris [5.1], and led to numerous conferences and festivals throughout Turkey and elsewhere.
[5.1, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7] Public interest generated by the 2009 Ride also played a leading role in the recognition of the Evliya &#199;elebi Way (hereafter E&#199;W) by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and UNESCO as Turkey's first equestrian Cultural Route, following approval by the TURSAB Eco-tourism group for promoting sustainable tourism in rural areas where local economies will benefit (15/01/2011).
[5.2] The project's continuing significance on an international scale is borne out by its role in Evliya's inclusion in the UNESCO Memory of the World register in April 2013.
[5.1] Creating new opportunities for tourism with economic benefits The Ride boosted the number of tourists visiting Evliya's ancestral province of K&#252;tahya from 81,855 in 2008 to 170,597 in 2010; the number of nights spent there by tourists increased from 316,201 in 2010 to 579,717 in 2011.
[5.3] The E&#199;W's international reach continues to expand, with Time magazine reporting how `the spirit of Turkey's greatest adventurer rides once again ... traveling on horseback ... truly conjures up Evliya's ghost' (23/01/2012), and the Guardian's recent recommendation of the Way for exploring `some of the country's most spectacular landscapes' and `villages off the beaten track' (23/03/2013).
[5.5] The impact of the 2009 Ride and E&#199;W commercial tours since 2010 have led `directly' to `significant growth' in Dilari's business of leading equestrian expeditions, increasing from "17,000 in 2009 to "91,000 in 2013.
[5.4] International equestrian agencies - eg Equitours (USA), In The Saddle (UK), Pferd und Reiter (Germany) - are sending riders from as far away as Brazil, testifying to international reach.
The E&#199;W has now been ridden by over 70 riders from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, South Africa, Belgium, France, and Turkey.
Commercial benefits to local communities cannot yet be measured, but Bursa and K&#252;tahya have supported further development of the E&#199;W.[5.3, 5.4] With Finkel and Kate Clow, founder of the Lycian Way, Landry co-authored the guidebook to the route, The Evliya &#199;elebi Way: Turkey's First Long-Distance Walking and Riding Route (Istanbul: Upcountry [Turkey] Ltd, 2011), pp.
160; ISBN 0-9539218-9-1.
Offering detailed itineraries for walkers, cyclists, and equestrians, and historical descriptions of sites noticed by Evliya, the book was favourably reviewed in the TLS (01/03/2013).
[5.5] Sales figures have not yet been tallied but are growing.
The 2011 Turkish translation was sponsored by the Mayor of Bursa; 1900 copies of its first print run of 2200 have been sold or otherwise distributed.
[5.4] Promoting awareness of Ottoman and equestrian history internationally During the period 2008-2013, the reach of Landry's research impact has expanded from primarily Turkey-based invitations.
Radio broadcasts on BBC Radio 4, `A Blunt Instrument' (11/03/2008), and A&#231;&amp;inodot;k Radyo in Istanbul (07/08/2008) were followed in 2012 by invitations to give an online interview to New Books in South Asian Studies (Mumbai) (09/06/2012), to lecture at the British Museum's exhibition `The Horse: From Arabia to Royal Ascot' (26/05/2012) to an audience of 100+ and discuss the exhibition on BBC Radio 3, Night Waves (24/05/2012).
The 2009 Ride attracted widespread media coverage [5.5] and led directly to `How the Ottomans shaped and were influenced by Europe' (City Circle, London, 10/05/2010), attracting 100+; `From Yalova to Mecca with Evliya &#199;elebi', a public lecture sponsored by the Istanbul Municipality (Istanbul, 26/03/2011) that attracted 250+, and a lecture for the Association of Turkish Women in Britain at the residence of the Turkish ambassador, London (01/05/2012), which attracted 90+.
[5.6] Landry's impact is also evidenced by pre-July 2013 invitations to write for popular magazines (Cornucopia, 2010; Turkish Review and Derin Tarih, 2013) and a Turkish TV documentary.
Collaborating with cultural providers The Ride led to Landry, Finkel, and MacLean being appointed consultants to the London-based NGO Maslaha on the British Council and Young Foundation sponsored exhibition, `Evliya &#199;elebi: The Book of Travels' which has had extensive international reach.
The exhibition opened in Bethnal Green in May 2010, attracting over 500 visitors a day, including classes from local schools.
It has since opened in Turkey (K&#252;tahya, March 2011) to an audience of 900, in Athens at the world-famous Benaki Museum (April-July, 2011), and Thessaloniki (January 2012).
The online exhibition has been visited by 20,144 people in 122 countries including the UK, the US, Canada, Greece, Bulgaria, Australia, Malaysia, Sweden, Germany, France, Turkey, and Oman.
[5.7] The Ride's significance can also be measured in its inspiring of the travel publishers Eland to commission An Ottoman Traveller: Selections from the Book of Travels of Evliya &#199;elebi (2010), the first substantial collection of English translations of Evliya: `Hearing that a group of enthusiastic scholars were planning to ride horses across Turkey by way of recreating the journey of a 17th-century Ottoman travel writer, my immediate thoughts were "Who is Evliya?
How can I publish him?"'
Priced at &#163;25, the initial hardback print run of 2000 sold out in 2011; a paperback reprint of 3000 priced at &#163;16.99 looks set to sell out next year.
Sales have been international, with the bulk pretty evenly divided between the UK and the USA.
[5.8] The impacts of Landry's research have been international in reach and concretely measurable in their significance for policy, economic benefit, and cultural enrichment.
The creation of the E&#199;W demonstrates how innovative research can be co-produced with people who will also benefit economically and culturally from its outcomes.
The project as a whole exemplifies how the delivery of impact can be made intrinsic to producing research of the highest excellence.
