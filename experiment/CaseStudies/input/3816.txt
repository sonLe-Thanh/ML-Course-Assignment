     In summary, the research carried out by WEDC resulted in the design and       implementation of significant aspects of NWSC's change-management       programmes (2000-2011).
This produced improved access to water services       for existing customers and increased numbers of new customers (an       additional 526,000 people, including 196,000 residents in the urban       informal settlements, in all of NWSC's service areas), all of which       received a better service in terms of quantity and quality of water       received.
Most impact of this research has occurred since 2008.
Implementation of the project Serving all urban consumers, led by       Loughborough University (Sansom, Kayaga, Coates and Njiri) produced       guidelines for getting to know and understand all consumer groups [R3];       targeting and providing differentiated services to low-income consumers;       and developing and implementing a strategic marketing approach to service       delivery [R1].
Specifically, this research influenced NWSC       management to set up the Urban Pro-Poor Unit in Kampala [C1].
This       in turn led to improved utility services to the urban poor.
For instance,       in low-income poor settlements, the number of people served increased from       923,600 in 2008, to about 1,120,000 in 2010 [C1, C2, C3].
Improved       access to water in turn led to improved quality of life and enhanced       economic opportunities [C4].
Improved Risk Assessment and Management of Piped Urban Water Supplies       was a joint action-research project carried out by WEDC, NWSC and Makerere       University (Uganda).
Through this action research, the procedures for       water-quality management in NWSC were revised in 2007 to incorporate water       safety plans (WSPs).
Since 2007, implementation has been rolled out to       other service areas [C4].
The result has been delivery of       better-quality water services to urban consumers in Uganda (Figure 1       below), leading directly to enhanced health of the population.
The researchers shared the findings they made in the Charging to         enter the water shop?
project with senior NWSC managers in April       2004.
The findings on the connection expenses to poor urban dwellers and       on other related barriers to uptake convinced NWSC to revise its policy       and procedures for effecting new connections [C5].
In particular,       they simplified the process and offered new financial incentives to       applicants.
As a result, the number of connections increased significantly       from 202,559 in 1998 to 272,406 in 2011 (Figure 2), a 34% increase.
Furthermore, the estimated population benefiting from these new       connections increased by 28% to 2,426,000, with an additional 526,000       individuals benefiting in this area alone.
Figure 1: Number of water quality samples conforming to WHO standards [Sources C2, C6, C7]   Figure 2: Improvements in access to urban water services [Sources C2, C7]      NWSC's change-management programmes &#8212; based on WEDC research &#8212; had four       significant types of positive impacts with huge outreach:     i.
Existing customers received better quality water services and customer       care, which increased their willingness to pay for water services [C2,         C3, C5]     ii.
The number of new customers increased, mainly due to simplified       connection procedures, financial incentives, better customer service and       positive word of mouth from existing customers [C2, C3, C5, C7]     iii.
Through a combination of i and ii, the revenue base of NWSC       increased significantly, which greatly contributed to their improved       institutional capacity, launching NWSC into a virtuous circle of       organisational performance.
For example, NWSC's turnover increased by 31%       from Uganda Shs.
100.6 billion (&#163;24.4m) in 2008 to 131.5 billion (&#163;31.9m)       in 2011 [C2, C7]     iv.
NWSC implementation of the urban pro-poor policy and programmes led       to significant improvements in water services delivery to informal urban       settlements [C1, C3, C4]     The improvements in water services had more far-reaching impacts on       residents living in poor urban settlements [C1, C2, C3, C4].

NWSC set up an External Services Unit with the goal of sharing knowledge       and expertise with other water utilities in the developing regions.
Since       then, NWSC has provided advisory and consultancy services in change       management programmes for urban water utilities in 12 countries in Africa,       Asia and the Caribbean.
These activities have extended the reach and       significance of impacts of our underpinning research to these utilities       and the consumers they serve in the respective countries [C8, C9].
The research-induced best practices have now been embedded in the policies       and practices of these utilities.
