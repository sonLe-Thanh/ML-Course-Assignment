     Grammenos and his team have established themselves as a leading global       authority on shipping finance.
The Costas Grammenos Centre for Shipping,       Trade and Finance is a global educational hub and the first to introduce       interrelationships between these three disciplines through research,       education and engagement.
Work conducted by the Centre has influenced       shipping practitioners and academics from across the world.
The Centre       provides a forum for dialogue through its conferences, seminars and       debates and acts as an ecosystem where research is trialled and       demonstrated in practitioner communities by those very practitioners       attending the Centre as students.
The Centre has over 2,900 alumni       (from more than 100 countries) who constitute a captive audience of       practitioner beneficiaries from the highest levels of the international       shipping and financial communities.
As a graduate of the Centre, Nikolas Tsakos, President of Tsakos Energy       Navigation (TEN) was influenced by Grammenos' research to raise finance by       listing his company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2002.
Mr Tsakos       first explored the idea of raising funds through capital markets in his       MSc dissertation and continued the idea into his professional career.
Since his graduation, Mr Tsakos has become a `flag bearer' for the modern       shipping business model of raising finance through equity.
TEN raised       $500M of equity from the stock exchange; it has been the only public       tanker company to be continually profitable from 1993 to 2011 and has       distributed, through dividends, over $400M to its shareholders.
The       company has exceeded US$1billion in profits and has, on average, returned       an impressive 20% on equity per annum to its shareholders [1].
Similarly,       Goldenport Holdings, a shipping company that owns and operates a fleet of       dry bulk vessels (major shareholder, John Dragnis, Cass 1999 graduate)       started trading on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.
Goldenport raised       &#163;158M and by 2008 the market value of the company reached &#163;293M.
Finally,       Stelios Haji-Ioannou (Cass 1989 graduate) listed Stelmar Shipping Ltd. on       the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, raising $126M.
The company was then       acquired in 2005 for $843M by the Overseas Shipholding Group, forming the       second largest publicly traded oil tanker company.
Overseas Shipholding       Group market value reached $2,673M in June 2008.
By going public, these       companies (together with others that followed) transformed the traditional       family ownership approach into a corporate structure, which resulted in       lower cost of capital, improved service to customers and enhanced       corporate social responsibility (CSR) due to investors' demand for better       disclosure.
The reverberations of these companies implementing the methodology       (listing, raising capital, business growth or expansion) meant that       Grammenos and his research, along with his team who have taught on courses       at Cass Business School, contributed to the success of London remaining a       main locus for the international shipping industry for the past decade.
Sir Gavin Arthur, former Lord Mayor of London, said: "London is not         only the world's leading international finance centre, but also the         maritime capital of the world.
In no small measure, the activities of         the Centre have contributed to this pre-eminence" [2].
Another Lord       Mayor of London, Sir David Howard said: "The Centre is a world-class         institution with a world-class reputation.
For Cass Business School it         is a jewel in the crown.
For London, Europe and the wider world, it is         an asset of immense value" [3].
As London became a focal point for the shipping industry, Grammenos and       his research Centre began to organise round-table fora to bring together       around 700 world business leaders, policy-makers and academics to discuss       and debate issues of challenge, competition, innovation and their       consequences within a global context, the City of London Biennial       Meetings, which have taken place since 1999.
In the words of one       participant, the late Eddie George, former Governor of the Bank of       England, "From the very beginning, the Centre for Shipping, Trade and         Finance's Biennial Meeting established itself as a major event for the         City of London, where academics, with policy-makers and business leaders         &#8212; from around the world &#8212; have the opportunity to discuss and debate         issues which contribute to the dynamic development of the City of London         markets and their effect worldwide.
Also discussed is the growth of         other international and national markets and their impact on the London         markets.
It seems now to be the major event of its kind for the City of         London."
At the most recent meeting in 2010, Mr Efthimios       Mitropoulos, Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization       described the meetings as "a landmark in the City of London calendar"       [4].
The research, education and international dialogue conducted by Grammenos       and his group redefined the context within which shipping companies are       assessed.
Investors now have the methodology to assess shipping companies       on the basis of both the financial factors which influence their market       standing (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates, commodity trade) and of       internal, business, or organisational factors such as managerial capacity,       financial robustness and operational efficiency.
Sir John Stuttard, Vice       Chairman, PricewaterhouseCoopers stated: "Many successful businessmen         and women in shipping, logistics and energy, trade and finance have         studied with Professor Costas Grammenos.
His inspirational teaching and         pioneering research have brought the rigor of academic debate to the         dynamic industry of shipping and maritime economics" [5].
December 2009 was a crucial time for global climate action.
With the       first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol set to expire in 2012, the       international community congregated in Copenhagen to adopt, under the       auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change       (UNFCCC), a new global regime to combat climate change.
Against this       background, in February 2009 the United Nations Conference on Trade and       Development (UNCTAD) expert meeting on `Maritime Transport and the         Climate Change Challenge' debated how best to address the multiple       challenges, especially those of concern to developing countries, the       least-developed countries and small island developing states.
Some 180       experts from 60 countries and 20 intergovernmental and non-governmental       organisations, as well as representatives of the global shipping and port       industries, met in Geneva to discuss a wide range of issues over the       course of three days.
The discussions, chaired by Grammenos, focused on       greenhouse gas emissions and climate change mitigation options; the       potential impacts of climate change on maritime transport systems and       supply chains; and the broader economic, social and developmental       implications that have yet to be understood and addressed adequately [6].
The reach of Grammenos' work on shipping professionals was enhanced by       the creation of The Grammenos Library, a series of book titles focused on       issues affecting the international shipping industry.
Published by Taylor       and Francis, the Library brings together contributions from a wide range       of internationally-known academics offering practical analyses of the       business of shipping.
Grammenos own title, `The Handbook of Maritime       Economics and Business' is the founding title in the Library.
Lloyd's       List, the leading daily news publication for the maritime industry, calls       it the `Maritime Bible' [7].
Grammenos is considered the leading authority on shipping finance by       business leaders and politicians and is regarded as the academic and       intellectual arm of the industry.
To that extent, his authority and       judgment have enabled him to become the executor of the Onassis Prizes in       Shipping, Trade and Finance ($200k each), in conjunction with the Onassis       Public Benefit Foundation, initiated in 2009.
The Prizes add to the       international recognition of The City of London as a hub of the shipping,       trade and finance industries.
Dr Anthony Papadimitriou, President of the       Onassis Foundation, said: "The Onassis Foundation is proud to associate         once more the name of its Founder with the Corporation of the City of         London and the Costas Grammenos Centre for Shipping, Trade and Finance         which respectively are world centres of the practice and academic study         of these three areas" [8].
Professor Grammenos' reputation as a shipping researcher and his       influence on shipping have led to honours and awards from various bodies.
In 2009, he was appointed CBE by Her Majesty the Queen 'for services to       teaching and research`.
In 2011 and 2012, Grammenos featured on the       `Lloyd's List of One Hundred Most Influential People in the Shipping       Industry', the only academic on the list of industry figureheads [9].
According to Lloyd's List: "[Grammenos'] input over many years means         that almost a whole generation of key decision makers have been         influenced by his courses, contributing in no small way to the shift of         many traditional family ship owning companies into more efficient         corporate enterprises able to compete in an increasingly challenging         global market...Few in the industry can claim to have been responsible         for the formative education in the finer points of maritime finance for         so many ship owners" [10].
