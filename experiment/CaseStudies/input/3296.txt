     In 2011, Spence and Rinaldi's research fed into direct contributions to       developing Sainsbury's       supply chain sustainability management practices (source 1).
Sainsbury's       used insights from this       research &#8212; including highlighting the different approaches to, and       interpretations of, sustainability       throughout the supply chain &#8212; to enhance learning and understanding about       sustainability       management at all levels of the company, up to the CEO, and implemented       this into their own       practices and through their supply chain.
Sainsbury's Director of Brand       notes:     "I think what [this] gave us was the confidence to approach what we         would see as very complicated         supply chain work.
In breaking it down into manageable chunks in a very         analytical and scientific         way and that was very valuable to our understanding and consequently the         changes that we have         made to improve those supply chains and make them more sustainable".
Research into sustainability management led to an invitation in January       2009 from The Prince's       Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) for Unerman to co-lead (along       with the late Professor       Anthony Hopwood and the Executive Chairman from PWC) a series of       practitioner-oriented case       studies to guide organisations in developing and implementing policies and       practices to help       embed sustainability considerations into decision-making at all levels.
The resulting book (source       7) has been used as a resource across a range of professional and       commercial organizations to       help enhance understandings among their staff of the significant role that       innovative accounting for       sustainability mechanisms can and do play in identifying and realizing       sustainability-related       opportunities and identifying and reducing sustainability-related risks       (sources 2 and 7):     "Insights from the research ... provided valuable learning both in         terms of next steps for A4S's         work to develop practical approaches to accounting for sustainability         and to organisations seeking         to learn...." Executive Chairman, A4S (source 2).
The research by Spence and Rinaldi at Sainsbury's also informed A4S's       approach:     "The case provided important insights in particular around use of         language, context for achieving         action and the role of different actors within the supply chain which         have informed subsequent A4S         research and continue to be some of the most important areas where         greater insight and action is         needed.
Most significantly, the research has provided a vital input to         frame A4S's work to establish         the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and develop an         international integrated         reporting framework.
This work is having a significant impact globally         to change corporate reporting         so that `mainstream' reporting brings together material information         about an organization's         strategy, governance, performance and prospects in a way that reflects         the commercial, social and         environmental context within which it operates."

Professional accounting bodies, leading companies and public sector       organizations are investing       considerable resources into developing sustainability accounting practices       and guidelines.
Spence,       Agyemang and Rinaldi's 2012 analysis of SMP-SME relationships (source 6)       has been       incorporated into policy making by the commissioning professional body       (ACCA), who have stated       that the research:     "had a genuine impact on our understanding of our members'         willingness, confidence and level of         skills in this area, and therefore an important basis from which ACCA,         and other professional         bodies, can start to address this more actively in the future."
(source 5)     The report's findings form the basis of ACCA's policy and practitioner       recommendations for       Embedding Sustainability in SMEs (source 9).
The research has also contributed to changes in policies affecting the       accounting profession, and       by extension accounting practices in business organizations globally,       through its initial influence on       the development of integrated reporting.
This is noted by the Executive       Chairman of A4S who is       also a member of the IIRC Board (source 2).
The IIRC is a global coalition       of regulators, investors,       companies, standard setters, the accounting profession and NGOs that is       developing global       integrated reporting guidelines.
Insights from the research were one input       informing A4S's work to       launch and shape the IIRC (source 2).
The SME-related research led to the development of a tool to help SMEs       embed sustainability       considerations into decision making (source 3) along with the ACCA report       (source 6) that has       made a difference to recommendations made by intermediaries (such as the       Network for Business       Sustainability (NBS) and ACCA) seeking to promote sustainability (sources       3, 4, 9).
"The Primer has been disseminated to our 3,000 subscribers from         industry and academia; viewed         and shared by NBS's 1,400 Twitter followers; and viewed more than 645         times on our website.
The         Primer has also been featured in the Guardian; Living Planet @ Work, the         newsletter for World         Wildlife Fund Canada; and Sustainability Learning Centre, a Canadian         management training         program in sustainability."

The report on research on SMEs (source 6) includes recommendations for       both small and medium       sized accounting practitioners and the accounting profession.
The report       has been widely       discussed within ACCA (source 5), and has been presented to the Global SME       Forum and the       International Federation of Accountants.
The research has been recommended       as a resource       through other practitioner publications such as the European Commission's       CSR Handbook for         Small Business Advisors and ACCA's Embedding Sustainability in         SMEs (source 8, 9).
