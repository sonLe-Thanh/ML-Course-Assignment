     The academic work of Gibson and Marshall revealed that the properties of       PLA could be improved by using catalysts to promote the formation of       stereoregular PLA, greatly increasing the potential applications for PLA.
On this basis a business plan was constructed and funding secured leading       to the formation of Plaxica in 2008 [B].
Marshall resigned his lectureship       position in December 2009 to join the Company full-time (Gibson having       previously taken a visiting professorship at Imperial when he joined BP as       their Chief Chemist in 2008).
The basis of Plaxica's technology is       fully-owned by the Company.
Nonetheless, the insight into the market and       the understanding of the capabilities arose from academic work at Imperial       over a number of years, and ultimately proved necessary when seeking funds       for the launch of the spin-out company.
Plaxica is a process technology licensing company.
It develops,       demonstrates and designs process plants for the production of the key       intermediates, especially L- and D- lactic acids and lactides, for       stereocomplex polylactic acid (PLA) &#8212; a high performance biopolymer made       from non-food renewable materials, such as cellulosic based materials.
Plaxica's technology allows high performance PLA to replace traditional       polymers produced from oil.
It has a flexible approach to how it interacts       with licensees, recognising that a successful biopolymers operation       requires technology in the areas of feedstock production and conversion,       intermediates production and polymerisation.
Plaxica focuses on the       ability to credibly scale up the chemical processes developed on a lab       scale.
Using a multidisciplinary team of chemists, process engineers and       technical consultants the team works to deliver the correct balance of       innovation, capital and operating costs.
Before the launch of Plaxica, the       UK had no commercial interest in the production of PLA, though several       distributors could supply it.
Plaxica was formed to commercialise strong IP in low cost, high       performance bioplastics.
The product is a greener, cleaner and stronger       form of plastic made from natural feedstock and can be used for a variety       of applications including for example, fibres and packaging.
It is "developing         next generation biopolymers that will be both cheaper to produce and         have improved properties compared with first generation biopolymers.
The         novel chemistry underpinning this technology came from research by         Professor Vernon Gibson FRS and Dr Ed Marshall at Imperial College         London.
Plaxica's technology uses sustainable feedstocks to produce a         biopolymer known as polylactic acid (PLA) using more energy-efficient         processes, to produce a stronger, higher-quality polymer.
The result         should be a low-cost, environmentally-friendly biopolymer for use in         applications as diverse as packaging, textiles, electronics and         automobile parts" [C].
Since its formation in 2008 Plaxica has had several successful funding       rounds and key milestones.
Imperial Innovations funded the initial launch       of the company in 2008.
A project involving Plaxica, Imperial and       Holloid Plastics Ltd won funding for the High Value Manufacturing       Technology Strategy Board in September 2009 [D], leading to       conditions for the successful injection moulding of stereocomplex PLA.
In       October 2009 Plaxica received &#163;1m in equity funding from Imperial       Innovations, the Carbon Trust Investments Ltd and the National Endowment       for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) [C].
Commenting on the       investment the CEO of Imperial Innovations Group plc, Susan Searle, said "Existing         plastics are no longer sustainable because of the oil they use and the         waste they leave.
This investment will help Plaxica develop a low-cost         and environmentally friendly alternative for a wide range of industrial         and consumer applications" [C].
Rachael Nutter, Investment Manager       at Carbon Trust Investment Partners LLP commented "The rapidly growing         market for bioplastics and Plaxica's position as a leader in this field         have made it an exciting company to invest in.
Plaxica has the potential         to transform the cost and carbon footprint of PLAs and develop new         applications for this polymer" [C].
This equity investment allowed       Plaxica to "continue developing processes aimed at reducing PLA         production costs to the point where it can compete with mass volume         oil-based plastics" [C].
In 2010 Plaxica announced that it       raised a further &#163;3 million in a Series A financing in which all existing       institutional investors participated.
The funds were used to accelerate       development and scale up of the company's next generation PLA technology       [E].
The funding consists of &#163;1.2m Imperial Innovations) and &#163;1.8m from       other existing shareholders [E].
In 2011 Plaxica completed a &#163;5m       round in Series B financing with investment from Imperial Innovations,       Invesco Perpetual and NESTA Investment [F].
In 2010, Plaxica began to rent       space in the Wilton Research Centre on Teesside to focus on process       development, scale-up and demonstration.
By September 2012 the       demonstration facility had entered the commissioning phase [20/9/12       announcement, G].
By May 2013 "Plaxica [had] demonstrated the         production of extremely high purity D-lactic acid from a racemic lactic         acid feedstock, validating [their] Optipure enantiomer separation         technology" [30/5/13 announcement, G] and had attracted commercial       interest from a number of clients and partners, especially in South East       Asia and North America [H].
The product quality exceeded industry       standards for polymer-grade lactic acid which was "an important         milestone in the validation of Plaxica's low cost technology for the         production of lactic acid" [30/5/13 announcement, G].
In total       Plaxica has raised almost &#163;10m in investment in the 2008-2013 REF period.
It continues to attract investment as demonstrated by the recent &#163;8M       Series C financing round [10/9/13 announcement, G, H].
Plaxica currently employs 27 people covering R&amp;D, engineering, plant       operation and commercial functions.
This includes 18 people in Wilton in       the North East of England.
Since 2008 Plaxica have employed 25 UK       graduates in STEM subjects [H].
Further support is provided as required       from a retained team of ca.
10 consultants (industry and academic       experts).
The construction of a pilot demonstration facility in Teesside       demonstrates Plaxica's commitment to creating jobs and revenue within the       UK.
Examples of the local press include:            "The licensing company, which develops transformational biopolymer           technology, only moved into the Wilton Centre 18 months ago but has           already had to take another laboratory and a large open plan office,           in addition to its existing lab and two small offices."
[I]       "A technology and licensing company is doubling the size of its           Teesside operation with the launch of a pilot plant that will           demonstrate the conversion of bio-renewables into polymers using           break-through technology."
[J]       "Steve Duffield, accommodation manager at The Wilton Centre, said:           `The speed of Plaxica's progress is very impressive.
It is an ideal           operation to have at the Centre, complementing other organisations           also here.'"
[K]          Imperial Innovations, one of the major investors in Plaxica make the       following statement about the company: "Plaxica is developing a new         generation of biopolymers derived from renewable resources.
Plaxica's         polymers are a range of polylactic acid based materials which have         improved physical properties compared with first generation biopolymers.
In addition, they have a smaller environmental footprint, and are fully         recyclable and cost competitive with current oil-based alternatives.
First generation PLA is by far the most successful biopolymer to date,         with 25% of the biopolymer market.
Plaxica's second generation PLA is         expected to combine the advantages of biopolymers with the mechanical         and thermal performance of petrochemical derived plastics and is         expected to develop a market much larger than that of existing         biopolymers.
Given Plaxica's PLA's improved physical properties, its         applications will expand beyond the currently limited range of         applications for which first-generation PLAs can be used... Plaxica's         second generation PLA polymers are likely to compete effectively with         conventional oil-derived products such as PET, polypropylene and         polystyrene in applications ranging from textiles to automotive,         electronics, household goods and packaging.
Plaxica's technology is         particularly suited to the use of sugars derived from cellulosic         feedstocks &#8212; which are normally waste products and do not, in general,         take food out of the supply chain" [L].
They make the following       statement about the global polymers market: "The global polymers market         is worth more than $400 billion in annual sales and has grown at an         average of 3.5% per year over the last two decades.
The current         biopolymers market is in excess of $2 billion per annum and is growing         at more than 10% per year.
PLA has 40% of this market, at some $800m,         and this is forecast to grow to $1bn by 2012" [L].
The impact offered by Plaxica is nicely summed up by the CEO: "Economically         Plaxica has grown quickly to employ a critical mass of scientist and         engineers...
The emphasis on biopolymers from non-food sources such as         cellulose has clear societal and environmental impacts, and the focus on         using bioplastics in durable applications such as automotive interiors         demonstrates a sustainable advantage not offered by current PLA         materials" [H].
Unfortunately, due to "commercial sensitivities         in the highly competitive PLA marketplace", Plaxica are "unable         to be more forthcoming with details of the impact already realised by         the company" [H].
