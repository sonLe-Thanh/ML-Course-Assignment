     The development of the freelight chain assays by Professors Bradwell and       Drayson has had       significant impact on the clinical management of patients with B       cell lymphoid neoplasias and       has led to changes in clinical practice and commercial impact       through the success of the       Binding Site and the formation of Serascience.
Clinical impact       The SFLC test has been adopted into worldwide clinical practice because of       its importance in the       diagnosis and management of myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma and light chain       amyloidosis.
This       is evidenced by numerous review papers, national and international       guidelines for the diagnosis       and management of these diseases [1].
These guidelines continue to be       updated as more       scientific evidence becomes available about the use of the test.
The SFLC       test has been adopted       as a prognostic marker for the whole range of B lymphoid cancers and       premalignant conditions       including monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance which occur       in 3% of people aged       &gt;60 years [2].
More recently it has been adopted as a prognostic marker       for survival in normal       populations [2].
Use of the SFLC test in the MERIT trial and in the MRC       Myeloma 11 trial has       made it clear that the SFLC response to the first few weeks of       anti-myeloma therapy reliably       predicts final response [3]; this allows early identification of       non-responders and change to a       treatment more likely to be effective in identified individuals.
Impact on patients       The ability to measure serum FLC levels has had a major impact on the       diagnosis and       management of all patients with plasma cell dycrasias and B lymphoid       lymphoma and leukaemia       [4].
In non-secretory and light chain only myeloma and in many       plasmacytoma and light chain       amyloid patients SFLC tests allow diagnosis and detection of changes in       disease activity that could       not be achieved before.
The second generation of these tests       commercialised by Serascience is       making these tests more widely available, in particular a point of care       version, allowing patient       management decisions to be made more reliably and immediately in the       outpatient clinic, at the       bedside or even at home [5].
Commercial impact       The Binding Site was formed in 1982 by a group of researchers from the       University of Birmingham       Medical School, to manufacture and supply antibodies, alongside developing       a series of diagnostic       tests.
Following the development of the SFLC test the Binding Site       incorporated the technology as       a key part of its product portfolio.
In October 2009 the Binding Site sold       its autoimmune       diagnostics business to the Werfen Group SA, based in Barcelona, Spain for       &#163;84 million in order to       concentrate on Freelite which accounted for most of its other annual       income and was growing at       40% per year [6].
The company's annual turnover in 2012 was &#163;55 million       and the company       employs in excess of 550 people in the UK and abroad [7].
In 2012, 360,000       SFLC tests were sold       each month in 90 countries, directly through offices in UK, USA, Canada,       Germany, Austria,       France, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Belgium,       Netherlands and Luxembourg;       and through a network of over 70 distributors [7].
In 2010, the Binding Site won The Queen's Award for Enterprise in the       category International       Trade, for its outstanding achievement in increasing export revenues by       74% to over &#163;42       million/year in 3 years and selling more than 90% of its production       overseas [8].
Aggregate       exports over this period totalled &#163;96 million.
This growth is primarily       driven by sales of Freelite&#174;,       which has grown to &#163;36 million/year in 2012 [7].
New jobs have been       created in sales, marketing,       research and clinical education, both in the UK and internationally, to       support this trade.
In March       2011, the company moved its headquarters and 380 UK-based staff to larger       premises in the       centre of Birmingham.
In April 2011 Nordic Capital Fund VII acquired the       Binding Site for an       undisclosed sum [9].
City analysts believe that sum to be in the region of       &#163;200 million [10].
A new University spinout company, SeraScience, was formed in 2011 to       commercialise the       monoclonal based SFLC assay.
The company was formed as a result of       significant investment       from the University and UK based Healthcare company, Abingdon Health.
The       company has       successfully developed a new range of "point of care tests" for FLC, which       will mean that the SFLC       assay can be undertaken within the clinic, providing rapid clinical       assessment and immediate       information for the patient and clinical teams.
The new range was launched       at the Biannual       International Myeloma Conference in Kyoto, Japan in April 2013 [11].
The       point of care test is       manufactured by FORSITE in Yorkshire (a spinout company from DEFRA).
The       nephelometric and       turbidimetric assays are being developed with Spinreact in Gerona, Spain.
