     Impact on health and welfare     Well-designed and high quality research undertaken by Leeds has directly       influenced clinical practice and is now incorporated into systematic       reviews [A-B] and international [C] and national guidelines [for example,       D] for use by nurses, doctors and allied healthcare professionals in       countries around the world.
The most wide-reaching guidelines are the       Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Treatment Clinical Practice Guidelines [C]       produced by the joint US National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP)       and European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), which was published in       2009, and cites all six Leeds studies [1-6] and has been translated into       17 languages by national pressure ulcer prevention organisations across       Europe, Asia and South America who recommend adoption [C].
The reach of       the Leeds research is extensive due to its incorporation in international       and national guidelines, and significant due to its forming a large       proportion of the high quality (low risk of bias) evidence in the       systematic reviews and clinical guidelines.
Impact in systematic reviews for clinicians, policy makers and           guideline developers     The PRESSURE trial [3, 4, 6] was incorporated into the 2008 and 2011       Cochrane systematic review and BMJ Clinical Evidence systematic review of       mattress support surfaces for pressure ulcer prevention [A, B].
These       reviews provide the foundation for the development of national and       international guidelines.
Our trial provided approximately 80% of the data       for the comparison of alternating pressure devices in [B]: PRESSURE       provided data on 207 events in 1971 people, four other trials provided       data on 26 events in 243 people.
International guidelines     The extent to which the NPUAP/EPUAP guidelines [C] draw upon Leeds       research is shown in the following sections, with recommendations       explicitly based on our work in bold:     Patients in the operating room (page 41).
"Refine risk         assessment of individuals undergoing surgery by examining other factors         that are likely to occur and will increase risk of pressure ulcer         development, including: ..., b) Increased hypotensive           episodes intraoperatively, c) Low core temperature during surgery, d)           Reduced mobility on day one postoperatively.'
Risk assessment practice (page 25-26) .
"Use a structured         approach to risk assessment...
Consider individuals with alterations           to intact skin to be at risk of pressure ulcer         development.. ... `In addition, the presence of non-blanching           erythema also increases the risk of Category/Stage II         pressure ulcer development').
And "Consider the impact of the         following factors..including diabetes increase         the risk of pressure ulcer development."
Support surfaces (page 39) "Alternating-pressure           active support overlays and replacement mattresses have a similar           efficacy in terms of pressure ulcer incidence (strength of evidence =           A)."
It is noteworthy that only seven of 83 guideline statements have strength       of evidence A (the highest level).
The clear finding of no clinical       difference, but better tolerance and increased probability for cost saving       is important for evidence-based care.
Other international summaries       prepared for commissioners of services and clinicians use our research and       specifically note its quality [D].
Pressure ulcer prevention is an important element of patient safety and       care quality for clinicians, managers and commissioners.
Our research has       extensive reach and impact on these groups due to its being a significant       part of high quality evidence in international guidelines [E,F].
Impact upon economy     Our research [3, 4, 6] has impacted purchasing of mattresses for pressure       ulcer prevention.
After the publication of PRESSURE, which showed a       greater patient acceptance of and cost- effectiveness associated with       alternating pressure (AP) mattress replacements (which have a higher unit       purchase cost than AP mattress overlays) there was a decrease in the       proportion of AP mattress overlays being purchased.
Prior to trial       publication 42% of powered AP mattresses were overlays, and after trial       publication this fell to 33-34% in years 2007/8 and 2009 [G].
Impact upon policy     Nixon and Nelson are active members of National and       International collaborative and Policy Groups on the basis of their work.
NIXON led the Risk Assessment Guideline Development Group in the       development of the NPUAP/EPUAP (2009) guidelines, which led to       consideration of our high quality Leeds research.
Nelson and Nixon were       both part of the Scottish Preliminary Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment       (PPURA) development team, on behalf of the Scottish Executive (Healthcare       Improvement Scotland) Guidance for Policy and Practice.
We advised on the       development of pressure ulcer screening and our risk factor research       influenced the development of this component to the risk assessment       process including assessment of skin condition [H].
Impact on the public     Information prepared for members of the public at risk of pressure ulcers       [I] notes the role of operating table overlays and this is derived from       the Cochrane Review [A] where the PRESSURE trial [5] is the largest trial       and noted as being of high quality (p5 of the pdf of the review)
