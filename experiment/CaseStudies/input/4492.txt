     Research has led to impacts on national and international policy       decisions relating to space       exploration, health benefits for astronauts and people who cannot be       physically active.
Commercial       impacts have also been realised through the development and refinement of       new exercise devices.
Impacts on National and International Spaceflight Policy     Since 2005, Narici and Rittweger have acted as expert advisors to various       European space       programmes.
In 2007, Rittweger was appointed to the European Space       Agency's Artificial Gravity       Expert Group where he continues to contribute to space-based exercise       countermeasures.
Narici       was nominated to the ESA Life Science Working Group Committee in 2007       (until 2013).
In 2009,       Rittweger was invited to chair ESA's Exercise in Space topical team (until       present).
Serving as part       of ESA's expert panels Rittweger and Narici have contributed directly to       the development and       definition of ESA's Life Sciences Strategy and work programmes and were       involved in the       selection of space research applications.
The Head of the Directorate of       Human Spaceflight and       Operation at ESA states, "The Artificial Gravity Expert Group's work         has proven to be very valuable         to ESA, and results show that Artificial Gravity has good potential as a         space-based         countermeasure.
This is likely to impact on plans for future space         utilisation and exploration, and         both Narici and Rittweger have greatly contributed to this success."
[A]     In 2012, MMU Professors Narici and Rittweger were part of the UK Space       Agency's advisory       committee who contributed to a document in support of the UK Government       joining ESA's       `European Life and Physical Sciences Programme (ELIPS) resulting in a       &#163;12.4M investment from       the UK to exploit insights into the human ageing process http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-         environment-20421667.
Professors Narici was instrumental in       organising a dedicated workshop to       discuss ELIPS at Kings College London [B] as part of the UK Space       Biomedicine Consortium       (UKSBC).
This meeting led to the creation of a document submitted to a       ministerial delegation.
In       November 2012, the UK government decided to contribute to the `ELIPS4'       programme.
As the Co-Ordinator       of UKSBC confirms in a full statement available on file [C], "Over         the last decade or two         there have only been a small number of British people who have been         active in space life science         R&amp;D to an extent that has impacted the European research scene.
Professor Narici and Rittweger         are two of the more prominent and successful examples.
Quite possibly         their heritage aided their         ability to tap into the European effort, but also the support and         latitude offered by the Manchester         Metropolitan University has enabled them to make the impact that they         have.
The work carried out         by MMU was and is recognised at an international level.
MMU staff have         contributed to hardware         and activities on the International Space Station.
The UKSBC aim of         using space research as a         means to benefit terrestrial health care, in particular to combat the         effects of ageing.
It is through         the vision and R&amp;D of founding members such as MMU that this         consortium exists and will be able         to positively affect the future of a number of sectors of British         society.
MMU has been a significant         factor in the development of this new field of R&amp;D in the UK and         will remain at the core of this         domain."
In 2009, Rittweger was appointed to Head of Department at the German       Space Agency (DLR).
This position has given Rittweger, who retains a 0.2 contract at MMU, an       opportunity to direct       policy and research strategy at the German Space Agency.
It is as a direct       result of the influence       of his musculoskeletal research that he was appointed to this prestigious       and influential role as his       Director confirms "The specific knowledge in musculoskeletal         physiology and biomechanics that Dr         Rittweger had acquired at Manchester Metropolitan University were the         main reasons for head-hunting 		him for his current position at the DLR institute.
The leading         position of MMU-based         research in this scientific field was well recognized, and given the         importance of muscle and bone         losses in Space made him an ideal candidate for his position."

Direct Involvement In Space Missions And Associated Clinical         Applications     Professor Rittweger's pioneering work in demonstrating the efficacy of       vibration exercise as a       microgravity countermeasure has led to the wide adoption of this exercise       modality for space-related       research activities and for physical rehabilitation in clinical       conditions.
His work has helped       to answer questions about how bed-rest studies can help the human body to       adapt to living in       space.
In 2010 the 2nd Berlin Bed-Rest Study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20811145       tested the efficacy of whole-body vibration in addition to high-load       resistance exercise in preventing       bone-loss during bed-rest.
A Resistive Vibration Exercise (RVE) evaluated       the effect of an       intervention protocol on bed-rest induced bone loss.
Results showed that       retarded bone loss       induced by simulated microgravity in humans, when exposed to RVE, was       mainly attributed to its       anabolic effects.
Rittweger's bed-rest work not only aided research in       spaceflight but also       contributed to significant international clinical advances as evidenced by       the Head of the Centre for       Child Rehabilitation at the University Hospital Cologne who states, "these         recognitions have been         instrumental when conceiving the `Cologne strategy' for rehabilitation         of children with         neuromuscular disturbances with various underlying pathologies.
Whole         body vibration are the         main constituents of this strategy...the Queen Rania hospital for         prevention and rehabilitation is         seeing 300 patients per year and is serving as a role model in Germany         and worldwide.
Besides         the impact of his publications, Dr. Rittweger has also been a continuous         source of information for         us in joint meetings and collaborations and has substantially         contributed."

This work is having       an on-going and direct impact on space missions.
For example, in 2012,       MEDES, the France-based       Institute of Space Medicine and Physiology, carried out the MNX bed-rest       study to measure       the effectiveness of two counter-measures used against the effects of       weightlessness to which       astronauts are subjected [F].
In order to improve the quality of       reports about whole body vibration       treatment studies, the International Society of Musculoskeletal and       Neuronal Interactions invited       experts in the field to provide suggestions on how the intervention should       be described in reports.
MMU research underpinned these recommendations which were published in       2010 and have       impacted on the way in which this work is carried out ever since [G].
In 2011, Professor Narici was instrumental in gaining approval from the       ESA and NASA to fly the       Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES) on-board the       International Space       Station (ISS).
Narici was heavily involved in the conception and design of       MARES, which is used       by astronauts to prevent musculoskeletal deterioration.
Consequently,       Narici and colleagues from       MMU (Rittweger [H]) and the University of Compiegne were the first       to use MARES to support the       NASA-approved experiment `Sarcolab' [I].
The Sarcolab experiment       examined the causes of       muscle atrophy and weakness in response to long-term (6 months)       spaceflight in 10 astronauts       including Dutch astronaut Andre Kuipers who was tested both before and       after his mission on the       International Space Station.
This project represents the first time that       astronauts have been tested       in this way and will lead to new methods of combating muscle wastage in       spaceflight       http://www.mmu.ac.uk/news/news-items/1508/
