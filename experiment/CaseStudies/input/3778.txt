     The non-academic reach of Wilson's research is demonstrated by       commissioned reports for the Scottish and Irish Governments and invited       talks at the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in Washington and at       Westminster Briefing Events in London (amongst others).
These outreach       activities draw directly on the knowledge gained from the underpinning       research discussed in Section 2 above.
The clearest and most significant impact of this research has been its       influence on the credit union sector in Ireland where credit unions are       central to the financial services sector (with 70% of the adult population       members of credit unions).
In 2011, following an IMF and EU bailout, the       Irish government established the Credit Union Commission to investigate       and make recommendations about their future role and operation.
Due to his       previous research on credit unions, Wilson was one of two academics       appointed by the Irish government to the Credit Union Commission.
His       previous research and expertise were integral to the production of a       report (2012) that formed the basis for legislative change (Credit Union       and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act, 2012), which in turn led to       structural change in the industry (by enabling consolidation) and enhanced       stability (via increased regulation and supervision).
The Minister for       Finance for the Irish Government asserted that `the work of the         Commission will inform Government policy on credit unions for the         foreseeable future' (S1); and the head of credit union policy at the       Central Bank of Ireland noted that `the Commission considered and         discussed many issues in relation to credit unions and these discussions         were informed by John Wilson's knowledge of, and research on, credit         union movements around the world' (S2).
Wilson fed the results of       his research into the Commission's deliberations, and many of his findings       and their implications were subsequently reflected in the Commission's       interim and final reports:             Interim Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.
Dublin:         Ministry of Finance, April 2012. http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=7012         Final Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.
Dublin:         Ministry of Finance, April 2012. http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=7687           The final report contained over 60 recommendations, which covered       corporate governance, prudential regulation, stabilisation policy and       sector re-structuring.
In particular, Wilson's research directly       influenced the following findings and recommendations:            The possibility of voluntary consolidation or restructuring of the         credit union sector over time, recognising the need to maintain local         presence and taking into account the not-for-profit mandate, the         volunteer ethos and community focus of credit unions.
The establishment and funding of a Credit Union Restructuring Board         (ReBo) to facilitate and support the restructuring of Credit Unions.
The options for groups of credit unions to share services on a formal         basis and the extent to which this model is appropriate.
The basic governance and regulatory requirements that are needed and         the benchmarks that credit unions should meet if they are to be         registered to operate.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Irish League of Credit Unions       concluded that `Professor Wilson's interventions went a long way to         ensuring that the recommendations, and by extension the legislative         provisions based on those recommendations, benefited from his         suggestions regarding the workability of various options based on his         experience of other jurisdictions' (S3).
The Commission's recommendations have been endorsed by the Irish Ministry       of Finance and approved by the troika of the International Monetary Fund,       European Central Bank and European Commission.
They were used directly to       inform legislation in the shape of the Credit Union and Co-operation with       Overseas Regulators Act 2012, which was passed by the Irish Parliament on       21st December 2012 (S1-S3).
The Commission's report and its       underpinning research have also received widespread media coverage in       Ireland (selected links numbered S4-S10 in Section 5).
In short, Wilson's       research informed much of the Commission's deliberations and       recommendations, which were subsequently adopted by the Irish Government       and ratified in parliament via the production of new legislation.
This new       legislation in turn has been instrumental in affecting the corporate       governance, prudential regulation, stabilisation policy and structure of       the credit union sector in Ireland (much of which is contained in a new       Credit Union Handbook published by the Central Bank of Ireland in       September 2013, and available online at http://www.centralbank.ie).
The Credit Union Restructuring Board in Ireland has now been funded to the       tune of &#8364;250 million, and is currently engaged in facilitating the       re-structuring of the entire sector.
