     This very recent work has informed the public about the scientific basis       of the reported activity of peptide-based skincare treatments, with high       levels of media coverage stimulating public interest and awareness of the       underpinning science.
This is important since many previous cosmetic skin       care claims have been based on absent or insubstantial scientific       evidence.
The work has already had substantial impact on industry &#8212; the       UK-based SME Forme Laboratories has, for example, launched a new       skincare product for menopausal women, "Stratum C", based on this work.
Procter         and Gamble has experienced increased sales of "Olay Regenerist", an       existing product range containing the key KTTKS peptide, and other       companies in the cosmetics field have sought collaboration with Prof.       Hamley.
Between 2010 and 2013, the research conducted at Reading received       considerable media attention in popular science magazines, national       newspapers, national radio, industry publications and women's magazines.
The media linked this rigorous, independent science with existing products       in the multi-million pound skincare market, bringing genuine evidence of       product efficacy to fact-hungry consumers.
This not only increased public       awareness of the science, but has had a major impact on the entire       skincare industry.
Informing the public through media       Hamley's research publications [1 - 6] generated a series of media       publications that reached millions of people in the UK and across the       world.
Examples include:            "The nano-secret of youthful skin", New Scientist (21 November         2010) [Online audience of over 2.3 million unique users]       Macrae, F. &amp; Kisiel, R., "Anti-wrinkle creams that really         work...but only with a magic ingredient", Daily Mail (6 March         2013) [42 million UK unique browsers/month; 129 million unique browsers         worldwide]       "Scientists find `miracle ingredient' in anti-wrinkle creams", Huffington           Post UK (7 March 2013) [4.8 million unique users]       "Research proves Matrixyl CAN make you look younger!
", Woman           Magazine [over 600,000 people weekly &#8212; print, online and social         media]       "Key to tissue growth may be in anti-wrinkle cream", Phys.org         (1 November 2010) [&gt;1.5 million unique monthly users]       "Scientists claim to discover "anti-wrinkle secret", ITV News         (6 Mar 2013) [1.5 million unique monthly users]       "Anti-wrinkle creams actually work!
", The Times of India (20         Mar 2013) [average daily readership over 7.6 million]       "There's the rub with anti-wrinkle creams", The Australian Weekend           Magazine (6 Apr 2013) [weekly readership ~700,000]       "Research suggests a specific peptide has enhance anti-ageing         properties", CosmeticsDesign- Europe.com (7 March 2013)         [highest-read European news website in the cosmetics industry]       BBC Radio 4 &#8212; You and Yours, 21 Jun 2013          The Daily Mail and ITV News both quoted the Fashion and Beauty Editor of       the Press Association as saying: `Anti-ageing creams frequently boast         about being packed full of peptides, but aren't specific as to which         one.
Now the secret's out and there's some scientific evidence for its         collagen- boosting properties, women will be rushing to find out if it's         in their anti-ageing potion.
It's likely that brands with products that         do contain Matrixyl will start shouting about it too if the "miracle"         peptide becomes the new buzz word in beauty.
There was a stampede at         Boots in 2007 for No 7 Protect &amp; Perfect Beauty Serum after a BBC2         Horizon programme scientifically backed the [Matrixyl containing] lotion.....'.
[a]     Media attention leads to increased sales of existing skin products       The UK skincare market was valued at more than &#163;1.7 billion in 2011 and is       predicted to be worth more than &#163;1.9 billion by the end of 2016.
Facial       care is worth 58.8% of the total skincare market value [Datamonitor &#8212;       "Skincare in the UK to 2016" published 22/11/2012].
Consumers are becoming       more appearance conscious, with a 7% increase between 2008 and 2011 in the       number of global consumers attaching importance to "looking good"       [Datamonitor &#8212; "The Future of Skincare: Consumption trends and product       preferences", published 07/10/2011].
Within such a competitive and       high-value industry, every market advantage is of huge benefit to       manufacturers.
As a result of the media attention, several women's magazines ran       articles that promoted skin products containing the `miracle ingredient',       Matrixyl, including Cosmopolitan [b] and Woman [c] , with       the latter referring directly to the research at Reading.
[6]     One of the products mentioned is the Olay brand, a global market leader       [d], produced by Procter and Gamble (P&amp;G).
Following the research       publication [6] and the associated media coverage, P&amp;G benefitted from       a significant boost in sales of this product in the UK.
Exact sales       figures are confidential, but a spokesperson from the Procter and Gamble       London Innovation Centre [d,e] said there was a "noticeable increase in         sales", as quoted below :     "The Molecular Pharmaceutics paper and subsequent mention in the Daily         Mail (Anti-wrinkle creams that really work") led to a high level of         media interest and actual coverage across print and online publications         and social media platforms such as Twitter.
The specific mention of an         Olay Regenerist product containing Matrixyl led to a noticeable increase         in sales of this product."
"The fact that the original Molecular Pharmaceutics paper appeared in a         peer-reviewed science publication certainly gave great credibility to         the following media coverage, although none of the mentioned cosmetic         products had been part of the research.
Media and consumers alike are         hungry for independent, believable information and we have seen direct         correlations between media coverage and sales numbers in this particular         case as well in previous examples.
This is way [sic] research         partnerships and scientific credentialling are key strategies for Olay         and other P&amp;G businesses."
Industry invests in research and development and new products       The research has also impacted on small and medium enterprises working in       the skin care area.
Forme Laboratories was recently established by a team       of entrepreneurs.
Hamley's research influenced their approach to       developing a new range of skin care products, Stratum C, which are       scientifically formulated for the skin of menopausal women using Matrixyl.
Hamley is featured on the company website, explaining the science behind       their products [f].
The CEO of Forme Laboratories [g] stated that Hamley's       research findings [6] stimulated their investment in the development of       new products and further research:     "We became aware of the work of Professor Hamley and the University of         Reading on peptides and collagen production through the online coverage.
This contributed to the development of a new product called StratumC         aimed directly at menopausal women to stimulate collagen growth during a         period of compromised cellular function.
We hope to use the basic         science as a foundation for further research and to optimise the product         with the help of Professor Hamley and the University."
Stratum C products are manufactured in the US, and are available online       from the UK-based Forme Laboratories, with a full treatment regime for       three months costing &#163;120.
