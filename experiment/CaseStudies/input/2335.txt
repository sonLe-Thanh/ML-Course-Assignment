     The breadth and depth of CCRI research and the expertise developed by       CCRI teams in       understanding how aspects of RD and agri-environmental policies' design       and delivery can       critically affect their outcomes represents a unique position of applied       research influence.
Research impacts have been both direct and indirect, and cumulative over       time.
While they draw       from this whole body of work, it is possible to pinpoint instances where       research findings have fed       directly into policy change at both UK and EU levels.
In addition, the       impact trajectory has been       iterative: including direct dissemination to, and feedback from, policy       makers as well as successful       research dissemination stimulating further commissioned studies, and       expert input by CCRI       researchers to policy boards, thematic working groups and committees.
Three examples of specific       impacts of CCRI research are evidenced for the 2008-2013 period.
EU RD policy development: The findings of the RD instruments         review and RuDI studies had       direct impacts on the content of the EU Rural Development Regulation       finally agreed in September       2013.
The RD instruments review generated detailed recommendations for the       policy after 2013,       most of which are incorporated into the new RD regulation, including a       shift to strengthen the       strategic goals of RD, the removal of `axes', and the redefinition and       merging of individual       measures to provide increased simplicity and flexibility in how funding       can be used [a].
UK upland policy development: Research findings from the study: "Economic         and         environmental impacts of changes in support measures for the English         Uplands" contributed to the       development of UK policy for the Uplands and was used in formal evidence       to the House of       Commons Committee on Farming in the Uplands (2011) as part of Defa's       policy statement on this       topic [c].
As stated by one Defra official [b] "Critically, the         research supported our approach to CAP         reform negotiation and is undoubtedly the most influential piece of         qualitative research I have         commissioned".
Also the uplands work on Exmoor exploring more       integrated and flexible land       management policies has helped to influence the policy debate "The NFU         are regularly using         these research findings in discussion with policy-makers to develop more         integrated and flexible         policies and schemes on the uplands"[d], stimulating an internal       review of Natural England's       approach to agri-environment schemes and shaping Defra's proposed response       to the 2013 CAP       reform (This is currently under consultation &#8212; it suggests closing the gap       in support rates between       upland and lowland farms, effectively increasing upland support).
Farmer advice and engagement: CCRI's collaborative research       findings on influencing farmers'       environmental behaviour have been taken up widely by the policy community       and agri-sector       practitioners in England and Wales.
As one Defra office stated "There         is, over the last five years,         no academic research institution that has either had more impact or has         influenced to a greater         extent, our approach to farmer behaviours, advice and land management         environmental issues"       [b].
The research informed recommendations by the independent Farming       Regulation Task Force       (May, 2011) on the need for clear communication of advice and the       importance of working with       farmers [b].
The study's good practice principles were used directly in       Defra's key principles for the       provision of advice, as stated in Annex 3 of Defra's Review of Advice,       Incentives and Partnership       Approaches, published as a Business Plan Commitment in March 2013 [e].
This review also       evidenced CCRI's evaluations in identifying the drivers leading farmers to       seek advice.
As an       indicator of the wider influence of CCRIs research in this area, Annex 1       of the report makes       reference to seven reports that the institute was directly involved in       producing [e].
CCRI research also influenced the Welsh Government's approach to farmer       engagement.
The       research on co-operative working demonstrated that successful       agri-environmental co-operatives       can be encouraged, through facilitation, to work collectively for       environmental gain.
A direct impact       of this work was the employment of 18 Commons Development Officers (in         situ) operating across       Wales whose task is to develop the confidence and capacity of Commoners to       apply for collective       agri-environment schemes.
Approximately 90% of Commons in Wales reportedly       subscribe to and       work with these Officers [f].
The CCRI research was also used at practitioner level by the Agricultural       Industries Confederation       (AIC Value of Advice report, April 2013) to develop an understanding of       farmers' different sources       of advice and to highlight the importance of farm management advice from       one trusted source.
As       a result Defra, Natural England and the Environment Agency are now working       more closely with       the agricultural industry to deliver environmental advice through       integrated advisory packages.
"In         the past Defra operated a top-down approach to the way environmental         advice, in particular, was         delivered.
However, now as a result of some of the CCRI research on         understanding and         influencing farmer behaviours Defra are working more with the industry         in delivering their advice"       [g].
