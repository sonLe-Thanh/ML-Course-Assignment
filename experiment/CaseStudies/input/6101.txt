     In response to the ESRC directive for its funded research to be       transformed into useful materials offering benefits in the wider world,       LSBU approached and collaborated with OnePlusOne (www.oneplusone.org.uk),       a leading voluntary agency concerned with personal and family       relationships support.
Through an ESRC-funded Follow-On project (PI: Prof       Ros Edwards; Co-I: Dr Lester Coleman (OnePlusOne); &#163;100k; September 2010 -       December 2011) LSBU and OnePlusOne worked with three key voluntary       organisations that support "mixed" couples and families: viz.
People in       Harmony (www.pih.org.uk), Intermix (www.intermix.org.uk) and Mix       Together (www.mixtogether.org).
The Impact reported to the ESRC from the above follow-on project is       available at (1).
The project adapted findings from the two linked research projects on       "mixed" (racial, ethnic and faith) couples and family relationships into       on-line support texts, video and e-learning resources, specifically for:            individuals, `mixed' couples and their families who wanted to         strengthen their relationship (via OnePlusOne's         theCoupleConnection.net);       voluntary agencies involved in counselling and supporting couples and         families (via theCoupleConnection.net); and       training for professionals who work with `mixed' couples and their         families (via OnePlusOne's e-Learning training resource).
The resources were launched initially as a pilot during July/August 2011       and re-launched on theCoupleConnection.net web site in November 2011.
Resources from the project have been piloted through 60 front line       practitioners, specifically aimed at helping parents deal with conflict in       ways that minimise harm to children.
The resources have become part of       OnePlusOne's e-learning training programme delivered to 4000 Children       Centre professionals and workers nationally (1).
Independent consultants have confirmed the following impact (2):            Awareness raised and established norms challenged: misperceptions of         stereotypes of mixed couples have been contested, providing awareness of         the diversity of such relationships (three conferences held (Edinburgh,         Nov 2011; London Feb 2012; Cardiff Jul 2012), two seminars (London, Dec         2011; Jan 2012), plus review of the resources in eg The Runnymede Trust         Bulletin (3)).
The ESRC also used the project as an exemplar of         Follow-On funding.
Improved social welfare, equality and social inclusion: through the         provision of new targeted resources for OnePlusOne which are more         feature rich, widely distributed and collaborative with key higher         education and other key partners (1).
Reach of the resources and understanding: the resources have gone         beyond just use by the immediate collaborators and beneficiaries, e.g.
Sure Start and Health Start centres, midwives, GPs and the professional         body, the Royal College of General Practitioners, have all made use of         the resource materials.
Frontline practitioners working with couples and families who         undertake the OnePlusOne training programme have shown robust evidence         of its effectiveness.
In summary, OnePlusOne stated that, in addition to reinforcing their       approach of transforming research findings into useful resources, this       Follow-On project with LSBU has also extended the scope of their services       into new areas of couple and family relationships (2).
Other collaborators in the Follow-On project stated that:     - "the existence of the materials makes me and my other 8 colleagues         at Intermix 20% more efficient &#8212; that means the resources are doing the         job we would have had to do and therefore we can see greater numbers of         people and we are seeing better outcomes" (4).
- "as a result of using the materials on our site Intermix is seeing         better outcomes and increased conflict resolution" (4).
- "the resources are just as useful for people that support mixed         couples as mixed couples themselves" (5)     Recognising the value and importance of its interactions with       universities, Intermix has appointed an academic (Dr Caballero, LSBU) to       the role of research director.
The `mixed' families' resources derived from the underpinning research       were evaluated at the end of the project (2011) by the couples involved in       the making of the resources, users (`mixed' couples), and academics and       representatives from `mixed' race organisations.
Feedback via surveymonkey       shows the `mixed` couples resources to be useful, relevant to issues that       `mixed` couples and their families face and have encountered, and are       helpful in understanding their situation better.
Email testimonials received by the research team about the resources       include:       "I watched the videos you made with the couples and read some of the         materials.
I found the viewing material to be of great interest and was         most fascinated to see that a lot of the opinions and feelings that the         couples had regarding being in a mixed race relationship were very         similar to the opinions held by myself and my husband".
"I did watch the video clips and read some of the responses.
It helps         a lot knowing that there are more people out there like me.
I think that         the videos and comments of couples are accurate on the stresses we face         ... all in all I believe what you have done is an excellent job"       (6).
