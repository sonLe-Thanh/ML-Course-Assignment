     Pathways: Building on the early impact of Wong's ESRC research,       further studies were carried out for government departments &#8212; ODPM/DCLG -       leading to her appointment to advisory roles of government and agencies       and other international collaboration.
Wong's reputation as a quantitative       planner led to various expert advisory roles: Expert Member of the DCLG's       Housing and Planning Panel (2007-10) and Expert Panel Member of the       European Commission Directorate General for Regional Policy `Urban Audit       Analysis II' (2008-09).
More recently, she has been invited to advise the       UN-Habitat BLP Partner (Middle East) and to establish a monitoring       framework for master planning in Shantou, China.
Taken together, UoM       research on indicators and policy monitoring methodology has led to a step       change in policy monitoring practices in Britain, as well as shaping       professional debates, thinking and practices internationally (World Bank,       EC, Australia, Africa, UN-Habitat Middle East, and China).
Impact 1: Official planning monitoring practice in England.
When       preparing their `Annual Monitoring Reports' (AMRs) all local planning       authorities in England were required to comply with the official ODPM `LDF       Monitoring: A Good Practice Guide' &#8212; from publication (2005) until         April 2011.
The first page of the guidance stated clearly: "This         practice guidance is based on work undertaken by Cecilia Wong, Mark         Baker and Sue Kidd".
This has had a direct and profound impact on       shaping policy monitoring practice and ethos in England, constituting an       evidence-based approach for spatial planning, and contributing to the       wholesale spatial planning reform of the 2004 Spatial Planning Act.
The       impact of this guidance in shifting the mind-set of planning authorities       in terms of how they used indicators and the AMR to inform policy-making       was ascertained in a subsequent survey (in the 2007 Outcome Indicators       Framework Report).
Of the 186 local authorities (out of 394) that       responded, 79.3% found the combination of core output and other indicators       in the framework useful; 89.6% found the AMR process useful in the overall       plan-making process; and 100% agreed that it was important to collect       indicators to measure the outcomes of planning policy.
Impact 2: An integrative, collaborative and reflexive framework to         measure policy outcomes.
The 2008 follow-up research on `Spatial       Planning Outcomes Indicators', for the RTPI and the OPDM offered further       new thinking towards the development of a `Strategic Planning Outcome'       (SPO) monitoring framework.
Findings were directly used by the ODPM to         update the 2005 guidance (ODPM Update 2/2008).
Moreover, the SPO       framework has further shifted the mind-set and practice of spatial policy       monitoring in new directions by offering an integrative framework that       moved away from the traditional linear monitoring ethos, towards       collaborative, reflexive and double loop learning &#8212; to `question the goal       whilst solving the problem' &#8212; approach for monitoring complex spatial       policies.
As highlighted by the then Communities Secretary, Hazel Blears:       ".....
The Outcome Indicators Project gives councils a new more rounded         evaluation tool to consider.
It builds on existing monitoring structures         that already help councils plan, monitor and assess the way they plan         for sustainable communities".
The then RTPI Secretary General adds,       "... by adopting the measures set out in the Outcome Indicators         Project, local authorities and regional planners will be able to gain a         much clearer picture of the overall effect their planning policy is         having on communities, the economy and the environment" [1].
Impact 3: Continuous influence on policy thinking and debates during         the Coalition government.
Our research continues to operate at the       forefront of influencing the Coalition government's policy thinking.
During 2011 and 2012, UoM has been contacted by staff of the Department of       Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) on the monitoring of spatial       planning and the development of the `Assisted Area Map' in relation to the       use of spatial indicators and policy monitoring.
BIS opened a consultation       on 31/7/2013, commenting that: `Government has a long- standing working         relationship with the Centre for Urban Policy Studies, and within my own         policy area, you provided sound advice in relation to developing the         forthcoming 2014-2020 Assisted Areas Map' [2].
UoM researchers were       also commissioned by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) to apply       spatial analysis to develop `A Map for England' (www.mapforengland.co.uk)       to provide the evidence base for the planning of infrastructure and       services and enable decision makers at the local level to make more       informed policy choices [3].
Following major media reports on BBC Radio       4's `Today' and `You and Yours' programmes, the map findings were       presented on the RTPI pilot website, and subsequently drawn upon by       politicians to illustrate their points within the `Growth and       Infrastructure Public Bill Committee' [4].
The BIS Minister Michael Fallon       and Shadow Planning Minister Dr Roberta Blackman-Woods referred to the       maps, showing the relationship between superfast broadband coverage and       National Park boundaries, and commenting that National Parks have some of       the worst access to (and availability of) superfast broadband in England;       with National Parks in the North of England particularly poorly served, as       the availability of superfast broadband varies between and within National       Parks.
Blackman-Woods also made the point that there is clearly an issue       that needs to be addressed in the East of England which is both a growth       area (and an internationally renowned centre for research) and an area       that receives a low rating by Ofcom for superfast broadband availability.
The RTPI President Colin Haylock noted that: "with a Map for England         policy makers could make better judgments about how individual policy         proposals interact with and affect development of the country as a         whole.
Such an initiative would also increase consistency in the         appraisal of policy, improve security and resilience, and provide a         better understanding of sectoral issues that might complement or         conflict with each other" [3].
Impact 4: International arena: key references, advisory roles and         professional practices.
The World Bank includes Wong's Urban         Studies paper [D] as a key reference under its `Local Economic       Development (LED): a Primer' [5] which continues to impact on shaping       policy and practice across the world.
Similarly, [B] is referenced by the       LED Network of Africa (LEDNA) [6].
More specifically, Wong's 2006 Book [B]       has an impact on shaping the policy discourse in Australia over the       development of sustainability indicators.
The `Sustainability Indicators'       report, prepared by the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre for its       community forum in 2008 [7], made key recommendations to State and Local       Government about the role and context of sustainability indicators, by       extensively citing direct quotations from [B] nine times, and using the       five broad principles established in the book as a benchmark for their       activities.
In the EU context, principal component analysis applied in [D]       was also used in `Urban Audit Analysis II' (2010) and Wong was the Expert       Panel Member to oversee the preparation of the report and made comments       over its methodology in 2008/09 [8].
More recently, Wong was invited by       the UN-Habitat BLP Partner at the Middle East to join an Expert Group       Meeting (10-11th May 2013) to evaluate and revise the current       `City Prosperity Index' (CPI).
In the invitation letter, the Director of       MERC-BLP specifically mentions that: "We are aware that you have         conducted extensive studies and research in the field of Urban         Prosperity, and that you have prepared and published a research paper         under the title of `The Relationship Between Quality of Life and Local         Economic Development: An Empirical Study of Local Authority Areas in         England' [E]" [9].
Wong and Baker are currently involved in an international consultancy       team led by Nanjing University (China) to develop an innovative indicator       framework to monitor the progress of the new `Shantou Master Plan'.
Learning from the experience of developing the SPO in England, the broad       principles of developing `an integrative, collaborative, reflexive and       flexible' indicators framework with a map-based visual interface were       presented, in April 2013, to the international expert panel and senior       planners and politicians of the Shantou Government.
The project's director       commented that "adapting certain key principles you developed for         monitoring spatial planning policies and outcomes in England to apply to         the complex administrative and governing contexts of Shantou are very         helpful.
In particular, your ideas of adopting a gradual, incremental         approach to policy monitoring, with a more focused and flexible spatial         framework for indicators analysis that emphasises on the communicative         aspects of policy learning are seen as an innovative practice in China         and make an important contribution to our on-going work on the master         plan" [10].
This on- going engagement further demonstrates the       continuing impact of UoM research in shaping international practices of       policy monitoring.
