     The body of research has created impact in two main areas:     (1) Contributing to the preservation, conservation and presentation           of cultural heritage     The SEAS Photography project's digital archive, under the directorship of       Shepherdson, has been made publicly accessible and reached a       diverse range of audiences through a variety of strategies including its       website, curated exhibitions, archive open days, corresponding       publications and presentations.
The significance of the impact of this       work is two-fold.
Firstly, by conserving previously perishable and unique       photographs in a robust digital format the project has preserved part of       the cultural heritage of the South East of England.
Secondly, through       various presentation strategies it has reached a cross section of the       population and enhanced public knowledge about this part of the UK's       cultural heritage.
This significance is corroborated in the following       testimonial from the Head of Heritage Lottery Fund South East England:       [the SEAS Photography archive] "means that many more people are able         to gain access to this historic collection of photographs, providing a         vivid and fascinating reminder of seaside days on the Isle of Thanet in         years gone by.
The project also gives the local community a chance to         enhance and add to the collection by sharing their own Sunbeam pictures."
The SEAS Photography website currently includes content of some 3,000       images and provides ready access to a previously inaccessible resource.
The website received 131,000 hits by 31 July 2013.
In addition, there have       been exhibitions and public talks curated and led by Shepherdson       that have provided opportunities for people to engage with the project       (for example, a public exhibition held at The Pie Factory, Margate, 11-17       July 2013; a public lecture given to Margate Museum Friends and       Volunteers, November 2012; and a public lecture for the Isle of Thanet       Photographic Society, November 2012).
In total, more than a thousand       people attended these events between November 2012 and July 2013.
The       project has also provided free short courses and workshops in Margate and       Broadstairs covering how to use digital tools to safeguard cultural       heritage and record everyday life of communities.
Over 80 people attended       these by the end of July 2013, enabling members of the public to       contribute to the creation and preservation of their own cultural       heritage.
The significance of the project and its reach are further       evidenced by the following testimonial from the Head of Collection,       National Media Museum, UK: "SEAS Photography is contributing to our         knowledge and understanding of both twentieth century commercial         photography in Britain and the cultural practice of the population at         leisure.
SEAS Photography is not only preserving images of the past, but         also increasing awareness and accessibility of this material for both         academics and the general public."
(2) Enhancing public and professional understanding of digital           transformations in communities     The body of work described in this case study has enhanced public       understanding of digital transformations in communities through a range of       strategies including creation and publication of new knowledge, workshops,       public talks, debates and expert advice.
Gulyas' research provided       new evidence and initiated public debate on the impacts of digital       transformations on local media and communication.
The findings of two       empirical research projects, Empirical study on current trends and         challenges in regional media in Kent and Neighbours Online       showed how local communication is changing and raised concerns about       implications for local democracies.
The significance of this work is that       it provided data that had not been available before and raised public       knowledge of and awareness about the topic.
The impact of this research is       evidenced by the different ways it has been followed up: a public debate       on `Crisis in Local Democracy?'
(05/2010, Canterbury attended by 90)       chaired by Gulyas with contributions from key local media and       local political figures; a public research seminar given by Gulyas       on `Regional Media in Crisis' (06/12/2009, Canterbury); and media       exposure, including an interview with Gulyas on BBC Radio Kent       (03/2012), and coverage in the Media Guardian (09/05/2012) and Kent Online       (23/03/2012).
Gulyas' action research projects (Developing a Prototype Social         Media Toolkit for Community Groups and Organisations and Communities,         Third Sector Organisations and Social Media) worked with local and       regional public bodies and voluntary and community sector organisations.
The projects, led by Gulyas, aimed to support the latter in       developing their use of digital tools, in particular social media, in       order to enhance public engagement and augment their work in the       communities they serve.
Through the collection, analysis and presentation       of primary data, the research has improved understanding of social media       use in the voluntary and community sector as well as identified       organisational barriers and needs.
The projects involved supporting       voluntary and community sector organisations through workshops (free of       charge), one-to-one support, as well as stakeholder events which explored       the benefits of social media as well as issues with their use and       implementation.
There have been three workshops (07/2012 &#8212; `Social media       essentials'; 04/2013 &#8212; `Social media strategy; 06/2013 &#8212; `Community       building and fundraising with social media') led by Gulyas, which       were attended by 57 local third sector organisations demonstrating a wide       reach in the area.
The sessions gave the organisations tools, tips and       templates to support the adoption of social media in their organisation's       practices.
Impact of the workshops is evidenced by positive feedback       received from participants.
The significance of this work is confirmed in       a testimonial from the Director of Canterbury District Voluntary Alliance       (which has about 300 member organisations):"The Knowledge Exchange         project focusing on Social Media Skills and the third sector has been         extremely well received amongst the organisations who have taken part.
There is a real skills shortage in the sector regarding this area as         well as a realisation that social media needs to be increasingly at the         centre of what we do and, more importantly, will do in the future.
I,         personally, have benefited greatly from this project and am adapting my         working methods as a result.
It is heartening that there is such a         beneficial transfer of knowledge between the University and local         community organisations especially at a time when the sector is trying         to cope with the effects of the current economic situation".
Gulyas' research on social media use and attitudes in journalistic       communities in different countries has created impact through the       generation of new data and insights into how these digital tools are       embedded in professional practices, and their impacts on the profession.
The research has reached beneficiaries through publications, online       resources and presentations as well as media coverage in different       countries with widest dissemination in Germany and the UK.
Findings were       published online in non-academic professional reports available free of       charge.
Gulyas has co-written international comparative as well as       country specific reports on Germany and the UK yearly since 2011.
These       reports were discussed in a variety of professional outlets and forums.
For example, in Germany professional media exposure of the 2012 reports       included interviews with Gulyas (14/10/2012, 02/10/2012,       29/09/2012 on Cision sites), coverage and commentaries in PRReport       (29/10/2012), drehscheibe (12/11/2012), ABZV Universalcode (08/11/2012),       JakBlog (11/2012), Redbra.in (24/10/2012), Netzschnipsel.de (28/10/2012),       Zimpel.blog (30/10/2012), Verbande//Talk (11/2012), Lead Digital       (24/10/2012), onlinejournalismblog.com (27/10/2012),       saarlorlox.businesson.de (24/10/2012), ethority (25/10/2012), pressetext       (23/10/2012), TheWall (09/2012), Media Digest (19/09/2012) and MediaBistro       (20/09/2012).
In the UK the report was covered in the Press Gazette       (18/09/2012), Journalism.co.uk (19/09/2012), The Drum (18/09/2012), PR       Moment (20/09/2012), Graham Jones (19/09/2012), MediaPost (19/09/2012),       MediaJobs (20/09/2012), CorpComms (19/09/2012) and NewsReach (19/09/2012).
The significance and reach of the research is further evidenced by the       testimonial from the Managing Director of Cision Germany GmbH: "The         Social Journalism Study is of major importance in all of the markets it         covers (mainly UK, US, Nordics, Germany) and is essential in terms of         helping professional communicators to further their understanding of the         impact of social media.
Results of the study are communicated to the         entire industry by means of major press releases (up to 8 across the         globe), communicated within industry newsletters (approx.
200,000         subscribers/industry participants &#8212; several mailings throughout the         year), results are further used within Cision blogs posts (20 posts         within various country blogs), used in various online and offline         events, including YouTube videos, webinars, client events and are widely         reported within the media, online and offline.
Unique pageviews for the         2012 study results approaches 40,000 across Sweden, Germany, US and UK         (40%) with downloads of about 1,000 across these markets.
This study         would not be possible within the current format/quality, in terms of         output and impact without the support of both participating academics       [i.e.
Gulyas and Pole]".
Gulyas also organised an       international symposium on the topic ('Social Media, Journalism and       Communication Practitioners' 07/09/2012 Canterbury) attended by 60       academic and industry practitioners from different European countries.
