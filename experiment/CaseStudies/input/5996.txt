     The Centre has enhanced the cultural life of Bolton by increasing public       knowledge of the identity of Bolton as Mass Observation's `Worktown'.
Through its collaborative research partnership with Bolton Museum, the       Centre has undertaken research activities which have engaged the public of       Bolton in oral history other activities inspired by MO's Worktown project.
The benefits of this research partnership to wider society were recognised       in the designation of the Centre as a Good Practice Case Study of Museum &#8212;       HEI collaboration by Renaissance North West in 2009.
Social impact has       been achieved by:     1.
Five annual `Recording Leisure Lives' social history of leisure         conferences presented in Bolton Museum 2008-20012.
All were attended by         residents of Bolton as well as academic historians and photographers.
A         reviewed post-conference volume of each conference was published by the         Leisure Studies Association, widening the impact of the conference.
Staff members of Bolton Museum have acted as co-editors of several         volumes, thus enabling their participation in the publication of         research.
Members of the public published in these volumes, extending         the impact of the conferences beyond academia and stimulating further         interest in Worktown.
Conferences were reported in the national press,         extending awareness of the Spender collection to national and         international audiences.
A sixth conference, `Leisure in Worktowns' is         planned for April 2014.

Swain's two oral history projects in Worktown involved the public of         Bolton.
Both were funded by the Marriott Trust, were extensively covered         in the local press, and drew substantial engagement from Boltonians at         home and living abroad.
3.
A community arts project with young people in Bolton based on the         Spender Collection was funded through an AHRC Collaborative Doctoral         Award (2011-2014), supporting a research student placement in Bolton         Museum.
This studentship involved the re-classification of the Spender         photographs and engaged the public in the identification of unknown         locations.
The student was principal co-curator of the Museum's 75th         Worktown Anniversary Exhibition at the Museum from October-December         2012.
4.
Four Humphrey Spender scholarships under the supervision of Ian         Beesley through funding from the Marriott Trust.
These combine         documentary photographic practice and research and enable community         projects to connect the Spender photographs to the people of Bolton.
All         four projects engaged and involved members of the public.
5.
The establishment of a working relationship with the Mass Observation         Archive at the University of Sussex with reciprocal visits by staff of         each institution.
This supported the collation of the Worktown written         texts at Sussex and the corresponding photographs at Bolton, for example         the loan of written documents from Sussex for display in the 75th         Worktown Anniversary exhibition.
The impacts on public understanding of         the Mass Observation Worktown project will be realised further realised         through a Lottery funded education programme on Mass Observation in         2013.
6.
The Centre has inspired research in other fields; examples include the         production of a mobile phone "app" to locate the Spender images by the         University's Institute of Educational Cybernetics and a public         exhibition on textiles at Bolton Museum in summer 2013 presented in         collaboration with the University's Institute for Materials Science.
7.
Beesley has presented national and international documentary         photographic exhibitions at the National Media Museum, National Coal         Mining Museum for England, Liverpool International Photo-festival,         Orange Photo-festival Huang China, and the Peoples History Museum         Manchester.
8.
Snape has spoken on MO and Worktown to sixth form colleges, the North         West Region of the Photographic Collector's Club of Great Britain (April         2012) and Greater Manchester Council of Voluntary Organisations Research         Group (April 2013).
9.
The Centre actively supported a 75th Worktown Anniversary         Exhibition at Bolton Museum and the production of a new `Worktown         website, http://boltonworktown.co.uk/.
Between 1/9/2012 to 22/2/2013 this attracted 5,918 visits and 94,654         page views with an average length of visit of five minutes.
10.
Speake presented a photographic exhibition on disability at Bolton         Lads and Girls Club.
11.
The Centre has been approached by journalists and film-makers wishing         to use Worktown as the basis of newspaper and magazine articles and the         subject matter of a documentary film.
A film is currently in production.
12.
The Centre is also the locus of Rudd's work on the playwright Bill         Naughton who was a member of the Worktown team of observers.
While this         work is submitted to a different Unit of Assessment, its impacts include         a public conference to celebrate Naughton's centenary.
