     Prof. Wintemute's research and detailed knowledge of comparative law       developments have allowed him to contribute to campaigns for legal change       and significantly influence the development of human rights law.
In 1999,       he set out to find ways to participate in cases of discrimination against       same-sex couples or parents in international human rights courts, because       these cases can benefit many more countries than cases in national courts.
Judgments of the ECtHR apply to the 47 countries (with combined       populations of over 800 million people) that are parties to the EConHR.
Judgments of the IACtHR apply to the 23 countries (with combined       populations of over 550 million people) that are parties to the AConHR.
Favourable judgments of these courts could therefore benefit all lesbian       and gay individuals and same-sex couples and parents in these countries,       and their children.
Before 2000, there had been no "third-party interventions" in ECtHR cases       on sexual orientation discrimination.
Seeing an opportunity to combine his       pre-PhD litigation experience at a New York law firm with his research at       King's, Wintemute contacted an NGO (ILGA-Europe, the European Region of       the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association)       about a potential third-party intervention.
In so doing, he created an       academic-NGO partnership, which transformed ILGA-Europe's work, by opening       up a whole new field of activity, strategic litigation.
Since 2000,       ILGA-Europe has been granted leave to submit 14 interventions to the       ECtHR, 9 of which Wintemute has drafted.
In these 9 interventions (on       behalf of ILGA-Europe and 9 other NGOs, including the International       Federation for Human Rights or FIDH, and the International Commission of       Jurists), he has drawn on his research and expertise to advise the ECtHR       as to whether developments in comparative law support a finding of       discrimination violating the EConHR.
Since 1 Jan. 2008, these interventions have helped to persuade the ECtHR       to adopt crucial anti-discrimination principles in five cases, outlined       below.
In cases (1)-(3) and (5), the only intervention supporting the       applicants was drafted by Wintemute, while in case (4), Amnesty       International's intervention stressed United Nations materials of limited       relevance to the case.
In all five cases, the interventions contained much       more detailed comparative law research than the written arguments of the       applicants' lawyers.
In case (4), only the intervention drafted by       Wintemute made the specific "European consensus" argument mentioned below.
All 5 judgments discussed below are extremely useful precedents, which       practising lawyers and NGOs around the world are citing when they seek       legal reforms from national legislatures and courts.
For each case, the       paras.
of the judgment with the court's reasoning are cited, followed by       the paras.
of the judgment referring to the intervention (ECtHR) or report       (IACtHR) or to the specific arguments it makes, and the paras.
or pp.
of       the intervention or report where those arguments can be found:     (1) Karner v. Austria (Chamber judgment of 24 July 2003):       Countries that grant rights to unmarried different-sex couples must         grant the same rights to unmarried same-sex couples: (judgment       paras.
39-43 for reasoning; judgment paras.
8, 27, 36 for references; cf.
intervention pp.
2-9) (right to remain in home after death of tenant).
Although decided in 2003, Karner's impact continued when it was       cited and applied by the ECtHR in Kozak v. Poland (2 March       2010, same facts as Karner), P.B.
&amp; J.S.
v. Austria       (22 July 2010, sickness insurance cover for partners of civil servants),       and J.M.
v. UK (28 Sept. 2010, calculation of child       support), the subject of [5] above.
(2) E.B.
v. France (Grand Chamber judgment of 22 Jan.       2008): Countries that permit unmarried individuals to adopt children         may not exclude lesbian women or gay men (judgment paras.
94-97 and       Judge Costa's opinion para.
3 for reasoning; judgment para.
3 for       reference; cf.
intervention paras.
7-37).
This judgment overruled Frett&#233;       v. France (2002), which had allowed governments to exclude lesbian       and gay individuals from the possibility of adopting children.
(3) Schalk &amp; Kopf v. Austria (Chamber judgment of 24       June 2010): "A cohabiting same-sex couple ... falls within the notion         of 'family life' [in Article 8]" (judgment para.
92-94 for       reasoning; judgment paras.
5-6, 84 for references; cf.
intervention paras.
4-13); and the right to marry in Article 12 could apply to a same-sex         couple in the future (judgment para.
61 for reasoning; judgment       paras.
5-6, 47-48 for references; cf.
intervention paras.
14-27).
This       overruled prior decisions by the ECtHR that same-sex couples did not enjoy       "family life" under Article 8 (Mata Estevez, 2001), and that       Article 12 "secures the fundamental right [only] of a man and woman to       marry" (Christine Goodwin, 2002).
The "family life" statement was       cited by the IACtHR in Atala v. Chile, 24 Feb. 2012 (para.
174), and by Italy's Corte di Cassazione (Supreme Civil Court), 15       March 2012 (part 4.2, pp.
72-74).
A third aspect of Schalk is the       dissenting opinion (3 of 7 judges), which agreed with the intervention       that the absence of a legal framework for same-sex couples in Austria       (like the UK's Civil Partnership Act 2004) was discrimination violating       the EConHR (dissenting op.

28-44).
(4) X &amp; Others v. Austria (Grand Chamber judgment of       19 Feb. 2013): Countries that permit unmarried different-sex couples         to adopt each other's children may not exclude same-sex couples       (judgment paras.
139-141, 151, 153 for reasoning applying Karner,       paras.
7, 78-80 for references; cf.
intervention paras.
6-15, 20-38); the         burden of proof is on the government to justify the exclusion of         same-sex couples (judgment para.
141 for reasoning; judgment para.
7       for reference; cf.
intervention para.
14); and "European consensus"         should be assessed by examining only Council of Europe member states         that allow unmarried couples to adopt, not all 47 member states       (judgment para.
149 for reasoning, paras.
7, 79 for references; cf.
intervention paras.
16-19).
X &amp; Others made visible the       discrimination suffered by children of same-sex parents in most European       countries, which do not permit a child to have two legal parents of the       same sex.
It will require changes to the laws of 7 European countries       (unless they abolish adoption by unmarried couples), and could inspire       changes in others.
(5) Vallianatos v. Greece (intervention on 20 June 2011;       hearing on 16 Jan. 2013; Grand Chamber judgment finalised on 11 Sept.       2013, published on 7 Nov. 2013): Countries that create an alternative         to marriage for different-sex couples must extend the alternative to         same-sex couples (judgment paras.
85, 91-92 for reasoning, paras.
6,       69 for references; cf.
intervention paras.
3-8).
Prof. Wintemute's reputation for work in the ECtHR gave rise to a second       form of participation in the case of Atala v. Chile, the       IACtHR's first dealing with any aspect of lesbian and gay human rights.
Having been proposed by Ms. Atala's lawyers, he was invited by the IACtHR       to appear as an expert witness at a hearing held in 2011 in Bogot&#225;,       Colombia.
He was asked to provide a report on international law with       regard to sexual orientation discrimination, with emphasis on the EConHR,       because a critical question for the IACtHR was how the ECtHR would handle       a similar case.
Wintemute's evidence on this specific question helped to       persuade the IACtHR to conclude:     (6) Atala v. Chile (judgment of 24 Feb. 2012): Sexual         orientation is a "protected category" under the AConHR (judgment       para.
91 for reasoning; judgment para.
18(c) for reference; cf.
report pp.
2-5, 17-21, 22-23, 25-26); it was discrimination to transfer custody         of 3 girls from their lesbian mother to their heterosexual father       (judgment para.
146 for reasoning; judgment paras.
18(c), 134 and 153 and       footnotes 126 and 157 for references; cf.
report pp.
8-14, 21, 24).
Atala       lays the foundation for future IACtHR case law regarding sexual       orientation discrimination in the criminal law, in access to employment,       or in relation to the rights of same-sex couples, as well as with regard       to parental rights other than custody (including access to adoption).
Prof. Wintemute speaks frequently at conferences, seminars and NGO       training sessions about the potential applications of these judgments (eg,       Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile, 8 Nov. 2012; Ministry       of Foreign Affairs, Tallinn, Estonia, 23 Sept. 2013; Bandhu Social Welfare       Society, Dhaka, Bangladesh, 9 Nov. 2013; all funded by the local British       Embassy or High Commission).
