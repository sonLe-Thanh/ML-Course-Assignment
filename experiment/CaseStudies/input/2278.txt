     REAP has undeniably contributed significantly to the understanding of the       archaeology and history of Northern Britain in the early medieval period,       the wider impact of the research has been on popular knowledge and       appreciation of this crucial period for understanding the origins of the       kingdoms of medieval Britain.
The impact took place during and between the       fieldwork and the beneficiaries are multifarious; local communities,       regional audiences, and national and international communities interested       in the medieval world and those defining themselves in relation to       northern British, specifically Scottish, ancestry worldwide.
For all       groups, the impact has involved an enhanced understanding of post-Roman       society in northern Britain.
Integrated Fieldwork Outreach     REAP adopted an explicit philosophy and methodology for the generation of       academic and popular knowledge and debate through the engagement of the       public with early medieval histories in stone during fieldwork.
Key aspects of the project includes:            opportunities for local volunteers to participate in the fieldwork       training undergraduate students in archaeological fieldwork techniques         linked to the study of the context of early medieval monuments       open door policies giving tours to visitors on a daily basis       open days attracting a wide range of visitors       primary school groups site tours and school visits       youth club sites tours       The REAP website: http://www.reaparch.blogspot.co.uk/         started in June 2012.
As of 02/09/2013 the page had been viewed 8,350         times from all over the work from Europe to Australia and Fiji.
Popular Media     Between field seasons, REAP has disseminated results of the fieldwork       through a variety of media:     - As well as international peer-reviewed publications and open access       online publications (see section 3.
), popular magazine articles published       include Noble, G. and Gondek, M. 2011.

On-Site Heritage Management and Interpretation            REAP is working with Historic Scotland to update and improve the         current signs and the display of the carved stone monuments from Rhynie         incorporating the results of our work; this includes a bid to laser scan         all of the existing carved stone monuments at Rhynie to provide more         detailed illustration options and web-based visualisations.
REAP, in conjunction with Aberdeen Archaeology Services, has laser         scanned the Rhynie Man (currently housed in Aberdeen Council Offices) in         Nov/Dec 2012.
This will form the basis of new in-depth research, new         media outlets (e.g.
web based visualisations) for dissemination and         hopefully a reconstruction of the monument itself to be put back into         the village at Rhynie.
Community and Museum Engagement            2013 saw major investment and interest from the local Rhynie community         resulting in a pop-up caf&#233;/visitor centre in the village linked to the         project.
REAP is working with Marischal Museum, University of Aberdeen are         planning a new Pictish exhibit based largely on new material from Rhynie         in 2013.
