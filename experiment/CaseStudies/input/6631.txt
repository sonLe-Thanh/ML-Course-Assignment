     Artefacts from a national collaborative research programme, `Bespoke'       [1], featured at the London       Design Festivals of 2011 and 2012 [2][3].
This internationally renowned       festival annually attracts       visitor numbers of 350,000+.
[4].
Artefacts have been demonstrated and       exhibited internationally at       the British Council and AHRC backed design festival, `Unbox', in Delhi,       India [5].
`Unbox' abjures       established academic conferences and promotes as a `celebration of       interdisciplinary thought &amp;       work'.
Devices have been showcased at The Mozilla Festival 2013; Marshall       and Rogers were       invited to contribute to the `Making the web physical' strand [6].
The `Talking Memory Box', iterated the `Digital Story Box' for the       project with KEAP was used by       the Story Republic project [7] at schools across Cornwall to encourage       children's engagement with       local poetry and to allow them to associate their recorded responses with       objects that they had       found and/or made.
These successful deployments demonstrate the device's       potential for further       work within a educational contexts (see section 5 for details).
Deployments of adapted versions of       this device in other contexts have also proved valuable.
These deployments       include the local       history projects in Newcastle's Byker Estate [8] and Cornwall's Hayle [9].
Beyond the funded Impact award, the second iteration of `Viewpoint' has       been successfully trialled       recording community opinion related to sustainability and energy use.
