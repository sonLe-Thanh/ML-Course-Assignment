     Wilson's work has been instrumental in developing innovative forms of       artistic expression that both contribute to urban generation and       demonstrate how sculptural installations can stimulate debates enhancing       public awareness of art's role in enriching the cultural life of deprived       urban regions [a].
Established in 1998, the Liverpool Biennial is the UK's largest festival       of contemporary visual art `generating economic benefit, levering       investment and contributing to national and international external image       as well as local quality of life' [b: paragraph 1.2].
In partnership with       Liverpool Culture Company (LCC) and showcased at the Fifth Biennial (20thSeptember-30th       November 2008), Wilson's commission Turning the Place Over was       Papplauded by the LCC as "an astonishing feat of engineering that stunned       audiences on many levels", and the "jewel in the crown of the public art       programme" [d].
The installation, delivered as part of Liverpool's year as       European Capital of Culture (ECoC) in 2008, demonstrated how public art       could drive an inner-city renaissance by attracting more than 10 million       people to it.
Turning the Place Over both made an important general contribution       to Liverpool's Year as European Capital of Culture (2008) and specifically       reanimated a familiar, disused space within the city; as such, it       demonstrated how cycles of urban decline and redundancy can involve       artists in programmes of social and cultural regeneration.
Its reanimation       of the fa&#231;ade of an abandoned office block (a disused Yates' Wine Bar) in       Liverpool stood as a compelling example of the cultural benefits       accompanying sculptural installations within derelict urban spaces.
The       impacts of the piece on public discussion, debate and awareness of that       capacity for contemporary art to contribute to urban regeneration arose       particularly from the fact that it attracted both specialist and       non-specialist individuals to engage with the cultural benefits deriving       from it.
The piece itself, moreover, made an important contribution to the       regeneration of the area in which it was produced and to the       revitalisation of Liverpool's cultural offering more broadly.
In a survey       by Liverpool Biennial on the impact of Turning the Place Over,       90.2% of respondents believed Wilson's sculpture was good for Liverpool,       reinforcing the positive impact that public art in general can achieve &#8212;       and that Wilson's work specifically did achieve &#8212; on urban regeneration       and community confidence.
Feedback provided as part of that survey       included the following:     `It brought people across Merseyside together, put us on the map for         innovation, inspired thinking and had a real impact on improving the         reputation of Liverpool'.
`It reconnects city and their citizens.
It makes them have an opinion         because it might be controversial to them.
It's nice to see a bit of         change in the city sometimes'.
`Economically, it generates footfall and can draw people to areas they         may normally avoid.
This can also help to break down social barriers and         preconceptions' [h].
Wilson's work encouraged tourism to and within Liverpool as a means of       contributing to community regeneration.
Written evidence submitted by the       Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art Ltd to Parliament highlighted the       fact that the 2008 Biennial generated a spend of &#163;26.6 million &#8212; more than       ten times the level of public investment in the festival [b: paragraph       4.2].
Of its total 975,000 visits, 9% were made by international visitors       who came specifically for the event, and it leveraged around 20% of its       production budget from Europe and around the world [b: paragraph 4.4].
The       report concluded that `Liverpool's year as ECoC proved that cultural       output, commissioned from British arts organisations with real weight       behind their punch, will attract visitors and the consequent economic       benefit' [b: paragraph 4.4].
Hailed by the Liverpool Development Agency as `the most daring piece of       public art ever commissioned in the UK' [f], Turning the Place Over       attracted significant media attention, both to the piece itself and the       Liverpool Biennial more broadly, standing as a powerful social metaphor       for the ways in which public-facing art can transform run-down inner city       buildings.
The Liverpool Biennial and the LCC extended its presence to 18th       January 2011 &#8212; three and half years beyond the original time-scale &#8212; in       response to popular demand for public tours of the `iconic attraction'       [f].
The Liverpool Echo (18 January 2011) applauded its       `phenomenal draw' for both visitors and local people, claiming more than       3.5 million viewers had seen the work first-hand [e].
It also became a       `YouTube star', with over 158,000 views [g], contributing to Liverpool's       enhanced on-line media profile [c: p. 45].
Its popularity and publicity ensured that Turning the Place Over       was one of the Biennial's principle attractions, increasing national and       local media coverage of Liverpool's cultural offering; the number of press       articles more than doubling in the five years to 2008 [b: paragraph 4.5].
It contributed to the increase in perceived positive stories about       Liverpool, which rose by 71% between 2007-2008 [c, pp.
4 and 40-41].
The       success of the Liverpool Biennial and of Turning the Place Over       was influential in encouraging highly positive media coverage of Liverpool       'as a world class city' [c, pp.
4 and 39].
Consequently, 68% of UK       businesses judged that Liverpool's role as ECoC had had a positive impact       on Liverpool's image [c, pp.
4 and 35-6].
85% of residents agreed that       Liverpool was a better place than before ECoC' [b: paragraph 4.5]       believing contemporary art, including Turning the Place Over, had       enhanced community pride and facilitated social cohesion [c: pp.
4 and       53].
