     Principal beneficiaries include UK and worldwide policy-makers,       including WHO, international development NGOs and education ministries in       Europe; users of public services (i.e.
the general public, including       children) and those who work in them.
Dates of impact: From 2008-13, affecting many different policies       at different times.
Reach and significance: EPPI's continuous development of synthesis       methodology has made it possible for an ever-broadening range of decisions       to be informed by research &#8212; from EPPI itself and others using its       training, methods and tools.
These include policy decisions made by       governments and agencies globally and decisions by individuals considering       their own health choices.
The impact has been instrumental1,         supporting changes in policy, guidance and practice for services         provided to different groups within society; conceptual &#8212;         helping change the way politicians and civil servants develop policy;         and capacity-building &#8212; by training and supporting others         in review methods and use (R5).
Its reach is global: for         instance, work with WHO and DFID extends this training and support to         low-income countries.
Impact on research-informed policy-making capacity: Independent       external anonymous reviews of the programme, commissioned by DH in 2009,       reveal the extent of EPPI's influence (S5).
Reviewers praised its       pioneering innovations in methodology, its approach to working with       clients and its commitment to building capacity around the world:            "They have contributed significantly to our ability to spot `what         works best for whom in what circumstances'."
"The two-stage approach to systematic reviews is critical ... Not only         does it provide a key way of enhancing the dialogue with policymakers         ... it also promotes the effective use of resources".
EPPI developed "methods to synthesise the kind of complex         interventions that are so urgently needed to promote health and reduce         health inequalities".
The Centre "led the way in persuading other review groups to take         seriously a broader range of research evidence ...
Ultimately this has         to be to the benefit of the policy-making community".
UK Government: EPPI trains policy-makers and academics to       enable government to make better use of systematic reviewing.
For example,       they teach civil servants at DFID, DH and other departments how to develop       focused research questions that will result in more useful reviews.
Its       methods enabled the benefits of systematic reviewing &#8212; which formerly       analysed randomised controlled trials of health interventions &#8212; to extend       its reach to other areas, particularly education.
[text removed for publication]     Health guidance: EPPI's expertise in research synthesis       methods and in reviewing social care literatures led to two NICE contracts       in 2013: a) to be a part of NICE's National Collaborating Centre in Social       Care that develops and disseminates guidance and standards and b) to lead       a collaboration between several universities that acts as NICE's Research       Support Unit.
The Centre is a formal partner of both the internationally       prestigious Campbell Collaboration (social policy reviews) and the       Cochrane Collaboration (healthcare reviews).
Oliver is a member of the WHO       Expert Advisory Panel on Clinical Practice Guidelines and Research Methods       and Ethics and of the NICE Accreditation Advisory Committee.
Public involvement: Oliver's work has helped ensure that       user perspectives inform health guidance.
With colleagues she developed       new research-informed resources and procedures to support patient and       public involvement in shaping health technology assessments to meet NHS       needs.
Guidance authored by Oliver was publicly available on the National       Institute for Health Research website until the summer of 2013.
An       evaluation by the IOE's Social Science Research Unit (2006) showed that       public involvement changed the focus of research commissions and added new       outcomes &#8212; patient organisations and charities highlighted patients'       views, social contexts, long-term implications and the provision of       information to consumers &#8212; issues not usually addressed by professionals.
The same body of research (e.g.
R6) informed the WHO handbook for       guideline development (2012, p15, S3) and the James Lind Alliance       guidebook, co-authored by Oliver, showing step-by-step how to bring       patients, carers and clinicians together to identify treatments needing       urgent study (jlaguidebook.org, updated 2013).
Education Impact in Europe: EPPI leads the EU-funded       Evidence Informed Policy and Practice in Education in Europe (EIPPEE)       project (2011-13), which links 36 partner countries and 600 individual       network members, and helps countries across Europe develop their       research-informed policy-making capabilities.
Thirty-nine people from 20       countries have benefited from its free online training courses and more       than 250 people from eight countries from its tailored workshops &#8212;       including many from education ministries.
EPPI's consultancy service       helped education policy-makers in the City of York select the highest       impact strategies for narrowing the learning gap and develop the `York       Challenge' approach for 2013-14 (S7).
The consultancy "helped to       unpack the research so that we have been able to plan implementation       processes with schools", they said.
Wider international collaboration: From 2008-13 EPPI       provided training for policy-making bodies around the world, including       education and justice ministries in New Zealand, India's National Council       for Educational Research and Training, the European Food Standards Agency       and Japan's Economic and Social Research Institute.
EPPI is a partner in       an international Global Evidence Initiative to build review capacity for       policy and practice in low and middle income countries and supports       WHO-funded Centres in Bangladesh, Chile, China, Lebanon, India and South       Africa to carry out systematic reviews relevant to health systems policy.
Professional engagement: EPPI has partnerships or strong       links with the UK's What Works Centres including NICE, the Education       Endowment Fund and the new What Works Centre for Crime.
Impact of         individual reports: EPPI studies have broad national and       international impact, taking in neonatal health in developing countries,       sex education interventions and plain tobacco packaging.
We have chosen       two very different high impact reports as examples of EPPI's diverse       impact.
Education for smoking cessation in pregnancy:       Beneficiaries include infants and mothers in at least five countries.
By       addressing health-worker and patient concerns, the researchers shaped       questions around how to educate and help women to stop smoking,       not just the impact of smoking (R3).
The findings inform clinical       guidelines in Australia, Brazil, South Africa and the UK, as well as those       published by the International Primary Care Respiratory Group.
The 2010       NICE and NHS Wales guidelines say all pregnant smokers should be       automatically referred to stop smoking services and offered help to quit.
This was a key recommendation of the EPPI research (R4), which is       cited in the guidelines' background and briefing papers (e.g., S4).
The research also informed the American 5As clinical programme (Ask,       Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) (S6).
Microfinance in Sub-Saharan Africa: The 2010 study (R2)       and the 2012 follow-up sparked debate and helped bring a more questioning       approach to microfinance to the international development community.
Policy         change in Norway: The research contributed to the 2012 decision of       the country's aid agency Norad to stop funding most new microfinance       institutions, after more than a decade as a key donor.
The decision       followed a TV expos&#233; by a Danish journalist, to which Stewart contributed.
In its response, Norad stated it was "well aware of the new research in       the microfinance area, including the systematic reviews" (S8).
The       Anglican Communion asked Stewart to contribute to its Economic       Empowerment Workshop in Nairobi in 2012.
Priorities agreed included       "development of new products and services that can provide access to       finance for the most poor" and better financial literacy education.
Professional         and public engagement: Impact was heightened by an intensive       programme of meetings, briefings and colloquia in 2011-12, including with       Comic Relief, FSA, World Bank, Cochrane Colloquium, the South African       government and the House of Commons Microfinance All Party Parliamentary       Group.
