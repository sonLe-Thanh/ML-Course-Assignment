     The law and practice of the Supreme Court of Canada and United         Nations High Commission         for Refugees has been significantly influenced by Cryer's research       on definitions of crimes,       principles of liability and defences in international criminal law,       specifically as they impact on       refugees.
Impact on Canadian Refugee Jurisprudence:     In July 2013, Cryer's book chapter (in R1 above) was cited by the         Supreme Court of Canada in       its landmark decision, Ezokola v Canada [2013] SCC 40 (see source       1 below).
Cryer's argument       influenced the Court's new test to determine eligibility for refugee       status.
In Ezokola, the Court had       to interpret Article 1F(a) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the         Status of Refugees, under which       claimants are denied refugee status if they are determined to have       committed a crime against       peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity.
Prior to this case,       Canadian jurisprudence on       Article 1F(a) had been unclear and contradictory.
Refugee applicants were       being excluded on the       basis of their membership of groups accused of such crimes, rather than       their individual       responsibility for the commission of crimes.
The Federal Court of Appeal       in Canada had previously       held that those in authority could be considered complicit in an       international crime by remaining in       their position without protest and protecting their group/government's       interests while being       conscious of the offences being committed in the name of their group.
This       permitted guilt by       association and through passive acquiescence.
The Supreme Court of Canada       was required to       bring consistency and coherence to this area of law.
The Court recognised       that liability by virtue of       complicity plays a key role in the commission of international crimes,       owing to the large number of       people who tend to be involved in them.
When deciding where the line       should be drawn between       association and complicity, the Court laid down a new `significant       contribution' test for determining       the criminal liability of refugees.
In creating this new test, the Supreme Court of Canada relied upon         Cryer's book chapter to rule       that there must be a voluntary, significant and knowing contribution on       behalf of the individual for       the criminal purposes of the group.
Cryer's underpinning arguments,       utilised by the Supreme       Court, stress:            The importance of the nature of joint criminal enterprise liability.
The Supreme Court found that joint criminal enterprise requires that "the       accused have made, at a       minimum, a significant contribution to the group's crime or criminal       purpose, made with some form       of subjective awareness of the crime or criminal purpose" (para 67).
The fact that to satisfy the actus reus requirement, membership in the         group per se is not         sufficient to ground liability.
The defendant must perform an action         that contributes to the         implementation of the plan.
There is no requirement that the         contribution made by the         defendant is a `necessary or substantial one', but...it needs to be         `significant' (pp.369-70).
The Supreme Court held that "guilt by association is not a means to       exclude" and found that there       must be a link between the accused's conduct and the criminal conduct of       the group (para 67).
This helps to align Canadian jurisprudence with international law and       limits the overextended use       of Article 1F(a) of the 1951 Refugee Convention.
The change         significantly impacts individuals         who would previously have been denied State protection, while       continuing to deny refugee       status to those individuals who were involved in serious international       crimes.
The Senior Counsel,       Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes Section, Government of Canada,       confirmed that his       office "uses [Cryer's] book regularly, most of the time when our office       provides legal advice to the       Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Border Service Agency...       the latter when       dealing with overseas visa applications or inland asylum or deportation       processes.
Especially when       the question pertains to defences, either as a stand alone question or in       the context of child       soldiers, the book is one of the first sources we rely on, either directly       or as a guide for further       research ...
The advice provided by our office... usually will find its       way into facta filed with either       the civil or criminal courts.
Examples of the legal advice utilized in       this fashion in the civil context is       foremost the factum of the government as well as several facta of       intervenors in the recent case of       Ezokola before the Supreme Court of Canada, which itself referred to the       book in its decision" (see       source 2 below).
Influencing UNHCR Guidelines:     In January 2013, Cryer participated as an invited expert to the UNHCR in       roundtable discussions       held in Colchester, UK, designed to revise and update the UNHCR's 2003       Guidelines on       International Protection: Application of the Exclusion Clauses issued       under Article 1F 1951         Refugee Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee         Convention).
The aim of the       roundtable was to ensure that the guidance was aligned with advances in       International Criminal       Law, International Humanitarian Law, International Human Rights Law and       Refugee Law.
Owing to       his expertise on International Criminal Law, and how crimes, principles of       liability and defences are       defined, Cryer was invited to provide expert advice on the expansion of       general principles of       liability in the determination of refugee status (the key issue to be       considered in the revision of       these Guidelines) (source 3).
The discussion focused on the challenges       that modern developments       in the law on general principles of liability pose for refugee law, and       the fact that the guidelines       must reflect existing law rather than creating new law.
A central concern       was whether a person       should be denied asylum on the basis of what s/he has done.
Cryer proposed       that the new       guidelines should reflect the controversy associated with the mental       element in group participation.
Drawing on the arguments in his book he advocated the need to balance the       dynamics of the       group nature of international crimes with individual responsibility, and       emphasised flaws in the       2003 guidance which contained little substance on the general principles       of the criminal law,       because it was not considered so important when this guidance was drawn up       (source 4).
Consequently the arguments in Chapter 15, where Cryer identified the       practical implications of       mens rea with regard to the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise       and criminal liability, underpin       proposals to reform the guidance on exclusion of refugees.
Cryer's       contribution to the roundtable       has therefore influenced the UNHCR in applying the general       principles of liability and defining the       eligibility of refugee applicants, thus benefitting both the States which       implement the UNHCR       guidelines and those individuals seeking refuge within their borders.
The       revised guidance       containing these changes, which will offer stronger legal protection to       refugees, will be published       by the UN in 2014.
UNHCR guidelines are widely used by States in their       determination of refugee       status, and by lawyers acting for putative refugees.
They are intended to       offer interpretative legal       guidance for governments, legal practitioners, decision-makers, the       judiciary, and UNHCR staff       carrying out refugee status determination in the field.
In many cases, the       UNHCR actually       determines eligibility which States then follow.
To give a sense of scale       of this problem, in 2010,       UNHCR conducted refugee status determinations in 67 countries, making       about 100,000       determinations.
That amounts to 11% of global asylum applications (source       5, p.42.)
Summary     Cryer's research has thus shaped developments both in international         jurisprudence and at         the level of UN guidance, by facilitating access to justice for       refugee applicants in Canada and       contributing to improvements in the provision of guidelines for the       determination of refugees within       UN Member States.
It thereby directly benefits governments, legal       practitioners, decision makers       and the judiciary implementing UNHCR guidelines, as well as the       individuals seeking refuge within       their borders.
