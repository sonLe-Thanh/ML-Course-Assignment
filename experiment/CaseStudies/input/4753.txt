     From its inception, the Project has been guided by the philosophy of       making the fine rolls accessible to and usable by as many beneficiaries as       possible, reaching out to engage everyone with an interest in this period       of English history.
Information about the Project has been disseminated       through the website, email correspondence and numerous talks by members of       the Project team (listed at http://www.finerollshenry3.org.uk/content/news/events.html).
From 24 to 25 June 2011, the Project hosted an international conference on       the fine rolls at KCL, attended by approximately 60 delegates, including       students, archivists, local historians and established scholars from the       UK and US.
Articles about the Project have appeared in History Today       (Issue 5, 2007), BBC History Magazine (March 2011), the local Kent       press (The Kentish Gazette, Dec. 2010) and the newsletter Supporting         Research at the National Archives (Winter 2009, Spring 2011, Summer       2011).
The Project website has been linked to The National Archives'       palaeography practice page, http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latinpalaeography/practice-documents.htm,       its user guide `Looking for records of medieval political history',       http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/looking-for-subject/medieval-political-history.htm,       and its catalogue, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C3620.
The Project's reach and significance can be measured in the following         ways:            The Project has an international reach and has created new audiences         and users for this medieval resource: between 02 June 2012 and 02 June         2013, alone, according to `Google Analytics', 22,931 visits were made to         its website by external users and its webpages were viewed 102,191         times.
8,992 visits were made by returning users.
Users accessed the         site from the UK (11,699), US (5,796), Australia (1,092), Canada (844),         France (431), Germany (360), New Zealand (205), Ireland (155), Spain         (145) and unknown countries (146).
The `Fines of the Month', totalling more than 350,000 words on the         Project website, provide monthly comment on material in the rolls.
They         represent a direct interface with the general public as contributions         are invited from people outside the Project team.
85 `Fines of the         Month' were published between December 2005 and December 2012 (57 after         01 April 2008).
Evidence of the Project's impact can be found in more         than 40 `Fines of the Month' written by people outside the research team         http://www.finerollshenry3.org.uk/content/month/fine_of_the_month.html.
These show how material from the rolls has: i. allowed local communities         to re-connect with their thirteenth-century past.
The villagers of         Nunney in Dorset used the rolls to date their market charter to 1260         (Ken Lloyd, Project Director, Friends of Nunney Church, Fine of the         Month, August 2010); ii.
helped secondary school teachers to research         their local communities.
Huw Ridgeway, former head of history at         Sherborne School, used the fine rolls to examine `Sherborne and Corfe         castles in 1260-1' (Fine of the Month, December 2010); iii.
assisted         local archivists in extending their knowledge by complementing material         in their own repositories.
In the Fine of the Month for October 2008, Dr         John Alban, the county archivist for Norfolk, explains how the fine         rolls provide evidence of the high prices paid by the men of Norwich and         Lynn for the confirmation of charters under Henry III; iv.
provided         heritage organisations with new evidence for the architectural history         of their properties (Jeremy Ashbee, Head Properties Curator at English         Heritage, `"Gloriette" in Corfe Castle', Fine of the Month July 2011);         v. been used by postgraduate students at UK Universities.
The Fine of         the Month for October 2010, which considered the fine rolls as a source         for the Fifth Crusade, was written by Josey Cullen, who completed an MA         in Crusader Studies at Royal Holloway and Queen Mary, University of         London.
The Project website has also been used as a teaching resource         for the `Perspectives in Medieval History II' module for the MA in         Medieval History at the University of York.
The Project has 586 followers on Twitter, and the website has a blog         (http://blogs.cch.kcl.ac.uk/frh3/),         managed by Dr Wilkinson (August 2010 to December 2012).
The blog's         impact can be evidenced by its use in the field of Jewish studies.
In a         blog entry of 31 January 2012, Marcus Roberts, founder of the         Anglo-Jewish heritage organisation J. Trails, commented on the `Apple of         Eve', referred to in a writ copied onto the fine rolls in January 1252,         shedding light on rituals in medieval synagogues http://blog.frh3.org.uk/?m=201201).
The Project website has been used as a resource by local schools and         societies.
In March 2013, Pete Morgan, a teacher at Beverley Grammar         School, contacted the Project (see http://blog.frh3.org.uk/?p=1033#comments),         describing how he had set a task for Year 7 students, whereby students         used the Henry III Fine Rolls website to research the history of         Beverley.
Members of the Ilkeston and District Local History Society         (Derbyshire) have also used the website to research their `lords of the         manor'         (http://www.ilkestonhistory.org.uk/history/briefhistories/lordsofthemanor/lordsofthemanor.htm).
