     Because the use of a mycoinsecticide in the context of locust control was       such a novel concept at       the time, LUBILOSA scientists were obliged to undertake an extended       transition from research to       the `near marketplace'.
The large trials in Niger of `Green Muscle' (&#167; 2)       were all publically funded,       as were toxicology, ecotoxicology, registration support and even initial       branding: functions normally       carried-out in the 21st century by private enterprise.
The       pattern of public-funded research being       taken up by small companies now appears to be conforming to another trend:       over recent years       these have been in turn acquired by major agro-chemical companies.
The       withdrawal of many       conventional chemicals, for various environmental, toxicological and       regulatory reasons, has       created a heightened need for biopesticides, so in retrospect the       importance of this work extends       well beyond just locust control.
Green Muscle&#174;       The company Biological Control Products (BCP), a leading producer of       biopesticides in Africa,       commercialized Metarhizium for the locust control market as `Green       Muscle', first in South Africa       and subsequently in other southern and eastern African countries.
The       company was taken over by       the U.S. crop-technology company Becker Underwood in 2010, which was in       turn bought by BASF       in 2012.
The company continues to supply Green Muscle&#174; for the central       &amp; southern African       market [A].
The product is marketed as `an alternative to chemical         pesticides' that works in       `complete harmony with the environment', and it is `recommended         by the Food and Agriculture         Organisation of the United Nations for use in ecologically sensitive         areas' [A].
The impact of Green       Muscle includes:            In 2009, the bio-pesticide was used to treat around 10,000 hectares of         wetlands infested with         red locusts (Nomadacris septemfasciata) - this was to prevent a         full-blown invasion that could         have affected the food crops of around 15 million people &#8212; whilst still         protecting wild animals         including: elephants, hippos, and giraffes, in the Iku-Katavi National         Park, Tanzania [B].
It was         the first time that biopesticides had been used on such a large scale         against locusts in this         region and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations         (FAO) organized and         coordinated the campaign together with the International Locust Control         Organization for         Central and Southern Africa (IRLCO-CSA) [B, C].
Aerial survey and         control operations were run         over a few weeks in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, to get the         locust threat fully         under control [B, D, E].
A plague of locusts broke out in Southeastern Egypt and Northeastern         Sudan in February 2013.
Within a month, the plague had reached Cairo and, by 4th March, it had         reached Israel.
In         Israel, the plague was treated with the bio-pesticides Green Muscle,         which largely controlled the         outbreak within the first week [F].
Green Guard&#174;       The LUBILOSA Programme was regularly reviewed by Dr. Richard Milner of the       Commonwealth       Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, who       subsequently promoted       the mycoinsecticide technology in Australia as Green Guard&#174; [G].
In an       article describing the       Green Guard&#174; pesticide, the relation between Green Guard&#174; and Green       Muscle&#174; is explicitly       described: `Much of the basic technology used to develop Green Guard&#174;         was derived from a         collaboration with the LUBILOSA group working in Africa and England to         develop Green Muscle&#8482;,         a similar product registered in parts of Africa and produced under         licence by Biological Control         Products in South Africa' [G].
Plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera) populations in Australia       are present more regularly than       most African locust species and there is a greater environmental pressure       to develop alternatives       to chemicals [G].
Control of locusts using Metarhizium/Green Muscle&#174; is       more expensive than       control using chemical insecticides.
Therefore it is mainly used on       properties with certified organic       production, including cattle, and in other areas, such as water-courses,       where chemical pesticide       use is restricted or undesirable.
Constraints on the use of chemical       insecticides are increasing and       having a biological control agent is critical to ensuring the continued       effectiveness of the Australian       Plague Locust Commission (APLC) locust management programme [H].
The APLC       began using       Green Guard&#174; operationally in 2000 and, since then, it has been used `extensively         where there are         land use limitations on chemical pesticides' [I].
Green Muscle&#174; is       mainly aerially applied [J].
During the period 2004-2008, 33,350 ha was sprayed with Metarhizium;       for the period 2008-2010 it       was 30,120 ha, with an additional 9,630 ha treated by the South Australian       Department of Primary       industry and approximately 11,000 ha treated by the Victorian Department       of Primary Industries       during a 2010 outbreak.
Green Guard&#174; was a recommended pesticide during       the 2010-2011 locust       campaign in New South Wales [K].
Although more expensive than chemical       insecticides, the area       treated with Green Guard&#174; has generally increased as a proportion of the       total area.
Green       Guard&#174; has also been used in East Timor and China and is also now marketed       by Becker       Underwood [L].
Mycoharvester       A `spin off' technology from the development of Metarhizium acridum       was the development at       Imperial College of a device to collect separated conidia from the culture       substrate (usually grain) in       a pure form, to aid both drying (which enhances conidial shelf life) and       formulation stability.
This       equipment was later further developed and named the `Mycoharvester' [M];       it is now used by others       working on fungal pathogens and more than 100 machines have been sold       around the world.
