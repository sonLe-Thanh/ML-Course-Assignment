     Dr Hope's PAGE2002 model was used by the Stern Review, widely recognised       as the most       influential report on the economics of climate change.
The member of the       Stern team responsible       for running the model confirms that `PAGE2002 was the sole model used         by the Review to         estimate the economic impact of climate change in money terms.
The         resulting estimates were a         crucial part ... [and]... are certainly the most cited part of the         Review, not only in academia but also         in the policy and public debate.
For example, the front pages of several         national newspapers in the         UK and beyond ran with the estimates' (Source 8).
The most       high profile users of the PAGE2002       model in the assessment period are the Eliasch Review in the UK (Source         1), the US       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Source 3) and the       International Monetary Fund (IMF)       (Source 4).
The Eliasch Review (2008), an independent report to the UK government on       ways to make       effective reductions in forest carbon emissions, used the PAGE2002 model       to estimate that the       mean global economic cost of climate change caused by deforestation could       reach $1 trillion a       year by 2100 and that the mean net benefits of halving deforestation could       amount to $3.7 trillion       over the long term (Source 1).
The net benefit of avoiding       deforestation calculated by the Eliasch       Review has helped to advance the case for forests to be included in any       future agreements on       climate change policies.
In doing so, the costs of reducing global carbon       emissions will be reduced       substantially, and lower costs will mean that a more ambitious overall       emissions target will be       possible.
The written statement from HM Treasury details the impact of the PAGE2002       model, which puts       specific analysis and figures on measures for reducing global       deforestation as a policy priority for       the international community (Source 9).
Analysis of costs and       benefits by Hope provided a figure       for global deforestation that was a central message and considerably       strengthened the impact of       the Eliasch Review.
It is now being used to make evidence-based policy and       shape negotiating       positions in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
UK, EU and US       governments have used cost estimates from the Eliasch Review to decide on       an overall figure of       $100 billion required for climate mitigation and adaptation.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used PAGE2002 in 2009-10 as       one of three       integrated assessment models, to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC)       for use in regulatory       analyses (Source 2).
A written statement from the US office of the       EPA describes how SCC is       incorporated into federal regulations by the EPA; and by NGOs, private       sector firms, development       banks and others to quantify the climate impacts of their carbon-related       decisions (Source 10).
For       example, the Environmental Defense Fund used documentation on the SCC to       inform a public       utility commission hearing examining new electricity power generation.
Following publication of the       U.S. government SCC analysis, DOE, EPA, and the U.S. Department of       Transportation (DOT)       have used its estimates in twenty rulemakings.
These rules affect vehicle       GHG standards, ECS for       domestic appliances and cross-state air pollution, amongst others (Source         4).
The US EPA notes that the SCC estimates calculated by them using the       PAGE, DICE and FUND       models represent the first sustained interagency effort within the US       government to develop an       SCC for use in regulatory analysis.
The appropriate level for the price of       carbon has been the       subject of debate (Ref 6, Ref 7) and featured in the New York         Times (Source 5).
Dr Hope's work is       continuing to move the policy debate forward on this important issue, for       example, his calculations       are being used by the EPA to generate revised climate damage estimates,       which are incorporated       into the cost of electricity generation to ensure the EPA in the US sets       the strongest possible       carbon emission standards on power plants.
In 2007 Dr Hope was described       in The Financial         Times as the `unsung hero who has finally devised a way of         calculating the financial cost of global         warming, showing that you can save the planet while keeping the economy         healthy' (Source 7).
Hope's work directly impacts on the ability of government to put a price       on carbon emissions.
This       is a concern for all governments.
`Just as every country has a value         added tax or a sales tax, every         country will put a price on greenhouse gas emissions' (Source 6).
In 2012, the head of the IMF,       Christine Lagarde, argued in a foreword to a major new IMF report that `fiscal         instruments&#8212;carbon         taxes or their cap-and-trade equivalents (with auctioned allowances)&#8212;can         and should form the         centrepiece of policies to reduce energy-related carbon dioxide         emissions'.
The IMF's guidance on       the appropriate carbon price drew explicitly upon investigations performed       using the PAGE2002       model in the US and the UK, cited in chapter 4 of their report (Source         3).
