     4a: Laboratory studies led directly to a series of clinical trials in         humans.
Following on from the initial studies undertaken at Queen Mary by Prof       MacDonald's team, further comparisons between enteral nutrition and       corticosteroids were carried out.
Heushkel and colleagues summarised 5       other studies that showed that enteral nutrition was as effective as       steroids in inducing remission in paediatric Crohn's disease [6].
In 2006,       these results were confirmed in an Italian study [7].
Since then pediatric       gastroenterologists have accepted the efficacy of enteral nutrition, and       more recent studies have focussed on the type of enteral nutrition [8],       partial enteral nutrition [9], and fractionated versus continuous feeding       [10].
4b: Change in clinical guidelines and policy in UK     The use of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for paediatric Crohn's       disease was adopted in 2008 in the guidelines of the British Society for       Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition [11]; this       recommendation was reinforced in 2010 [12].
It is recommended by leading       opinion leaders as the primary choice for patients presenting with Crohn's       disease and a degree of malnutrition [13].
Consultative NICE guidelines       published in October 2012 are strongly supportive of enteral therapy in       paediatric Crohn's disease.
For example, paragraph 1.4.2 of the consultative NICE guidelines states:       "Enteral nutrition is currently widely used as first-line therapy in         children and adolescents to facilitate growth and development."
Paragraph 4.3 states: "Consider enteral nutrition as an alternative to         a conventional glucocorticosteroid to induce remission for: children in         whom there is concern about growth or side effects, and young people in         whom there is concern about growth."
[14]     4c: Change in clinical guidelines beyond UK     European guidelines changed in 2006 to recommend enteral nutrition as       first line therapy in children with Crohn's disease [15].
The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and       Nutrition issued new guidelines in 2012 recommending enteral nutrition as       first line induction of remission therapy for paediatric Crohn's disease       [16].
4d: Change in clinical practice worldwide     In Sweden, 96% of paediatric IBD units now use enteral nutrition for       Crohn's disease, and 65% use exclusive enteral nutrition as primary       therapy [17].
Overall in 2003, 62% of European gastroenterologists used       enteral nutrition to treat Crohn's disease in children [18], and it is       likely that the figure is even higher now, although no recent European       data are available.
Exclusive enteral nutrition is now being used in       Australia [19].
In a survey of the use of enteral nutrition in Europe, North America and       the Asia-Pacific region, 89% of units used enteral nutrition and polymeric       formulae, and by far the majority used two products, Modulen IBD or the       lactose free equivalent, Elemental 208 [20].
4e: The change in practice produced a change in patient outcomes     About 20 per cent of children with Crohn's disease treated with long-term       low dose steroid treatment have growth failure.
After cessation of       steroids, 70 per cent do not show catch up growth [21].
In a two-year       follow up of 109 children treated with Modulen IBD, weight and BMI       improved markedly during follow up [22].
Height catch-up growth was       bimodal, with those patients who responded clinically showing catch-up       growth but those who did not, remaining short [22].
In addition, children       with Crohn's disease have a markedly impaired quality of life [23].
Exclusive treatment with Modulen IBD improves their quality of life [24].
An estimated 17,000 new cases of Crohn's disease occur in children across       Europe annually, so a conservative estimate is that as a result of our       early research, at least 13,000 children a year are being spared steroid       therapy.
