     We now provide evidence to show that the research findings that we have       cited in 3.1 and 3.2 have resulted in two major impacts:     (1) the design and production of a new generation of sound barrier for a       wide range of industrial and business partners, a number of them leaders       in their field.
These sound barriers not only provide commercial and       operational benefit for these companies but they additionally provide       improved environmental benefit (reduced sound transmission) and reduced       cost in compliance with EU Regulations.
A spin-out company (Sonobex) has       been established to test and market these designs and products     (2) a contribution to the understanding of science and engineering to       both the public and to policy makers, via Sonobex.
Impact 1     The outcome from the research is in the commercialisation stage and the       research grants listed in section 3 have been awarded in order to develop       commercial products based on the academic research carried out in       2007-2012 [3.1, 3.2].
A spin-out company Sonobex       Ltd. was formed in May 2013 and prototype sound barriers have been       successfully tested.
The list of project partners given below is evidence       that Sonobex Ltd has established its visibility and is set       to realise its potential in both UK and international markets.
Because of       the damaging effects of noise on public health and       the environment, European Legislation [The European       Parliament and The Council of The European Union, Directive       2002/49/18.7.2002.]
for noise has required each member state to prepare       noise maps of larger towns and cities and to publish action plans that       identify noise standards and set out programmes to reduce levels to these       standards.
The first UK round of noise mapping has been completed (2011)       and the second round of noise mapping is taking place.
A follow on       regulation to the Environment Noise (England) regulations, 2006 will       require reductions in noise limits to take effect from 2016.
The noise       which is predominately of concern is airborne sound and the Loughborough       University research and development of air sound barriers with their       advantages as outlined in Section 2 has led to interest from a wide       variety of major construction firms.
As such the solutions provided by       Sonobex Ltd, based on the research conducted within the Unit, is       contributing to the implementation of public policy and improved           public services.
Current business partners, attracted to the technology because of its       potential for improved public health and quality           of life, include:            Alkane Energy (Methane Extraction &#8212; prototype installed) [5.1]        East Midland Trains (prototype installed) [5.5]        British Gypsum (prototype designed) [5.2]        Tarmac Building Products [5.3]        Cherwell District Council design for first ever acoustically designed         sheltered housing for autism sufferers [5.4]; their application         for sheltered housing incorporating Sonobex attenuators has won             the Department of Health Care and Support Specialist Housing Fund             design competition and will commence construction in             2014.
A leading European power infrastructure company (non-disclosure         agreement in place) have placed an initial order for a trial         instillation for power station use in Brazil.
Colas rail (France) who are evaluating the SonoBex designs with a view         to a roll out in the French rail transport infrastructure.
The range of designs and products include:            Production of enclosures for use around noisy machinery in factories,         air conditioning systems, road drills etc.- the Alkane Energy prototype         and the "Major Power Infrastructure Company" order are of this type [5.1,           5.2].
Sound barriers for use along motorways and railways with reduced wind         loading, improved drainage and visual impact &#8212; East Midlands Trains         prototype is in this area as are the Colas rail designs [5.3, 5.5].
Prevention of sound barriers forming a physical barrier to small         animal movement.
Bespoke barriers for special needs &#8212; Cherwell District Council         sheltered housing application [5.4].
Impact 2     Loughborough's spin out, Sonobex has featured on national radio (BBC       Radio 4's PM show) and newspaper (The Times, Innovation &amp; Growth       supplement) as well as in more specialist outlets (The Engineer magazine       and a cover article in Innovation &amp; Research Focus).
Sonobex and the       BBC have agreed production of a feature in the The One Show for 2014.
This       provides further evidence of an on-going commitment to public engagement.
In addition, for his work on sound barrier technology, Elford won a Bronze       award from the Parliamentary &amp; Scientific Committee at the Houses of       Commons research competition &#8212; SET for Britain.
Sonobex has       therefore made a contribution to the understanding of science and           engineering to both the public and to policy           makers.
