     Whereas previous design rules led to two failed products, the new design       rules have informed a series of devices and products.
Without the Brunel       research this technology would have been dropped.
Keeping the technology       commercially viable led Hi-Wave to establish a subsidiary business unit in       the UK called Redux Laboratories.
Redux spun out from Hi-Wave in May 2013.
The sound pressure level of poorly designed phones is 10-15 dB lower than       new designs based on the improved Brunel technology, which can be driven       by `real-world' electronics that enable maximum power transfer while       minimising electrical field in the piezoactuator (DMA).
The follow-on is direct-drive technology using design rules developed       from the original foundational design rules from this research.
There is a significant improvement in the environmental impact and energy       usage in deploying these improved piezoelectric devices over conventional       voice-coil loudspeakers, as they require much less electrical energy to       operate, which for mobile phones means longer battery life and better user       experience.
Without this project, the following opportunities would not have       materialised.
Units made to date:            DMA haptics $1.8M licence, signed with Nissha printing, Dec 2009.
First product, Yota mobile phone.
Estimated 10,000 units per annum;         40,000 in total.

5,000 engineering samples sold.
"Farina" personal audio headset developed and being commercialised by         Hybra technologies and others.
Released in 2013, estimated more than         250,000 units per annum.
Licensed units,     The product has been licensed to the following companies [text removed for publication]            Company A: up to 10,000 units per annum, expected release late 2013.
Company B: up to 20 million units per annum with next generation games         machine.
Release expected 2014.
Company C: up to 2 million units per annum, release expected in 2014.
Company D: up to 2 million units per annum, release anticipated in         2015.
Company E has been engaged in discussions about a licensing agreement,         with a release estimate 2015.
The current business strategy of Redux Laboratories is to concentrate       their resources on the personal headset market.
