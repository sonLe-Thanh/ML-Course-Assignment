     The research described in Section 2 produced novel tools and technologies       that have been       adopted by academia and industry.
We present the impact in the two       distinct areas: industrial       asynchronous circuit design; and business process mining.
The research has enabled automated construction of asynchronous           circuits       Gartner Analysts reported that for the years 2010-2012 the total annual       worldwide semiconductor       revenue was on average $300 billion.
Intel Corporation had 16% of this       market and was the world       leading manufacturer of processor chips for high-performance computers ("no.1         semiconductor         vendor for the 21st year in a row").
One of the fastest growing       areas of semiconductor       manufacturing is concerned with asynchronous circuits, which are       faster and have lower power       consumption than the existing synchronous ones; e.g., as stated by Fulcrum       Microsystem       (acquired by Intel in 2011): "Fulcrum Microsystems' [asynchronous]         switch silicon, already         recognized for high performance and low latency, complements Intel's         leading processors and         Ethernet controllers, and will deliver our customers new levels of         performance and energy         efficiency while improving their economics of cloud service delivery."
[E9].
The results of research described in this case study have been used as       the basis for Intel       Corporation's Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for asynchronous circuits.
In his letter [E2],       Intel's Chief Scientist for Technology Development identified the       longstanding problem of high       levels of complexity that the inherent concurrency of asynchronous       circuits pose to industrial       designers, and stated that "The predominant means of analysing this         concurrency is Petri Nets and         the work by Alex Yakovlev and his colleagues have pioneered the         application of Petri Nets to         asynchronous circuits" [E2].
Specifically STGs, Petrify and related       Petri net theories have       provided:     (i) the basis of understanding and modelling performance analysis as well       as optimisation of       asynchronous circuits, and     (ii) the formal basis of the slack matching optimisation       algorithm (patented by Fulcrum       Microsystems [E1]) which is a key technology for asynchronous circuits       design.
In combination, together, (i) and (ii) have allowed Intel to produce       higher performance       asynchronous circuits ("Slack matching is one of the core technologies         within the asynchronous         CAD flow that my Intel division is using and this process is a pillar to         us achieving higher         performance than the synchronous alternatives in our past two products"       [E2]).
The impact is       already evident in the wide deployment of the new circuits in the       financial services industry; in       particular, most transactions on the NYSE and NASDAQ (combined daily       volume of trade       exceeding &#163;80 billion) now rely on Intel's switch silicon &#8212; a design       facilitated by the use of new       CAD tools that depend on the research described in this case study [E2].
The research described in Section 2 is now an embedded element of       teaching practice in       asynchronous design, demonstrating that this vital area of professional         training has been informed       and stimulated by research at Newcastle University.
Around the world, most       of the top engineering       courses use Petrify and STGs in courses on asynchronous circuit       design (e.g.
Columbia       University, Technical University of Vienna, and IIT Delhi).
As Intel's       Chief Scientist for Technology       Development [E2] testifies: "The tool Petrify and STGs have become a         fantastic means of teaching         and explaining asynchronous design concepts".
Improved business process analysis by practitioners &amp; large           organisations       Process mining is a fast-growing area of business process analysis which       allows practitioners to       discover, monitor, and improve business processes by extracting knowledge       from event logs.
Research on asynchronous system synthesis and analysis at Newcastle has       provided tools and       methods that can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the analysis       of complex business       processes that involve parallelism.
The resulting process mining       technologies allow the       beneficiaries to improve their system models, leading to the improved       performance of the       organisations themselves.
This is especially important for complex       organisations with several       parallel business processes.
The Process Mining Group (http://www.processmining.org/)       incorporated Petrify into ProM [E3], a       generic world-leading open-source framework and toolset for supporting       process mining through a       two-step construction process.
The second step, the discovery of control       flow processes based on       example event logs, is implemented using the Petrify tool [E3, E4,       E5].
ProM tools have been downloaded over 65,000 times since 2008 and       have been used to analyse       event logs of over 100 organisations [E3, E6] including: ING Bank, DSM,       Deloitte, Philips       Healthcare, Ricoh, Thales and Winkwaves.
The analysis of event logs using       ProM has been       carried out for a variety of purposes and benefits, e.g.
:     - In the Dutch AMC hospital it was used for analysis of billing       information of about 627       gynaecological oncology patients resulting in understandable models for       large groups of       patients (2008 [E7]), allowing streamlining processes for       efficiency.
- In ASML, the leading manufacturer of wafer scanners in the       world, an analysis of test       processes resulted in recommendations for process improvement,       including reordering of       tasks to prevent feedback loops and using idle time for scheduling (2009       [E8]).
In Municipality of Heusden, an analysis of the process which       handles appeals against the real-estate       property valuation or the real-estate property tax (2010 [E5, pg 89]).
