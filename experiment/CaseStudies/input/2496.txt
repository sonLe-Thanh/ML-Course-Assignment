Enhanced public engagement with Scotland's cartographic heritage      Pathway: Communication of research findings to the public has       occurred through:            The publication in September 2011 of a highly successful book, Scotland:           Mapping the           Nation, for which Withers was co-author with Fleet (National         Library of Scotland, NLS) and         Wilkes, (Royal Scottish Geographical Society).
The invitation for         Withers to be involved         stemmed from earlier roles, as author or consultant, in the publication         of limited editions of         facsimile atlases (2006 onwards) which represent the largest single         theme publishing         project in Scotland since 1945, as can be corroborated by the publishers         of both works [A].
The hosting of digitised map images on web-based resources associated         with all three         phases of the research [B] provided online resources for the         public to access these maps.
At the invitation of the NLS / Royal Soc.
of Edinburgh, Withers gave a         June 2008 public         lecture `Maps, Mapping, Map History' to mark the 50th         anniversary of the NLS Map Library.
Significance and reach:            For three weeks in November 2011 Scotland: Mapping the Nation         was the best-selling book         in Scotland.
The hardback edition (4,500 copies) sold out by June 2012         and a paperback         edition appeared in August 2012, which had sold 3,800 copies by April         2013 as can be         corroborated by the publishers [A].
The book has been widely         acclaimed and was awarded         `Scottish Research Book of the Year' by the Saltire Society in November         2012 [C].
It was         chosen by three leading geographical authors as one of the Scottish         Books of the Year,         selected expert reviews state `a brilliant text' and `... a           model of how to combine scholarship           with popular reach' and one public review states: `Brilliant           concept!
Scotland will never           appear quite the same shape again' [D].
Coverage of the         book featured on BBC News UK,         BBC News Scotland, BBC Radio Scotland and in a dozen national         newspapers.
Invited         lectures on the book have been given at seven national         literary/scientific festivals.
The websites associated with all three of the project phases, which         contain online digitised         map resources, have proven very successful.
In particular, the Project           Pont and Blaeu         websites have experienced 15,000+ and 12,000+ per-annum hits         respectively, for each         year since 2008.
These figures represent increases of at least 50%         relative to the average         pre-2008 levels, demonstrating their sustained and increasing popularity         with the public.
The `Maps, Mapping, Map History' public lecture was attended by         over 330 people and was         acclaimed as `a significant triumph' by the National Librarian         and Chief Executive of NLS         [E].
The NLS Senior Map Curator also said: `splendid lecture           ... inspiring and coherent.
...           posterity will look back on the productivity of the 1990s and 2000s           and see this period as a           golden age for map history in Scotland, and you have played a large           part' [F].
Enhanced cross-sector collaboration and improved institutional         standards     Pathway: Withers has been involved in a range of activities that       have promoted cross-sector (HEI,       non-HEI and public) collaboration on Scotland's map heritage.
Prompted by       Withers' research, in       2008 the NLS established the Scottish Maps Forum [G] to       disseminate news of research initiatives       and public meetings via its newsletter Cairt.
The research has       also demonstrated high standards of       practice in the cataloguing and management of historical map collections.
Significance and reach:            From an initial circulation of c.100, the January 2013 issue         of Cairt reached 553 individual         and 117 institutional subscribers.
Four Scottish Map Forum public         meetings were held over         the period 2008 - 2012, themed on `mapping and urban history', `mapping,         military         cartography and antiquities'; `transport, communications and         cartography' and `map         publishing', attracting audiences of between 78 and 120 public and         curatorial expert         participants.
All of these figures can be corroborated by the NLS Senior         Map Curator [F].
The Charting the Nation project led to the adoption of         cataloguing standards (MARC1 /         AACR2) beyond industry norms by five of the partner institutions,         including the Bodleian         Library, NLS and Royal Scottish Geographical Society.
The impact of         Withers' research on         shaping practice in map libraries has been affirmed by the NLS Senior         Map Curator [F].
In July 2010, with Withers' involvement, the NLS's management of the         Pont maps was         recognised by its inclusion in the UNESCO Memory of the World heritage         listing [H].
