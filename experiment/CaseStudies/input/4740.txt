     The significance and reach of impact on cultural life is evidenced by       audience and publication figures, widespread media coverage, awards,       commissions, third party funding, prestigious partnerships and       collaborations, and acquisition of created work and archives by major       institutions.
The ability of the work to raise awareness of socio-economic       and political issues is demonstrated by collaborations with the       independent Post-Conflict Research Center, Sarajevo, and Age UK, Hackney.
Work has also significantly influenced policy and practice at Save the       Children, UK.
The Daniel Meadows project was produced in partnership with, and       funded by the National Media Museum (NMM), Bradford; Ffotogallery,       Cardiff; Birmingham Central Libraries; and Photoworks UK.
In keeping with       Williams' previous research, taking work of photographers out into a wider       critical and public sphere, this was Meadows' first solo show, including a       broad span of projects, many of which were unknown to the photographic       community, the museum establishment or the wider public.
`Together Val         Williams and Daniel Meadows have brought to light the photographer's         incredible archive of prints and negatives, along with ephemera and         audio recordings.
They have unearthed unpublished and sometimes         forgotten treasures which add to a remarkable document &#8212; a dramatic,         moving and empathetic evocation of a recognisable, yet increasingly         alien era.'
(NMM Press Release).
The exhibition was seen by an       audience of nearly 40,000 at the National Media Museum, including two       sell-out events at which Meadows spoke.
The exhibition and the       accompanying publication Daniel Meadows: Edited Photographs from the         70's and 80's received considerable press attention, including a       feature in the FT Magazine `Daniel Meadows' images of working-class         communities in 1970s Britain bear witness to the reinvention of the         craft and purpose of photography'.
The publication was one of The       Guardian's Photography Books of the Year 2011.
Magnum Magnum (Lardinois) has found a worldwide audience.
Its       reach is evidenced by sales figures for the publication, with in excess of       135,000 being sold since publication in November 2007.
There are four       different editions in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch,       Japanese, Korean and Russian.
Lardinois ongoing engagement with Magnum and       its photographers resulted in the 2009 publication Eve Arnold's         People, the first book on Eve Arnold (a Magnum photographer since       1951) to be edited by anyone other than the artist.
After Arnold's death       in 2012 Lardinois curated All About Eve at Art Sensus, London.
A       demonstration of reach is given by widespread media attention given to the       exhibition including five star reviews in the Evening Standard and Time       Out; coverage in The Guardian, The Independent, FT Magazine, and Culture       24; BBC 3's Nightwaves; and BBC 4's Today programme reporting from the       gallery.
Hunter's film A Palace for Us (2010) was commissioned by the       Serpentine Gallery (as part of their Skills Exchange project) in       collaboration with Age UK Hackney and Goldsmiths, to highlight issues in       relation to social housing and break down stereotypes in relation to the       residents of the estate.
Media coverage included the following: `Hunter's         film is not a rant, but a moving homage to lives and memories that today         are obliterated by harsh and violent caricatures of the white working         class.'
(Jonathan Jones, The Guardian).
The film was shown over a       six-week period at the Serpentine Gallery, London (attracting an audience       of 15,000).
Further commissions and projects undertaken by Hunter, often       representing communities, traditions and identities in a new light       include: Flashback (2009) for the Museum of London; Unheralded         Stories (2010) funded by the Purdy Hicks Gallery; Punch         Professors for the V&amp;A (2012), which attracted more than 165,000       visitors at the Museum of Childhood and featured on the BBC's Culture Show       and BBC News; and Midsummer Night's Dream for the Royal       Shakespeare Company (2012).
Findings (2013) was the first       photographic commission by GRAIN the new hub and network for photography       at the new Library of Birmingham, for which Hunter was felt to be the `ideal         choice' due to his abilty to produce critical engaging work whilst       retaining historical reference.
The project resulted in 50 images that       explored places and space in two neighbouring areas of Birmingham.
Exhibited in Birmingham City Centre, Findings was seen by an       estimated 1.4 million people (Source: GRAIN), and media coverage including       The Sunday Times, the Birmingham Post and RPS Journal.
Lowe's expertise in the area of ethics of photojournalism were utilised       as part of a 2008 Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Save the       Children.
The project resulted in the development of research-informed       guidelines for the commissioning and use of photographic images, which       aimed to make Save the Children's future commissioning and use of visual       imagery as ethical as possible.
These guidelines now inform the ethical       commissioning, collection, and utilisation of images by Save the Children       UK.
In 2010 Lowe was commissioned by the Post-Conflict Research Center       (PCRC) in Sarajevo to undertake work for Rescuers: Portraits of Moral         Courage (2009), investigating individuals who had rescued people       facing genocide via photography and narrative.
The rescuers came from       different countries and times including Germany, Rwanda, Cambodia and       Bosnia-Herzegovina (Lowe's contribution).
The aim was to heightened       awareness and understanding of the presence of rescuer behaviour during       genocide or mass violence, and encourage social healing and reconciliation       through positive narratives.
The work was exhibited within       Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of a program to promote peace, reconciliation       and genocide prevention by the PCRC, and has been exhibited in Europe,       Australia and the US.
In 2011 Al-Ani was one of five artists to be awarded the Abraaj Capital       Art Prize worth $120,000 for the production of Shadow Site II.
Her       film and video work has been exhibited nationally and internationally       including: 18th Biennale of Sydney (2012), Mori Art Museum, Tokyo (2012),       Victoria and Albert Museum (2012), Sharjah Biennial 11, UAE (2013), 13th       Istanbul Biennial (2013) and featured in The Future of Promise       (2011) the Venice Biennale's first pan-Arab exhibition of contemporary       art.
Major solo exhibitions of her work have been held at Darat al Funun,       Jordan (2010), the Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery (2012) and the       Beirut Art Center (2013).
Work has also been funded by the Arts Council       England and the Young Arab Theatre Fund.
A documentary by Pia Getty Films,       Axis of Light: Contemporary Art from the Arab World and Iran       (2011), includes an in depth interview with Al-Ani and extracts from her       work including Shadow Site I and II.
It was awarded Best       Feature Documentary at the Madrid Film Festival (2012), and was Remi       Winner at the Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival (2012).
Impact is also demonstrated on the field of photography and collecting       more generally.
In January 2013 Williams' archive became part of the       photographic holdings at the new Birmingham Library.
Hunter's Living         in Hell and Other Stories (2005) resulted in acquisition of Hunter's       work by the National Gallery, where it is now on permanent display.
Seduced         by Art: Photography Past and Present (2012), the National Gallery's       first ever group photography and painting show, included Hunter's The         Death of Coltelli which was acquired for The Wilson Centre for       Photography.
Hunter's Punch Professors was acquired by the V&amp;A       adding a contemporary component to their existing archive of Punch       photography.
Al-Ani's The Guide and Flock are in the Darat       al Funun collection in Jordan; Shadow Site I is part of the Arts       Council England Collection and the collection of the Mori Art Museum,       Tokyo; and Shadow Site II is part of the Abraaj Capital       Collection, Dubai; the collection of the Fondation Louis Vuitton pour la       Cr&#233;ation, Paris; and four stills from the film are in the V&amp;A       collection.
