     (a) Impact on EU data protection policy:     The 2010 Korff-Brown "New Challenges" report was specifically       commissioned by the EU to inform its thinking on "post-Lisbon" reform of       the EU data protection regime, and this was clearly reflected in the       November 2010 Commissions Communication on the issue (see at 5, below).
Subsequently, many of the issues identified in the report &#8212; e.g., lack of       harmonisation, lack of consistent enforcement, the need to deal with new       technoligies and the Internet &#8212; were addressed in the 2012 draft EU Data       Protection Regulation, currently in the process of being adopted, that       will replace the current EC Data Protection Directive, often in ways       suggested in the report.
(b) Impact on the work of the CofE Data Protection &amp; Cybercrime         Unit:     Korff's research has also impacted on the work of the Council of Europe's       Data Protection and Cybercrime Unit and of the CofE Commissioners for       Human Rights.
DP&amp;C Unit: In 2012, Korff advised the DP&amp;C Unit on the       human rights implications of the Cybercrime Convention.
In 2013, he was       asked to advise on the Unit's priorities in relation to the Internet.
Commr for HR: In 2008, the then Commissioner for Human Rights,       Thomas Hammerberg, published an "Issue Paper" on Privacy &amp;         Terrorism, written by Korff, as the official statement of the       Commissioner's position.
In 2011, he included a chapter on Social         Media &amp; Human Rights, written by Korff and Brown, in another       major CofE publication.
Korff continues to advise the Commissioner's       office on data protection and Internet-related matters, including in 2013       training Commissioner's staff on these issues.
The current Commissioner,       Nils Mui&#382;nieks, continues to involve Korff closely in relevant work.
Later       in 2013, Korff will write an "Issue Paper" for this Commissioner, on The         Rule of Law on the Internet.
(c) Impact of the Opinion on ACTA:     Korff largely wrote The Opinion on ACTA, influential in (1) Europe-wide       civil society campaigns against the Agreement, and (2) helping to defeat       the Agreement in the European approval process.
NGO websites disseminated       The Opinion, and it was cited in the (reluctant) referral of the Agreement       by the European Commission to the ECJ, specifically on the issue addressed       in the Opinion: the (in)compatibility of the Agreement with EU human       rights principles.
The Opinion was also cited in the Third Party (Amicus)       Brief that a leading civil society group, FFII, tried unsuccessfully to       the Court.
(d) Impact of the GNI " Digital Freedoms "         report:     The 2012 Korff-Brown report for the Global Network Initiative on Digital         Freedoms in International Law has been widely discussed in Internet       governance forums, including EuroDIG, the European part of the global       Internet Governance Forum (IGF).
