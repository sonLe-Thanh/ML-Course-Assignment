     In May 2012 the four UK governments launched a joint food labelling       consultation [http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/05/food-labelling-consultation-launched/].
One of the questions put to consultees resulted from FCBH's findings       (Hodgkins et al., 2012).
By October 2012 [http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/10/nutrition-labelling/],       Anna Soubry (Health Minister), announced that the UK Government would work       towards a consistent FOP scheme based on a hybrid approach of %GDA and       traffic light colour coding.
This is in line with the findings of the FCBH       research (Malam et al., 2009, Hodgkins et al., 2012) This approach gained       the support of all the leading retailers in the UK, many of whom were       previously resistant to harmonisation.
Technical guidance for       implementation of the new hybrid label was issued in June 2013 [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/front-of-pack-nutrition-labelling-guidance].
This technical guidance cites FCBH research that showed that market       penetration (e.g.
see Storcksdieck et al., 2010) is key to consumers       noticing and becoming familiar with labelling information (van Herpen et       al., 2012).
The allergen project findings have been used in the FSA's work on the       development of thresholds/action levels for cross-contamination of       pre-packed foods with allergenic ingredients.
In addition, they have been       cited by the Agency in relation to a need to move away from the phrase       `may contain' if and when such thresholds are implemented because of the       preconceptions regarding its interpretation.
The need to ensure consumers       are pointed towards the ingredients list as the primary source of allergen       information was fed into the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural       Affairs for use in negotiations on the EU Regulation No 1169/2011 on the       provision of food information to consumers.
The EU Regulation No 1169/2011       includes a requirement for allergens to be highlighted in the ingredients       list.
The results of the `eating out' element of the research underpin the       Agency's guidance to UK industry and regarding provision of allergen       information for foods sold non-prepacked which is a new requirement of the       new EU Food Information Regulation.
The importance of the allergy advice       box, identified by this research as the first point of allergen       information, has been used in the FSA's correspondence with industry which       now specifically emphasises the importance of manufacturers ensuring that       the allergy advice box matches the ingredients list regarding allergens       present in the food.
The British Retail Consortium, in partnership with       the Food and Drink Federation, has produced Guidance on Allergen Labelling       [http://www.brc.org.uk/brc_policy_content.asp?iCat=46&amp;iSubCat=658&amp;spolicy=Food&amp;sSubPolicy=Labelling#sthash.naADqpa8.dpuf]       that refers to our research.
The Food Standards Agency is currently       conducting a survey of allergen labelling and allergen content of       processed foods to gain a better understanding of the type of allergen       advisory labelling present on pre-packed processed foods sold in the UK       [http://food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/allergen-survey-protocol.pdf] in order       to quantify the risks highlighted by our work.
