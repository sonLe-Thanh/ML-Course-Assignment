     Impacts on Industry: Extreme space-weather scenarios, based on       real observations, are being generated by Bath for application in a [text removed for publication] simulator.

[text removed for publication]     Impacts on Policy: Our MIDAS research has contributed to a       situation in which "the management of an environmental risk or hazard"         has changed, in this case through policy decisions made at       government level.

Rose (PhD student supervised by C       Mitchell) played a key role in raising awareness at UK Government level,       when he presented his Space Weather MIDAS research and was awarded the 2010         SET for Britain Engineering and Westminster Medals.
Quoting from the REF guidelines, "policy debate has been stimulated         and informed" &#8212; here by real-time monitoring of the ionosphere by       MIDAS.
The research resulted in an invitation to C Mitchell to take       lead authorship of a European Space Agency white paper on the effects of       ionospheric scintillation on GNSS systems [c], as well as authorship of       both a white paper by the US Federal Aviation Authority's Satellite-Based       Augmentation System Working Group in 2010 [d] and a Royal Academy of       Engineering report in 2013 [e].
Further, following the UK-US Space Weather       Policy Round Table in 2010, The National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric       Administration (NOAA) in the US organised workshops to define how this       policy would be delivered.
One of the five areas addressed (co-led by C       Mitchell) was the ionosphere and the development of MIDAS to provide       real-time ionospheric imaging.
This has contributed to a Roadmap Document       (in 2011) to both UK and US governments detailing how UK/US research can       be delivered as an operational system for space weather monitoring.

Bath led a special workshop on       MIDAS in South Africa, in 2009, funded by the Royal Society and       subsequently led a successful bid to ESA to lead an initiative to involve       more researchers from African nations in space weather research.
The Bath       group consequently organised a workshop, including training sessions on       MIDAS, in Africa in 2013, funding the attendance of researchers from six       African nations [g].
Impacts on Public Awareness: "Public interest and engagement         in science and engineering has been stimulated" and "the         awareness, attitudes or understanding of the public have been         increased."
In April 2013, the Bath team mounted an exhibition,       "Antenna Live: Space Weather", at The Science Museum in London.
The       exhibition presented the concepts of space weather, explained why it is       important to some technological systems, described how MIDAS works to       image the ionosphere and described the dramatic fieldwork undertaken in       the Antarctic to deploy GPS receivers at the South Pole for MIDAS       analysis.
The exhibition was attended by about 3,200 visitors over 3 days       [h].
The Science Museum curator comments, "Thanks again for the time         and effort you put in to the Antenna Live last week &#8212; we had ~3200         people visit the display over the three days, which is great, and I         think there was a really nice mixture of objects and media for the         visitors to see and talk about."
In the same month, C Mitchell was       interviewed for "Solar Storms", a Radio 4 documentary programme on space       weather [i].
She also completed a `Science Explained' webcast for the BBC       website in 2010, explaining the fundamental concepts of how GPS works [j].
In summary, the space-weather MIDAS research at Bath has had significant       impact on industry, policy and public awareness.
