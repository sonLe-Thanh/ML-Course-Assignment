     Many of the 70 headteachers and principals who experienced the portrait       process informally       reported impact after the process, and all of those formally interviewed       about it, remarked on the       highly positive experience of talking about their values, visions, and       challenges in the initial       interviews, and of the reflections generated by the interview transcripts       and portraits.
No two       impacts were ever quite the same, as these were occasioned by the location       of a particular       individual within a particular context.
Nevertheless, the overwhelming       impression was one of       gratitude that they had been given the opportunity to discuss their       challenges in a private and non-judgmental       situation.
Such positivity was seen in the 2012 comments of UK Headteacher       A       (corroborative source 1), for even though Ofsted was critical of some of       his practice, he still felt that       a focus on the social needs of pupils and parents should remain a priority       in his school, and the       portrait process had strengthened his resolve: `...It reaffirms who you         are and what you are, and if         our values don't fit within a certain organisation, it's not necessarily         you that's at fault...'     Hong Kong principal B (corroborative source 2) described how the process       had highlighted for him       the things that he valued, and that `...mentioning creativity impacted         on me a lot...and therefore         afterwards I spent quite a lot of time on how to promote creativity in         our school.'
Moreover, upon       leaving the principalship in 2010, he now began working with the Chung       Ying Theatre `...to         produce new musicals for all students in Hong Kong...' and he was       very clear that `... this would         not have happened without the impact or without the portrait.'
UK principal C (corroborative source 3) described how being a perfectionist,       she always was driven       to do her best, and the process in 2009-10 made her realise that the       changes that the school now       needed were things she no longer had the drive to undertake, and that       reading the portrait made       her realise that it was time to change her job &#8212; which she subsequently       did.
She then ascribed the       process as critical to arriving at this decision: `...
The portrait         process had a direct and long lasting         effect on my leadership role and I am grateful for its contribution to         changing my life'.
Finally, UK       principal D (corroborative source 4) described the portrait process as `cathartic',       as it brought to the       surface and allowed him to articulate thoughts about retirement he hadn't       fully recognised, and       which now became a subject of intense reflection and personal debate for       him.
He decided to retire       shortly after in 2009, and ascribed the portrait process as a critical       driver in this decision.
As he       said `Before [the portrait process] it might have been a throw-away         comment, but now it was         something I needed to think about.'
These then are strong examples of individual impact, some of which       translated into impact directly       affecting their organisation and beyond (such as the job change by       headteacher C and the       retirement by headteacher D).
However, impact of the approach is also       shown in the take-up of the       approach by other organisations.
A UK example is CfBT, who employed       Professor Bottery to run       three-day workshops for Headteachers working in difficult schools in       Lincoln in 2008, with the aid       of two university colleagues.
The feedback interview at the end of the       session (corroborative       source 5) strongly suggested that the process had been very beneficial to       all in their reflections.
Interest in the approach is also demonstrated internationally through       funded invitations to       Professor Bottery to talk about the approach to teachers, academics and       students in the Czech       Republic (2009) and South Africa (2011).
The strongest example currently       comes from the work of       Hong Kong academic researcher F, (corroborative source 6) who engaged in       collaborative       research when the approach was first used in Hong Kong, and bid for money       to permit himself and       a colleague further involvement in Hong Kong and the UK.
He bid for, and       succeeded in gaining       (2011) a grant of over $1, 280, 000 HK (approximately &#163;80,000) from the       Hong Kong government's       Quality Education Fund entitled `Special School Leaders Development       Programme (ref.
2011/0183) to support principals in the largest group of special schools       in Hong Kong &#8212; the Hong       Chi association, as well as bringing Professor Bottery to Hong Kong to       lead the research aspect of       this process.
This funded project is on-going.
Professor Wong comments: The         approach has filled         in a gap in principal development and training programmes in HK.
So far,         programmes have not         taken into serious consideration the specific needs of individual         schools and principals.
In addition,         they haven't helped principals who, for whatever reasons, are unwilling         or unable to attend the         formal programmes.
This approach provides them with another alternative         and one I am very         enthusiastic to pursue (corroborative source 6)
