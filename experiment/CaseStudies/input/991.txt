     Through collaboration with museums the research conducted at Liverpool:     i.
Contributed to tourism growth, economy and experience     The Beat Goes On (TBGO) attracted 478,188 visitors.
Using       data on the profile of visitors to the museum, together with visitor spend       figures supplied by the Mersey Partnership Digest of Merseyside Tourism,       NML calculates that these visitors contributed &#163;22,255,060 to the         local economy (corroborating source a).
The extensive research at       Phase 1 enabled a richly layered exhibition allowing visitors to access       different levels of detail and depth, and information on a broad range of       music styles and histories.
Indicators of the quality of the         exhibition included favourable press reviews and radio coverage,       recommendations by national newspapers such as the Independent on         Sunday and Daily Telegraph, and a short film for The         Guardian website (corroborating source b).
The exhibition was       shortlisted for the `Tourism Experience of the Year' award in the       Mersey Partnership Annual Tourism Awards 2010; and was voted by the public       as their favourite NML exhibition of 2008 (corroborating source c), and by       Daily Post readers as their favourite large venue exhibition of       2009 (corroborating source d).

Enriched public understanding, engagement and experience     Dissemination of the underpinning research (through object displays, text       panels, images, commissioned films, gallery puzzles, computer       interactives, and audio recordings) stimulated public engagement with         music heritage.
For example, the Mapping the Beat       installation based on Phase 2 research enabled visitors to explore music's       contribution to local character by clicking on and through sites featured       on digital maps of the city to reveal layers of related materials (written       narratives, archival images, and excerpts from interviews, songs and live       performance).
The exhibition content, design and approach attracted         new visitors to the museum, particularly teenagers (often a lost       audience to museums).
The NML Annual Report 2009-2010 notes, `Visitors       learnt about the remarkable achievements of Merseyside artists from across       the years ...The exhibition proved to be very popular, especially with 13       -18 year olds' (corroborating source e).
The Beat Goes Online, a       resource designed to support the exhibition and produce a lasting legacy,       extended possibilities for learning beyond museum visitors and has       had 130,700 page views since its launch in August 2008.
The research underpinning TBGO enhanced the cultural experience of         museum visitors by stimulating memories, providing an educational       and enjoyable experience, and encouraging awareness of and pride in local       cultural heritage.
A 2009 NML exhibition evaluation report (corroborating       source f) based on interviews with 203 museum visitors, revealed that for       70% of them the exhibition brought back memories, 98% found the exhibition       text engaging and easy to understand, and 83% felt they had learnt         something new.
This is also evidenced by remarks on comment cards       (corroborating source g), such as: `This exhibition is fantastic I could       spend hours reliving my childhood &amp; teenage years here' (58 year-old       woman from Sleaford, Lincolnshire); `Today I learned just how much       influence Liverpool has on musical history' (15 year-old girl from       Liverpool); `This has been an educational experience' (21 year-old man       from London).
Subsequent (Phase 3) research by Leonard and Knifton       underpinned additional public engagement events.
They included the Mixcase       exhibition (VG&amp;M, 2011; 23,417 visitors); and workshops       organised in partnership with NML (April 2011): one on popular music       objects and memory; and one at Merseyside Maritime Museum involving guest       speakers, theatrical performance and the handling of museum objects.
A 72       year-old woman participating in the latter wrote on a comment card,       `Liverpool has a great "track record" of music which should keep our       heritage alive.
Music enriches our lives'.

Influenced how museums preserve, conserve and present popular music       heritage     Cohen and Leonard influenced NML's decision to depart from initial plans       for a chronological approach to TBGO and develop an alternative approach       underpinned by a substantial body of (Phase 1) IPM research, and based       around various themes, including musicianship, sounds of the city, and       music sites and scenes.
Leonard's research on gender provides just one       example of how that research informed museum practice, enabling       NML to exhibit material related to local female performers, and present       new histories of women's experience in the music industry, histories       included in the TBGO book produced in association with NML.
Meanwhile       (Phase 2) research undertaken for the exhibition resulted in the accessioning         of objects and oral histories into NML's permanent collection.
It       also enabled NML to explore and test innovative approaches to display,       including the museum's first use of digital cultural mapping and an online       resource as a public interface.
Moreover, NML used TBGO as a pilot for         the new Museum of Liverpool being built on Liverpool's waterfront.
Most of the TBGO curatorial team were simultaneously developing displays       for that museum and the content and approaches of TBGO were adapted         and adopted for one of its central galleries.
Since opening in July       2011 the museum has won numerous awards and attracted over two million       visits (corroborating source h).
iv.
Expanded knowledge of museum collections and approaches to popular       music     Subsequent (Phase 3) research by Leonard and Knifton involved working       directly with museum- practitioners to expand awareness and influence         approaches to the collection, care and curation of popular music and       related materials.
They presented and discussed this research with museum       professionals from Malaga and NML; with UK artists and curators at the       National Conservation Centre seminar `Music in Action' (13/8/10); with       curators and a museum director at the Museum Association conference       (6/10/10); and through a front-page and feature article in Museums         Journal (1/03/11).
They also organised a British Library       symposium (5/7/11) for museum directors, curators, librarians, archivists,       collectors and scholars, which generated exchange of information about         current practice, and established a network of professionals       engaged in collecting and curating popular music materials.
Feedback from       the event was overwhelmingly positive, with practitioners welcoming the       opportunity to connect with and learn from others (corroborating source       i).
One curator stated that he would work `on incorporating music in       future book and exhibition projects', while another wrote that the event       provided an 'invaluable look at issues surrounding music and museums' and       he intended to apply what he had learned.
v. Developed the Practice of Museum Professionals     Research (Phase 2) led by Leonard during her secondment to NML       (2006-2008) contributed to the personal and professional development         of museum staff.
As head of the TBGO curatorial team she provided       expert knowledge based on IPM (Phase 1) research which informed the       exhibition approach, content and interpretation of materials.
An Assistant       Curator who Leonard mentored states that `as a direct result of this       experience' she secured the role of Curator of Special Exhibitions at       another museum, and was `provided with the theoretical and practical       framework essential for delivering quality projects and success in the       role' (corroborating source j).
Leonard and Knifton's subsequent (Phase 3)       research (2010-11) influenced curatorial practice.
Developed in       partnership with the V&amp;A and NML and with support from the British       Library and the British Music Experience, it informed the practice of       V&amp;A curators at a time when they were revising the museum's rock and       pop collecting policy.
Leonard and Knifton also advised on the development       of popular music exhibitions, including the major Home of Metal       exhibition at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (2011) where one of the       curators commented that their advice had `informed the approach and         development of the exhibition' (corroborating source k).
Leonard and       Knifton co-organised a study day for gallery and museum studies       postgraduates from north-west England (Merseyside Maritime Museum, June       2011), and their research also informed Leonard's teaching of cultural       management students in Kufstein, Austria (July 2011).
Thus our research is       also now contributing to the professional development of the next         generation of curators by increasing their knowledge and capacity       for working with popular culture materials.
