     The TI-UK studies were commissioned based on the strength of prior       underpinning research (Macaulay and Lawton, 2006a, b).
Further, the impact       of the underpinning research has several elements: there is the impact on       policy and practice; on the media; and on further academic studies.
First,       the research has had a direct impact on Transparency International and       TI-UK in particular, in terms of both its future strategy and also its       future advocacy policy: To produce an advocacy plan; to hold 4 regional       events; and to publish 4 policy papers as a foundation for advocacy.
Indeed, TI stated:     "Since funding is available for these activities, we plan to use them         as a focus of our advocacy activities until September 2012.
In         particular, the policy papers will present an opportunity to provide         brief publications that outline TI-UK's views on specific subjects,         building on the research already undertaken for the UK Corruption         Report.
Each paper will have one, or a small number, of very clear         advocacy objectives &#8212; ie identifying what TI-UK is seeking to change."
"TI-UK cannot address all the problems identified in its UK Corruption         Report.
We therefore attempted to prioritise them and concluded that it         would be desirable to give the highest priority to the issues set out         below.
Each issue will be the subject of a policy paper, to be published         by the end of 2011.
An advocacy plan is being developed for each issue,         in part using the TI-S toolkit outlined in Annexes II and III, that will         lay out what TI-UK needs to do to achieve the change(s) recommended in         each policy paper.
The 4 priority areas identified are:            Anti-corruption agency (and UK strategy to combat corruption at           home and abroad);       Organised crime including within prisons;       Politics, including parliament, the executive and political           parties; and       Media          "The Corruption in the UK Report contained 25 headline and research         recommendations, plus several minor recommendations.
It covered 23         separate institutions, themes and pillars, each of which is important in         its own right.
Of the four areas it picked out as most in need of urgent         advocacy, only sport does not feature in our priority list."
(TI-UK)     Interestingly, in terms of impact, it was notable that TI explored the       research lacunae that the researchers had identified and commented on       (whether that was in terms of the researchers observing a paucity of       research or incomplete research).
Thus, for example, TI has noted that       future research needed to be broader in scope and imaginative in       execution.
By way of illustration, it argued for longitudinal analysis of       the corruption issue which would by implication factor in changes within       the public sector and should focus upon the police service, local       government, the NHS and social housing as core targets and/or vectors for       corruption.
That analysis should automatically legislate for the       inevitable impact upon the sector by issues caused or facilitated by lower       resources input.
More broadly, TI suggests that the research indicates a       need to undertake a more systematic analysis of corruption in sport       including some demarcation in terms of corruption typologies and impact       within respective sporting institutions.
TI also argues that research upon       those sectors not ordinarily apparent in corruption analysis such as       marginalised communities and/or those sectors not fully present in such       analysis such as agriculture, private security and waste management, as       well as comparative assessments of corruption typologies within the four       countries of the UK and within regions of each country, should be       undertaken.
In terms of broader policy and practice, the research elicited a personal       response from the Prime Minister David Cameron [1] and has led to a number       of questions being raised in Parliament [2], particularly regarding       corruption in prisons and the recent restructuring of HM Prison's       Corruption Prevention Unit [3].
The research has also been cited and used in the Home Office's most       recent strategy on Organised Crime [4], which noted that:     "A recent report by Transparency International highlighted the need         for more action to understand and combat the growing threat of         corruption in key sections of the UK.21 Many public and private sector         organisations, including all law enforcement agencies, have guidelines         guarding against staff corruption.
SOCA offers help and advice on public         sector corruption in relation to organised crime, although we do not yet         know the full extent of the problem.
SOCA will carry out an           assessment of the extent of corruption by organised criminals           in the public and private sectors and recommend ways for           addressing it."
Although relatively recently published, the research has already made an       impact in academic circles and is cited extensively in Nicholls et al's       (2011) second edition of Corruption and Misconduct in Public Office       [5].
The work has also received major media coverage including BBC       television, The Guardian, The Telegraph and the Wall         Street Journal and has been the subject of a commentary in the Guardian       [6].
Building on this work, Macaulay was invited to advise TI New       Zealand's National Integrity Study; has been involved in creating TI-UK's       Anti-Corruption Defence Digest; was appointed as an advisor on TI-UK's new       study of local government; as a contributor to the latest Committee on       Standards in Public Life (CSPL) inquiry.
In addition, the standards       committee research has impacted various councils across the UK; for       example, Walsall Council has "noted" and taken into consideration the       study [7], as have a number of other councils in all parts of England,       including Epsom &amp; Ewell [8], Sefton [9] and Macaulay's former       home council and one of CfSL's local stakeholders Redcar &amp; Cleveland       [10].
