     Robinson's `availability of poetry' activities have articulated and       underlined the value of poetry and       encouraged the reading and writing of it at a variety of cultural levels       and by a range of different       age groups.
This has helped to improve creative, emotional and moral       wellbeing through close       attention to the integration of accurate perception and truthful       representation in appropriately       structured language, qualities that help bring into mutual acknowledgement       individual reading or       writing minds, bodies, and the surrounding material and cultural world.
Impact on individuals     Particular impact has been felt by poets and poetry readers, students and       enthusiasts, both locally       and further afield, who have enjoyed and benefited from the increased       focus on poetry that       Robinson's activities have brought about.
Impact on the local economy     Robinson's activities have had a major positive impact on the fortunes of       a small Reading       publishing firm, Two Rivers Press, which was struggling after losing       funding from Reading Borough       Council and Arts Council England.
Robinson's research-based commitment to       the availability and       efficacy of poetry led to him providing pro bono work as poetry editor,       management committee       member and poetry event organiser for the company.
In the two financial       years before he became       involved (April 2008 to March 2010), revenue figures for Two Rivers Press       were &#163;11.5k and &#163;10.2k       respectively.
In 2010-11, they rose to &#163;14,296 and in 2011-12 to &#163;28,589.
Revenues for 2012-13       were &#163;25,068.
Revenues for Apr &#8212; Jul 2013 are: &#163;9,715 (from the draft       accounts) [1].
Total sales of poetry books have risen as follows: The books published in       2009 (4 titles) netted       &#163;1,700; 2010 (2 titles) = &#163;2,711; 2011 (4 titles) = &#163;5,950; 2012 (5       titles) = &#163;,5,058, 2013 (3 titles) to       date = &#163;2,772.
(these numbers are calculated from the unit sales of books       published in each year       using a standard 60% net receipt).
Impact in the local community            Robinson further boosted the profile of local poetry publication with         the anthology A Mutual           Friend: Poems for Charles Dickens ed.
Peter Robinson (Two Rivers         Press and the English         Association, 2012), including a series of well-attended readings [2].
Robinson initiated and led the organisation of the first Reading         Poetry Festival (2013) &#8212; five         days of events including a children's poetry day, a centenary symposium         on Vittorio Sereni, two         days of conversations with poets on themes derived from the Poetry and         Poetics Group's         research, as well as readings by local, national and international         poets.
In feedback, the festival         was described as `a great opportunity to broaden horizons, meet a wider         range of poets and to         discuss poetry' [3].
Such was its success that the event will become an         annual one, with a         broadened international reach.
Robinson's work has benefited marginalised groups such as prisoners.
He collaborated with         The Reader Organisation in HM Prison Reading, where he took part in a         reading and writing         workshop with prisoners aged 18-21.
The Reader in Residence at HM Prison         Reading, wrote         that she had witnessed the reading of Robinson's `Reading Gaol'         alongside Oscar Wilde's `The         Ballad of Reading Gaol' `connecting people across the ages, and within         the group.
More vitally,         I saw it having some sort of use for these individuals, living out their         lives in the here and now         of prison life' [4].
Further plans to increase the reach of poetry-related activity in the         local area include a poet in         residence to enhance links between the University's Special Collections         archives and the         community, as well as a Reading poet laureate.
Testimonials/Feedback     Robinson's authority as a poetry editor is based on his own continuing       impact as a highly       respected poet and literary scholar [5].
One poet, who had ceased writing       for over 20 years,       remarks of Robinson's advocacy for the art: `It is more than probable that       neither of [my] books       would have appeared were it not for Peter's support and encouragement'       [6].
Another poet writes       that Robinson's `willingness to trust in the raw material of a complete       unknown seems a rare       quality in a publisher nowadays and an absolutely essential one' [7].
Books of poetry and anthologies edited by Robinson have received positive       reviews, some of them       made available on the Two Rivers Press website [8].
Launch events and       readings organised by       Robinson are documented on a number of Facebook pages and Twitter accounts       [9].
