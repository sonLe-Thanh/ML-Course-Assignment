     Shetland is a group of over 100 islands, of which only 15 are currently       inhabited.
Traces of       Neolithic, Pictish, and Viking settlements are seen today in the form of a       unique cultural landscape,       admired by visitors and valued by the local community, who regard their       Scandinavian heritage as       a crucial element of their identity.
Shetland's tourism industry reflects       the importance of the islands'       cultural and natural heritage (a).
Local agencies estimate that 77% of       visitors come to the islands       to experience its heritage, contributing over &#163;16 million in direct spend       per annum (b).
From the beginning, the Old Scatness project placed an emphasis on       facilitating public access and       maximising local involvement.
During the period of the excavation the team       won the British       Archaeological Award for best presentation of a project to the public.
The       site has had significant       national and local media exposure (print, television and web) and       guidebooks such as The Rough         Guide to Scotland include site descriptions.
In 2010 Scatness was       one of the most visited sites in       Shetland, with 6,279 visitors recorded; an increase in 1,000 from the 2009       figures (c).
The       Shetland Amenity Trust is the heritage agency responsible for the       conservation, preservation and       management of Shetland's built heritage and it promotes these assets,       including Old Scatness,       with the help of a carefully designed culture and heritage brand identity       (c).
As the Trust's annual       report states, "Scatness continues to have an extremely high public         profile acting as a tourist         centre with guided tours and special workshop events exploring the         crafts skills of the past" (d).
The contribution of the site to promoting Shetland's past was highlighted       by the Cabinet Secretary       for Culture and External Affairs in the Scottish Government in her address       to the 2013 multinational       Viking Congress.
MSP Fiona Hyslop praised Old Scatness as "a major         attraction for visitors to the         islands, with its innovative approaches to interpretation" (e).
A visit to Old Scatness starts with a guided tour.
Archaeological       information discovered during       excavations has been used to create reconstructed buildings adjacent to       the site.
The       reconstructions include two Pictish buildings and one of the aisled       roundhouses.
When the site is       open to the public, the fires are lit and the house dressed daily, so that       visitors can feel what it       might have been like to live in the Iron Age.
Using the skills of       experienced dry-stone workers and       other craftspeople, demonstrations are given to allow visitors to learn       more about how the       structures were built and would have functioned.
Living History       demonstrators are engaged to       replicate items and to demonstrate their use.
Specialist craft workers       work on site: their skills       ranging from metal and jewellery working to pottery, textiles, rope making       and soapstone working.
Scatness has provided employment for five guides and two living history       demonstrators.
Replica       artefacts made by the craft workers sell well in addition to other       merchandise including guidebooks,       mugs and Pictish style necklaces (c).
Education packs have been developed       for all 32 schools in       Shetland (d).
The packs include replica artefacts and the learning is       reinforced by a visit to the site       to participate in traditional craft activities.
In 2009-10, 268 school       children visited the site (c).
The impact of heritage promotion is illustrated by the acceptance, in       March 2011, of Old Scatness,       Mousa and Jarlshof, together described as The Zenith of Iron Age         Shetland, onto the UK Tentative       List for World Heritage Status (f).
Inclusion in the tentative list is for       sites considered to be of       outstanding universal value and can only happen with the support of a wide       variety of       stakeholders, including local and national government, local communities,       NGOs and other       interested parties.
Bradford's research at Old Scatness has inspired the design and creation       of a range of products       crafted by Shetland manufacturers thus contributing to the cultural       identity and economic well-being       of the islands.
The Old Scatness Collection comprises ten items       such as jewellery and other       artworks based on the bear and boar symbol stones (now on display along       with other artefacts       from the site in the &#163;11.6 million Shetland Museum opened in 2007).
Valhalla Brewery's Old         Scatness Ale is brewed using an ancient form of barley, known as bere,       which excavation proved       was grown at the site in the Iron Age.
This evidence is core to the       marketing of Old Scatness Ale       and is cited on the brewery's website; the beer is also being supplied       further afield to mainland       Scotland and Norway (g).
The General Manager of the Shetland Amenity Trust has praised the "unparalleled         visitor         experience" that has resulted from the collaboration with Bradford       researchers noting that the site       has "helped stimulate heritage tourism" and "benefited the local         economy in many ways" (h).
New       investment at Old Scatness is planned consisting of a &#163;7.8 million visitor       centre covering the site       with a dome providing greater access (i,j).
This interpretive centre, will       provide "a year round,         world-class visitor attraction ... maximising the potential for dramatic         interpretation using state of         the art media", supporting a sustainable future for heritage       presentation at the site.
