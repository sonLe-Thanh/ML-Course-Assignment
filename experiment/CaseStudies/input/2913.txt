     Context     Methods of determining small biological molecule 3D-conformation for use       in structure-based design have numerous limitations:            protein co-crystallography for a novel target is very expensive and         can take years of trial and error       the anhydrous packing environment in small molecule crystals leads to         non-physiological conformations       the theoretical nature of computational modelling leads to unreliable         3D-predictions       NMR methods cannot account for flexibility without resorting to         inaccurate computational chemistry          The MolGyrate technology overcomes these limitations, bringing accurate,       experimentally- determined solution structures (which relate directly to       the bioactive conformation [6]) to the market.
This method has proven       capable of producing accurate bioactive structures for natural ligands,       performing rapid hit identification and removing bottlenecks in lead       optimisation, accelerating medicinal chemistry, reducing costs and       increasing productivity.
To illustrate:            C4X Discovery determined the flexible structure of carazolol in a         week, validating it to have the same shape as in the 03b22-adrenergic         receptor co-crystal.
The company also solved an antagonist of the Class B GPCR         corticotropin-releasing factor receptor in the same time frame.
It is         successfully using this approach to develop novel selective inhibitors         of the orexin-1 receptor, with potential to treat anxiety and addiction.
Pathways to impact       The technology was taken from the laboratory to a spin-out company         through research by Almond and Blundell (via research, translational and         proof-of-concept funding and a secondment from UoM).
A prototype was         developed using BBSRC Follow-on funding (for demonstration to investors         and pharmaceutical clients).
The drafting of a business plan was enabled         by a BBSRC/RSE Enterprise Fellowship awarded to Almond in 2007.
Conformetrix was assigned IP from the UoM and incorporated in 2007 (its         name changed to C4X Discovery in 2013).
Reach and significance of the impact       During the impact period the success of C4X Discovery and the         underpinning research, which includes a research collaboration with         AstraZeneca (AZ) across its pre-clinical therapeutic pipeline, have been         recognised through a series of awards: Bionow Start Up Company of the         Year (2008), NorthWest Development Agency GRAND award for Innovative         R&amp;D (2009), and Bionow Emerging Biomedical Technology Project of the         Year (2011).
Almond was also a finalist in the BBSRC Innovator of the         Year competition (2009) [A], and the company is profiled in a BBSRC         Impact Evidence Report (2012) [B].
More recently, the UoM and UoM IP         were joint runners-up in the 2013 BBSRC Fostering Innovation `Activating         Impact' Awards (with C4X Discovery being one of two examples).
Formation of a successful spin-out company:         Since 2008 C4X Discovery has raised several &#163;million in venture capital         funding (specific amount not disclosed due to commercial         confidentiality), through a series of investments from Aquarius Equity         Partners [C], a fund focussed on UK life science technology.
In September 2012, Aquarius Equity Partners announced the release of a         third tranche of investment, triggered by significant progress of the         company against milestones.

Industry investment in R&amp;D through in-house evaluation             studies:         C4X Discovery has provided paid services to the world's largest         pharmaceutical and biotech companies (not disclosed due to commercial         confidentiality).

Collaborative agreement with AstraZeneca to enhance drug             discovery and optimisation:         In 2012 C4X Discovery announced a two-year research collaboration         agreement with AZ, under which MolGyrate will be applied across AZ's         entire pre-clinical therapeutic pipeline to enhance lead discovery and         hit identification.
The VP and Head of Discovery Sciences at AZ said:       "We are excited to be working with Conformetrix.
We believe their           technology will provide a powerful addition to our hit identification           and lead optimisation approaches, supporting our strategic objectives           to improve the quality and choice of candidate compounds for our early           pipeline" [D].
Also in BioCentury, a US-based biotech business newsletter, he         said:       "As we've done due diligence, we've been looking to see if there is           anything else out there that competes with Conformetrix's technology,           and we feel it is truly unique" [E].
The collaborative agreement with Conformetrix forms part of a revamped         business development strategy for AZ [F].
The research collaboration is         one of only two involving companies/groups in Europe (and the only UK         deal, the majority being US-based ventures) and involves a team drawn         from both companies to manage the research strategy [G].
C4X Discovery         received an undisclosed upfront payment and research funding, and is         eligible for funding milestones as certain targets are met.
