     Activities and Impacts Achieved     All three examples evidence high quality published research prompting       non-academic users to seek TJI assistance with a variety of political       initiatives, revealing the extent to which TJI is an established `go to'       academic centre for knowledge of peace processes and transitional justice.
In the Basque peace process Hamber provided assistance to various Basque       agencies, e.g.
He supported the development and implementation of the peace plan of         the former Basque President, Juan Jos&#233; Ibarretxe Markuartu.
Hamber was         consulted at various stages of the process, and visited the region on         several occasions to share knowledge with NGOs, academic institutions         and government bodies.
Hamber worked with the Basque government in         Konpondu Participatory Process (2007-8) aiming at bringing together all         political traditions into an inclusive dialogue, feeding directly into         the Basque government's Peace and Reconciliation Plan.
Hamber's         expertise was considered so valuable that with the collaboration of         Basque government, his monograph was translated into Spanish.
In his         testimonial, President Ibarretxe states Hamber's work `has had a         significant impact on the Basque peace process'.
In March 2013, Hamber participated in a social forum led by Lokarri, a         citizen network to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation.
The         contribution of Hamber and others enabled Lokarri to publish a series of         recommendations on the peace process.
Hamber also supported the         preparation of Lokarri's publication on principles for reconciliation in         the Basque Country          TJI ensures the sustainability of these relationships through partnership       with the Agirre Lehendakaria Center for Social and Political Studies, Uni.
Basque Country (founded by Ibarretxe) and a scholarship programme funded       by the Basque government for two students to participate in TJI's LLM.
TJI       hosted workshops in 2004 and 2012 at the O&#241;ati International Institute for       the Sociology of Law, co-founded by the Basque government.
Participants       included Basque politicians.
Based on her international scholarly reputation Bell was invited to       intervene in the Philippines peace process by Conciliation Resources (CR),       as her research was well known in the country (2006 AJIL article cited by       the Supreme Court).
CR is a peacebuilding NGO and member of the       International Contact Group on Mindanao.
Bell's engagement had multiple       stages and dimensions:            She was commissioned by International Alert to write a report on the         law of peace made available to Conciliation Resources and circulated to         all key stakeholders before the site visit.
In April 2011, Bell was sponsored by the Norwegian government to visit         Manila and Cotabato (in Mindanao) where she discussed the applicability         of her research insights to the peace process in 16 meetings that were         attended by some 300 people.
The visit's purpose was to expose different         audiences to reflections from a scholar-practitioner who has vast         academic and practical experiences in comparative analysis of peace         agreements.
Participants in the meetings included: all the negotiating         parties of the government and the non-state armed groups: Moro Islamic         Liberation Front (MILF) and National Democratic Front of the Philippines         (NDFP).
The chief government negotiator held a direct second meeting to         explore further Bell's ideas.
Other participants were regional         governors, the Supreme Court; national Defence College and International         Monitoring Team (a peacekeeping force); civil society organisations in         Cotabato; embassy staff from multiple countries; and Judges of the         Supreme Court.
Evidence supplied by CR confirms their view that the trip         was `a big success' and government and the MILF peace panels expressed         their satisfaction.
Bell also met the Negotiating Panel of the National Democratic Front         of the Philippines in Utrecht (31 May 2011).
As the testimonial email         from International Alert notes that `The meeting with the NDFP         negotiating panel was significant since it was probably the first time         they discussed the possible constitutional ramifications of a potential         peace agreement'          As the CR testimonial notes, Bell's work continues to be cited by both       sides in peace process and by civil society groups, and has become `an       important reference for the Mindanao peace negotiations'.
In 2013, TJI       welcomed Yasmin Nao (a member Government Peace Negotiating Panel) as a       summer school student and arranged for her to have series of private       meetings with women involved in the NI peace process.
Amnesties are used during or after conflicts around the world to       encourage combatants to surrender and disarm, to facilitate peace       agreements and to incentivise combatants to engage with TJ processes.
Uganda provides one of the most high profile examples of amnesties being       used during a conflict.
Prior to joining TJI, Mallinder conducted       fieldwork in Uganda and produced an open access report on amnesty,       conflict resolution and TJ in Uganda that has been viewed 878 times.
During 2011, there were extensive local debates on the role of war crimes       prosecutions and amnesty for armed groups fighting the government,       including the Lord's Resistance Army.
On the basis of her international       expertise on amnesty and knowledge of the local context, a series of local       actors consulted Mallinder resulting in the following activities:            She participated in a training programme for judges from the         International Crimes Division and Constitutional Court on the legal         status of amnesties in June 2011.
Her presentation explored the status         of amnesties under international criminal law and the case law of         national and international courts.
It questioned the emergence of a         prohibition on amnesties for international crimes.
The Constitutional         Court does not generally cite academic research but Mallinder's approach         was reflected in the court's decision in the leading Kwoyelo case.
In 2012, she engaged in a consultation led by the Ugandan Coalition of         the ICC (UCICC) and HURINET-U.
This required Mallinder to take the         findings from her research on how amnesties can link to other forms of         transitional justice and adapt them into a series of country-specific         briefs for non-academic audiences.
One brief entitled `Implications of         the Expiry of the Amnesty Law' that was published in the UCICC's         magazine, The Forum (2012).
Ndifuna's testimonial notes that         these engagements fostered discussion among stakeholders in Uganda on         the future form that the amnesty could take and recommendations proposed         by Mallinder were incorporated into a report for the Government of         Uganda, produced by the Justice Law and Order Sector's Transitional         Justice Working Group, which is composed of representatives of key         government departments.
Responding to requests from the US State Dept,         Mallinder shared the brief on the expiry of the amnesty with American         policymakers.
Mallinder was asked to contribute to the research and drafting of         Advocats Sans Fronti&#232;res (ASF)'s report, `Amnesty: An Olive Branch in         Justice' (2012) The testimonial from ASF affirms that Mallinder's         contribution enabled ASF to identify loopholes in Uganda's amnesty legal         framework and to develop practical recommendations to ensure that         amnesty can contribute to peace and justice.
This document was widely         used by local policymakers and civil society.
In 2013, the amnesty was reinstated and work has begun on drafting         comprehensive transitional justice legislation.
Mallinder provided a         brief on the linkages between amnesty and TJ mechanisms for ASF as part         of the debates in Uganda on holistic TJ approaches.
Evidence or Indicators     This case study demonstrates a range of activities to maximise impact on       difference audiences, and multiple types of evidence are used to       demonstrate the links between the underpinning research and impact       claimed.
These include citations by national courts and in policy       documents, audience numbers for events, documented evidence of impact in       NGO reports, user testimonial letters, several of which provide evidence       of the research being influential in public discussion and debate among       practitioners, and evidence of ongoing engagement with range of users.
Sources demonstrate sustained global engagement by TJI researchers with       peace processes.
