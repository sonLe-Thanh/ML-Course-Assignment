     The LAG method developed by the Jones Group is routinely used by industry       to search for new solid forms; in particular with regard to poorly soluble       drugs, which will have limited bioavailability.
The approach allows a       complete search of the phase diagram associated with the formation of new       solid forms.
In addition, intellectual property can exist for each new       solid form entity.
When searching for new forms drug companies want to be       able to screen for all possible forms and develop that form which has the       best physical or chemical attributes.
By means of this LAG approach the       phase space can be more efficiently explored, in a shorter time scale,       with smaller amounts of material (important in early stages of development       when sample quantities are small).
As a result candidates, which might not       otherwise be suitable for commercialisation, can be developed into       effective solid forms for formulation into drug products.
LAG       significantly impacts on how the pharmaceutical industry is able to screen       for and discover new solid drug forms.
A number of pharmaceutical companies are known to currently use LAG as       part of their drug development process, as evidenced by 3 corroborating       statements provided by Amgen, Eli Lilly and Renova Research, and patents       that cite the methodology.
Further names of companies that can be       approached to corroborate that they use the technique are listed in       Section 5 and include Pfizer and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
Quote from Senior Research Advisor, Eli Lilly corroborating letter: "(W)e         have successfully leveraged LAG in recent years to discover new,         metastable crystal forms, many of which evaded solution-state         crystallization screening...(I)t has been your work around adding small         (catalytic) amounts of solvent that has paved the way for us to access         more highly crystalline and phase pure crystal forms in high yield.
In         fact, as a result of your contributions, I am pleased to confirm that         LAG has now been incorporated into our solid form screening strategy for         enabling forms."
LC1     Quote from President and CSO, Renova Research, Atlanta, USA,       corroborating letter: "Through my direct interactions and         collaborations with Bill Jones I was able to take advantage of the LAG         concept to create high throughput LAG screening equipment that would         produce 96 experiments in a parallel reaction process.
The assistance of         the Jones lab was essential to the success of this effort to produce a         screening platform that could be used in a production contract research         environment."
LC2     A search of US Issued patents referring to methods for co-crystallisation       reveals a number of patents that reference the use of LAG and the Jones       Group in their methodology indicating that the technique has been adopted       across a number of Pharmaceutical industries.

poor solubility), can be saved by the development of new solid forms and         the LAG method allows rapid screening of a range of potential molecules         to cocrystallise with the drug (the screening step).
The time needed to produce a crystalline form of the drug suitable for         large-scale manufacture is significantly reduced.
With typical drug sale         revenues of the top 10 major drug products each being between 6 and 13         billion US$ per annum, a six month increased revenue can be significant         for profits and therefore further support of R &amp; D in other disease         areas.
Approval of the solid form by regulators (e.g.
FDA) can be accelerated         by evidence that the proposed marketed form is robust and that a full         screening has been undertaken.
Small amounts of material are required: In initial stages of drug         discovery only small amounts of material are available.
The amounts         needed for LAG experiments are small &#8212; of the order of milligrams,         representing a significant cost savings.
There is no need to use large amounts of solvent typical of a solution         screening approach &#8212; with such solvents then being incinerated.
This         cuts down on waste and lost revenue.
Evidence of some of the advantages of using LAG, and how LAG has resulted in     economic impacts such as improved business operations, competitiveness and     profitability of industry; as well as environmental impacts through     reductions in solvent and consumable waste streams are available in the     letters of corroboration, with selected quotes listed below:     Quote from Preclinical Director, Amgen, Cambridge MA, U.S.A,       corroborating letter: "(T)his reduction in the number of experiments         has led to tremendous efficiencies in terms of the amount of compound         required, solvent and consumables waste streams, data organization         efforts and time required to conduct and complete experiments."
LC3     Quotes from President and CSO, Renova Research, Atlanta, USA,       corroborating letter: "The High Throughput (HT) LAG equipment has had a         significant and positive impact on my business operations.
To date I         have used the HT-LAG equipment to produce 16,128 samples (based on the         number of samples logged into the database used to track screening         processes).
The time savings compared to performing individual reactions         is enormous.
The `hands on' time required to do 16,128 reactions         individually would be approximately 8064 hours, while the number of         hours actually spent creating and analyzing these samples using the         HT-LAG approach was only 1680 hours.
"Without the HT-LAG system the core operational efficiency required to         profitably operate Renovo Research would simply not exist.
The LAG         screening process constitutes about half of the sample output in a         typical commercial screening project, thus a significant portion of the         contract research income to Renovo is directly dependent on this         technology.
The demonstrated ability to perform rapid and comprehensive         cocrystal screening was instrumental in the acquisition of $500k USD in         investment by a commercial group that contracted with Renovo to rapidly         identify cocrystals of key pharmaceutical ingredients that were         approaching the end of the patent protected lifecycle.
Without the         HT-LAG system, Renovo would not have been awarded this contract and         could not have completed it within the aggressive time period required         by the investors.
