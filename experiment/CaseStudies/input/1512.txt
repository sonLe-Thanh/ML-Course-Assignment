     As a viable route to targeting new commercial markets and creating novel       game genres, our academic-industry partnerships fully demonstrate the       cultural and commercial value of collaborative research and development.
Consistent engagement with industry at trade events, workshops and       networks throughout the development stages of the research ensured that       experimental investigation was firmly located in the practical, commercial       contexts of games production and in authentic player experience.
The       research described above has resulted in the following demonstrable       impacts:     Contributing to economic prosperity via the creative sector (computer         games)     The underpinning research led to the formation of `The Chinese Room' in       2007, now a fully established, successful, independent games development       studio with Pinchbeck as the Creative Director.
The company employs 12       full-time staff.
The Chinese Room is a major beneficiary of the       underpinning research demonstrated through the commercial success of its       first title (Dear Esther) and its most recent collaborative venture       with Sony.
The Chinese Room has been able to build a strong reputation in       the industry based the credibility of its underlying research base.
Three commercial game titles, based on the underpinning research have       been developed:     (i) Dear Esther &#8212; game released by The Chinese Room     In order to complete the commercial product, the underlying intellectual       property was assigned from the University to The Chinese Room which       subsequently entered into a licensing contract with Valve Corporation (US)       in order to release Dear Esther commercially, using Valve's Steam       distribution platform.
The Chinese Room successfully secured ca.
&#163;55,000       Indie Development Funds to finalise the commercial product and released       the game to critical acclaim, including five BAFTA nominations and winner       of 7 major game industry awards (see http://dear-esther.com/).
Dear Esther has, to date, secured sales of 850,000 units (compared       with 100,000 for a typical Indie release) equating to US$2 million.
(ii) Everybody's Gone to the Rapture &#8212; game development by The Chinese         Room for Sony Computer Entertainment (US)     Following the research performed under Grant 1 and dissemination of the       outputs within the industry, the AHRC [Grant 2] and University [Grant 3]       funded further development of a commercial game prototype, under the title       Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
The work and outputs from this       project led directly to the University securing a commercial contract       [Contract 1] with Frictional Games (see below).
The Chinese Room is       currently developing Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, funded by       Sony Entertainment (US) for later release on the PlayStation platform (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3PG7k6vyyY).
(iii) Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs &#8212; game released by Frictional AB,         developed in collaboration with the University of Portsmouth     The popular release of Dear Esther demonstrates that industry and       academia are successful when collaborating on innovative game projects       with potential for commercial application.
Because of this success,       Frictional AB approached the University to partner in its development,       bringing the innovative story-telling elements and atmospheric environment       to its latest `first-person' horror game: Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs       was completed in Feb 2013 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/239200).
Pre-release sales of the game (full-release Sept 2013) allowed Frictional       AB to recover the full costs of its development, approximately &#163;400,000.
In the TIGA Awards in 2013 Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was shortlisted         as Finalist in the `Best Action Adventure Game (Small Studio)'       category and won Best Audio Design.
Generating new ways of thinking that influence creative practice     Dear Esther was a unique game, at the forefront of innovation in       the industry with strong following by the independent games community.
It       received widespread trade and press recognition with articles in PC         Gamer, Games TM, Develop, Edge, The Guardian and Develop       publications A major contribution to experimentation in `new wave' games       design, the success of Dear Esther has had a major impact on       perceptions within the games industry about how collaboration with       academic institutions can be made to be highly effective.
Academic       `practice-led' research (closely informed by participant `users' in the       games community) has generated innovative insights into the unexplored       capacities of digital gaming.
Major industry (e.g.
Sony Computer       Entertainment America) as well as `indie' developers (e.g.
The         Astronauts, Poland) cite Dear Esther as the creative       precedent for development of their own projects and the creation of a new       `walk `em up' games genre.
Due to the University's role in brokering innovation in creative industry       practice, this has enabled the collaborative links with a number of       companies, including: Valve, Crytek, Sony, Splash Damage, Red Game Tools,       Rebellion and Climax.
The University of Portsmouth is a short-listed       finalist in the TIGA Awards 2013 for `Best Educational Institute' in the       `Business of Games' category (http://awards.tiga.org/awards_categories.php).
