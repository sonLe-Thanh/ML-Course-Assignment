     Our research has influenced policies and initiatives to improve nutrition       in children, tackling childhood obesity, and improving the long-term       health of the population.
Our work has benefited children from birth       onwards, covering breast feeding, production and use of infant formulas,       and novel public health programmes for children of different ages.
Our       growth acceleration hypothesis and the results of our randomised       controlled trials provided firm scientific evidence that slower growth in       infancy has long-term benefits for health, which has been used worldwide       to bring about a change in policy and practice.
Slow growth and breastfeeding: impacts on national and international         policies and initiatives     Contrary to previous public opinion and paediatric clinical practice, a       slower rate of weight gain in infancy (as seen in breast-fed compared to       formula-fed infants) is now regarded as desirable for long-term health.
Such growth patterns are now actively promoted in statements by official       bodies.
Our work has provided important evidence to support the importance       of breast-feeding for long-term as well as short-term health outcomes, and       has been widely cited in health and public health policies and initiatives       in this area.
In 2006, the World Health Organisation produced revised child growth       charts, based on the slower rate of growth of breast-fed infants (previous       charts based on faster growing formula-fed infants).
Our research provided       scientific evidence that a slower pattern of growth had long-term benefits       for health, which supported the adoption of these charts in the UK and       elsewhere.
The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and Royal       College of Paediatrics and Child Health joint report on the WHO growth       charts cited our work, stating that: `current evidence suggests that         such a (slower) pattern of growth could potentially reduce the later         risk of obesity' [a].
These charts have now been adapted and       adopted for use in the UK.
The research above led to the commission of a review for the UK       government's Foresight report on `Tackling Obesities: Future Choices'.
This report states that `Breast-feeding and early growth patterns         provide the only period in which there is clear evidence to support the         concept of a critical period of development associated with long-term         consequences' and `while there is less evidence of a direct link         between birth weight and obesity, weight gain in early life appears to         be critical'.
It adds `Breast-fed babies show slower         growth rates than formula-fed babies and this may contribute to the         reduced risk of obesity later in life shown by breast-fed babies' [b].
The Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition report on the influence       of maternal, fetal and child nutrition on the development of chronic       disease later in life, cites references 1-3 above and states: `In         particular birthweight and birth size, early feeding, and the rate of         growth in early life modify the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and         its risk factors (such as blood pressure, adiposity and glucose         tolerance) and certain cancers' [c].
In 2011, the US Institute of Medicine's policy on childhood obesity       stated that health care professionals should `consider the children's         rate of weight gain when determining which children are at highest risk         of developing obesity' and they need to `support breast-feeding         to help prevent future obesity' [d].
Michelle Obama's       initiative to tackle childhood obesity cites our work on the mechanisms by       which breast-feeding is beneficial for later risk of obesity along with       reviews directly based on our work and patents [e].
Infant formulas: impacts on their formulation and use.
This research has also led to changes in the nutrition content of infant       formula with an emphasis on changes to both infant formula composition       (e.g.
lowering of protein content) and volume of consumption in order to       produce a growth pattern more similar to the breast-fed infant.
For       example, formula manufacturers SMA have detailed on their website aimed at       professionals how our research has influenced their products [f].
We have also patented research relating to the composition of infant       formula and this intellectual property is currently under licence to       Abbott Nutrition PLC who fund a phase 3 clinical trial to develop a new       infant formula designed to mimic the growth rate of the breast-fed infant.
This trial has so far generated [text removed for publication] in       royalty income for MRC/ICH and over &#163;2.8m in research funding [g].
Our evidence that promotion of faster growth may have adverse       consequences for long-term health in infants born small for their       gestational age (SGA) has led to changes in the management of these       infants.
Regarding long-term metabolic complications in such infants, a       consensus statement by the International Societies of Paediatric       Endocrinology and Growth Hormone Research on the management of SGA infants       (to which Singhal contributed), advised that: `obesity and accelerated         weight gain are likely to be major risk factors' and `calorie         dense feeding for SGA infants may not be appropriate' [h].
As a consequence, nutrient-enriched formulas are no longer recommended for       use in otherwise healthy infants born low birth weight at term.
The MEND Programme and Trim Tots: lifestyle interventions for children     The first MEND programme was developed at Great Ormond Street Hospital       and the UCL Institute of Child Health, and then in 2004, MEND Central Ltd       was set up, operating as a social enterprise, to provide the programme       more widely.
Since that time, more than 55,000 individuals have benefitted       from the programme.
It is currently running in more than 200 locations       across England and Wales, and has been adapted for use in a number of       other countries around the world [i].
The Greenwich Healthy Living       Service, who have been running the MEND programme for four years, report       the following case study about one of their participants: "Since         attending the MEND programme at the Waterfront Leisure Centre with her         12 year old daughter Elise, Carmen, a mum from Eltham, has noticed a         huge improvement in her daughter's eating habits.
Carmen has made         healthy changes to the way she cooks and Elise now tries new things and         eats a wider range of foods.
Carmen and Elise have also been spending         time together whilst improving their health: `We both joined the gym         together and we are definitely much more active.
The graduate children's         exercise sessions were also very encouraging because you don't just         finish the programme; you have something to do which continues to         motivate the children'" [j].
We are now piloting a new intervention for younger children, called Trim       Tots.
This is a 24-week programme for families with under-fives, which       teaches the principles of a healthy lifestyle through art and play.
One       parent who has taken part in this pilot reported: "The simple fact is,         the lessons we learned and knowledge I have passed on to friends and         family, has made a big difference to our lives...
The Trim Tots         programme and support for children and families at this vital age needs         to be widespread.
It should be available for all parents as they are the         building blocks to nurturing a generation of health conscious, educated         young people" [k].
