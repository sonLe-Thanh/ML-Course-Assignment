     The value of this research, which has impacted on employment dispute       resolution services in Ireland in several ways, is underlined by the       following quotes from successive Chairpersons of the LRC.
In 2008, the then Chairperson of the LRC Board commented on REF2:       "The study...did note that as employment relations systems become more         legalistic there is an even greater need for complementary measures that         assist the parties to become more self-reliant in complying with labour         standards.
Moreover, the authors note a growing emphasis on the evolving         pro-active services that focus as much on dispute avoidance as dispute         resolution and they cite mediation as one such approach.
The bottom line         is that we should &#8212; and we will &#8212; stick to the knitting but we need to         develop, expand and improve on service delivery.
We are broadly, doing         the right thing, but we need to do it better."
In 2009, Breege O'Donoghue, Chairperson of the Labour Relations       Commission, said:       "The Board, with the assistance of the Chief Executive and the Senior         Management Team, have initiated a review of current trends in human         resource management; employment rights dispute resolution and the         overall interface of our services with our primary representative         clients in the context of the extremely fluid national economic and         international outlook.
To assist it in its deliberations, the Commission has engaged         independent academic expertise ...A number of seminal studies, focus         groups and reviews of current trends are being undertaken in order to         evaluate the changes underway and identify areas of positive engagement         for the future in both our private enterprise sector and state         services."
The rich evidence base produced by the research was disseminated through       several national conferences, organised by the Labour Relations Commission       ("New Perspectives on Workplace Change", Croke Park, Dublin, November       2008, and "Building Better Employment Relations", 23rd February, 2011,       Croke Park Conference Centre (organised by the LRC).
Presentations were       also made to the Governing Boards of the LRC and Equality Tribunal and to       the senior management teams at the Labour Court and Employment Appeals       Tribunal.
Focus groups and workshops were held with staff of the Rights       Commissioners, LRC; the employers' organisation, IBEC, and the ICTU, the       confederal body of Irish trade unions.
Detailed internal briefings and       presentations were made to senior staff of the Department of Department of       Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as well as the Taoiseach's office.
Discussions were       particularly intense inside the Labour Relations Commission about the       implications of the research findings for the way it carried out its       mandate.
As a result of these discussions, the LRC has introduced a number of       important changes since 2008.
In particular, its conciliation service, the       biggest service within the organisation, was re-organised so that fewer       resources were directed to solving collective disputes, the incidence of       which was found to have declined substantially.
In addition, a       publicly-funded mediation service was created to allow employees and firms       to address mainly individually-based problems informally, so that they       would not revert automatically to the law.

The research had shown that the LRC's Rights Commissioners service was       considered the most efficient and innovative part of the employment       dispute resolution machinery.
In 2008, the Commission successfully used       this evidence to win extra Government resources to increase the numbers of       Rights Commissioners from 11 to 18 and to develop a more systematic       training and support package for this service.
In 2009, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation increased the       secretarial support for the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to address       the issue of long waiting times, an important finding of the research.
As a result of the evidence that the legalisation of the EAT process had       increased significantly, in 2010 the EAT, the LRC and the national       Employment Rights Authority collaborated to launch a pilot early       resolution service that would endeavour to bring parties to a dispute       together before a Tribunal hearing to explore the possibilities of       reaching an informal settlement http://www.lrc.ie/docs/New_Pilot_Early_Resolution_Service/803.htm.
In 2011, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Minister,       Richard Burton TD, announced a major overhaul of public dispute resolution       agencies to streamline and simplify the system.
This was a main       recommendation of the research and the major thrust of a high-level       presentation delivered to the Department by the research team six months       previously: Civil servants have confirmed in correspondence that the       findings emerging from the research heavily influenced the decision to       reform established arrangements.
On the back of this research, the United Nations' International Labour       Organisation commissioned Teague to produce the discussion paper `Resolving         workplace disputes in Ireland: The role of the Labour Relations Commission', DIALOGUE       Working Paper No.
