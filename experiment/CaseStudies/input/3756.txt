     PHYESTA is involved in a particularly vigorous programme of Public       Outreach, Engagement and Education.
A major aspect of this is the ROE       Visitor Centre (www.roe.ac.uk/vc).
Within the UK university sector, this programme is unusual in its breadth       and scope, extending well beyond the normal expectation of public talks,       press releases and media interviews.
This is in part because university       staff, post-docs and students have the opportunity to work collaboratively       with Visitor Centre Staff, but is also due to the unique advantages       afforded by the ROE site, with its unusual combination of front-line       astronomical research, world-leading instrument/technology development,       and astronomical history/heritage.
Activities include the annual open days, weekly public observing,       `Meet The Astronomer' sessions, school visits, blogs, teacher training       (including the development of educational resources for Primary and       Secondary teachers) [F1], adult `continuing-education' certificated       evening courses, and the development and operation of the Dark Sky       Scotland and Dark Sky England programmes [F2].
ROE is now also the       Scottish centre for the European Space Agency led European Space Education       Resource Office (ESERO) [S1].
Over the last year, PHYESTA has also       collaborated with the Edinburgh College of Art to produce a film on       exoplanets (Wish You Were Here?
Searching for Exoplanets), which       won an honourable mention in the `Scientific Merit Award' at the Imagine       Science Film Satellite Festival in Dublin, leading to it being shown in       the official Imagine Science Film Festival in New York in Nov 2012.
Impact on the General Public       Evidence of short-term Impact is provided by basic numbers, and       immediate feedback from questionnaires etc.
For example, the annual       PHYESTA Open Days attract ~3000 visitors of all ages, while ~6000       school-age children either visit PHYESTA institutions, or receive school       visits each year.
In addition, more than 50 community Dark Sky events have       now been held throughout Scotland, and more than 800 teachers and       educators have been trained to run Dark Sky activities.
PHYESTA makes a       major contribution towards this direct people contact.
For example, in       2010, ten post-graduate students contributed a combined total of over 300       hours to outreach activity.
The short-term impact of PHYESTA's exoplanet work can also be       demonstrated.
PHYESTA's exhibit "Is there anybody out there?
Looking         for new worlds" [S2] was a highlight of the 2008 Royal Society       Summer Science Exhibition, and was selected to be shown at Techfest 2009       at the IIT (Mumbai, India).
The Royal Society exhibition attracted 3069       visitors (including 894 students and 109 teachers), as well as 1197       invited VIP guests in two evening sessions [S3].
Exhibitors and visitors       were able to exchange views regarding detecting life beyond Earth, our       role within the cosmos, and how research on exoplanets relates to a better       understanding of our home planet.
It is this link that explains the       particular appeal of extra-solar planets to the wider public.
An analysis       of the media coverage of the UK's National Astronomy Meeting found that "the         public interest in the topic of extra-solar planets seems to be         insatiable".
86% of the public visitors of the exhibition who       provided feedback stated that their "interest in science had increased",       while 62% of the students declared that they are "more interested in a         career in science", 68% were "more interested about science in         general", and 58.5% were "more likely to read about science         outside of school".
We can also identify clear evidence of long-term impact in public         outreach.
Our work has featured in widely-distributed long-running       documentary movies, as well as television programmes such as "Wonders         of the Universe".
The film "Wish You Were Here?
Searching for         Exoplanets" has now been widely viewed at UK Science Festivals, and       is currently showing in New York.
PHYESTA's exoplanet research also       triggered and enabled the widely viewed March 2010 "Life" episode       of the BBC series "The Sky at Night" [F3] as well as a docu-fiction       "The visit &#8212; a documentary from outer space" (being produced by       Lise Lense-M&#248;ller, 2010 Academy Award "Oscar" nominee for "Best       Documentary") [F4].
In addition, the PHYESTA work on the James Webb Space       Telescope has featured in the award winning "We are Astronomers"       film [S4], showing at Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh, and six other science       centres across the UK.
As one final example of long-term public impact,       our efforts to take astronomy outreach to the more remote regions of       Scotland have been formative in motivating and helping Galloway Forest       Park to successfully apply for Dark Sky Park status.
[F2]     Impact on Teachers and Education       PHYESTA's astronomy research has also had a long-term impact in         education.
Over 200 school teachers have attended our Deep Space       Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses, and have been provided       with Deep Space resources for use in the classroom.
These       resources are now included in the official SQA Course Unit Support       document for the new Nat 4 Physics (replacing Standard Grades (= GCSEs) in       Scotland), and the exoplanet resource has been expanded into a Researching       Physics topic for the new Higher Physics.
These educational resources are       now being distributed through four outreach centres in England (Leicester,       Oxford, Portsmouth, Warwick).
ROE also supplies resources to the BBC       Learning website, and the star-charts have proved to be one of the most       downloaded resources.
Commenting on PHYESTA's contributions to secondary       education, the Head of Section Physics and Technology of the SSERC states       "...few, if any, university-funded organisations have quite the impact         on my work and indeed on Scottish school physics education in general...".
[F1]     Impact on Policy Development and Public Debate       Our exoplanet work has also had long-term impact in fostering debate       on the societal implications of the detection of life beyond Earth.
To       encourage the involvement of relevant stakeholder organisations, PHYESTA       astronomer Martin Dominik proposed and co-organised a Royal Society       Scientific Discussion Meeting on the detection of extraterrestrial life       and its consequences [S2].
This meeting was chosen to open the Royal       Society meeting series in its 350th anniversary year, and       hosted the first ever pro-and-contra debate about the benefits and risks       of communication with extra-terrestrial civilisations.
This is now being       followed up by a new study group "Active SETI: Scientific,         Technical, Societal &amp; Legal Dimensions" of the International       Academy of Astronautics.
The meeting received world-wide media coverage       and has stimulated new debate in the field [S5].
Following this meeting       PHYESTA has contributed to an agenda for policy development, involving the       United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), which supports the       Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS).
The Director of       OOSA states the importance of the PHYESTA work: "The activities         carried out under the study led by Dr Martin Dominik have, indeed,         increased public awareness of the United Nations Office for Outer Space         Affairs (OOSA) and the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of         Outer Space.
Whilst at times there were objections to having the United         Nations debate the issue of aliens, the publicity did trigger discourse         on the processes and procedures for decision-making should         extraterrestrial life be detected....In addition, the exchanges and         views of information that occurred during those activities did lead to a         better understanding among the SETI and extraterrestrial life community         on the best way forward to engage the United Nations."
