     The impact of this research has been to inform adult understandings of       the needs that children of different ages have in relation to social and       physical space whilst they are in hospital.
The research has (1) shaped       the health-care design practices of architects, nationally and       internationally; and (2) assisted health-care professionals in the UK and       Australia to make their existing facilities more child-friendly.
Indeed,       writing in the professional journal, Paediatric Health, McKenzie et       al (2010) commend this research for `illuminating the actual experience         of children and adolescents of the physical environment of the hospital'       and for outlining a `methodology for involving young people in         designing hospital environments'.
[S1]     Informing professional architectural practice with more           `child-friendly' design of children's hospitals     Following the 2007 dissemination event, Avanti architects (London) wrote       to underscore the significance of the research for informing their own       practice: I was really challenged about my 'knowledge' of what children         and young people want from hospital environments.
I am sure your         research will be very helpful in keeping the 'fluffy bunny approach' at         bay and trying to design something more stimulating and appropriate.
BDP architects (Sheffield) also attended the dissemination event and       afterwards wrote to say that they found the research `very interesting         and relevant to [their] on-going work, particularly some of the slightly         more counter-intuitive findings about children's lack of anxiety about         hospital attendance and limited interest in way-finding issues'.
Following the posting of the dissemination materials on the website,       James and Curtis were invited by John Laing Construction to visit the       construction site of the Great North Children's Hospital being re-built at       Newcastle.
They were asked to assess the extent to which the building       would be able to meet the child-friendly criteria identified by the       research and write a report.
An email from Laing states that the report `was         well received by the Trust in Newcastle who will consider the points you         raise when developing their plans for commissioning the hospital'       post-construction.
In 2010, James and Curtis were contacted by Balfour Beatty who had been       short-listed as contractors for building the new Alderhey children's       hospital in Liverpool, that had an estimated build cost of circa &#163;288m.
This time James and Curtis were asked to act as consultants to the bid       team, as the architectural plans were being developed and refined.
This       included: running workshops for the bid team - artists and architects       through to structural engineers and accountants - about the concept of       child-friendliness; assessing the child-friendliness of their initial       architectural plans in relation to the placement of playrooms, parent       facilities and types of decor; and commenting on the draft bid narrative       to highlight its child-friendly focus.
A senior manager for Balfour Beatty       writes:     "The input we received from Dr Penny Curtis and Professor Allison         James was instrumental in helping our team to appreciate the         fundamentals of designing child focused spaces within a hospital         environment.
The workshops and design reviews led by Penny and Allison         challenged our thinking in designing for children.
They particularly         helped us with the design of spaces for families, the importance of         personalisation and the creation of spaces that can be used by a broad         range of children and young people".
[S2]     In 2013 James and Curtis were again approached by Balfour Beatty to       assist with their bid plans for the redesign of the Edinburgh Sick       Children hospital (estimated build cost &#163;150m) by: (1) outlining key       design principles for a child-centred hospital; (2) reviewing and       critiquing designs with respect to layout, way-finding and decor; and (3)       conducting simulation exercises to test designs from a child- and       family-user perspective.
The global reach of the original research is made clear in Johnathan       Wilson's feature article in the trade publication Hospital Build, 4.
Principal and healthcare leader for Anshen + Allen (architectural partners       in the global design group Stantec who are specialists in healthcare       architecture), Wilson endorses wholeheartedly the project's       recommendations `to improve and enhance the experience of being a child         in hospital, social relationships and getting around the hospital',       describing the findings in relation to hospital waiting areas and the need       for separate adolescent spaces as being particularly `compelling'       [S3].
Making existing hospital facilities more `child friendly'     In 2007 the evaluation toolkits and key design principles were put on the       Department of Health Knowledge and Information Portal website, thereby       making them available for use by health professionals and NHS estates.
Evidence of their adoption include their adaptation by the Royal       Hallamshire Hospital to create a `child-friendly audit system' to       inform the work of their Stereotactic Radiosurgery Department and make it       more child friendly [S4].
International impact followed this in 2010 when       James and Curtis were contacted by Queensland Children's Hospital who also       requested access to the project's materials and findings.
Subsequently,       Curtis visited Australia in October 2011 to discuss these with senior       managers at Royal Brisbane Children's Hospital who implemented them by:       including distraction art in treatment spaces, making space for young       people to personalise their bedrooms and restricting "babyish" images to       babies wards [S5].
In 2011 James and Curtis were contacted by planners at the Leeds General       Infirmary for advice about the problems children and parents were       experiencing with way-finding.
A KT project was developed in order to       identify the key problem areas and a set of recommendations for       improvement was made.
These were taken forward by the Trust and included:       making signs consistent and easier to follow, using the more familiar term       "children's" rather than "paediatrics" on signs, installing interactive       way-finding kiosks, revising the maps available for families on the       Internet and putting up child friendly wall art on the corridors [S6].
Sheffield Children's Hospital (SCH) has also drawn extensively on the       project's findings and recommendations.
According to a senior manager, the       hospital "fundamentally reviewed [its] accommodation", and no       longer sees it simply in relation "to demand, capacity and the needs of         clinicians".
Instead, they now view it from the "perspective of         [their] families".
According to him, the project's findings were "central         to the principles in [the] design specification for the new Children's         Hospital Wing and also informed the design and specifications         for the teenage psychiatry wards at Becton, completed in 2011" [S7].
Building on the research findings about young people's needs, this       facility now offers bedrooms that allow for personalisation and is       equipped with gyms, soft rooms, games areas and outdoor recreational games       areas.
Other parts of the main hospital have also been changed in       line with the children's recommendations from the research: for example,       age appropriate art has been installed, way-finding has been simplified,       with plain English and icons now being used on signs.
Designated       adolescent areas are now provided in the Outpatient, Day Care and In       Patient areas.
These are off limits to young children, reflecting       children's views about the need for age appropriate space.
The Ryegate       therapy and hydrotherapy pool have been rebuilt to provide a less       cluttered and brighter kind of space.
This was also identified by the       research as a major concern for children and young people.
The significance of the hospital's change in approach was further       demonstrated in 2013 by their decision to fund a new piece of research by       James and Curtis.
The findings from this will inform the design of a       contract for the delivery of family centred care in the new single       occupancy cubicle facility currently being built and due to be completed       in 2015.
As a senior manager writes: "The Space to Care project has         fundamentally changed the priorities of the hospital and trust"       [S7].
