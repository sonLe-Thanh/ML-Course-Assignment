     Sedmak's research, through the pilot studies: (A) impacted on the       care experience of hundreds of children in Namibia and Nicaragua; and (B)       subsequently, through the framework these studies yielded, impacted on the       approach and policies of SOS Children's Villages International worldwide.
Impact A: The research changed the lives of hundreds of       children through the significant changes it has engendered in the working       culture of SOS Children's Villages in Namibia and Nicaragua.
1.
According to Greg Clayton and Benito Rivas, SOS National Directors for         Namibia and Nicaragua (5.1.2 &amp; 5.1.5) respectively, Sedmak's CA         research has had a `significant impact' and has `changed the way we deal         with concepts of the good life for children'.
In corroborating letters         to us, they report that the capabilities approach developed by Sedmak         has been used to build capacity in numerous ways on the ground,         resulting in an improvement in both the culture and quality of care.
In general, the whole focus of the Villages (each with schools for           their children) has shifted from `unified school-success criterion' to           the individual capabilities of children and their individual           development paths.
On specifics, they report that as a result of this           shift:         Children are now exposed to a wider range of professional career           possibilities, and have access to more computers and computer literacy           programmes.
They are provided with improved life plans, long-term perspectives           and decision-making skills.
SOS children are benefitting from Sedmak's recommendation that the           institutional profile of SOS is reduced in the community (where           identification as a foster child often caries with it a certain           stigma) and that the children are integrated into wider society.
Children are now encouraged to meet with their biological families           and to bring friends into the village, and SOS logos have been removed           from vehicles used by children.
There is now also an organised effort to discuss issues of cultural           pluralism and gender, and to challenge traditional gender roles, with           the initial result of the appointment of a woman as Child and Youth           Development coordinator in the SOS village, Windhoek.

SOS children who participated in the workshops and interviews during         the evaluation field trip to villages of Windhoek and Tsumeb, Namibia         (undertaken by Sedmak and three SOS International and National Directors         between 25-31 August 2013) were overwhelmingly positive.
The repeatedly         recurring theme of responses from recorded interviews with children in         these villages were that the pilot project had been `life-changing'.
Specifically, they testified, for example, that the project has provided         them with `a sense of direction' (workshop 2, children); had `changed my         life' (workshop 2, children); `changed a lot of things in my life' (SOS         youth, interview); `changed my life in many ways' (SOS child,         interview); and `helped me think about the future' (SOS child,         interview).

According to (5.1.3) Reinhold Bauer, former Managing Director of SOS         Germany and currently a consultant to the organisation, the version of         the capabilities approach presented in Sedmak's research has `changed         greatly' the way in which SOS now approaches its Family Strengthening         Programme (FSP).
He reports that this vital programme, which goes beyond         foster care in supporting vulnerable children and their families in the         communities, is now more focused on capacity building and fostering         self-efficacy and a sense of autonomy.
Specific examples are:                In Tsumeb, a community of 200 families &amp; 400 children, and in           the `One Nation' District of Windhoek, home to 240 families and 580           children, income-generating activities such as sewing, gardening, and           bread-baking that help to develop a sense of responsibility have been           introduced.
Sedmak's CA has been used in two new projects in Tsumeb &#8212; a           counselling project with children in the SOS village and a           capacity-building project led by volunteers.
This includes projects           such as `making a movie', established as a direct response to a           recommendation by Sedmak that children should be challenged in their           spare time and that creativity should be fostered.
Impact B: The research changed the programme policy of the       international programme department of the headquarters of SOS Children's       Villages.
1.
The research developed a basic theory for the work of the entire SOS         Children's Villages worldwide, in the process impacting on the         organisation's effectiveness and efficiency as a global civil society         actor.
According to Christian Posch (5.1.1), the International Director         of SOS Children's Villages International), Sedmak's research has not         only made a `significant impact for our international programme         building' but has been `policy defining at every stage'.
This can be demonstrated in relation to the impact of Sedmak's           research on the SOS Child Development Plan (CDP).
This sets out the           interaction between caregiver and child to assess the child's future           aspirations and is a standard procedure across all 133 countries and           territories.
According to (5.1.3), Sedmak's research had a           `significant impact and brought changes', to how CDP is used.
This           view has been endorsed by SOS care workers who participated in the           August 2013 workshops and interviews in Tsumeb and Windhoek.
These           practitioners expressed the view that Sedmak's research project had           `changed CDP', had made it `less superficial' (Workshop 1, care           givers), and had made `child participation very important' (Workshop           4, care givers).
Sedmak's research has also led SOS to introduce a new stage of           `rethinking institutionalization', fostering a culture of decreasing           institutional features that gives more voice to care givers and           embraces the `children first' approach of Sedmak's research.
It has           even led the organisation as a whole to consider how best to           facilitate the promotion of individuals, not least by introducing a           culture of self-evaluation and exchange at all levels of the           organisation.
His research project has also served as a focus for the NGO's           interaction with government and authorities in implementing strategy.
In 2010, SOS staff met in Nicaragua with the Nicaraguan minister of           children to discuss in detail the possible implementation of Sedmak's           research.
In Namibia, findings of the project evaluation trip showed           that Sedmak's research has led to the establishment of new links with           national organisations such as the Namibia Institute of Mining           Technology and has improved the culture of cooperation with the           University of Namibia.
It has also forged a new relationship between SOS and the Namibian           Ministries of Family, Health and Social Service.
As a social worker           (5.3.2) employed in the latter reports, noted, Sedmak's research `has           been influencing me in my work...especially in the analysis of           capabilities and in applying tools for making minors participate in           decision-making processes'.
According to Greg Clayton (5.1.2),           National Development Coordinator, Namibia, this has strengthened SOS'           position as a `theory-based' and `reflective NGO'; and Reinhold Bauer           (5.1.3) reports the cumulative impact of the project has led SOS to be           taken more seriously at an official level in Namibia.

In view of these successes, with their highly positive impacts, the         NGO is now in the process of implementing the basic policy document         yielded by Sedmak's research across its International SOS Children's         Villages programme worldwide.
As Dr. Barbara Schratz (5.1.4) programme         director and scientific advisor for SOS has remarked, Sedmak's research         `will influence programme planning and programme evaluation in all 2,407         programmes in more than 100 countries'.
And Greg Clayton (5.1.2)         likewise comments: `I am quite proud that Namibia has become a pilot         country since the approach tested here will be taken to other countries         and an international level.'
