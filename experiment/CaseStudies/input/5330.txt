     Impacts include: health and welfare; commercial; public policy and       services       Main beneficiaries include: patients, industry, NICE, NHS, American       College of Rheumatology,       Royal College of Nursing     The global continuing impact of this work has been to revolutionise the       treatment of Rheumatoid       Arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.
Full validation of TNF as a target came about in the form of clinical       trials in man, which       unequivocally showed significant benefit in most patients treated.
Biologic inhibition of TNF, in       combination with concomitant methotrexate (MTX), not only improved       symptoms and signs of       Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in many patients, but most dramatically halted       the structural damage       previously thought to be an inexorably progressive feature of RA.
Preservation of functional       capability is a consequence of both reduction in disease activity and       prevention of joint damage       and as such, not surprisingly, the most impressive benefit of biologic TNF       inhibitors has been       demonstrated when therapy is initiated in the early stages of RA.
Biologic       anti-TNF therapies have       set the height of the bar to which all biologics directed at alternative       molecular targets have had to       aspire to achieve the magnitude of improvement in symptoms and signs,       prevention of joint       destruction and preservation or improvement in function.
TNF blockade has changed the rheumatology practice.
The introduction of       infliximab (among other       biological therapies) has changed the way inflammatory bowel diseases and       rheumatoid conditions       are treated.
More importantly, infliximab has offered significant       improvement of the quality of life of       many patients.
In addition, infliximab has changed the natural course of       these inflammatory       diseases [1].
Infliximab (Remicade&#174;) provides anti-rheumatic activity by inhibiting       tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
The use of such agents in combination with methotrexate has been shown to       be clinically superior       to methotrexate alone in controlled clinical trials.
The work has had ongoing impact across the globe for the treatment of       inflammatory diseases.
In       2012 Remicade was the 4th best-selling worldwide drug with total global       sales of $7.67 Billion [2].
Since 2008 Remicade&#174; has been used to treat more than 1.3 million       patients worldwide who have       inflammatory conditions such as plaque psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis,       psoriatic arthritis, adult and       paediatric Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis       [3].
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)       currently recommends the use of       anti TNF for RA under the following clinical circumstances (clinical       guidance 79 Feb 2009): From       the recommendations: 2.2.1.1 The tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;)       inhibitors adalimumab,       etanercept and infliximab are recommended as options for the treatment of       adults who have both       of the following characteristics.
Active rheumatoid arthritis as measured by disease activity score         (DAS28) greater than 5.1         confirmed on at least two occasions, 1 month apart.
Have undergone trials of two disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs         (DMARDs), including         methotrexate (unless contraindicated).
A trial of a DMARD is defined as         being normally of 6         months, with 2 months at standard dose, unless significant toxicity has         limited the dose or         duration of treatment.
In 2010 NICE has widened the proposed criteria for treating psoriatic       arthritis with Schering-Plough's       Remicade&#174; on the National Health Service, improving access to therapies       for the disease       [4, 5].
"In its updated guidance, NICE advises healthcare professionals to       prescribe infliximab       (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel) or adalimumab (Humira) if:             The person has peripheral arthritis with three or more tender joints         and three or more         swollen joints, and        The psoriatic arthritis has not responded to adequate trials of at         least two standard disease-modifying         anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), administered either individually or in         combination"          Numerous global treatment guidelines, practitioner guides and standards       of care have been written       to reflect the impact of this discovery [6, 7, 8, 9].
The introduction of anti-TNF created a wider therapeutic field and       introduces concept of utilising an       antibody to block a cytokine.
This concept of biological therapy has lead       to the development of       further new classes of drugs for example [10];            Anakinra is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist.
Anakinra         blocks the biologic activity of         naturally occurring IL-1, including inflammation and cartilage         degradation associated with         rheumatoid arthritis.
Tocilizumab] (INN, or atlizumab, developed by Hoffmann-La Roche and         Chugai and sold         under the trade names Actemra and RoActemra) is an immunosuppressive         drug, mainly for         the treatment of RA.
It is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the         interleukin-6 receptor         (IL-6R) blocking the actions of Interleukin 6 a cytokine that plays an         important role in immune         response and is used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, multiple         myeloma and         prostate cancer.
