     Introduction     On February 13, 2013, a House of Commons Early Day Motion (EDM) signed by       77 MPs, including senior figures from the Conservative, Liberal Democrat,       Labour, Scottish Nationalist, Plaid Cymru and several Northern Irish       parties laid down     That his House celebrates the 175th anniversary of the launch of the       People's Charter on 8 May 1838 which was a blue print for our       Parliamentary democracy; salutes the men and women of the Chartist       Movement across the UK who sacrificed so much to achieve universal adult       suffrage; acknowledges the Black Chartist leader William Cuffay and others       who were transported to Australia for striving for political justice;       recognises that it was left to the Suffragist and Suffragette movements to       win universal female suffrage; [and] notes the subsequent roles of       political parties in legislating for many of the Chartist demands       including the secret ballot.
[a]     Although there had been previous EDM's about Chartism, none had gathered       significant cross-party support.
The motion was proposed by the Chair of       the All Party Parliamentary Group on Archives and History who has       explained that he `established contact with Malcolm Chase in 2013 to seek       his advice to help raise awareness and support in parliament for the       recognition and memorialization of the work of the Chartists and Chartists       movement ...
I wanted to work with the leading current Chartist historian       and that is widely recognized to be Malcolm Chase.
I have been aware of       Malcolm's research in this area for over 20 years.
'[b]     The Chair of the All Party Group said he had been advised by Chase about       the content of the EDM and Chase was `very helpful in achieving the proper       balance and historical content of the EDM.'
He said this fed directly into       the support gained by the EDM: `it is really quite radical to have such a       range of parties represented.
I believe it is down to the quality of       advice and information that Chase provided, because Chase has shown how       Chartism has impacted on all parties and how over time all parties adopted       most of the Chartist demands.
'[b]     Impact on Parliament       The EDM has been part of a broader reappraisal by parliamentarians and       parliamentary staff of the legacy of Chartism.
Chase and his research have       been important to this process.
[b] Following the EDM, Chase advised       curatorial staff of the Parliamentary Art Collection on a temporary       exhibition about Chartism in the House of Commons' No Lobby (16 July-18       October 2013).
The No Lobby is part of MPs' working lives and also a       fixture on public tours of Parliament: estimated visitors to the       exhibition during its first fortnight were in excess of 14,300.
Chase       worked closely with curators designing the exhibition, identifying many of       the key exhibits and writing much of the explanatory text.
The display       reflected Chase's research including its depiction of Chartism as a       grass-roots social movement (the black Chartist Cuffay is, for instance,       prominently featured).
In February 2013 Chase was invited to give the All Party Parliamentary       Group on History and Archives annual lecture on the Chartist movement (in       October 2013 and to be held for the first time in the Speaker's State       Rooms).
On 14 May 2013 the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art       decided to establish a permanent Chartism exhibition.
Chase has had a       similar role in this development as he had in the earlier temporary       display.
The Parliamentary Art Collection Curator's Office confirms that       Chase's research, notably output 6, has contributed to knowledge about       their existing collections and led to a change in their collection and       exhibition development: `we are now much more informed and have a better       understanding of the objects in our collection'.
[c] The Speaker's Advisory       Committee also agreed to assign a budget to improving Parliament's       collection in this area; the Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group       links that decision to `Malcolm Chase's research [showing] that Chartism       is not well represented in the collections.
"[b] He also underlines the       profound significance of the change in Parliament's policy: `This is the       first ever acknowledgement in Parliament of the legacy and influence of       Chartism on the development of this parliament and modern democracy       internationally'.
[b]     Impact on cultural life and public discourse       Chase has also worked to inform the public about Chartism and explain its       relevance to contemporary citizenship.
Examples of this work include:            Contributions to Radio 4's weekly magazine Making History         (Radio Joint Audience Research [RAJAR] estimated listenership for this         slot = 700-800K), e.g.
to give a historical perspective on the         Alternative Vote Referendum (April 2011).
Chase writes regularly for popular history publications, notably BBC's         Who Do You Think You Are?
Magazine.
Specifically Chartist-related         pieces include `Factory Reform', (February 2008) and `One man, one vote'         (Spring 2008).
He was advisor for BBC History Magazine's feature `Where         History Happened: Chartism' (September 2009; National Readership Survey         = 226K); now freely accessible on-line.[d].
Chase has given 14 talks on Chartism (1 January 2008 to 31 July 2013)         to non-HEI audiences, ranging from a dayschool organised by the Barnsley         Black &amp; Ethnic Minorities Initiative to the opening of an exhibition         gallery in Nantyglo &amp; Blaina, South Wales.
A particular area of engagement has been explaining Chartism's continuing       relevance to our physical environment.
Having advised (1998) the National       Trust on its purchase and restoration of Rosedene, the last `unimproved'       Chartist Land Plan cottage, Chase regularly broadcasts on related issues.
Appearances have included:            Radio4 Escape to the Country (April 2010; RAJAR=1,000K)       Radio4 (November 2010) social affairs documentary: Guerrilla           Gardeners (RAJAR=500K)       ITV1 Britain's Secret Homes (June 2013).
`MC was identified by         researchers on the programme as the leading national expert on         Chartism', comments the producer.
`His presentation of the information         [on Rosedene] bridged the gap between academic study and public interest         ... [and] had an impact on the knowledge of the production team, and         their approach to the content and presentation'.
[e]          William Cuffay and international impact       Chase was not the first historian to write about the Chartist activist       William Cuffay, but his `Chartist Lives' micro-biographical approach,[1]       situating Cuffay within Chartism as a whole, has enhanced understanding of       this activist's importance in both the UK and Australia.
Chase was advisor to Radio4's feature, Britain's Black Radical:           William Cuffay (July 2010; RAJAR=400K).
Interviewed, he detailed         Cuffay's trade union and political career, leading to his transportation         to Tasmania in 1849.
An Australian community activist `listened to the         program online and a whole world of political transportation to         Australia was opened up for me ... Chase's part in that program in         particular encouraged me to discover more about William Cuffay's life in         Australia'.
[f]       This activist then created http://cuffay.blogspot.co.uk/         (Australian-based despite its URL), the first-ever website devoted to         William Cuffay (c. 1,000 monthly hits during 2013).
[f]       The Australian Broadcasting Corporation also invited Chase to         contribute to an national radio documentary on Cuffay (c. 60K         broadcast audience and 38K podcast), subsequently re-edited for `ABC         Splash' schools' broadcasting.
[g]       The creator of the Cuffay website believes Chase's research is `a key         factor in the widespread upsurge of interest in Chartism as an early         civil rights movement.
His ability to convey the complexities of history         in an engaging way to a broad audience has certainly played an important         part in widening public understanding'.
Ensuing Australian interest         includes several publications on Cuffay and a Senate adjournment debate         speech honouring him by the Government Deputy Chief Whip.
[f]          Family historians       Chase provided advice, a complete proper-name index to Output 1[h], and       biographical details of all known Teesside Chartists (research conducted       for Output 4)[i], for the website Chartist Ancestors.
Receiving       c.130 visits daily, Chartist Ancestors is among the most       sophisticated non-commercial genealogy websites.
Its manager comments       that `it is hard to believe that Chartism would be such a popular area for       non-academic history without Professor Chase's engagement with       non-academic historians such as myself'.
