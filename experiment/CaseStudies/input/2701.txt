     Heriot-Watt's output propels the access agenda for Deaf people in       Scotland and beyond.
As the Scottish engine-room of BSL research and       knowledge exchange, we inform dialogue across the public sector.
Beneficiaries include Deaf people, individual members of signing       professions and professional bodies at Scottish, UK, European and global       levels.
We inform commercial practice in the private sector, third sector       developments and public policy advances.
Source 1 (section 5) notes that       Heriot-Watt "has enhanced public understanding and improved the         quality of public discussion on the major issues for Deaf people in         society", while Source 6 states that Heriot-Watt University's input       "has certainly framed public debate on BSL in numerous respects and         used research to challenge social assumptions about deafness and sign         language."
Key impacts are:     We were instrumental in preparing for Scotland's BSL Bill by leading an       event (November 2010) http://scotlandfutureforum.org/assets/library/files/application/BSL_Report.pdf       defining BSL's future in 'an inclusive Scotland'.
"Heriot-Watt research         drawn from the University's analytical output fronted this Forum, while         the follow-up briefing for MSPs, researchers, Scottish Parliament         corporate staff and Deaf community representatives helped define the         direction of the subsequent Bill" (Source 2).
The impact of       increased awareness became evident (October 2012) following the largest       public consultation response to a proposed Member's Bill in Scottish       history.
Mark Griffin MSP lodged a final Bill proposal to Parliament (June       2013) and intends to see it enacted by winter 2014-15 http://www.markgriffinmsp.org.uk/.
Research from Heriot-Watt "has been particularly critical in providing         fundamental underpinning analyses which framed the consultation process         leading towards this Bill" (Source 2) and is recognised as       contributing significantly to addressing a gap (acknowledged in the       Scottish Government [SG] Equality Evidence Strategy 2013) in evidence on       disability issues.
A successful Bill will transform the lives of all       Scottish signers by securing access to BSL across all sectors and       institutions.
Since 2000, the BSL and Linguistic Access Working Group (BSLLAWG       http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/remit/Access-Working-Group),       convened and chaired 2000-2011 by SG Equality Unit, 2011-13 by the       Scottish Council on Deafness (SCoD), has developed Government strategy on       BSL in Scotland.
Heriot-Watt has been the only university represented on       BSLLAWG throughout this period, and has "brought new information to the         table and applied research findings informatively to topics across the         policy spectrum" (Source 1).
BSLLAWG channels priorities to       Government and acts as the policy `think-tank' for improving linguistic       access nationally.
In August 2009, leveraging contributions from       Heriot-Watt research, the Working Group published a BSL `roadmap', setting       out the knowledge SG, Local Authorities and public bodies require when       setting and implementing policy: "Insights from Heriot-Watt research         influenced the recommendations of the report in all areas of BSL"       (Source 1).
In this context, our research has penetrated the work of       institutions such as the Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service-led `Working       Group on Interpreting &amp; Translation', Scottish Police Services       Authority, Law Society Scotland, NHS Health Scotland and NHS Greater       Glasgow &amp; Clyde (leading to keynote invitationshttp://www.elitelinguists.co.uk/pdfs/Programme.pdf,       consultancy and public awareness-raising http://www.scotsman.com/news/graham-turner-language-must-not-be-a-barrier-to-care-1-827104).
The `Building Bridges' project (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/remit/projects)       enabled our work to prompt a new SG policy to secure a sufficient,       sustainable population of BSL interpreters: the UK skills-promoting body,       Signature, affirm that they "have introduced new qualifications, such       as those in BSL/English translation and interpreting between sign       languages as a result of your research" (Source 5).
We rolled       project lessons out via continuing professional development for       interpreters and Deaf professionals (e.g.
via an innovative 'Deaf       Managers' seminar, promoted by bodies such as the British Society for       Mental Health &amp; Deafness http://www.bsmhd.org.uk/news0411.htm).
"Your work has changed the way interpreters operate in Scotland, and         this affects every interaction between a deaf and a hearing person,"         states Source 6.
We contribute significantly to high-impact BSL skills development.
From       2005 and 2008 (under Building Bridges), Equality Unit sponsorship enabled       us to educate research-informed teacher-trainers.
(This had been       recognised as critical since 2002, when BSLLAWG produced a blueprint for       BSL http://www.ssc.education.ed.ac.uk/resources/deaf/sasli/intro.html,       underlining that vital expansion of skills was impossible without more BSL       teachers and thus teacher-training.)
These advanced practitioners       subsequently designed sector-leading programmes (e.g.
http://www.bda.org.uk/British_Sign_Language_(BSL)/BSL_Academy)       and catalysed greater professionalisation of BSL teaching.
UK-wide, key       institutions have exploited our research similarly: the British Deaf       Association notes that our work enables them "to undergird our       campaigning with a strong, evidence-based account of `heritage BSL'.
Our       campaigns are, above all, designed to carry forward language planning       strategies that are significantly informed by Heriot-Watt University's       research and policy analysis.
We have been assisted in drafting       consultation responses and position statements with reference to your       work and it is clear that your engagement has advanced public awareness       and debate on BSL" (Source 7).
Our work has "given us... the       evidence we need to develop a GCSE in BSL" (Source 5), prefiguring       massively improved national signing skills.
We have been instrumental in driving forward regulation, establishing       good practice, and standard-setting in the SLTI profession: for example,       Heriot-Watt's research "to identify effective practices in the work of       sign language interpreters has guided the field in the provision of       services in the workplace for Deaf employees, [...] has established Deaf       people's preferences for communication in health consultations, and has       played a leading part in articulating and making the case for       progressive, collaborative models of interpreting performance"       (Source 8).
Informing a 2013 Liberal Democrat conference vote for enhanced       BSL recognition, we briefed Westminster MPs on BSL policy challenges       (Stephen Lloyd, Mike Crockart http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2549).
This included digital, remote interpreting services, a commercial field       transforming SLTI services (worth a proportionate share of $33 billion       globally &#8212; Common Sense Advisory 2012).
Market leader SignVideo http://www.signvideo.co.uk/       consulted us on service delivery.
Citing our BSL corpus study (grant i,       section 3), they note that this research "legitimises the status of BSL         and by establishing this gives weight to the daily communication         barriers faced by deaf BSL users which proves the business case for an         instant-access communication solution such as SignVideo.
We have used         this in our sales and marketing collateral to ensure that public and         commercial service providers are made aware of the potential customer         market" (Source 9).
SignVideo now offer remote SLTI services to       customers "such as Accident and Emergency wards in hospitals, and in         doing so we have reduced the waiting times from weeks (RNID 2006) down         to mere seconds" (Source 9).
Our research advances global practice as we advise the World Federation       of the Deaf's own experts: "Heriot-Watt's research on sign language         studies and sign language interpreting has informed the work of the         relevant WFD expert groups, so that they have a global picture of the         lives of deaf sign language users" (Source 3).
As noted by the World       Association of Sign Language Interpreters (Source 4): "Each time WASLI         seeks an evidence-based study to share with a member making an inquiry,         we know we can reliably refer people to the work completed by         Heriot-Watt."
We coordinate an advanced professional programme www.eumasli.eu,       injecting research that defines SLTI practices, critical to Deaf       participation (e.g.
in the United Nations).
Graduates take       research-informed practices forward as Presidents of national (Anja       Hemmel, German Sign Language Interpreters' Association http://bgsd.de/)       and European (Maya De Wit, European Forum of Sign Language Interpreters 	  http://efsli.org/) organisations.
Exploiting our research (source 10), the leading International Sign       interpreting provider, Overseas Interpreting Co, delivers professional       training from Iceland to Singapore.
The company "has expanded our       presence with offices in both London and Paris.
Our turnover has       increased 34% over the past two years... With Heriot-Watt research       profoundly informing our service design, this year will see us doubling       staff numbers as well as expanding our global reach to provide services       in at least 15 countries across three continents".
At Scottish, UK, European and global levels, therefore, key institutions       representing Deaf people (from the Scottish Council on Deafness to the       World Federation of the Deaf), and parallel bodies charged with advancing       sign languages and SLTI professions, exploit Heriot-Watt research to       change policies and practices and improve life-chances.
Through robust       partnerships, initiatives arising from our research improve the lives of       thousands of Deaf citizens every day, delivering services that remove       barriers to participation.
