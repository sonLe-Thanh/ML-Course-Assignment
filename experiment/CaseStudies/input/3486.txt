     The impact of our research stems from its far reaching contribution to       the professional development, training and support services provided by       both sports coaches and sport science practitioners.
In the sections that       follow, numbers in superscript refer to particular sources to corroborate       the impact (in section 5).
The influence of Hardy L on policy, service delivery, and the development       and provision of sport psychology support services (through for example,       his involvement with the British Olympic Association, UK Sport and the       England and Wales Cricket Board) has extended well beyond the UK1.
Indeed, his research has been and continues to be among the most         influential in the provision of sport psychology support to athletes and         coaches1.
For instance, originally conceived when he       worked with Richard Butler (co-author) during his tenure as Chair of the       British Olympic Association's Psychology Steering Group and Head       Psychologist (1989-2001), performance profiling is generally acknowledged       to be a model of best practice for the development of optimal         performance and widely employed by practitioners 1, 2, 10.
The significance of Hardy L's impact on sport psychology provision is,       however, best evidenced by the influence that Hardy L, Jones G and Gould       (1996) has on the current thinking and professional practice of sport       psychologists and coaches almost 20 years after its publication 1,         6, 10.
In relation to professional service delivery, research into coaching and       reflective practice has also informed the development and training of       sports coaches and sport science practitioners.
To illustrate, at the       request of the Welsh Football Trust, Cropley recently co-developed the       Youth `A' Coaching Licence, the first qualification of its kind in the         world.
The content of the licence is based on research into       reflective practice, performance profiling and goal-setting from IRESE       researchers.
The first cohort of coaches began the course in June, 2013       and the programme will run annually with approximately 20 candidates per       course2.
The importance of Cropley's research for coach       development is such that he was invited by the Welsh Football Trust to       give a keynote presentation at their national conference (2013), and in       association with a Knowledge, Economy, Skills Scholarships Project,       received funding for a PhD (&#163;72,000) into the development of Level 1 and 2       coaching qualifications (2011)2.
In terms of influencing policy at a UK level, Cropley was invited to       provide a position statement for Sports Coach UK (SCUK) on the utility of       reflective practice for sports coaches as the basis for integrating       reflective practice into all UK sports coach education programmes (&#163;5,000       enterprise grant awarded, 2011) 7.
Both he and Jones R were       also invited members of a panel of experts consulted by SCUK about how       `coaching excellence' could be better developed in the UK (2012) 8.
Also at a UK level, Cropley (in conjunction with Knowles at Liverpool John       Moores University) co-wrote a core supervised experience reflective       practice workshop for the British Association of Sport and Exercise       Sciences (BASES) 3, which is compulsory for all trainee         sport and exercise scientists pursuing BASES accreditation to work         professionally in the UK sport industry.
The workshop, delivered by       Cropley has been running since 2010 and attended by some 120 candidates 3.
It has also been run as part of the BASES Continuing Professional       Development programme for Accredited Practitioners (2010) 3.
Internationally, research by Jones R has underpinned national         initiatives such as that of Sport New Zealand to grow leadership         potential in young people by helping to better prepare them to coach       9.
Further evidence of research impact can be found in the development         of new National Governing Body coach education programmes and in changes         to existing ones.
For example, in relation to the former, Jones's       research into re-conceptualising the nature of coaching has been central         to the development of a new coach education programme offered by the       Gaelic Athletic Association 4, the largest sporting body in       Ireland.
In addition, based on their earlier coach education work, Callow       and Roberts' current Sport Wales funded project has led to the upskilling         of more elite sport coaches in the UK 5.
Although this       work is yet to be completed, the nature of the intervention and evaluation       has attracted considerable interest from other UK sporting agencies.
For       example, in 2012, Callow and Roberts were consulted by UK Sport in       relation to best practice for the evaluation of their education       programmes.
In relation to the development of existing coach education programmes,       examples of the content of the programmes being underpinned by research       conducted at Bangor and Cardiff Met include the Rugby Football Union (RFU)       Level 4, British Gymnastics Level 3 and the UKCC Level 2 Paddle-Sport       courses 10.
The RFU and Paddle-Sport courses include aspects       of performance profiling, goal setting and imagery, all of which are       underpinned by research from Bangor and Cardiff (Callow, Hardy L, Kingston       and Roberts) and the British Gymnastics course provides further evidence       of the impact of Jones's research on coaching practice 10.
Since 2008 more than 1600 coaches have completed the Paddle-Sport course       and 50 the RFU Level 4 coaching award.
