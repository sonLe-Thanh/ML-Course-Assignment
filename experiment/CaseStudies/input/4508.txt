     Torture Team research successfully challenged the narrative of the       US administration around the legality and use of "enhanced interrogation       techniques" (torture) on detainees at Guantanamo Bay.
It directly impacted       on US and Spanish policy and investigations into the legality of America's       treatment of suspected terrorists and decisions about whether to prosecute       Bush Administration lawyers for war crimes, and it promoted greater public       understanding of international criminal law.
Legal investigations and proceedings       The Torture Team research has been widely used in Congressional       investigations, legal proceedings and investigations by civil society       groups seeking to hold the US executive to account for its actions and to       cause a change in policy and practise.
US Congressional Investigations: The Torture Team         findings played a key role in US Congressional investigations into         torture at Guantanamo Bay.
In early 2008 an unpublished draft of Sands's         Vanity Fair article, "The Green Light" [3], based on his         research, was made available to the Chair of the US House of         Representatives Judiciary Committee, Congressman John Conyers Jr.         Congress then convened hearings to address the role of Bush         Administration lawyers in torture [1], and as a result of his research         findings, Sands was invited to testify before the US Committee on 6 May         2008 [1, p. 83] and 15 July 2008 [2].
Sands's Vanity Fair         article became part of the official congressional investigation [1 p.         9], was published in full in the official Congressional record [1, p.         87], and was relied upon by the Congressional Committee to identify         which Bush Administration officials would be subpoenaed to testify         before Congress in the Guantanamo Bay hearings [1, p. 108].
As a result         David Addington, Chief of Staff to the Vice President, and Douglas         Feith, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy for President Bush,         were subpoenaed and appeared before Congress.
Both Addington [4, pp.
45,         56, 165] and Feith [5, pp.
2, 5, 7, 8, 9] were questioned by Congress         specifically about evidence presented in Torture Team on their         involvement in authorising torture.
These investigations publicly         exposed how US law and the Geneva Conventions had been set aside by Bush         Administration lawyers, reiterated US commitment to the Conventions and         generated calls for a criminal investigation or public inquiry into the         actions of these officials.
Spanish Prosecutions: Torture Team led directly to two         judicial investigations in Spain [6].
In March 2009 a criminal         investigation was opened on six Bush Administration legal advisers,         alleging that these officials had enabled and abetted torture by         justifying the abuse of terrorism suspects.
Gonzalo Boye, the Spanish         lawyer who initiated the investigation, said of Professor Sands, "let           me just say that he played a very big role in my thinking.
His book           showed me who the targets were" [7].
In April 2011 the case was         stayed by a Spanish court; that decision was appealed and the case is         currently before the Spanish Constitutional Court.
In a separate case         launched in April 2009, the Spanish courts are investigating allegations         that four former Guantanamo detainees who are Spanish citizens,         residents or subject to Spanish legal proceedings were tortured.
This         case draws on Torture Team research and is on-going [6].
In 2011 Human Rights Watch, an international non-governmental         organization, published the report, Getting Away With Torture: The           Bush Administration and Mistreatment of Detainees, arguing that         sufficient grounds exist for the US government to order a broad criminal         investigation into alleged crimes committed in connection with the         torture and ill-treatment of detainees, the CIA secret detention         programme, and the rendition of detainees to torture.
Sands's Torture           Team research was frequently cited and used as authority in this         report [9, pp.14, 40, 42, 79].
Following the Human Rights Watch report, The Constitution             Project's Task Force on Detainee Treatment, a US         independent bipartisan panel, was charged with examining the US         government's policies and actions related to the capture, detention and         treatment of suspected terrorists during the Clinton, Bush and Obama         administrations.
The Project's 2013 report, Detainee Treatment,         relied on Sands's research to provide authority for the finding that the         US government engaged in torture [8, cited 13 times].
Worldwide debate and communication: Sands's research changed the       narrative about torture in the US by putting the emphasis on the role of a       small group of politically-appointed lawyers who were able to by-pass the       normal decision-making processes, including those within the military.
His       research has been communicated to millions of people on an international       scale, through the large number and wide variety of mediums that have       reported the findings [10].
As well as extensive international press and       media coverage, the Torture Team research has also made the rare       crossover into the arts and been the subject of a number of dramatic       performances.
Media coverage: The Torture Team book has sold       internationally in excess of 25,000 copies and was nominated for the       Orwell Prize in 2009 [11].
Professor Sands also wrote four articles on his       research for Vanity Fair [3,12], with international circulation of       over 1.1 million [18].
The research was reported and discussed extensively       in the international media [10].
Notable examples in worldwide print and       online journalism include: Huffington Post; Newsweek Magazine;       The New York Times; Financial Times; Guardian; The         Times; Der Spiegel [10].
Sands's findings received       significant international television and radio coverage, including: US       National Public Radio show Fresh Air (listening figures of 4.5       million) [13]; a Democracy Now!
interview aired on over 700 US       stations [13]; and a Russia Today interview viewed on YouTube over       11,000 times [13].
Public engagement and cultural artefacts: Sands's research       catalysed numerous large-scale public events designed for non-lawyers,       engaging members of the general public with the research findings and       increasing understanding of this vital human rights issue.
This began in       2008 when Sands was invited to discuss his research findings in The Hay       Festival of Literature and Arts Festival [14].
Unusually for academic       research, Torture Team inspired the creation of several artistic       and cultural artefacts.
The research was adapted into dramatic       performances, including plays attended by several thousand people and       starring some of the world's leading stage and film actors: in May 2008 at       London's Tricycle Theatre, with a cast that included Joanna Lumley, Corin       Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave [15]; in January 2011 at the Long Wharf       Theatre, New Haven (USA) that included an interactive audience discussion       with Sands following the performance [16]; and a performance at the Hay       Festival, with a cast including Ralph Fiennes, Gillian Anderson and Damien       Lewis, which was podcast on the Hay Festival website [17].
