     KCL research provided an evidence base for book-, CD-ROM- and web-based       self-care CBT treatments for people with bulimic disorders that have       completely changed patient care from entirely expert-led to service-user       led, self-directed care with therapist guidance if needed.
People can now       access specialist therapy in non-specialist or voluntary sector settings,       or through entirely self-guided means, that can lead to complete recovery       from or amelioration of their condition.
As these interventions are       delivered without or with only limited therapist guidance they make more       efficient use of NHS therapeutic resources, reducing waiting lists and       cost and allow flexibility of access for mobile populations.
Overcoming Bulimia Online impacts NHS and other services: KCL       researchers are involved in a web-based intervention for bulimic disorders       called Overcoming Bulimia Online (OBO), launched by Media Innovations Ltd       in 2008 (1a).
This site provides a CBT self-help, life-skills training       package comprised of eight training sessions using video, audio and text       combined with downloadable materials.
The course was developed by Dr Chris       Williams from the University of Glasgow using material from the CD-ROM,       Bit(e) by Bit(e) and contributions from KCL researchers.
The website       discusses a number of KCL-led studies that evaluated this intervention,       including Bara-Carill et al.
2004, Schmidt et al.
2008 and Pretorius et       al.2009 (1b).
Since 2008, 19 NHS Mental health Trusts, four         Universities and three eating disorders organisations have subscribed to         OBO, with around 2,000 individual and institutional licenses sold       since then.
OBO is endorsed by Beat, the UK's only nationwide organisation       supporting people affected by eating disorders (1c).
Feedback from OBO       users include:            "By speaking more openly to the computer I am able to speak more           openly to [a therapist] now than I could have done a few weeks ago"        "I wanted to do it in such a way that I was in control and I could           just do it whenever...to be online like that and to have those           booklets and the CD was just the perfect package ... for the point I           was at" (1d).
The OBO intervention is used in the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS       Foundation Trust Eating Disorders Outpatient Unit and the SLaM care       pathway specifies that OBO is available as a first step in treatment.
This       measure has significantly impacted waiting lists as all patients can be       offered immediate treatment with email support, as opposed to having to       wait for up to 6 months to see a CBT therapist.
As a result, some patients       that would previously have been seen by a therapist can now be treated by       this measure alone (about 20%), meaning those that need a dedicated       specialist have less time to wait (1e).
KCL research impacts UK eating disorder treatment guidelines:       Current UK NICE guidelines recommend guided self-help for bulimic eating       disorders as a first step in treatment, based largely on early trials       conducted at KCL including Treasure et al.
1994, 1996 and Turnbull et al.
1997.
Profs Schmidt and Treasure were both members of the NICE guideline       development team.
The guidelines underwent review in 2011 and were       confirmed as still current (2a).
KCL research affects treatment implementation: The NICE guidelines       also form the basis of NICE's 2009 `Clinical Knowledge Summary' on Eating       Disorders that recommends evidence-based self-help programmes (2b).
Implementation of the NICE recommendation by specialist eating disorders       services was examined in a 2012 UK national survey underpinning a Royal       College of Psychiatrists (RCP) Report (chaired by Prof Schmidt).
This       shows that currently 67% of UK specialist eating disorders services         use self-care interventions in the treatment of bulimia nervosa and 58%         in the treatment of binge eating disorders (2c).
All these       recommendations are based on KCL research findings.
The NICE guideline is also used as evidence for the recommendation within       the 2012 NHS Map of Medicine, which details best practice, that "Patients       with bulimia nervosa should be encouraged to follow an evidence-based       self-help programme (which) may be sufficient treatment for a subset of       patients" (2d).
Current Scottish eating disorder guidelines use the NICE       guidelines to state that "there is good quality evidence to support the       use of self-help programmes in bulimia nervosa" (2e).
KCL research impacts international eating disorder treatment         guidelines: Internationally, the 2010 German Eating Disorder         Guidelines also recommend guided self-care as first step in       treatment for bulimic disorders.
The guidelines cite amongst their       evidence base Thiels et al.
1997 and Treasure et al.
1994, 1996.
Prof       Schmidt was also an advisor to the guideline development group (2f).
In         the US, the American Psychiatric Association in their 2011 `Practice         guideline for the treatment of people with         eating disorders' cite Schmidt et al.
2008 (along with a number of other         KCL studies on this work but not detailed above) to say that "a       variety of self-help programs have been studied and shown to be effective       for bulimia nervosa" (2g).
KCL publication &#8212; Getting Better Bit(e) by Bit(e) &#8212; impacts the             public worldwide: While Profs Schmidt and Treasure's self-care           bulimia book was first published in 1993 it is still recommended by           many professional and self-help organisations nationally and           internationally.
For instance in 2013, the charity `The Reading           Agency' together with The Society of Chief Librarians rolled out the           first national Reading Well: Books on Prescription scheme where a           range of CBT self-help books are recommended by GPs or other health           professionals and are available in all public libraries.
Getting             Better Bit(e) by Bit(e) is one of only three books on bulimia on             their Core List of books (3a).
The RCP, in their patient-centred           information pages on eating disorders recommends the book (3b) as does           Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Trust (3c).
Further afield, it is           also recommended by Body Whys, the Eating Disorder Association of             Ireland (3d) and Eating Disorders Victoria, a specialist             centre in Australia (3e).
Since 2008, the manual has sold over           10,000 copies in the UK alone (3f).
German, Italian, Spanish,             French, Dutch and Japanese versions have been published and           these too are recommended.
For instance the German version is           highlighted on the website PsychNet (3g).
