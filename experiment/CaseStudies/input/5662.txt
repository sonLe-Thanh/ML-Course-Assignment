     The 2008 finding, by a group led by Rohling, that global sea level could       rise 1.6 &#177;1 metres per century helped reshape the worst case scenarios       considered in planning documents worldwide.
It provided the first       real-life estimates and in the UK helped to bring estimates down from very       high initial assumptions (UK Climate Projections UKCP09, [5.1];       Environment Agency (EA) Thames Estuary (TE) 2100 Plan [5.2]).
Assimilation of the work into planning arose from a combination of       scientific publications (which led to widespread international media       coverage across more than 400 news outlets) and active engagement at       expert workshops and conferences.
The UK's latest climate change projections present a "sensible maximum         value" for planning and flood risk assessments [5.1],       amongst others taken up by the EA [5.2].
The UKCP09's H++ scenario       warns of sea level rise between 0.93 and 1.9m by 2100; the upper estimate       directly relates to Rohling's estimates [5.1].
The EA uses values       of the H++ scenario in its flood risk management strategy for the Thames       Estuary, ensuring that its plans could cope with a sea level rise of 2 to       2.7 m; this "reduction in worst case scenario for this century means         that a (proposed) tide-excluding estuary barrage will not be         necessary to manage flood risk this century and can be dropped from our         final options" (TE2100 Plan [5.2]).
Rohling's research also informed the scientific underpinning of The       Netherlands' Delta Committee Report Working together with water: A         living land builds for its future [5.3], which presents an       integrated vision for the long term protection of the Dutch coast and its       hinterland extending to 2100 and beyond.
The recommendations were       completed in 2008, presented to the Dutch Cabinet in 2010, ratified in       November 2011, and have been implemented since January 2012.
In New Zealand Rohling's work informed the 2008 report Climate         Change: Impacts on Dunedin, which recommended the adoption of a new       upper limit to sea level rise.
These estimates, contained in Dunedin City       Council's Climate Change Predictions Policy (2011) are reflected       in council policies, for example increased minimum floor levels for new       buildings [5.4].
In Canada the British Columbia Ministry of Environment Climate Change         Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use       (2012) make extensive use of Rohling's work (via the associated 2011 Draft         Policy Discussion Paper).
Another contributor to this report Golder       Associates have used the new guidelines in their Harbourside development       in Vancouver and "proposed a shoreline concept adapted for sea level         rise".
They also comment that "Anticipating climate change is         now paramount for most land use and design projects" [5.5].
Rohling's work is also used in Vancouver municipal authority's 2008 report       Vulnerability of Vancouver sewerage area infrastructure to climate         change and the City of Vancouver Climate Change Adaptation         Strategy (2012).
Other examples of a wide variety of uses include, Australia's Climate       Change White Paper (2008), the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic Programme       Report A closing window of opportunity &#8212; global greenhouse reality       (2008) and in the November 2012 World Bank report Turn down the Heat:       Why a 4 degree centigrade warmer world must be avoided.
Sustained public engagement has helped ensure that future sea level rise       remains at the forefront of public debate on climate change.
Worldwide       media coverage (for example the BBC, Reuters, Chinapost.com) [5.6]       followed the online publication of [3.3] in December 2007 and [3.4]       in June 2009, resulting in continuing interactions with global broadcast       and print media, and email exchanges with the public.
In December 2011 at       the American Geophysical Union Fall meeting (the world's largest       geophysical sciences conference), together with James Hansen and Ken       Caldeira, Rohling gave an hour-long press conference in which his       palaeoclimate research was covered [5.7].
This led to a USA Today       feature article [5.7] (referenced on its front page; 3.2 million       readers daily), which attracted 200+ reader       comments/likes/recommends/tweets.
The article was reproduced on ABC News       with 300+ audience comments/likes/recommends/tweets, and led to a       nine-minute interview for Scientific American [5.8] (3.88 million       unique users per month).
Other dissemination efforts at focused workshops have included the       Challenger Society meeting on sea level change (Royal Society, Nov. 2010),       and a workshop at UNESCO's Venice office in 2010, which led to a UNESCO       report [5.9] looking at the future of Venice under climate change.
Rohling considers continued outreach directly to the wider public to be       important, because only education can change attitudes.
In November 2011,       Rohling gave a keynote speech at a public engagement event on climate       change organised in Amsterdam by the Dutch media.
It was attended by 300       members of the public and journalists.
The debate was given extensive       coverage in the national daily newspaper NRC [5.10] (840,000       readers) and NRC.next (350,000 readers), as well as the climate blog of       Paul Luttikhuis, which has 20 million page views per month.
He also gave       talks and workshops to a variety of smaller meeting audiences, including       marine engineers, Royal Navy officers, Wessex public heath specialty       registrars, and charities, and he contributed to fact-finding and       script-definition for climate change documentaries by NHK Japan, Picture       Films for National Geographic, and Wildfire TV.
Rohling set up NERC consortium project iGlass, which includes direct       involvement of seven UK research institutes, two overseas academic       partners and &#8212; importantly &#8212; three key stakeholders: UKCIP (formerly UK       Climate Impact Programme), EA, and global re-insurance specialist Willis       Ltd.
The stakeholders are directly involved in project development,       results synthesis and in defining strategies to ensure that results are       developed and presented from the outset in optimized form for planning       purposes (e.g., to assist the insurance industry in improving their       understanding of likely rates of future sea level change).
The EA       considers this research "with its key outcome to place sound limits on         the likely ice-volume contribution to maximum sea level rise estimates         for the near future, vital if we are to prepare adequately for the full         range of potential impacts" [5.11].
