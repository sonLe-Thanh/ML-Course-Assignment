     Background: In English speaking jurisdictions the introduction of       complaints investigation       organisations, separate to the police, has dominated policy development       and research for several       decades.
However, the same cannot be said for most European states, with       the COE CHR       expressing concern, in 2007, that cultures of police impunity had the       potential to emerge within       some member states.
In line with these concerns, the work of Dr Graham       Smith was circulated and       discussed via a range of targeted engagements:             Workshop: Following recommendations by the European Court of         Human Rights (ECtHR),         `Council of Europe Committee of Ministers and the Committee for the         Prevention of Torture and         Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment', the CHR invited Smith to         serve as         rapporteur to an expert workshop on police complaints mechanisms,         attended by senior         practitioners from across Europe (including the heads of several police         complaints bodies).
In         the workshop summary report the five principles of effective police         complaints investigation         were first presented [1].
Opinion: In the wake of this workshop, the CHR appointed Smith         to serve as his external         consultant on police complaints, and commissioned him to write an         Opinion (now translated         into 10 languages), which also examined existing police complaints         mechanisms across         Europe and ECHR case law [E].
The CHR thematic co-ordinator has praised         this work,         suggesting that Smith's "...contribution to the Commissioner's           opinion on police complaints           mechanisms and its dissemination was essential... [and was]           based on independent research           and the results of the Commissioner's workshop on the subject."
[1]        Research: Subsequently, Smith published articles on the CHR's         police complaints initiative in         two practitioner journals [2], and subsequent to the Opinion's         publication, Greater Manchester         Police (GMP) opened negotiations to investigate disproportionality on         grounds of ethnicity in         misconduct proceedings.
Pathways to Impact: These activities led to a range of additional       outlets:            In June/July 2010, Smith provided a plenary, and served as the         moderator of the `police'         pathway (one of three pathways, encompassing two days of workshops) at         the `EU &#8212; Brazil         Human Rights Civil Society Seminar' jointly organised by the Brazil         Secretariat for Human         Rights and the European Commission Human Rights Unit (Brasilia).
In November 2011, Smith participated as a member of the review panel         in the Organisation for         Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OCSE) `Human Rights and the         Investigation of Terrorist         Crimes: A Practical Manual for Law Enforcement Officers' panel.
In March 2012, Smith gave a keynote speech at the EU/UNDP         `Strengthening Palestinian         Police Accountability' workshop in Ramallah, alongside two additional         sessions, and has been         invited back to follow-up the `Three-Year Strategic Plan for         Strengthening the Accountability         of the Palestinian Civil Police' sketched out at the workshop.
For the         conference, paper [B] was         translated into Arabic.
In April 2013, Smith presented research to a COE round table (Tbilisi,         Georgia), alongside         delegates from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine.
This led to an         invitation to research         police complaints mechanisms in these five countries and to prepare a         report, subsequently         discussed in Baku (Azerbaijan), to assist with the development of these         new mechanisms [3].
Primary Impact: During this period, the research led to a raft of       invitations to train police officers:            Between 2010 and 2012 Smith conducted training for the Office of           the Police Ombudsman for           Northern Ireland (OPONI); and in November 2012 gave two         presentations to personnel.
Taken         together, this work was highly praised, emerging from a long-standing         engagement with         Smith's Opinion for the ECR.
As the Ombudsman attests:         [This] has been a key reference for many of the activities of           OPONI... [Dr Smith] has also           been a helpful expert in training sessions for the Office and of           course this could not have           been accomplished without his expertise and research forming a           background for his evident           connection with our investigators.... As we struggle to apply ECHR           principles           retrospectively to alleged police crimes from 1968 through 1998, in a           highly charged           political environment, Graham has provided sage advice and discussion           with myself and           our Director of Historical Investigations.
None of this could be           accomplished without solid           research efforts and a broad understanding of the different police           oversight mechanisms           and their principles available around the world.
[4]       In June 2012 &amp; March 2013, Smith gave two workshops within the         third phase of training         Bahraini police officers (senior and frontline, respectively).
In February 2013, Smith participated in a four day `Independent         Commission of Investigations'         training event in Kingston (Jamaica), leading for two of the days with         workshops on         independent and effective investigation of police complaints, and         citizen oversight.
In February 2013, Smith participated in the `Exercise Gaudi' element         of the Police Strategic         Command Course (College of Policing, Bramshill); the equality and         diversity component of the         Chief Superintendant training programme.
In March 2013, Smith gave a presentation on GMP DIPPS research to a         regional professional         standards meeting of Cleveland, Northumbria, Durham, N. Yorkshire, W.         Yorkshire and         Humberside police services.
In June 2013, Smith led three working groups on DIPPS at the ACPO         national conference on         professional standards, later summarised in the largest circulation         police weekly [5]          Similarly, work with GMP (and others) examining disproportionality in       professional Standards has       been highly praised.
In March 2013, GMP's Chief Constable accepted the       report's findings:     We have been very clear that disproportionality in discipline issues         has existed in GMP         and... the research carried out by Graham Smith is helping us to         understand some of the         underlying causes which are complex and wrapped up in a host of cultural         issues... We         believe it is better that this issue is openly debated and welcome         further research and         discussion with other employers.
[6]     Likewise, the President of the National Black Police Association noted       that: "The research report is       now the subject of working groups to address disproportionality in       Constabularies across the UK",       going on to note how Dr Smith's research has "reignited important         debates":     The issue of disproportionality in Police Professional Standards has         been identified by the         National Black Police Association (NBPA) over many years but in the         absence of academic         research in this area, NBPA and community activist struggled to         influence Government and         Police Policy.
Dr Smith's report provided a powerful reference point ...         the National Black       Police Association has been able to strengthen its argument for more         urgency on the part         of The Home Office and Police Leaders in terms of implementing policies         to drastically         improve minority representation in Policing and Police Leadership.
An         example of this is the         recognition now, by Senior Police Leaders in Greater Manchester Police         and Metropolitan         Police of a 'Diversity Crisis in Policing' and moves towards addressing         this.
[7]     Secondary Impact: The CHR Opinion document has been cited in legal       and policy contexts:            Firstly, following his visits to COE member states, the CHR         has cited the Opinion when         recommending more effective investigation of police forces, and the         creation of independent         complaints bodies [8]; the CHR thematic co-ordinator noting that "The           Opinion is used by the           Commissioner in his country monitoring and has become a central           reference document in           many member states which are contemplating or carrying out reforms in           this field" [2].
Secondly, the Opinion has been used by Amnesty International,         a member of their policy         team affirming that: "We have used it here several times when making           recommendations on           various countries (most recently Greece and Germany) and it is really           so useful as a lobbying           (and learning) document.
It's...
USABLE, which from an NGO standpoint           is very important (and           it nicely incorporates the specifics of the relevant ECtHR           jurisprudence)' [9].
Thirdly, the research has been picked up in a range of international         arenas.
The UN Special           Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions used         the research in support of         an independent police complaints body, and proposed guidelines for         governments on the         creation and operation of effective external complaints mechanisms.
The         support in the         Opinion for the existence of an independent police complaints body was         favourably cited in a         report to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Emergency Planning,         with the chair of the         enquiry noting that Dr Smith's CHR work had been "an important           inspiration for the           commission" with the report subsequently recommending the creation         of a more independent         complaints system in Norway.
Finally, Dr Smith gave a live video-link         presentation to the         Victoria Office of Police Integrity Forum, (Melbourne, Australia)         regarding the independent         and effective investigation of deaths associated with police contact; a         subsequent `Issues         Paper' cited the Opinion and `Every Complaint Matters' (reference [B],         above) [10]       More recently, Smith has engaged directly with solicitors who         required an expert report on         behalf of a police officer they are representing in civil proceedings.
