     Government Policy Impact     Following publication of the underpinning research, Scottish Government       endorsed the need for nationwide clinical information systems to support       diabetes care through the Scottish Diabetes Group in the Scottish Diabetes       Framework (2002) and the Scottish Diabetes Action Plans (2006 and 2010       [1]).
The Government commissioned further informatics research at the       University of Dundee to develop DARTS into a national technology product,       the Scottish Care Information-Diabetes Collaboration (SCI DC; http://www.sci-diabetes.scot.nhs.uk/)       [2,3].
NHS Scotland Quality retinopathy screening [4].
E-very NHS Board in       Scotland was instructed to deploy SCI DC.
TheImprovement Scotland also       endorsed its implementation for national clinical standards and Government       has funded SCI DC as a joint venture between the University of Dundee and       NHS &#8212; Tayside (~&#163;750K per annum during the assessment period), and it is       now the national clinical information system for the care of all people       with diabetes in Scotland.
SCI DC uses state of the art informatics to       combine information from heterogeneous data sources, including the       national community health index, general practices, hospitals,       laboratories and the national retinopathy screening service.
Since 2004       SCI DC has been implemented in all 14 Scottish Health Boards, and since       2008 it has been used in 1038 general practices and 38 hospitals,       monitoring the care of over 271,000 people with diabetes.
Since 2008 the       SCI-DC has supported the nationwide retinopathy screening programme (http://www.ndrs.scot.nhs.uk/),       arguably the most complete, quality assured screening programme       internationally, performing digital retinal photography on 200,000 people       with diabetes annually.
SCI-DC also produces the Scottish Diabetes Survey       [5] which has recorded year-on-year improvements in the quality of       diabetes care, delivers national diabetes patient-led information and       education packages (e.g.
http://www.mydiabetesmyway.scot.nhs.uk/)       and is embedded within national quality standards.
In December 2008 SCI-DC       commissioned an independent review of its products with a view to       consolidating into a single system (SCI-DC Phase III) for diabetic care       across Scotland, as well as moving to the latest relevant technologies,       and in April 2013 the SCI-DC Team successfully completed the migration of       Health Boards from SCI-DC Network to the single SCI-DC Phase III product       now known as SCI-Diabetes [6].
Other impacts include:             Improved patient care and health outcomes: SCI-DC supports the         evaluation of improved regional and national health outcomes, e.g.
a 40%         reduction in amputation rates [ii] and a 40% reduction in         sight-threatening retinopathy 2003-2009 [iii], and has evolved into a         powerful nationwide pharmacovigilance tool, allowing safety assessment         of diabetes treatments and other therapies [v].
Strategic Research Impact: SCI-DC is the core of the Scottish         Diabetes Research Network (http://www.sdrn.org.uk/;         Dundee led), that attracts research income (~&#163;500K p.a.)
from the Chief         Scientist's Office to improve clinical trial performance (300% increase         2008-2013).
The associated recruitment of individuals to large genomic         studies (&gt;40,000 subjects) [7,8], and the linkage of phenotype to         genotype, has been of great importance [iv].
Dundee is now a major         partner of several international research endeavours including the         Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2, the &#8364;43M DIRECT study on         stratification of diabetes (led from Dundee) and the &#8364;32M SUMMIT study         on biomarkers for diabetes complications (co-led by Dundee).
Dundee         leads the Scottish node of the &#163;39M MRC co-ordinated Farr Institute and         convenes the UK Health Informatics Research Network.
In terms of         research policy, this case study has been highlighted as best practice         in the UK Life Sciences Strategy 2012, the UKTI "Business           Olympics" at Lancaster House July 2012, and The House of Lords           Report on Genomic Medicine (2009) [7].
The linkage between         research, informatics and health care led Sir Mark Walport, Director of         the Wellcome Trust to write (The Times 30th May, 2011); "If you         live in Dundee and suffer from diabetes, you have recently been taking         part in a medical revolution."
Creation of a new business: In 2008 Aridhia Informatics (http://www.aridhia.com)         was co- founded by the University with the aim of creating an         international health informatics company based in Scotland.
Aridhia is         now a small-medium enterprise, based in Dundee and Edinburgh, which         employs 82 people.
It has attracted &gt;&#163;10M of external investment,         including a &#163;1.2M Technology Strategy Board Cancer Informatics programme         in Scotland, and venture funding from Scottish Equity Partners and         Albion Ventures.
Aridhia has cloud-based deployments in Scotland,         England, Kuwait, New Zealand and Australia [9].
International Impact: We have rolled out the informatics model         internationally to the Kuwait-Scotland eHealth innovation network (www.dasmaninstitute.org/kuwait-scotland).
The thesis is that we can export the Scottish Health Science "package"         of informatics, research and quality care delivery to other nations         wrestling with the challenge of non-communicable diseases.
Following the         signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in 2010 between the Ministry of         Health in Kuwait, the Dasman Diabetes Institute [10], the University of         Dundee, NHS Tayside and Aridhia Informatics, the partners have:                installed an electronic health record to the Capital Region of           Kuwait City (600,000) with nationwide roll-out anticipated in 2013;         enrolled 170 Kuwaiti students on a University of Dundee Masters           Course in Diabetes Care, Research and Education;         developed the Kuwait clinical skills centre, the first of its kind           in the Middle East;         established collaborative research programmes in genetics,           epidemiology and health services research;         secured multi-million pound income to Scotland (&gt;&#163;15M);         been shortlisted for the Times Higher Education Supplement           International Collaboration of the year 2012.
