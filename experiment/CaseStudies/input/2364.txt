     The book was favourably received by the daily and weekly press in Britain       and the USA.
It served as the foundation in 2011 for a 55-minute       documentary programme entitled 'Frederick the Great and the Enigma of       Prussia', presented by the author, directed by Chris Wilson and produced       by Adam Kemp for Aenon and Fresh One Productions [ref 5A], last       aired on BBC4 on Saturday 22 October 2011.
The book was also translated       into French, Czech and Polish.
But it is in Germany (Preussen.
Aufstieg und Niedergang, 1600-1947,       Deutsche Verlagsanstalt: Munich, 2007) that its impact was broadest and       deepest.
Sales exceeded 100,000 (the book was no.
1 on the Spiegel       non-fiction bestseller list for several weeks and remained on the list for       several months).
There were numerous full-page reviews in the daily and       weekly press and many radio interviews (Bayerischer Rundfunk, Rundfunk       Berlin-Brandenburg, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, Hessischer Rundfunk).
Der         Spiegel ran a four-page author-interview and there were hundreds of       reviews in the metropolitan, provincial and regional papers.
The author       was invited to the Palace of Bellevue, residence of the President of the       Federal Republic in Berlin, for an interview with the then Federal       President Horst K&#246;hler, in which the author was asked to brief the       President on the issues raised by the book.
In a speech he gave a week       later, President K&#246;hler cited remarks made in the interview on the renewed       public interest in the history of Prussia, as exemplified by Clark's book.
This immediate reception occurred after German hardcover and paperback       publication in 2007-8, but the book has continued to receive intensive       publicity and discussion in Germany throughout the period currently under       review: for example, an interview with DeutschlandRadio Wissen (5       Nov. 2010), an invited contribution to Tagesspiegel (15 Jun.
2011), and a tribute in a speech by Minister of Culture Bernd Neumann (20       Mar.
2012).
Subsidiary rights were procured by the Bundeszentrale f&#252;r       Politische Bildung, so that a special edition could be produced for       subsidised distribution to `mediators in political education and       interested parties in tertiary education and at schools' [5J].
The       author was interviewed on the subject of Prussia for one hour on the       bi-weekly programme `Klassik &#224; la Carte' (Norddeutscher Rundfunk &#8212; est.
audience 850,000) on 23 January 2012, and contributed interview material       to the RBB Docudrama 'Friedrich: Ein deutscher K&#246;nig' starring Anna and       Katharina Thalbach, and broadcast on 7 Jan 2012.
The author also       contributed interview material relating to Prussia for the Gebr&#252;der Beetz       docudrama `Die Akte Kleist', broadcast by ARTE on 24 March 2011 [5B]       and for the Credo Film docudrama `Rahel &#8212; eine preu&#223;ische Aff&#228;re' [5C],       broadcast by ARTE on 5 December 2009.
On 27 November 2011, Die Zeit printed a debate on Frederick II       between the author and the Polish journalist Adam Krzeminski [5D]       and on 7 December 2011, Stern-Magazin published an interview with       the author [5E].
On 6 November 2010, the author became the first person from outside       German-speaking Europe to receive the triannual 'Deutscher       Historikerpreis' awarded by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.
The prize       was presented by Federal President Christian Wulf (K&#246;hler's successor) who       spoke of the book's importance in transforming public perceptions of       Prussia and inaugurating a different way of conceptualising the       relationship between present and past in Germany.
The event received wide       media coverage [5F, 5G].
On 23 January 2012, the author was asked to deliver the keynote address       on the occasion of the official anniversary marking the 300th       birthday of Frederick II in the Konzerthaus in central Berlin.
The other       speakers were Federal President Wulff, the Lord Mayor of Berlin, Klaus       Wowereit, the Minister-President of Brandenburg, Matthias Platzeck and the       Prince of Prussia.
The event was broadcast live by Rundfunk       Berlin-Brandenburg and the author's address was reprinted in Berliner         Zeitung and S&#252;ddeutsche Zeitung, and reviewed in over one       hundred newspapers [5H].
In short: the impact of this book has been felt far beyond the usual       academic milieux.
It is seen as having helped to transform contemporary       German engagements with the country's past.
In 2008, the S&#252;ddeutsche         Zeitung cited the book prominently in a 4-page comment piece       entitled 'Prussia is Sexy Again', and in a book-length conversation with       the former German foreign minister Joschka Fischer, published this year,       the American emigr&#233; German-Jewish historian Fritz Stern spoke of the       'Prussian renaissance' (Preu&#223;en-Renaissance) triggered by the book [5I].
