     Research at Bath has had an impact on:            Practitioners and services, evidenced by the supply of improved and         new products, literature and web information by Exchange Supplies,         Association Apothicom and Frontier Medical.
Public policy, evidenced by the influence on the Advisory Council on         the Misuse of Drugs and subsequent health policy.
And, through these, on the health and welfare of drug misusers.
Impact on practitioners and services     Exchange Supplies is a social enterprise, formed in 2001, which       provides products, information and services that reduce the harms of       illicit drug use.
Dr. Scott has been collaborating with Exchange to       examine the use of various acids in the injection-preparation process and       the resulting drug content in prepared injections.
An important impact of       this research was its crucial influence on the development by Exchange       Supplies of Citric and VitC acidifier sachets, which are much safer than       alternatives, such as lemon juice, often used by injecting drug users.
The       Managing Director of Exchange Supplies has remarked [1], "We have had         a long association with Dr Jenny Scott at the University of Bath, whose         understanding of the chemistry of illicit drug injection process is         second to none.
When we were first establishing the business, and         developing our first product (a single use sachet of citric acid to be         added to heroin or crack cocaine as a safer alternative to vinegar or         lemon juice) the advice we received from Dr Scott was invaluable.
Her         research provided a scientific rationale for the amount, and type, of         acid we should supply in the sachet.
The positive impact of launching         the product on the basis of a solid scientific foundation in its         subsequent success cannot be underestimated".
The move to evidence-based provision of the products manufactured by       Exchange Supplies by most NHS services in the UK has been the foundation       upon which the company has been built and transformed into a thriving       social enterprise, turning over almost &#163;3 million per year, and employing       15 people.
The Exchange team includes current and former drug users for       whom paid, flexible and supportive employment, and additional training       opportunities, are provided [1].
The Managing Director further notes that [1], "Dr Scott's expert         evidence to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs was a         significant causal factor in them recommending amendments to the Misuse         of Drugs Act so that acids, spoons, filters and foil could be legally         provided.
This combination of impact on injecting drug users technique,         drug worker practice, and UK public policy have combined to achieve         significant impact on the health and welfare of injecting drug users         both in the UK and worldwide".
Correct use of the Citric product was encouraged via the production of a       collaborative film by Dr Scott and Exchange Supplies in 2006 [2].
This       demonstrated in the laboratory the correct use of Citric with street       heroin, and addressed concerns that injectors had been using the whole       sachet rather than the correct amount, an error which could (and did)       result in vein damage.
The DVD was distributed to needle exchanges, it was       shown in waiting rooms, and handed out free to IDUs.
In 2008, a drug user       activist posted the film on YouTube, prompting Exchange Supplies to launch       a YouTube channel and publish the film in HD format.
Total YouTube views       for both versions of the film currently stand at over 50,000.
Association Apothicom (France), a not-for-profit association       created in 1992 for information and prevention, conducts public health       research programmes and develops tools for drug use-related harm       reduction.
Apothicom created and developed a unique prevention       kit, Steribox&#8482;, and invested considerable effort to make it       available to illicit drug users.
Subsequently, Stericup&#174;       and Sterifilt&#174;, single-use cup and filter,       respectively, completed the kit.
Today, Steribox2&#8482;, which       contains these prevention tools, is supplied by pharmacies, syringe       exchange programmes and automatic vending and dispensing machines.
The       founder of Apothicom, has stated [3], "Dr Scott's efforts were pivotal         in the early 2000s in convincing the U.K. Home Office to change its         position on harm reduction tools for illicit drug users (specifically,         the supply of acidifying agents and the provision of sterile filters).
Evidence presented by Dr Scott to the U.K.
Advisory Council on the         Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) informed subsequent legislation changes on         paraphernalia supply.
In turn, this convinced the French authorities         that the supply of harm reduction tools for drug users was warranted.
Further, Dr Scott alerted Apothicom in 2008 of a possible risk         associated with the metal composition of our Stericup&#174;,         a problem which has now been resolved such that 50,000 drug users are         now using this tool every day".
As further examples of the reach of Dr Scott's research and its impact in       the REF period, in 2009, Apothicom and the Centre de Biologie M&#233;dicale       Sp&#233;cialis&#233;e de l'Institute Pasteur, Paris, sought permission from the       Scottish Executive to translate the `Study of Safety, Risks and Outcomes       from the Use of Injecting Paraphernalia' [4] into French, to inform French       policy on needle exchange equipment supply.
Apothicom's founder also notes       that, "Jenny Scott's report, `Study of the Safety, Risks and Outcomes         from the Use of Injecting Paraphernalia' (Edinburgh: Scottish Executive,         March 2008) is a reference work for French decision makers, and greatly         influenced our document, "R&#233;f&#233;rentiel de R&#233;duction des Risques".
Her         work has contributed to best practice recommendations and to ensure that         harm reduction supplies are available to public health services in many         countries.
For example, her studies are often cited when a choice         between acidifiers or other materials is to be made; as an illustration,         see Best Practice Recommendations for Canadian Harm Reduction Programs         That Provide Service to People Who Use Drugs and Are AT Risk For HIV,         HCV, and Other Harms (2013)".
[5]     Frontier Medical Group (Wales) provides a range of safe and       appropriate products (usually distributed through pharmacies) for the       prevention of harm in intravenous drug users.
One of Frontier's products       was an aluminium cup in which IV drug users dissolved heroin in water,       typically adding an acidifier and applying heat.
Scott undertook research       to address a concern that there was a risk that aluminium from the cup       might contaminate the "hit" and cause harm to the user.
Although this work       revealed that the cups were in fact quite safe, and that the release of       aluminium was unlikely to pose a health risk, Frontier decided, on the       basis of Scott's results, to develop its own brand stainless steel spoon       that is now a highly successful product, millions of which have been sold       throughout the world [6].
Bristol Drugs Project (BDP).
Scott's work [7] with BDP included a       focus on the microbiology of the hands of injecting drug misusers.
A       comparison of the performance of two methods of hand cleansing resulted in       the crafting and distribution of an advice pamphlet for intravenous drug       users.
Subsequently, in collaboration with Scott, BDP introduced Safer       Injecting Workshops with four main foci: (a) use of a clean needle for       each injection, (b) rotatable sites, (c) good technique for preparation       and injecting, and (d) hygiene (including hand washing).
As BDP's former       Harm Reduction Team Leader notes [7]: "... as a result of [Scott's]         initial research, all washing facilities were revamped and hand-washing         Gel dispensers were liberally installed around [BDP's] buildings and         mobile units for clients to use".
Impact on policy     Professor David Nutt, past chair of Advisory Council on the Misuse of       Drugs (ACMD), invited Dr Scott to give evidence to this group on three       occasions.
The first two presentations informed the 2003 and 2005 changes       in legislation on paraphernalia supply.
The third gave an overview of       research conducted for the Scottish Executive, which is cited in a 2009       ACMD report [8] which informs current policy on hepatitis C prevention.
Funding from the Scottish Executive and the publication on the Internet       in 2008 of the report called `Study of the Safety, Risks and Outcomes from       the Use of Injecting Paraphernalia' [5] led to a change in policy, not       only in the UK but also in France and Canada during the REF period [4].
The 2011 Harm Reduction Training Manual published by the British Columbia       Harm Reduction Strategies and Services department, part of the British       Columbia Harm Reduction Program, used Scott's research findings to       evidence their advice on paraphernalia use [6].
Health and welfare of drug users     The Managing Director of Exchange Supplies affirms that Scott's research,       expert advice and advocacy: "on injecting drug users' technique, drug         worker practice, and UK public policy have combined to achieve         significant impact on the health and welfare of injecting drug users in         the UK and worldwide" [1].
This view is fully endorsed by the       Programmes Coordinator of the International Network of People who Use       Drugs (INPUD, a global network that seeks to represent current and former       drug users in international agencies, e.g., the UN, and those undertaking       international development work), who states [9], "[Scott] has been         active in training practitioners working with drug treatment         organisations... [her] involvement has reduced significant harm to many         of the drug using communities".
Thus, in summary, the main beneficiaries of this research are:            Injecting drug users, who now have access to a range of sterile,         fit-for-purpose equipment that has been tested for theoretical safety         despite no legal requirement to do so.
This has benefited their         individual health.
The supply of equipment has attracted IDUs into         needle exchange services, which by proxy is thought to have contributed         to the control of blood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C.       Policymakers and harm-reduction agencies in a number of countries have         been able to develop their thinking and their practical approaches in         the light of scientific evidence from Bath.
Companies that manufacture and distribute injecting paraphernalia,         including Exchange Supplies and Association Apothicom have benefited         from the provision of scientific data that has guided product         development, contributing to the uptake of new products by health         professionals and injecting drug users.
