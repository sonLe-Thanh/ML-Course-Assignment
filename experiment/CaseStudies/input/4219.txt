 Both the methodology employed by the researchers and the identification of specific occupational breast cancer risks affecting working women has had an impact across a number of countries.
In relation to the team's focus on the role of occupation in breast cancer, the research (especially Brophy et al.2012) has triggered an important debate about the relative benefits of occupation- based studies in relation to gene-environment interactions4 With regard to the methodology employed by the group, both the secondary studies (Brophy et al, 2012a; DeMatteo et al, 2012) and the main study (Brophy et al, 2012b) have impacted beyond academia on how public health bodies, such as the surveillance body CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) Canada approach issues of occupational cancer etiology and the etiology of occupational diseases more generally, with CAREX aiming to generate a widely disseminated data base of work related carcinogenic chemicals.5.
Similarly the publicly funded Institute for Work and Health has noted the importance of the study's case control methodology in this specific work context.6 The research has also led trade union bodies, charitable organisations, environmental groups and, more recently, legislative bodies to demand regulatory change, improved inspection and further research.
In Canada, the Automobile Workers Unions (CAW) &#8212; one of the largest and highest profile social unions with over 225,000 members &#8212; has used the findings to demand changes to health and safety regulation to make the working lives of women safer.
Specifically, CAW news releases (Nov 2012) note that "CAW is deeply troubled by the latest findings on the occupational causes of breast cancer among Canadian women and is calling for regulatory changes and increased attention by health officials to blue collar women's workplace exposures, in light of the new research."
In reviewing the group's main study, CAW's Health, Safety and Environment Director Sari Sairanen publicly has stated that "Important studies like this give credence to the glaring trends that we see in our workplaces &#8212; it is absolutely urgent that we do not continue to wait until overwhelming evidence piles up before we take action."
CAW called for a series of measures including (19 Nov 2012): - increased attention by health officials to blue-collar women's workplace exposures and cancer research; - research initiatives into preventable environmental causes of breast cancer; - a public inquiry or commission to examine the risks to women posed by exposures in the plastics industry; - regulatory changes; and - action by the Federal Government to ensure that companies that use safer and healthier products do not face an unfair competitive disadvantage with overseas companies using harmful substances.
The Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation &#8212; one of the largest non-governmental funders of breast cancer research worldwide &#8212; noted in a press release (18 Nov 2012) that "[t]his landmark research provides new evidence to help inform discussions with governments, industry, health care providers and stakeholders about the serious effects occupational risk factors can have on the development of breast cancer."
The Director of the National Network on Environments and Women's Health, Dayna Nadine Scott (a CBCF official), has stated that the research will be used to "demand a precautionary approach to dealing with toxic substances" based on a "growing understanding that when it comes to endocrine disrupting chemicals, even low doses can be dangerous" (19 Nov 2012).
Similar demands have been made by a number of charitable and civic organizations in North America, including the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Network, the National Association of Professional Women (USA), the Breast Cancer Fund (USA).
Also in the UK, the Alliance for Cancer Prevention &#8212; a multi-stakeholder group which includes representatives from NGOs, environmental and occupational health organisations, trade unions, (including UNITE, UNISON and USDAW), public health advocates and civil society groups - has stated that "a dramatic policy switch to eliminate exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) must be the main focus of the EU's EDC strategy."
Specifically, the Alliance demands "an urgent refocus of the EDC strategy to eliminate exposure to EDCs" and calls "on the UK Government to support a hazards based approach to identification and assessment of EDCs including mixtures of EDCs across all exposures in the workplace and for the public in general" (7 Dec 2012).
