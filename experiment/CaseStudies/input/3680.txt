     Three specific research themes were integrated and combined in a       synergistic manner that, together with a responsive business engagement       approach, has helped four organisations &#8212; RE, Sunderland City Council,       Modrec (a distributor of business luggage) and TASS (the Talented Athlete       Scholarship Scheme) &#8212; to develop and improve their strategic marketing,       brand and business functions.
1.
Developing an integrated approach that satisfies customer needs and         changes organisational culture by providing solutions     The RE KTP, which commenced during 2010, embedded a strategic marketing       approach to business and market development by establishing a market       focus, and transferred marketing and business development knowledge, tools       and techniques.
At the start of the KTP, RE had no marketing department,       expertise or focus and instead, engaged in a sales- and production-focused       approach to business.
The KTP aimed to maximise the potential of recent       acquisitions by helping the company acquire and develop strategic business       development expertise by creating for them a transferrable knowledge base       to help them to diversify their products, services and markets.
The new       focus helped RE to develop and introduce a screening instrument to       maximise new product/service development prospects whilst minimising       opportunity costs.
The tool is called Preliminary Estimation Tool for       Enquiries (PETE), and has been responsible for screening and giving an       initial "green light" on contracts worth &#163;500,000 in 2012 alone (Source       1).The project also facilitated a strategic change in organisational       culture in terms of business operation as well as repositioning the       company from a traditional product manufacturer to a higher margin       business solutions provider.
As a result, RE began to provide design         support and fine tuning customised technical solutions for individual         customers.
Thus, they produced a "water-proof, fire-proof, sound-       proof door with easy access for off-shore wind turbines" rather than, as       before, simply manufacturing ship doors to customer specifications.
"The "KTP relationship ... has been a great success for all involved.
Academic knowledge and research has been helpful in our strategic         thinking and planning, and the KTP continues to deliver tangible         benefits not just to the growth of the business but it has also injected         a `feel good' factor which is permeating throughout the Renown team."
(Managing Director RE, Source 2)     The Renown KTP project was giving the highest possible ranking of       "outstanding" by an independent Technology Strategy Board KTP grading       panel (Source 3).
Less than 5% of KTP projects achieve an outstanding       grade.
As a result of the RE KTP, areas such as e-business function,       exhibition management and market research have been improved and       integrated with a focus on services and providing solutions that are now       part of an overarching business strategy.
For example, a new website       (developed using a CoP approach to refocus the site on stakeholders) has       generated 60% of enquiries for one strategic business unit (SBU) during       2012, with a high conversion rate to sales.
No leads or sales were       developed through this website for this SBU in previous years (Source 3).
"Since the KTP started in November 2010 our sales have risen from &#163;11         million to &#163;15 million and profits have also increased.
I believe a         significant part of this growth is a direct consequence of the work done         on the Marketing Knowledge Transfer Programme with Newcastle Business         School."

In addition to the direct impact on RE that arose from this research,       these approaches were transferred to two other KTPs.
Firstly, TASS changed       its approach to management of resources and improved service delivery.
Further, both TASS and Modrec developed a new and integrated approach to       strategic marketing planning and branding that has allowed diversification       into new products and markets.
For Modrec, "The partnership has         supported opportunity exploration and provided strategic recommendations         to implement which will assist in the successful positioning and         longevity of Modrec International, its brands and its products for the         future."

Utilising a brand matrix and other branding tools     The RE project has enabled development of an integrated brand identity       over their existing seven disparate trading brands (Source 3).
Similarly,       for TASS, "The results of the research carried out during our KTP with         Northumbria University have had a significant impact on TASS.
We have         developed new approaches to satisfying customer needs and enhanced the         TASS Brand.
As a result, we can now be sustainable without government         and funding and have been able to employ new staff to take advantage of         new market opportunities."

Building upon underpinning brand related research in the non-profit       sector a partnership with SCC helped them to develop a consistent set of       brand values and integrated approach to internal and external branding.
"The         results of research carried out by NBS since 2009 have helped Sunderland         City Council develop a consistent set of brand values which is an         excellent fit with our stakeholder needs.
The impact has resulted in         record levels of employee trust and engagement despite having been         through 3 years of unprecedented change: having these core values to         anchor and guide us has been instrumental in this.
A NBS PhD student is         now working with us and has surveyed our employees, helping us to better         understand the relationship between internal marketing communications,         brand values, employee engagement and employee brand identity."

In order to disseminate the results of this branding research and share       knowledge with a wider group of businesses the "Great Northeast Brands"       partnership was established between the Business School and the North East       Branch of the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM).
This partnership       highlights the role branding can play in business development in the       region (Source 8 and 9).
Since 2010, the School has hosted six CIM events       focusing on Great North East Brands.
"Our partnership with Newcastle         Business School at Northumbria University has helped to share the         results of their research with local business practitioners and enabled         those businesses to learn from examples of best practice from other         organisations.
Over 250 business managers have attended Chartered         Institute of Marketing events hosted in partnership with Newcastle         Business School and as a result they have been able to put examples of         best practice into action in the businesses where they work or own,         which in turn has resulted in a significant impact on their success."

Transferring knowledge between and among stakeholder communities         using communities of practice     Drawing on specific communities of practice techniques with customers and       suppliers, RE developed a strategic marketing process and a shift from a       "sales" and "production" to a "market" orientated business that is a       value-added provider of solutions.
An immediate and tangible result is       that sales margins have increased by 30% with an associated rise in       profits.
Integration with an engineering-based RE KTP managed by       Northumbria University that focused on designing water-proof and       fire-proof doors for ships helped create additional impact.
Specifically       new export sales, new markets and new products including &#163;100,000 of new       sales in Saudi Arabia in 2012 of the world's first fire-proof and       water-proof doors for ships (Source 3).
The researchers focused on       marketing these unique new doors while the engineering KTP focused on       designing and manufacturing them.
