     The impact of the APRGD (which has received wide public recognition       globally) has taken the following forms:            Deepening the quality of contemporary productions of classical theatre         through work with theatre practitioners from 1996 onwards, thereby         helping to develop new skills, insights and ways of working for         directors, poet-translators, composers, designers, choreographers and         actors, and drawing in audiences for new cultural experiences and         bringing acclaim to the UK theatre sector.
Commissioning new theatrical work from 2005-10 through the `Onassis         Programme for the Performance of Greek Drama'.
Helping to create an appetite for classical theatre through public         engagement activities, and so contributing to knowledge and the quality         of life.
Offering the pedagogical benefit of open-access information about the         history of performances of Greek and Roman drama.

Collaboration with theatre practitioners     The research team at the APGRD has provided academic expertise for       contemporary theatre.
Discussions on performance interpretation, the       historical dimension of drama and input at rehearsals have led to       continued relationships with practitioners, in the UK and worldwide.
[4,         5, i] According to Wlodzimierz Stanieweski, founder and artistic       director of Gardzienice Centre for Theatre Practices, Poland, whose       repertoire has included three Greek tragedies since 2008: `Gardzienice's       work is forged in the fires of antiquity.
The APGRD keeps these fires       burning and has been a constant source of illumination, inspiration,       support, learning and excellence.
'[1] The knowledge and       expertise developed by the research team has helped to sustain the       distinctive and dynamic nature of the UK theatre sector.
The       poet-playwright, Tony Harrison has commented: `The life of drama is in       performance and the APGRD opens up what has been locked in a more narrow       academic discipline into a potentially much wider and more generally       available field of interest and study'.
[2] The research team       has had significant input at rehearsals initiating discussions on the       historical dimension of drama and performance interpretation.
The APGRD's       activities on opera and dance have also gathered a remarkably       distinguished and varied collection of contributors to its conferences and       publications, including the composer Christian Wolff and choreographers       Suzy Willson (Artistic Director, Clod Ensemble) and Struan Leslie (Head of       Movement, RSC).
For Leslie, `The APGRD has provided support and       encouragement, as well as having been a touchstone for my continuing       practice.
It is a place that hears the modern and resonates the ancient in       response to a creative contemporary context'.
[3] Research using       the APGRD's resources has also directly fostered professional careers in       theatre: Avery Willis, whose Oxford doctoral thesis on Euripides' Troades       was based on APGRD material, has established a career working with Peter       Sellars in the USA; former BA Postdoctoral Fellow Kathleen Riley has       worked with actors including Nigel Hawthorne, Edward Petherbridge and       Kathryn Hunter and with the playwright Frank McGuinness on his forthcoming       Trojan Women.
Helen Eastman, APGRD's Onassis Producer 2005-2011,       has received numerous playwriting commissions from UK theatre companies,       including the acclaimed Hercules (Chester 2010).
Collaborations since 2008 include the following:            Macintosh's work on Gilbert Murray and Bernard Shaw was discussed with         Tony Harrison for his play FRAM and featured in the programme notes for         Nick Hytner's production of Major Barbara (both Royal National         Theatre 2008).
Hall was consultant on Die Perser at Braunschweig State         Theatre, directed by Claudia Bosse (May/June 2008).
Macintosh acted as dramaturge for a devised chorus piece choreographed         by Struan Leslie (Head of Movement, RSC) and Simon Deacon (Composer) at         RNT Studios (August 2008).
Taplin conceived and provided translations for the show Powerful           Voices: Women in Ancient Greek Drama, presented by the Alexander         S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation (USA) at Florence Gould Hall, New         York, in December 2008.
19 performances of Taplin's adaptation The Wanderings of Odysseus         were put on at the Stanford University Summer Theater programme,         July-August 2010; and at the Cacoyannis Centre, Athens, September 2012.

Commissioning new work     The research undertaken by the APGRD led to the establishment of the       Onassis Programme for the Performance of Greek Drama at Oxford (www.onassis.ox.ac.uk),       whose audiences numbered over 30,000 in over 30 UK cities from 2005-2011.
This programme commissions and produces work[ii] by       international theatre artists inspired by classical Greek drama, notably       the opera version of Seamus Heaney's The Burial at Thebes,       directed by Derek Walcott, with music by Dominique le Gendre (2008), and       Glyn Maxwell's After Troy (2011), which resulted from dialogues       with Taplin.
Rehearsed public readings by professional actors of new       versions of ancient plays have brought writers, audiences and academics       together at the APGRD to develop new plays (including Goddess from a         Machine by Peter Morris, Ismene by Stacey Gregg, and The         Angry Wounds by Julian Armitstead).
One of the commissioned audio       plays for the `Pots and Plays' event at the Ashmolean in May 2011, Vanessa       Badham's Bull, went on to become The Bull, the Moon and the         Coronet of Stars, which enjoyed a successful Australian tour in       2013.

Public engagement and access to research     The open-access APGRD website and online database have had approximately       50,000 visits since 2008 (25,000 of whom have used the database) and is       being used as a model for similar projects at Northwestern University and       NYU.
The APGRD research team has put on several public exhibitions and       lectures.
For example, the Onassis production of Tom Paulin's Medea       (2010) was accompanied by an exhibition of APGRD materials relating to Medea's       performance history; Derek Walcott's script and drawings were exhibited       for the opera The Burial at Thebes (2008); and in November 2011       the APGRD organised an exhibition, in conjunction with the National       Theatre Archive and the Jocelyn Herbert Archive to mark the 30th       Anniversary of the Oresteia (Royal National Theatre 1981), and an       event for 200 guests with a discussion with the translator Tony Harrison,       a performance by the actor Greg Hicks (Orestes in 1981), and a talk about       Harrison Birtwistle's score.
The APGRD series of public lectures has regularly featured prominent       international playwrights and theatre directors, including Frank       McGuinness, Martin Crimp and Poland's Wlodzimierz Staniewski (together       with the UK premiere of his film, `Iphigenia at Aulis', 2009).
Frank       McGuinness' discussion with Macintosh is available online (podcasts.ox.ac.uk).
APGRD       researchers have also given public talks on aspects of classical theatre       and have been featured on BBC Radios 3 and 4.
[iv] Taplin and       Hall joined Tony Harrison for a Platform Talk at the National Theatre in       relation to Harrison's play FRAM (2008).
Macintosh has been a speaker at a       number of Oxford Festival of Dance events.
Taplin has been a regular       contributor to Radio 4's Front Row and Radio 3's Night Waves.
Hall has       appeared on Start the Week, In Our Time, Women's Hour and in a number of       TV documentaries.
Macintosh has appeared on Night Waves; presented the       programme `Euripides' in the Radio 3 series The Essay: Greek and Latin       Voices (broadcast 6/3/2008); and contributed to the Radio 4 programme       `Freudian Slippage: Part 1' (broadcast 13/12/2010), which was inspired by       her chapter in the APGRD 2004 volume Dionysus since 69.
The APGRD is cited by the AHRC on its website as an outstanding example       of a Humanities project that has made a considerable impression on the       world outside academia.
The APGRD was also successfully nominated by the       AHRC for inclusion in the 'cultural and community' section of the RCUK       'Impacts: Achieving investment in the UK - Research through Partnership'       publication.

Pedagogical benefits     The research done by the APGRD has had varied pedagogical benefits.
[v]       In particular, all Onassis productions have been accompanied by workshops       for schools and downloadable packs for teachers which make extensive use       of APGRD materials; the APGRD website includes a `Learning' section with       short essays by young scholars aimed at school and undergraduate students       of Classics, English, Film and Theatre Studies.
Macintosh's Radio 3       programme on Euripides is also course material for Open University course       A275 `Reading Classical Greek: language and literature'.
Professor Robin       Osborne (Cambridge) has described the APGRD as one of the `great research       projects', which enables `patterns to be discerned that could not       previously have been seen' (Bulletin of the Council of University         Classical Departments 40 (2011), p.5).
Building on its contacts in       the creative and heritage industries, the APGRD has run two AHRC- funded       public engagement/collaborative skills training courses from 2010-2013 for       20 doctoral/early career researchers from 15 different HEIs.
