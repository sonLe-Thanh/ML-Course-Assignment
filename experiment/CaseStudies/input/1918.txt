     The CPR incorporated a comprehensive communications strategy to place its       work in the public eye, maximise discussion and debate about its reports,       and secure policy and professional leverage for its proposals.
Without the       contribution of CPR, the debate on reform of primary education in England       would have been much more narrowly configured and less well informed.
What       follows are some key indicators of the CPR's impact on the constituencies       of policy, schools and the general public, in both the UK and       internationally.
Public Debate in the Media: Public debate about the condition of       English primary education was a key objective of the CPR.
It secured major       interest from the media as a result:            On the day the final report was published (16 October 2009) CPR was         the top news story in the UK.
National television coverage included BBC,         ITN, Channels 4 and 5 as well as Sky News (18 in total including all         related outlets).
National radio included items on Radio 4's flagship Today         programme as well as Radio 5 (11 in total).
National press: including Guardian,         Independent, Daily Telegraph and Times (over 30).
International press: including outlets in Australia, Canada, China,         Germany, Malaysia, Spain and New Zealand (total over 30).
(see 5.1).
Independent media analysis shows that on five of the ten previous         occasions between 2007-09 when the CPR released its reports it was the         top UK news story overall for those days with 3 of these top ratings         occurring since January 2008.
(See 5.2).
CPR's findings were widely reported in the national press.
In the         interests of balance we have drawn on media reports from across the         political spectrum.
The proposals for a later starting age for the         formal processes of schooling at 6 (preceded by education based largely         around more informal activities), the reform of national testing and the         provision of greater freedom to teachers to determine how they teach         were a common denominator in most coverage.
The Guardian had         detailed discussion of Findings 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 15 (as numbered         earlier in Section 2).
The Independent gave particular emphasis         to Findings 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 10.
The Daily Telegraph majored on         Findings 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 14.
Meanwhile BBC News gave         considerable attention to Findings 1, 2, 3, 7 and 9.
In an editorial the         TES said: `Politicians may dismiss the Cambridge review, but it         is a must-read for teachers' (see 5.1)       After publication there was considerable follow-up on social         networking sites and in specialist media.
Examples include Mike Baker,         the highly influential BBC Education Correspondent, who wrote that the         report ought to carry the testimonial `this book should change English         primary schools forever.
This is the most thorough, research-based         analysis of primary schools I have seen in over two decades of reporting         on education'.
Mick Brookes (General Secretary of the NAHT) wrote about         `why the Cambridge Review is required reading for all schools' (see         5.1).
Meanwhile Matthew Taylor (Chief Executive of the RSA) described it         as the `most comprehensive and far-ranging review since Plowden' (see         5.3),          It should be noted that the report was received with scepticism in many       quarters and some of the coverage was overtly hostile (see 5.1).
There was       also a good deal of misreporting of CPR's recommendations (see 5.1 and       below).
Influencing Practitioners' Attitudes and Behaviours: Network and         Commercial Partnerships The construction of a national CPR Network       has secured CPR's long-term influence:            CPR obtained further funding from Esmee Fairbairn to build a national         network of teachers keen to take forward its proposals.
By 2012 this         comprised a 5000-strong database with regional centres located at twelve         universities, each with a programme of events and action school-based         research and/or development projects, focusing particularly on aims,         curriculum, pedagogy and assessment.
Many schools have now reformed         important aspects of their work in line with CPR principles (see 5.4 and         5.5)       Between the publication of its final report in October 2009 and the         start of its partnership with Pearson in 2013, the CPR organised or         contributed to over 400 conferences, seminars and meetings convened for         the purposes of professional dissemination and/or policy engagement (see         5.6).
In mid-2013, Pearson, the world's biggest educational publisher,         decided to enter into partnership with the CPR Trust for a three-year         period in order to produce joint materials and professional development         for schools (see 5.7).
International Influences: International interest in CPR has been       high:            CPR's website has been accessed from 147 countries, with many of which         there has also been direct correspondence, followed by invitations to         speak in 11 including Australia, Chile, Germany, India, Israel,         Netherlands, Norway, Singapore and the United States see 5.8).
Influencing Policy: CPR has had an impact on policy in the       following ways:            In its early days CPR secured major publicity for its ideas and         proposals.
As a result the government launched its own review of primary         education with a more restricted remit which resulted in The Rose Review         (see 5.9).
Just before the 2010 general election CPR published a list of 11         policy priorities which it sent to political leaders and publicised in         the press.
Since the election there has been significant movement on         several of these.
For example, CPR made major contributions to the         government's public reviews of the Early Years Foundation Stage, Key         Stage 2 assessment, inspection, professional standards and the         curriculum.
CPR principals held discussions of its implications with DfE         officials and with ministers at 22 meetings between June 2010 and         September 2012 (see 5.10).
