     King's stroke research has had substantial impact through translation       into national and local       policies for stroke care, leading to improved commissioning and delivery       of stroke services.
This       has contributed to reductions in mortality and cost savings for health       services, mainly through       transformation of services in cities and the implementation of Early       Supported Discharge, the latter       also being rolled out internationally.
The ultimate beneficiaries of these       impacts are patients with       stroke, as well as their family members, who benefit from better health,       less disability and longer       lives.
Other stakeholders benefit from our research through high quality       evidence to inform policy.
Such beneficiaries include the government and non-governmental       policy-makers, commissioners       and providers of health and social care, and the voluntary sector       including the Stroke Association       and aphasia charities.
King's research influences national policy for stroke       South London Stroke Register data informed the Department of Health National           Stroke Strategy on       the need for acute and longer term stroke care.
King's data informed and       were embedded into       `Action         on Stroke Services: An Evaluation Toolkit (ASSET) for providers and for         commissioners'       which is cited as a `key resource' in Annex B of the National Stroke       Strategy.
King's was also       commissioned by the Department of Health to develop recommendations for       the top         ten priorities in stroke service research.
The South London Stroke Register team was commissioned by the       National Audit Office (NAO) to write an annex to the report on       stroke care (NAO, 2010: `Progress         in improving stroke care').
This utilised King's estimates for risk of stroke, long term outcomes and       survival to inform recommendations for stroke care.
King's data were used       to model cost-effective       options for stroke care (NAO, 2010: `Report         on the findings from our modelling of stroke care provision',       pages 15-16), informing the Parliamentary         Public Accounts Committee (2010) report on       the need for a step change in stroke care.
King's research informs major service reconfiguration in London       In response to Lord Darzi's 2007 report `Healthcare for London: A       Framework for Action', South       London Stroke Register data on incidence and patient outcomes were used by       Healthcare for         London to develop a Stroke         Strategy for London (2008).
King's data were specifically employed       to estimate the number of people who can be expected to have a stroke and       thereby the number of       Hyper Acute Stroke Unit (HASU) and Acute Stroke Unit (ASU) beds required       in the city, and to       develop models of cost effective configurations of services (page 7).
Wolfe and Rudd led work       streams for the strategy development.
The reconfiguration, implemented in       2010, consisted of 8       HASUs and 24 Stroke Units.
An evaluation (Hunter         et al., 2013) found an estimated 12% reduction       in deaths at 90 days, as well as a reduction in the median length of stay,       with an estimated cost       saving of &#163;811 per patient (2011) in London after the reconfiguration.
King's provides professional leadership and research evidence to         inform clinical guidelines       The South London Stroke Register leadership has also been instrumental in       improving stroke care       nationally.
Professor         Anthony Rudd from King's has chaired the Royal College of         Physicians'         (RCP) Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party (ISWP) since its       inception in 1995.
The fourth edition of       the Working Party's National         Clinical Guideline for Stroke (2012) recommends that Early       Supported Discharge should be a component of stroke care.
The Guidelines       also discuss the       unmet needs of stroke patients (following McKevitt et al., 2011 cited       above).
The RCP's National         Sentinel Stroke Audit 2010       recommended that Early Supported Discharge should be made       available in all districts.'
(page 11).
Early Supported Discharge is now       provided by 66% of English       hospitals.
(RCP Sentinel Audit 2012) and has been implemented       internationally (Fisher         et al.2011).
Earlier editions of the ICSWP National Stroke Guidelines, which also cite       King's stroke       research, have been used to inform the 2008 National Institute of         Health and Care Excellence       (NICE) guidelines         on stroke and the 2010 Stroke         Quality Standard, the latter recommending Early       Supported Discharge as a component of the rehabilitation pathway.
In a       report authored by King's       stroke researchers, and using methods developed by King's researchers to       estimate the quality of       stroke care, data from the RCP National Stroke Audit data for the first 72       hours of stroke care in       NHS facilities, demonstrated reduced mortality in hospitals with better       organised stroke care (Bray         et al., 2013).
The work of King's is also influential in the NHS Improvement       initiative for stroke care.
For instance, the ISWP documents are referenced throughout their website       and publications,       especially in terms of calling for pathways that include Early Supported       Discharge.
King's works with voluntary sector and patients to articulate needs       The Stroke Association (SA) recently published `Saving           Lives.
20 years of investment in vital stroke research'       that identifies how the research it has funded has led to patient benefit.
This report       highlights King's research in developing and evaluating Early Supported       Discharge.
The results of       the Stroke Association 2010 Stroke         Survivor Needs survey have informed Stroke Association       policy, and identified stroke survivor priorities, for areas of research       and service development       which have not previously been addressed, for example high prevalence of       stroke-related fatigue.
