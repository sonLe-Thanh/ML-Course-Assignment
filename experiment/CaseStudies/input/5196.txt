     Our research insights into new forms of journalism were a catalyst for       impact across three projects.
In each, detailed below, the impact was       realised through building relationships with media professionals, social       media entrepreneurs, citizens, and journalists.
Combined, they evidence       the impact of our research on (citizen) journalism.
Changing media practice - establishing an independent citizen media         centre (Vancouver 2010)       Following our insights into citizen journalism at the Beijing 2008       Olympics [3], our researchers were brought to Vancouver and       inspired the CEO of Vancouver's W2 Centre and other leading media       professionals to develop two bespoke media communities to apply our       research findings and champion citizen journalism as a civic contribution       to the Games [A].
This initial collaboration received &#163;50,000 investment from the London       2012 Cultural Olympiad [B, D], which enabled three senior creative       programmers for London 2012 (South West, Scotland, and North West) and two       technical producers (from TenantSpin) to travel to Vancouver 2010 and       produce, curate, and deliver "the world's first independent social         media centre for the Olympics" (Mayor of Vancouver) [A].
Without Miah's research findings, these collaborations and subsequent       activities would not have taken place.
Changing media practice &#8212; establishing a citizen journalism network         (London 2012)       This new partnership between Vancouver and London led the collaborators to       invest into Miah's proposal to create a nationwide citizen       journalist network for the London Olympics, dubbed #media2012 [D, E].
Miah's research argues that this was the next step for citizen       journalism, to fulfil its civic role [1].
Numerous arts       organisations, including Cornerhouse (Manchester), FACT (Liverpool) and       Watershed (Bristol), strategised for two years before London 2012, to plan       citizen media activity.
This work developed social media skills in       community media organisations, which would contribute to realising what Miah       argues as a crucial mechanism for democratising participation through       mega-events, so as to empower citizens [1].
The long-term impact of this project is evidenced in the work of Russia's       `SochiReporter', which has taken forward these principles ahead of the       Sochi 2014 Olympics [C] and Miah's appointment as mentor       for the IOC Young Reporters Programme, which aims to enhance the economic       benefits of the Olympic Games by developing the skills of novice       reporters.
During 2012, #media2012 also influenced the work of an artist       who created a painted/montage visual artwork symbolising its contribution       [D].
Out of the #media2012 collaborations, McGillivray developed       #CitizenRelay (#CR), which drew on findings [1, 2, 4] to create a       participatory media project funded by Creative Scotland [F].
#CR       built a structure within which individuals and unofficial organisations       across Scotland could develop journalism skills.
The impact of this was       considerable, with #CR participants generating 20,000+ online visits       during the Relay's week-long stay in Scotland.
The production team       produced 207 three-minute podcasts, over 100 YouTube videos, 805 Flickr       photos, and 350 Instagram images (see http://www.citizenrelay.net).
The consequence of this activity was a greater degree of participation and       the creation of an alternative lens through which people could make sense       of the Olympic programme.

#CR developed new forms of media coverage and embedded the use of social       media into media organisations.
For example, the Camglen Radio station       indicated how #CR "was a milestone for us - cementing our ability to         broadcast live programming from various locations within the communities         that Camglen is set up to serve" [G].
#CR also influenced       MediaTrustUK (funded by Big Lottery), helping to raise its profile in       Scotland and meeting "a central policy objective of increasing our         reach and establishing links with hyperlocal sites".
MediaTrustUK's       director described "#CR as `a model for engagement....a project model         that will act as a key reference point for future thinking."
[H]     #CR also had an impact on large media producers, notably Scottish       Television, who recognised: "there is no doubt that the extent and         depth of the updates provided via the #citizenrelay project helped to         provide a better quality of coverage to our readers' and how it `helped         to inform our thinking about how we cover other subsequent mass         participation events" [J]     The project was reported by the BBC, the Guardian Datablog and STV local.
McGillivray also worked with the National Libraries of Scotland and       The National Archives to develop good practice guidelines for archiving       multimedia resources.
The project's community is now actively engaged in       delivering a legacy project for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games,       funded by The Big Lottery (&#163;168,000) to create a `Digital Commonwealth'.
