     In July 2006, Magnomatics Ltd was spun-out from the University of       Sheffield in order to       commercialise the high performance electric drives employing magnetic       gearing arising from the       research at Sheffield.
Magnomatics is now recognised as a world leader in       magnetic gearing-based       products and services, and has a worldwide customer base, mostly large       multinationals and       governments.
Magnomatics Ltd:            Currently employs 35 full-time staff.
Had a turnover of &#163;1.4M for the year 2012.
Had a total investment of &#163;3.4M, with a latest investment of &#163;2.5M was         completed on 16th         November 2012.
The purpose of the investment is to enable Magnomatics         Ltd to complete         the development of its technology for the electric/hybrid vehicle         markets.
Has 21 patent families that stem from the underpinning research, with         6 granted and the         rest in application.
Was selected as a New Energy Pioneer at the 2010 Bloomberg New Energy         Finance         Summit.
Won the prestigious 2011 Northern Defence Industries (NDI) Innovation         and Technology         Award [S1].
In 2008, Magnomatics Ltd led a consortium [S2], which included Volvo, for       the development of       `pseudo' direct-drive electrical machines for applications in trucks,       buses and construction vehicles.
In 2009, Magnomatics Ltd won contracts, totalling ~&#163;1M in 2009 [S3-S5],       from the Ministry of       Defence's (MOD) Programmes and Technology Group for the design,       manufacture and testing of a       scale prototype of a 300kW naval `pseudo' direct-drive machine that will       de-risk production of a       15MW full size naval propulsion machine.
The high torque density, high       efficiency and the and       inherently lower acoustic noise emissions makes the `pseudo' direct-drive       machine an attractive       alternative for military and civilian ship propulsion.
In 2011, results from a first prototype magnetic CVT of its kind       attracted the attention of major       OEMs, leading to TSB funded projects worth more than &#163;0.5M for Magnomatics       Ltd [S6,S7] for the       development of a magnetic CVT for hybrid passenger vehicles in       collaboration with Ford Motor       Company and another for larger vehicles with Caterpillar Engines.
The       adoption of a magnetic CVT       enables the realisation of hybrid drive-trains with similar architectures       and functionalities as the       Synergy Drive&#174; employed by Toyota on its hybrid vehicles, while       potentially circumventing the       Intellectual Property owned by Toyota.
As stated in the FP7 Work Programme 2012, for wind turbine applications,       the `pseudo' direct-drive       is now recognised as an innovation which can have a major impact on large       wind turbine head       mass.
In theme 5, Energy [S8], the `pseudo' direct-drive is specifically       mentioned as one of the       major innovations which should be investigated for future 10MW-20MW wind       turbines.
Magnomatics Ltd, together with Siemens Wind, Ramboll Group, Gamesa and       other academic       partners which include the University of Sheffield are currently partners       on an EU funded project,       investigating the feasibility and design of light weight 10MW-20MW future       wind turbines.
In 2013, Magnomatics Ltd has received a &#163;1M grant from the Regional       Growth Fund, in order to       further the development of its magnetic transmission systems, such as the       magnetic CVT and the       high-torque PDD, and create 41 new jobs by 2015 [S9].
