     During the assessment period the team developed, tested and applied the       research results in projects for over 20 multinational corporations,       through a toolkit titled "Manufacturing Footprint Strategy", providing a       structured approach for companies to address four questions: a) why is it       necessary to evolve the global production network?
b) what strategic       elements form the basis of distinctive market position?
c) where should       plants be located, and how many plants should there be in each role?
and       d) how best can the transition be achieved and monitored?
These manufacturing footprint strategy projects &#8212; each involving at least       12 months of intense collaboration and a senior cross-functional team &#8212;       applied the research across a wide range of sectors from construction       equipment, aerospace and transport, to chemicals, packaging, white goods       and toys.
Companies which have used the research in the assessment period       to set strategy and to make major budgeting and expenditure allocation       decisions, benefitting as a result from cost savings and improved       competitive differentiation, include Beiersdorf, Bombardier, Caterpillar,       Electrolux, Grundfos, Huntsman, Invensys, LEGO, Rolls-Royce, Schneider       Electric, Sealed Air, Shell and Wavin.
In addition, projects relating to       supply network design, engineering and service networks have been       undertaken in the same period with BAE Systems, GKN, GSK, Huawei, LEGO,       Rolls Royce and Unilever.
The research has been disseminated through publication, events, training       and consultancy.
In 2007, the DoEng published a best practice guide, Making         the Right Things in the Right Places &#8212; a structured approach to         developing and exploiting manufacturing footprint strategy.
[4] Key       events include Practitioner Forums (structured programmes of workshops and       analysis aimed at defining best practice and sharing experiences, based on       members of the research team working closely with company executives) and       Annual Symposia (aimed at leading academics and industrialists in the area       of global manufacturing, providing a focal point for a community of       practitioners to share experiences in this field, and to help align       academic research with industry needs).
7 such events relating to this       research have been held in 2008-13 with a total of 331 delegates.
The main vehicle for training and consultancy has been DoEng's       wholly-owned subsidiary Institute for Manufacturing Education and       Consulting Services Limited (ECS), which has generated GBP 2,158,181 in       consultancy, training, publication and events revenue based on the       research between Jan 2008 and July 2013.
The specific outcomes of the collaborative projects with companies are       often commercially highly sensitive, particularly when they concern       strategic investments or major budget reallocations and their impact on       costs and employment.
However, the following companies have provided       summaries of the impact on their businesses during the period 2008-13:             Sealed Air (a USD8bn-turnover global leader in food safety and         security, facilities hygiene, and product protection) applied the         research in a major strategic programme during the period 2004-11         involving 120 senior managers across multiple business divisions, and         culminating in a Board decision on radical transformation of its global         production network.
The VP of Global Manufacturing described the project         at the Annual Symposium in 2009, defining the aim of the company's         Global Manufacturing Strategy (GMS) to expand global production         capabilities in developing markets around the world, and to re-align         existing production into manufacturing centres of excellence within an         optimised network, in order to significantly improve operating         efficiencies and lower overall costs without compromising service,         quality or EHS.
The company reported a series of updates in Press         Releases over the period 2008-11, where it announced that the overall         project involved capital expenditure of USD220m [5] and delivered         repeating savings of USD55m per annum.
[6]        Rolls-Royce has been working with ECS since 2011 to apply the         research on managing complex global supply networks, to build thought         leadership within the company and thereby sustainable supply-chain         competitive advantage.
Work in the assessment period has included         development of `Do-Buy' tools for prioritising investment in new         manufacturing process technologies; piloting of global supply network         capability development tools; and development of new concepts in the         areas of internationalisation and industry structure mapping and         reconfiguration.
Rolls-Royce's Director of Corporate Planning comments         that the work "has resulted in innovative strategy tools &#8212; linked to           original research &#8212; that have been embedded as part of our on-going           strategic processes.
These are helping to guide significant           investments of around GBP250m in our supply chain that will generate           tangible business value (over GBP750m) over the life of the           investments, and which will contribute to competitive differentiation.
"[7]        GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has applied the research on managing         global supply networks.
Work in the assessment period included a global         packaging strategy model (used to underpin GSK manufacturing's move to a         regional/hub model and to support development of growth markets); a         supply network capability framework (used to assess different network         configurations and the required capabilities at different sites); and a         framework for assessing the dynamic reconfiguration of networks         (underpinning the supply of novel products and the creation of new         business models for diagnostics supply).
The SVP Head of Network         Strategy, Global Manufacturing and Supply, commented: "Our work has           resulted in a range of new strategy tools with very practical           application.
These tools have helped in important decision-making           areas in our supply chain that have enabled GSK to drive business           performance in manufacturing and supply chain, and commercially.
We           estimate that this work has underpinned investment decisions affecting           more than GBP50m of investment, and supported the development of our           new product capability supporting revenue in excess of GBP500m.
"[8]        Caterpillar has worked with ECS throughout 2008-13.
The         research on optimising global manufacturing networks has underpinned an         enterprise-wide strategic process of aligning manufacturing networks         with projected sales, generating improved return on production-related         assets and increased enterprise synergies.
The Manager of Global         Production Network Planning comments: "We are one of the world's           largest manufacturers, with sales approaching USD50bn, and the main           reason for starting this process was to secure the long-term           optimisation of our production network".
Since 2008 this approach         has been used in all business divisions and serves to guide and align         all Caterpillar's investment regarding the future footprint.
This         process guides Caterpillar's annual multi-billion-USD capital spend         through coordinated investments across the vertically integrated         company.
[9]        Wavin (a leading supplier of plastic pipe systems with over 40         plants across Europe) and ECS worked together in 2009/10 to apply the         research on optimising global manufacturing networks, resulting in a         strategy covering development of clear plant roles and guidelines for         ongoing investment.
One particular area of focus was optimising the         trade-off between exploiting low-cost labour and investing in automation         in legacy high-cost country plants.
The project resulted in an advanced         analysis tool, based on the research, which was used to guide decisions         on production location and investment programmes.
Wavin's Executive         Director of Supply Chain Operations described the project's impact in         2012: "This was a major strategic thrust aimed at developing and           implementing the right supply and manufacturing footprint to achieve           operational and service leadership within the Wavin Group.
As a           result, we are running an investment program of EUR8-10m per year for           3-5 years to implement the desired footprint as designed.
The           estimated repeating annual cost-savings achieved to date are EUR3-5m.
"[10]        Electrolux (a EUR12bn-turnover global leader in household         appliances selling more than 40 million products to customers in 150+         markets every year) conducted a collaborative programme with ECS in         2012-13, applying the research on optimising global manufacturing         networks through strategy workshops with senior managers across 4 global         product lines, with results being aggregated to form an enterprise-level         global footprint strategy for the board.
The outcome will guide         investment in the future footprint over the next 3-5 years, expected to         be in the order of 3.5 Bsek (EUR400m), where the targeted cost savings         are in the order of 1.3 to 1.6 Bsek (EUR180m) annually.
The SVP of         Global Manufacturing Operations at Electrolux comments: "This project           forms a major part of our corporate business strategy and will help to           guide the optimisation of our footprint of over 45 plants around the           world.
This will drive structural changes in terms of cost reduction           and responsiveness to customers which will underpin our future           competitive differentiation.
"[11]        BAE Systems used the network configuration and capability tools         in 2010-11 to analyse the current and future role of the Engineering         Function of the Military Air and Information (MAI) Business Units, in         order to determine their potential role as part of an evolving network         over the next ten years.
The network design tools developed by the DoEng         provide a structured approach to developing industrial capability,         showing how the proactive reconfiguration of the network can shape         future engineering and industrial capability across the         design-build-service-support operation.
