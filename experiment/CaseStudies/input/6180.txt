     The financial crisis has provoked intense interest in how economies and       financial systems work.
Werner's research has actively engaged with this       issue from the highest level of policy-making to the general public.
Werner's book New Paradigm in Macroeconomics (2005) has sold       17,000 copies in its English and Japanese editions.
Tobias Hoschka, Head       of Asian Research at McKinsey and Company called it "A must read for       economists and finance professionals."
[5.1]     His other book Where Does Money Come From?
(first edition 2011,         second edition 2012) has sold 3,300 copies so far and is now       included as a core text on a City University undergraduate banking and       finance course.
[5.2] Professor David Miles of the Bank of       England's Monetary Policy Committee said "The way monetary economics and       banking is taught in many &#8212; maybe most &#8212; universities is very misleading       and what this book does is help people explain how the mechanics of the       system work."
[5.2] The book has been widely cited in the press,       including by the Financial Times (20/1/13).
Werner's work has also been used to manage two award-winning UCITS       investment funds.
In 2008, Profit Global Macro Fund AGmvK and Global Macro       Trust [5.3] were formed and adopted the latest version of Werner's       credit creation methodology as the core element of their portfolio       management.
In terms of cumulative monthly returns, performance for both       funds between June 2008 and December 2012 has been as good or has exceeded       those of FTSE100 and HFRI Fund of Funds Index [5.4].
This has led       to financial benefits for investors &#8212; recognised in 2009, when Profit       Global Macro Fund won silver in the 'Global Macro SHF: Germany Hedge Fund       Award' [5.5] and its 2012 naming as a 'Top 10 UCITS Macro Hedge       Fund' [5.6].
In 2013 Global Macro Trust was shortlisted for an       'HFMWeek European Hedge Fund Performance Award' [5.7].
In November 2010, Werner submitted evidence based on his QTC to Britain's       Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), pointing out the need for bank       regulation to reflect the role of banks as creators of the money supply [3.8].
The ICB recommendations formed the basis for UK government policy on       banking reform.
HM Treasury has confirmed that ICB Commissioners paid       attention to Werner's evidence and that "the final report was informed by       Mr Werner's submission amongst others" [5.8].
Werner had       previously been in touch with Treasury in order to influence policy [5.9]     Werner's work on credit creation is heavily cited in 'The Chicago Plan       Revisited', the 2012 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report arguing that       banks should no longer be allowed to create new money in the form of       credit in connection with their lending activities [5.10].
This       IMF paper has been much cited in the national and international media,       such as in the Daily Telegraph on 21 October 2012.
Werner organised the first European Conference on Banking and the Economy       (ECOBATE 2011) with Lord Adair Turner, Chairman of the Financial Services       Authority and ECOBATE 2013 with Vince Cable as keynote speakers.
Each       conference was attended by over 200 members of the public, local business       and government representatives, policy activists and politicians, and has       called for specific changes to bank regulation policy.
Lord Turner has       confirmed that Werner's work has been an important influence on FSA policy       and on the deliberations by the international Financial Stability Board,       both of which Lord Turner chaired from 2008 to 2013.
[5.11]     Since 2011 Werner has been a member of Handelsblatt's 'ECB Shadow       Council' &#8212; a forum of 15 top European economists whose views on monetary       policy decision are regularly published in the paper, which also nominated       him as one of four `economists of the year' and frequently cites him [5.12].
Leading UK economist Tim Congdon compared Werner and his invention of       `quantitative easing' to Keynes (Economic Affairs, October 2012).
Recent articles by Werner were published in The Financial Times       (5/3/2013), The Economist (15/06/2013, 1/07/2013, 14/09/2013), The         Guardian (10/2/2012, co-writer Caroline Lucas MP), The Central         Banking Journal (10/5/13, with subscribers in 130 countries, 120       central banks) and Frankfurter Allgemeine (10/9/12 and 4/10/12) [5.13].
His research has been cited, among others, in the Daily Telegraph       (26/10/2012, 17/12/2012, 22/01/2013), profiled in South Korea's JoongAng         llbo daily newspaper (2/12/2009), Greece's Naftemporiki (5/09/2011)       and Boerse Online, one of the largest-circulation German       stock-exchange journals (25/11/09).
His contribution to QFinance is the       most widely read in the volume [3.4].
His YouTube interviews have       received over 34,300 hits in total (2011-07/2013) [5.14].
Werner       is regularly asked to comment on economic news including UK Banking and       Regulation (BBC News, 2/8/12 BBC World Service 30/8/11), Quantitative       Easing (The Guardian 12/07/12, Fundweb 13/4/12) and the LIBOR probe       (Bloomberg, 26/6/12, 2/3/12 and 21/2/12).
His professional publications       influence thinking in the business world (Chartered Banker, June 2013;       Local Council Review, Summer 2013).
The Bank of England's `Funding for Lending Scheme' of 13 July 2012 was       predicated on a core tenet of QTC, as it aims to "incentivise banks... to       boost their lending to... the `real economy' " (BoE Quarterly Bulletin       2012Q4) [5.15].
Only Werner's work had previously argued for such       a disaggregation of bank credit, and the Bank used the same method to       calculate the data series defined as `credit for the real economy' as       Werner had recommended for the UK [3.5] and submitted to the Bank       in July 2011.
