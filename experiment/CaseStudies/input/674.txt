     Process of Dissemination       Presentation of initial study at Universiteit van Leiden, Jan. 26, 2005.
The HAP and the Lee et al., (2010) paper were included in SiRCHESI       newsletters (2010, 2011,       2013) disseminated via their website, office and www.fairtradebeer.com       and www.beergirls.org.
Research also disseminated at SiRCHESI`s annual conferences and       international academic       conferences.
The research detailing the beer sellers` situation and health       risks have informed two       SOMO (Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, Amsterdam)       reports.
Two websites       www.beergirls.org and www.fairtradebeer.com       are informed by this research project and provide       information about the beer sellers` situation.
In addition, www.beergirls.org       provides a memorial list       and a page on the HAP including quotations from former beer sellers who       have undertaken the       programme; www.fairtradebeer.com       aims to encourage brewers to take more responsibility for the       beer sellers.
Who has benefitted?
30 former beer sellers have benefitted from the Hotel Apprenticeship       Programme (HAP).
By end of 2011 over 10,600 people had taken part in the peer education       outreach programme.
Participants are beer sellers and members of the wider community in Siem       Reap.
Interns (3 in       2012, up to 12 planned for 2013).
Interns receive a 14 day intensive       programme of hands-on field       work.
How have they benefitted?
The HAP delivers Khmer literacy, conversational English, education on       health risks and related       behaviours and training in hotel industry skills (with paid placements in       a hotel).
Lee et al., (2010)       evidences quantitative and qualitative data showing that former beer       sellers who have taken the       HAP showed significant improvement in health-related knowledge,       specifically, how condom use       could prevent HIV/AIDS transmission and that drinking alcohol had adverse       effects on their health.
The drinking of, on average 1.2 litres of beer per night was reduced to       zero and HAP trainees       reported no longer engaging in sex work.
In addition, they reported       increased job aspirations.
Interviews also demonstrated that the programme has provided the women       with a sense of       empowerment as they take up more valued positions within the local       community.
Quotes from       interviews with trainees illustrate the positive impact HAP has had on       their lives:       "In the beer garden is no good job.
I have many problems when I drink a       lot of beer and I have no       empowerment.
Look down on me from the guests.
Not safe, not secure and no       respect.
In the       hotel is a good job.
In the hotel I have good knowledge and good skill and       stable income,       supported by society.
In the future I want to work for an NGO and help the       women in Cambodia."

During the period 2004 - 2009       it interviewed more than 700 beer sellers.
The SiRCHESI interviews with       beer sellers were       conducted either in the workplaces or during health workshops" (2010 p.       8), and Staffordshire       University is mentioned in a footnote to the report.
The SOMO 2012 report       refers to SiRCHESI`s       research in the 2010 report.
SiRCHESI`s newsletters report that by the end       of 2011 over 10,600       people had been part of this programme and about 12,000 by end of 2012. www.fairtradebeer.com       received 280 and www.beergirls.org       received 51,621 new visits (Jan 2009 to Dec 2012) evidencing       that people are accessing this information.
International impact is       demonstrated via visitors to       websites from countries including UK, Australia, China, Hungary, Canada,       US, Singapore,       Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia, India, Kuwait, Thailand, Ireland,       Slovakia, Japan, Korea, South       Africa, Sweden, and Indonesia).
The project has also received       international press coverage       (including in Cambodia, US and Sweden).
Between 2009 &#8212; March 2012 there       have been several       press reports published (see below) and two radio interviews associated       with this project.
