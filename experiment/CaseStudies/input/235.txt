     a) Health and Welfare.
The Irish government provided exclusive access to samples to enable       analysis of the impact of oral vaccination on shedding in a natural       population of badgera.
Data derived from sample analysis were       used to determine shedding and infectivity during the vaccine trial.
This       established the efficacy of the oral vaccine, which could be suitable for       distribution in food bait.
The group has trained vets in Tanzania to use the methodology to test       shedding in cattle.
A letterb from the Head of Vet School,       Sokoine University of Agriculture confirms that the assay is used to       monitor M. bovis load in wildlife in the National Parks of Ruaha       and Serengeti, and cattle in adjoining areas.
The current UK Governmentc will consider adopting this assay       in 2013 as it is unique in providing quantitative, highly specific and       sensitive analysis of infection loads (Secretary of State for Environment,       Food and Rural Affairs made two visits for detailed discussions and will       support its use).
The assay is in use for monitoring faecal shedding in wild boar and       cattle, and to detect environmental contamination.
b) Decisions by a regulatory authority have been informed by the         research     The assay is in use by VisaVet (European Centre for Veterinary Health, EU       Agency) to monitor bTB in wild boar and red deerd, and in       Tanzania by vets monitoring shedding in cattle herds on the border area       with the Ruaha wildlife parkb.
Recently DEFRA held a workshop       at AHVLA (April 2013) and a group of scientists, including the team from       the University of Warwick, participated in a discussion to establish which       methods were most specific, sensitive and useful to detection of bTB in       wildlife.
The molecular assay of the University of Warwick's team was       selected as the test of choice to detect shedding and to track       environmental contamination.
This test will be used by Defra.
c) Public awareness of health risks or health benefits has been raised     Farming cooperatives such as the Conservative Rural Affairs Group in the       UKe contacted us as a result of media interest following Prof.       Wellington's BBC interviews during the past 4 years (latest BBC Midlands,       March 2013).
In terms of benefits to wildlife conservation, in addition to the work in       Tanzania, the assay has been used to monitor bTB in African buffalo (Syncerus         caffer) in South Africa in collaboration with the Mammal Research       Institute, University of Pretoria; Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Mtubatuba; and       the Faculty of Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University.
The group in       Stellenbosch have an interest in monitoring human faeces, particularly in       neonates in Stellenbosch hospital.
The bTB status of cattle and       environmental contamination is a major source of infection in Africa, as       raw milk is consumed and this can lead to TB transfer to humans if cattle       are infected.
Public awareness of bTB infection in badgers in the UK is acute and the       group from the University of Warwick liaises with the UK Badger Trust to       demonstrate how the assay and the team's research are providing important       parameter values to improve mathematical models of disease transmission       and control.
This is particularly relevant at present as culling is taking       place alongside vaccination in the UK.
d) Animal Health and welfare has been enhanced     The method benefits animal welfare, as the assay is non-invasive and       provides monitoring of disease status in wildlife without the need for       trapping, anaesthesia, or any kind of trauma that results from other       methods, all of which are invasive.
e) Impacts on public policy and services            Policy debate has been stimulated and politicians have been made aware         of the importance of shedding in relation to infectivity and its control         by vaccination.
Debate was stimulated in both the National Assembly in         Wales (14/02/2007) and English parliament (meetings with Secretary of         State for Agriculture 03/05/2006 and with Secretary of State for         Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 10/01/2013 and 18/07/2013) about the         use of the `Warwick test' to determine levels of environmental         contamination, the extent of faecal shedding and risks presented to         cattle.
There is possibility of new technology being adopted; for example,         through Government encouragement of UK farmers to take responsibility         for biosecurity.
Discussions have focused on the implementation of         testing for environmental contamination at the farm scalec.
The quality, accessibility, acceptability or cost-effectiveness of a         public service is likely to have improved.
The assay provides the least         expensive method of monitoring bTB in badgers and will contribute to         effective bTB control in the future in combination with vaccination and         limited strategic culling.
Cage trapping is about four times more         expensive than the PCR tests.
f) Impacts on practitioners and services            Training of vets has been influenced by the research; the new         methodology has been taught to vets (5) in Tanzania and at the AHVLA in         the UK, and staff (4) at VisaVet in Spain.
The assay represents an         improvement in disease monitoring as current practices for wild life         rely on time consuming and more expensive cage trapping, tranquilizing         and sampling blood for immune assays.
Practitioners and professionals have used our research methodology in         conducting their work.
For example monitoring shedding in African         Buffalo, which skin tested positive.
Monitoring cattle and goats in         Tanzania to detect which herds have a hire prevalence of bTB, current         prevalence of shedding is 12% over 6 villages with a range of 24.6%.
