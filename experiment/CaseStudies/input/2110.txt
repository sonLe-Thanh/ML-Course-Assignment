     4.1 Decision making in local authorities and public         agencies     4.1.1 One of the most significant applications of applied policy       work of this type has been on decision making in local authorities.
This       has ranged from assisting local authorities and associated agencies in       developing approaches to constructing and maintaining multi-disciplinary       teams to respond to the requirements of ECM or to cultivate new ways of       working for teachers, sports coaches or fire-fighters.
As such, it has       offered a perspective for decision makers in areas where there is a lack       of precedent.
Developing new ways of working in environments external to       the authority can help to save time and money and to break down blockages       and delays in embedding policy.
4.1.2 Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service &#8212; The research       team's partnership work with Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service and a series       of HEIF Knowledge Transfer projects totalling &#163;80,000 between 2008 and       2013, was instrumental in the University of Chester's invitation to be       involved in the EU Framework 7 FP7 Population Alert Project.
The project,       involving 8 European partners which will commit &#163;1.4 million over three       years to investigate inter-professional and inter-cultural responses to       major crises.
CFRS have seconded a Senior Research and Development Officer       to work collaboratively with Hulme and McKay in developing       the research and embedding its outcomes in a review of management systems.
4.1.3 Developing Knowledge for Policy Implementation on         Multi-professional Working the work of Hulme and Cracknell       was instrumental in the University of Chester hosting the North of England       Education Conference in 2009, which was addressed by the then Secretary of       State for Children Families and Schools, Ed Balls.
The conference featured       master classes in decision making for Directors of Children's Services.
10       DCS from across England took part.
HEIF KT funded projects workshops on developing policy responses for         multi professional working in 2011/12, addressed by Maggie Atkinson,         Children's Commissioner for England and Professor Helen Gunter,         University of Manchester.
The Commissioner acknowledged the importance         of our event in the co-constructed knowledge in preparing the children's         workforce.
The Unit's work with local authorities attracted a workshop within the         ESRC Area Based Initiatives.
Addressed by Professors Mel Ainscow and         Alan Dyson, Manchester, the focal point was the co-ordination of local         authority and agency work in developing effective urban policy.
4.2 Professional Training / CPD     4.2.1 A further area of significant impact is on professional       training, particularly where there is a need to enhance professional       knowledge.
Hulme focused on working across boundaries, Garratt's       work on safeguarding is responding to significant areas of policy change.
The work of the team has impacted on the structure and content of training       for teachers and social workers at the University via the following       events/research trajectories:     4.2.2 Learn Together Partnership 2008-9 with Wirral MBC, featuring       collaboratively designed training for multi-professional leaders in       building multi-professional teams.
4.2.3 Two ESRC TERN funded workshops, in 2009 and 2010, on       embedding multi-professional working in teacher education.
These featured       contributions from Michael Eraut, Jean Murray and others.
The latter       featured work developed by Hulme in conjunction with teacher educators at       the University of Chester.
This work influenced the shape of research       training in post graduate teacher education at Chester     4.2.4 A further two HEIF funded workshops (in 2012 and March 2013)       on multi -disciplinary work with children and Young People &#8212; with a focus       on hybridity in coaching and mentoring roles in training in teacher       education and social work were addressed by Prof Nick Frost and Professor       Marion Jones.
4.2.5 `Looking Beneath the Surface' &#8212; A Multi-Professional       Safeguarding Conference in May 2013 to provide opportunities for delegates       to explore inter-disciplinary/inter-professional practice.
4.2.6 The University has developed five successful Professional       Doctorate pathways, with a multi-professional focus attracting health,       social work and education professionals.
The focus has been on embedding       collaborative professional enquiry to develop the creation of new       knowledge for professional enquiry     4.3 International Impact     Hulme has contributed to the construction of international       perspectives on embedding multi-professional working.
His leadership of       the Education Health and Human Services SIG at the American Educational       Research Association (to which he offered a keynote paper at the AERA       Conference in Denver in 2010) has brought the opportunity to work with       senior scholars including Hal Lawson at OISE Toronto in exploring the       relationship between local and regional policy structures and       multi-professional training which has impacted on the content of training       for teachers and health workers in Canada.
