     Research led by Prof Franklyn and Dr Boelaert has had a significant       impact on clinical management ofthyrotoxicosis (over-activity of the       thyroid) and thyroid cancer.
This work continues to drive national and       international guidance, professional training and clinician decisions, as       well as those of patients, in the UK and beyond.
Thyrotoxicosis and its treatment with radioiodine       Obvious (overt) over-activity of the thyroid affects 5% of the UK       population.
Untreated, in addition to unpleasant symptoms, it is a       significant risk factor for cardiovascular disorders, especially the heart       rhythm abnormality atrial fibrillation (AF), as well as for osteoporosis       (thin bones).
Management is typically with anti-thyroid drugs, radioiodine       therapy or occasionally surgery.
Radioiodine is used to overcome the       hyperactivity of the thyroid gland, but in many cases induces       hypothyroidism, i.e.
under-activity of the gland, which requires careful       management with thyroxine as thyroid hormone replacement.
Prof Franklyn       and team's research has impacted upon:     Clinician awareness and national guidance regarding use of           radioiodine:            Highlighted and clarified the increased risks of vascular diseases         associated with thyrotoxicosis, influencing current guidance in the UK         and overseas in terms of recommending and hence driving earlier use of         definitive therapy with radioiodine to improve long-term prognosis         [1,2].
Driven current national guidance for the use of radioiodine in benign         thyroid disease (Franklyn co-author and Birmingham work explicitly         referenced [3] in guidance published 2007 which has driven practice         2008-13), which underpins safe and effective delivery of radioiodine         treatment in conjunction with Medical Physics Departments, and         subsequent follow-up of patients to promptly identify development of         hypothyroidism and to manage it with the correct dose of thyroxine.
Franklyn contributed to the 2011 Royal College of Physicians         multi-professional guidance statement on diagnosis and treatment of         hypothyroidism [4].
Training in the administration of radioiodine with associated cost           savings and patient benefit:       To support clinician training and maximise patient benefit from this work,       the team used their expertise to innovate in postgraduate medical       education nationally.
Franklyn led a team in 2006 that included the Royal       College of Radiologists, the Institute of Physics and Engineering in       Medicine and ARSAC (the government licensing body) to create the first       national curriculum and associated teaching and assessment materials for       consultant endocrinologists (specialists who manage patients with thyroid       problems) to acquire the knowledge and skills required for licensing by       ARSAC to administer radioiodine therapy (guidance issued in 2006 and       revised in 2011 [5]).
Franklyn and Boelaert developed novel educational       materials and have delivered teaching on this national course 2-3 times       per year for 264 attendees since 2008.
Importantly, over 50 consultant       endocrinologists from across the UK have been certified by ARSAC, with       support from their NHS Trust medical physics departments, through this new       training scheme, representing an increase in licensed endocrinologists of       35% since 2008.
This has had the specific beneficial impact of reducing       patient visits and NHS costs (estimated at &#163;223 per unnecessary oncology       clinic appointment) by eliminating the need for cross-referral of patients       between endocrinology and either oncology or nuclear medicine specialists       for radioiodine treatment, allowing better planning of timing of treatment       and follow-up and thus improving and simplifying the care pathway to the       benefit of both patients and clinicians [6].
Patient access to information about optimal treatment for           thyrotoxicosis:       The team has worked directly with patient and carer groups to disseminate       the findings of their work and to support patient awareness and       decision-making.
Franklyn was a Trustee (2008-11) of the British Thyroid       Foundation (the major UK patient and carer support group), contributing to       patient information literature, newsletters, website information (such as       the revised patient information on thyrotoxicosis developed by Franklyn       and Boelaert [7]).
They have also attended meetings of patient support       groups, sessions which are "highly regarded" and have resulted in       excellent patient and carer feedback, as testified by the British Thyroid       Foundation [8], who also commented that "We strongly support the         notion that the University of Birmingham Research Portfolio continues to         have significant impact on the care of patients with thyroid disorders."
Mild (subclinical) thyrotoxicosis and its treatment with radioiodine     Thyrotoxicosis is described as "subclinical" (or mild) when the measurement     of thyrotrophin (TSH) from the pituitary in the blood/serum is low but the     blood level of the actual thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) is normal.
This     combination of blood test results indicates the earliest stages of     thyrotoxicosis which can progress to obvious/overt disease, but importantly     has its own specific associated health risks.
Work on subclinical     thyrotoxicosis (also termed subclinical hyperthyroidism) led by Franklyn and     team has shown how common this disorder is, especially in the elderly and     how it is associated with vascular disorders and mortality, and has:            Been incorporated into current UK guidance [9],first published in 2006         and updated in a Lancet invited review in 2012 [1], which clarifies         current best practice in terms the role of treatment of subclinical         hyperthyroidism with radioiodine, which is now increasingly undertaken         in the UK and abroad;       Directly influenced international practice by being incorporated into         the American Thyroid Association/American Association of Clinical         Endocrinologists/US Endocrine Society consensus guidelines in 2004 [10],         which remain current and have driven US and international practice         2008-13.
Franklyn was the only invited overseas expert and consensus         guideline panel member;       Been incorporated into the most recent US guidance published in         2011/12 [2] directly citing Franklyn and her team's work          Thyroid cancer and adjunctive treatment with radioiodine       Thyroid nodules are very common, and can be identified by ultrasound       scanning in up to 50% of the population, though only around 5% of the       population have nodules that are noticed by patients or their doctors.
Up       to 10% of such nodules may be cancerous, thyroid cancer being the       commonest endocrine cancer with more than 2000 new cases each year in the       UK.
Birmingham work on radioiodine treatment has also extended to thyroid       cancer.
Surgery (thyroidectomy) is the initial treatment for thyroid       cancer, but radioiodine is used subsequently to destroy any remaining       thyroid tissue.
Much higher doses of radioiodine are used than in       treatment of thyrotoxicosis as described above.
These high doses require       significant hospital stays in isolation because of national radiation       protection regulationsfor the general population and high doses are       potentially harmful long-term in terms of risk of "second"/later       malignancies; high doses of radioiodine were regarded as the best option       to ensure ablation of all residual thyroid tissue.
Franklyn played a key       role in the development and delivery of the `HiLo' trial of "high" versus       "low" doses of radioiodine in thyroid cancer patients at relatively low       risk of later recurrence (who represent 40-50% of those diagnosed each       year), the trial results showing that low doses were just as effective as       high and caused fewer side effects (21% versus 33%), helping with quicker       recovery and shorter hospital stays (13% given low dose radioiodine in the       HiLo trial hospitalised for at least 3 days versus 36.3% for high dose).
These findings have already:            Led to reduction in the doses of radioiodine administered to those         whose thyroid cancer is at low risk of recurrence, this being a         significant proportion of those treated, as evident in our own local         tertiary centre guidance and practice.
In the year to October 2011 100%         of 93 radioiodine doses administered for "remnant thyroid ablation" in         the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham were "high" (3000 or 5500MBq) in         contrast to only 73% of 102 doses in the year to October 2012 and 62% of         97 doses in the year to October 2013 [11], a change which was         implemented as a result of the HiLo outcomes.
These changes represent a         saving of approximately 100 days of hospitalisation over a 2 year period         in this single centre.
More broadly for other centres adopting this         recommended change in practice it was estimated within the HiLo study         that there was a 24% cost reduction in care of patients treated within         the NHS from reduction in hospital days in isolation, as well as         associated reduction in days off work.
This work has been widely disseminated amongst clinicians and patients         through Cancer Research UK [12,13] and hailed as seminal results which         are directly changing clinical practice.
