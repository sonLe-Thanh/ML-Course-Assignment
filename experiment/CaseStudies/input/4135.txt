     The impact derives primarily from the research and analytical critique of       dominant approaches to       land policy that Whitehead published with Tsikata (2003), and developed       further in Whitehead       (2009) [see Section 3, R2].
These have influenced international policy       debates and the formulation       of most major global organisations, whether reflecting on gender, land and       agriculture [see Section       5, C1, C3, C4 and C5], or on gender and development more widely (e.g.
in       informing the World       Bank's World Development Report [C2]).
In addition, the findings from the       research were taken       forward in Ghana by Tsikata, where Sussex's collaboration was used to       achieve substantial       development-policy impact.
The central arena of impact has been in legal reform concerning land.
For       example Whitehead's       research is cited as a central analytical and evidential component in the       International Development       Law Organization's Community Land Titling initiative [C1].
This       intergovernmental organisation       offers legal expertise, resources, tools and professional support to       governments, multilateral       partners, and civil society organisations.
Whitehead's analysis of the       challenges of informal justice       systems to advance the women's rights is cited in their programmatic       summary (2013) Accessing         Justice: Models, Strategies and Best Practices on Women's Empowerment       [C1].
Similarly, Whitehead's analysis of the potential pitfalls of       decentralised land institutions for gender-equitable       participation and representation became incorporated into the UN FAO's       policy       deliberation, initially via their analysis of Statutory Recognition of         customary Land Rights in Africa       (pp.
28-33) [C3] and, through this, becoming incorporated into their       (2013) technical guide       Governing Land for Women and Men: A Technical Guide to Support         Achievement of Responsible         Gender-Equitable Governance Land Tenure [C3].
The critique also fed       into the European Report         on Development through a preparatory paper addressing land-based       investments for food, fuel and       other agricultural commodities, and ways to strengthen local land rights       [C4].
As Whitehead's analysis not only addresses and reframes understandings of       gender and land, but       sets this within wider questions of poverty and land, her work has also       been influential in relation to       policies making or advocating changes in legislative practice to make       justice more accessible to       the poor generally; to poor men as well as poor women.
This aspect of her       research was significant       to the World Bank's `Justice for the Poor' (J4P) programme in Kenya, for       example, with the       potential for land registration to undermine women's land rights informing       their Assessment of         Women's Access to Land Rights in Agricultural Communities in Kenya       [C5].
The significance of Whitehead's work is visible in national deliberations       in several sub-Saharan       countries, for example in the Bank of Namibia's deliberations on       `Unlocking the Economic Potential       of Communal Land,' where her work evidenced the problems for women of its       land titling [C6].
The impact of Whitehead's research can be discerned not only in general       policy, but also in       programmes implemented to improve the lives of the poor and marginalised.
For example, a World       Bank Evaluation [C7] provides clear evidence and insight into the way in       which Whitehead's       research transformed the somewhat fraught `Ghana Land Administration       Project'       (http://www.ghanalap.gov.gh/).
This project had as a mission to strengthen `land administration and       management ... through ... appropriate land administration laws and       regulations, capacity building       for Land Sector Agencies, Land Owners and relevant NGOs, and streamline       business procedures       within the Land Agencies'.
It began with a focus on land titling,       generating the problems anticipated       in Whitehead's analysis.
When it was restructured in 2008, however, the       mix of activities was       altered, in particular to include a small-grants programme, to promote       civil-society participation in       local land administration, advocacy and debate on land issues.
As the       World Bank (2013)       evaluation put it, `This was a belated concession to the counterweight       lobby: those who had       advocated early on for developing institutions outside the chieftaincy       orbit', citing Whitehead and       Tsikata (2003) [C7].
Whitehead and Tsikata had persistently questioned the       project for threatening       women's land access (and that of the poor) and Tsikata had since became a       member of the ISSER       (University of Ghana) team implementing a research and dissemination       workshop programme for       the Land Administration Project (LAP).
By 2013 there were at least 25       small grants funding civil-society       organisations that supported the rights of the poor and marginalised and,       drilling down       further, one of these civil-society organisations had addressed some of       the failings [C8].
Given that Whitehead's research was very directly questioning World Bank       land policy in general,       and in Ghana, this change in project policy is all the more significant.
It is notable that later World       Bank outputs cite Whitehead's broader critique of neoliberalism in their       deliberations and policy on       Gender and Development in their World Development Report for 2012 [C2].
