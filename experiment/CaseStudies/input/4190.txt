     We have had major success in publicising our research in the media, from       local radio and newspapers through to national TV appearances.
Highlights       of our UK national media presence are the SuperWASP showcase on BBC TV       "The Cosmos: A Beginner's Guide - Other worlds" with Adam Hart-Davis, four       appearances on the Sky at Night, and eight appearances on BBC Radio       4/5/World (typical audience figures 1 &#8212; 10 million for these appearances).
Fitzsimmons was the featured scientist on the BBC TV's Horizon Special "The         Truth About Meteors", after the Chelyabinsk meteor impact and has       been filmed for another Horizon broadcast on Comet Ison.
To increase the       public awareness of science in Northern Ireland we have made a focused       effort to engage with the local media (BBC and independent broadcasters)       to showcase our research highlights and related public events.
In total we       have had 51 appearances on BBC Northern Ireland (radio and TV), RTE       (Republic of Ireland National broadcaster) or other regional broadcasts.
These include the BBC Radio Ulster shows "Good Morning Ulster" and       "Evening Extra" and the BBC NI Newsline (the main 6:30pm TV news show).
These are the primary BBC news and magazine shows in the weekday morning       and evenings, with typical listening figures of 295,000 for the morning       and evening radio shows and 140,000 for TV.
Our research underpins these       appearances as our topics have broad societal interest.
We have       significantly raised the awareness of our place in the Universe through       the studies of planets around other stars, searching for hazardous       asteroids and assessing the Sun's affect on the Earth through solar       flares.
Combining our breakthrough results (Section 3) with a high profile       media appearance has allowed us to directly increase the numbers of people       attending our organised science events.
Our profile allowed us to attract a &#163;200k philanthropic donation from Dr.       Michael West to enhance our engagement with the public and increase       scientific awareness in this region.
This funds a public lecture series       and a research fellow who dedicates part of his time to public outreach.
The funding is a direct impact of our research and media profile.
Due to       our geographical position, we need to work harder than other UK centres to       get world leading scientists to visit here.
We initiated the Michael West       Lecture series to do exactly that and now run the most successful public       science lecture series ever in Northern Ireland.
Since 2008 our nine       lectures have attracted over 160 people per event.
Numbers have been       rising, with excellent feedback which evidences our successful engagement       with the public (Section 5).
Further initiatives have also arisen from the       Michael West fellowship and extra efforts in ARC.
These are as follows:            A partnership with the W5 Discovery Centre (Ireland's award winning         science and discovery centre at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast).
We         developed the "Planet Quest" exhibition, based on explaining the         multi-wavelength nature of modern astronomy, particularly highlighting         infrared radiation.
The exhibition showcases our high-profile research,         as well as some personal stories, to illustrate to the public that world         leading, technology driven research is happening in Belfast.
School and         summer-school groups are brought to the exhibition, which ends with a         game of infra-red laser-tag, based in an alien planet setting.
The         exhibition ran March-September 2012, and attracted 26,400 visitors.
We         are STEMnet ambassadors at W5 and have hosted talks, question and answer         sessions and hands-on building games (aimed at Key Stage 3 pupils).
We         have further supported W5 through creation of astronomy CPD materials         and a centralized web resource for secondary school physics teachers         (Section 5; Source 9).
We host, support and sponsor bi-monthly meetings of the Irish         Astronomical Association (IAA) at Queen's which brings in around 80         people each meeting.
ARC staff regularly give lectures and use our         influence (and financial resources) to bring in speakers from Britain         and Europe.
We regularly arrange for our research collaborators to spend         more time at Queen's in order to give lectures to the Society and to         provide the public with talks that they would otherwise not have access         to.
We sit on the IAA Council and advise on speakers, joint events and         activities.
In addition to lectures we have hosted science events attracting large         audiences: "Jupiter Watch" as part of the BBC's Stargazing live in         January 2012 (600 people) and January 2013 (800 people).
The Large         Hadron Collider exhibition in 2013 attracted over 1000 schoolchildren         and members of the general public.
Two related lectures and a Caf&#233;         Scientifique evening attracted another 700.
Astronomy lectures and presentations at the following annual events:         (i) QUB Horizons in Physics (which attracts around 400 Year 11-12         students per annum), (ii) Physics Open Days (around 200 Y13 students),         (iii) Physics Teachers Conference (about 50 Physics teachers from         schools in Ireland).
Talks based specifically on our research described         in Section 2 is in high demand in these outreach events for school         children.
Talks at schools, mostly at secondary level but also at primary level         (we actively take part in STEPS (Source 4)), either in the         classroom or at QUB.
ARC staff deliver a total of about 40 talks         annually to pupils.
We also provide these presentations to amateur         astronomical clubs and societies, as well as further education colleges,         which are given typically 12 times per year.
We collaborate with the         School of Education at Queen's to deliver projects in astronomy and         space science in Schools and public libraries.
Over the REF Period we         have had projects with 20 schools to develop science podcasts and         science journalism.
In any one year, we typically reach an audience of         around 3000-5000 pupils.
In summary we have an active outreach programme aimed at popularising       science, physics and astronomy particularly in N. Ireland.
The impact has       been a major increase in the appearance of scientists in the media in this       UK region, but also a direct and tangible increase in the number of school       students taking physics further.
Between 2008 and 2012 we have seen an       increase in the number of UCAS applications from Northern Ireland students       to physics based courses across the UK of 71% (acceptances up by 56%).
This is an impact not just in applications to Queen's but applications       from NI students to all UK HEIs.
In Queen's itself we increased       applications by 80% from 272 (in 2008) to 491 (2012).
This increase       coincides directly with our increase in our public and schools engagement       efforts and we believe the impact of our research has directly led to this       societal change and increase in the desire of the NI school population to       study physics further.
