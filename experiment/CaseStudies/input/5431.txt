     WestCHEM develops software to support high-throughput systems       At the same time that the precursor to PolySNAP, the SNAP-1D software       package, was being       developed at WestCHEM to facilitate an integrated approach to full x-ray       powder-diffraction pattern       analysis, the pharmaceutical industry was developing automated       crystallisation systems using       robotics, and was beginning to generate large volumes of one-dimensional       diffraction patterns.
However, there was no software available to process, classify, and       visualise such data.
PolySNAP       was written under contract from Pfizer specifically to address this       problem.
It was the first software       to do this and used novel statistics and visualisation methods.
Data       visualisation is a vital       component of handling large amounts of data.
With PolySNAP, time       expenditure was reduced from       days to seconds for &gt;100 data sets.
It is an almost impossible task to       classify large data sets       without these techniques and so any investment in the new robotic hardware       would have been       pointless.
The software was described by one Pfizer employee as "like       having a new spectroscopic       method made available".
A confidential list of PolySNAP users up to 2010       is available, which       contains 72 users with commercial licences (Source 2).
The software was       the property of Glasgow       University until 2010 when Professor Gilmore retired, at which time it was       sold to Bruker.
PolySNAP supplied worldwide with Bruker diffractometers       Bruker purchased the rights to the program from Pfizer in 2002-2003 for ca.
&#163;125k (the same as       the original cost to Pfizer) and started to market PolySNAP commercially       under licence from       Glasgow University (Source 1).
Until 2010, license fees to the University       totalled &#163;84,164 (from       2008 &#163;37,894) (Source 3).
Bruker continued to develop this software and       Gilmore set up a limited       company partly for this purpose (Allander Science Ltd.) and continues to       act as a consultant to       Bruker.
Dr Dong was employed full-time by Bruker during the assessment       period.
The       development of PolySNAP also led to a free computer program called dSNAP       that uses the same       ideas to classify and visualise the results of searches on the Cambridge       Structural Database (see       below).
New versions of the software were released: PolySNAP-2, PolySNAP-M, and       the latest PolySNAP-3.
PolySNAP-3 is unique in that it allows data from multiple sources,       techniques or data collection       strategies to be incorporated into the analysis.
For example, data from       powder diffraction can be       combined with differential scanning calorimetry and Raman data to give a       combined analysis and       more accurate classifications of samples [5, 6].
This method is proving so       important that Bruker are       currently extending it to include x-ray fluorescence data in the new       releases of PolySNAP.
It saves       money because it releases the time of highly paid scientific staff and it       is also objective, avoiding       the risk that exists with this sort of data that interpretation can become       subjective.
The relationship between Bruker and the University continued until 2010       when Prof Gilmore       retired.
At that point, Bruker paid the equivalent of two years' license       fees (&#8364;30k) to purchase the       software outright.
PolySNAP continues to be a part of the company's       development plan (Source 4).
Current list price when PolySNAP is purchased separately is &#8364;2,700, and       approximately 120 have       been sold since 2004, while Bruker also offers another version, m-SNAP, at       a list price of &#8364;5,000.
PolySNAP continues to be sold in combination with all Bruker x-ray powder       diffractometers.
PolySNAP utilised across industry and education       Although the impact beyond the sale of the software is very difficult to       quantify, the beneficiaries of       this software are many:            The pharmaceutical industry: Most large pharmaceutical companies use         PolySNAP: Novartis,         AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Roche, Syngenta, Sanofi Aventis, and many smaller         companies.
It         dramatically reduces both the timescale and the reliability of sample         screening allowing even         very large datasets (&gt;100,000 samples) to be pre-screened in minutes         to find the subset of         patterns most relevant to a given target.
Prior to PolySNAP, such         searches would have used         reduced patterns in which the powder data are presented as a small set         of intensities and         positions for the top 5-10 peaks.
PolySNAP was the first program to use         the full measured data         in all its analysis steps.
High-throughput data are of poor quality and         using traditional reduced         patterns is ineffective at best and often worthless.
Mining industry: e.g., companies such as Anglo Platinum and Mintek in         southern Africa, where         PolySNAP software is used to assess the quality of ore samples prior to         processing into pure         metals, and to group huge quantities of materials of different origin.
The software allows the         companies to carry out rapid comprehensive assessments of ore         variability in terms of bulk         mineralogical composition and facilitating decision-making.
Materials Science: identifying new materials, studying phase changes         with temperature and         pressure, simple quantitative analysis of mixtures.
Forensic science: e.g.
South African Police Force have used PolySNAP         to match samples from         crime scenes with a database of known samples.
It is especially valuable         when used with         mineral theft.
A Principal Scientist, Materials Science, at AstraZeneca explains the       value of PolySNAP (Source       5):     "Identification of a suitable solid form for development of a         crystalline material still remains a         great challenge for the pharmaceutical industry.
Due to the different         physical properties (e.g.,         dissolution, stability) of different polymorphs, extensive screening is         performed during the         early stages of development to ensure the solid form architecture of the         proposed molecule         is fully understood and there have been a number of costly issues where         compounds have         had to be reformulated due to changes of form after launch.
In screening for different solid forms, both manual and automated         technologies have been         utilised and a number of high throughput platforms have been developed         that utilise common         analytical techniques, e.g., PXRD for analysis of solid form.
These         techniques yield large         quantities of analytical data which is quite difficult to comprehend and         can rapidly overwhelm         operators with excessive data.
[...] PolySNAP utilises a wide range of         mathematical         techniques to help manage large data sets and successfully guides the         scientists into not         only the presence of the different forms but, more importantly, how         these forms have been         manufactured and hence how they can be controlled.
It provides a range         of pattern-matching         methods and allows the user to have full control over understanding the         date avoiding `black         box' type results leaving the operator in control and reducing large         datasets to a much         smaller number of samples which require interpretation by scientists.
The results from         PolySNAP allow rapid identification of `safe' areas of working (e.g.,         solvents, temperature,         concentrations, etc.)
and where further understanding is required.
Most         recently, the extra         dimension of adding the capability of other analytical data (e.g.,         spectroscopic) has provided         further confidence and opportunities in the pattern matching."
A one-month trial version of the PolySNAP software is available from       WestCHEM, accompanied by       a tutorial and trial data (Source 6).
Visualising the Cambridge Structural Database with dSNAP       The WestCHEM research that led to PolySNAP also underpinned a free       computer program called       dSNAP (Source 7) that classifies and visualises the results of searches on       the Cambridge       Structural Database (CSD), a repository of over 500,000 crystal structures       derived from x-ray and       neutron diffraction.
The CSD is by far the most important source of       structural data for small       molecules, but while it is easy to search this database, it can be a       problem to interpret the results.
dSNAP is an important tool for this.
dSNAP simplifies the problem using       the same methodology as       PolySNAP: it clusters the search results into groups that are very similar       and thus allows the user       to treat the group as a single entity so reducing the number of structures       that need to examined.
Additional tools are provided to assist in this.
A confidential list of       166 licensed dSNAP users up to       2010 is available (Source 2).
