     Link between research and impact       The CTU model was the first intra-oral model to measure tooth-wear [1],       with development and       refinement [2, 3, 4, 5] revolutionising research methodologies on       reduction of tooth-wear, and the       first to measure intra-oral tubule occlusion.
In 2010, world dental       leaders were invited to a DH       symposium in Geneva, with the consensus being that in situ erosion models       with an intra-oral       acidic challenge are the ideal [a].
Unilever commented that "the CTU       developed an intra-oral       appliance retaining human tooth tissue which was a breakthrough novel       technology in this area"       [b].
This research has enabled new desensitising toothpastes with proven       efficacy in DH pain reduction       to be licensed.
GlaxoSmithKline (Rapid Relief, Repair and Protect,       Pronamel) [c], Procter and       Gamble (Oral B Pro Expert/Health) [d] and Colgate Palmolive (Pro Relief)       launched products       between 2008 and 2012, having tested toothpastes using the intra-oral       model.
The Bristol       methodology has helped to protect teeth from tooth-wear and reduce pain       from DH worldwide.
Nature and extent of the impact       Since the introduction of the model [1], it has been employed by many       research groups worldwide       [e, f] and has had a huge impact on the evaluation of products for       tooth-wear and tubule occlusion.
The model permits products that are effective in the laboratory to be       tested in real-world conditions       to determine whether the theoretical results translate into real effects.
Best-practice product-testing       now consists of laboratory testing, clinical testing using the model and       randomised control trial       human pain studies, correlating methodologies to strengthen the       significance of the observed       results [5, 6].
Photographs of teeth showing occluded dentine tubules, taken following       research using the model,       feature in promotional and educational guidance for the public and dental       professionals, as well as       in sponsor' in-house training.
Television advertisements use graphics       illustrating occluded tubules       to explain the physical effect of the toothpastes and pain reduction.
The       sponsor companies use       this literature worldwide.
Professor West was invited to speak at 22 international symposia on DH       between 2007 and 2013       for GSK (18 symposia [c]), P&amp;G and Colgate-Palmolive and is on       advisory groups for GSK [c] and       P&amp;G. She was a keynote speaker at the launch of desensitising       toothpastes developed using the       CTU intra-oral model for Repair and Protect and Rapid Relief (GSK),       Pro-Relief (Colgate) and Oral       B Pro Expert (P&amp;G).
Industrial development benefits of the impact       Researchers now have the ability to develop products quickly and test them       in a reliable and       consistent way to show dentine tubule occlusion.
The model has been       adopted globally and used       by sponsors such as GSK [c], P&amp;G [d], Colgate and Unilever [b] at       international research sites.
GSK comments that "following this methodological development and       understanding, the Bristol       Clinical Trials Unit intra-oral appliance for in situ clinical trials, is       now routinely used to assess the       ability of toothpastes to block open dentine tubules" [c].
Professor West       has been influential in       changing industrial practice in product development, resulting in the       recent successful launch and       high global sales of desensitising toothpastes, affecting millions of       people worldwide [b, c, d, g, h,       i].
In Europe, over 40% of the population experience tooth-wear and DH       [j].
These new toothpastes       address this problem.
Commercial benefits of the impact to industry       Research on DH using the model, has underpinned science-led global       marketing with high sales of       Sensodyne toothpastes for GSK (Rapid Relief, Pronamel and Repair and       Protect) to relieve DH       pain [c].
GSK desensitising toothpastes are available in over 100       countries with a turnover in 2011/       2012 of &#163;1.7bn, making relief from sensitive teeth available to a global       population [c, g, h].
GSK       has recently relaunched Ribena ToothKind as Ribena Light, with low-erosive       drinks sales worth       &#163;1bn in 2011.
Sensodyne Rapid Relief was launched in 2010 and Sensodyne       Repair &amp; Protect in       2011.
The latter has attracted almost 2.3m households and is worth &#163;15.7m       of the UK sensitive-       toothpaste market [h].
It achieved a 4% share of the total toothpaste       market and became the       number one selling toothpaste in the first 16 weeks of sales [h].
Sensodyne product sales rose by       16% in 2011 and 13% in 2012, with strong growth in emerging markets such       as Africa, China and       India.
Similarly, Lucozade and Ribena sales were up by 10% in 2011 [g].
In       2012, Sensodyne       Repair and Protect became GSK's first billion-dollar brand [g].
Repair       &amp; Protect was awarded       Product of The Year for 2013.
Product of the Year is the world's largest       independent, consumer-       voted award for product innovation [h].
Similarly, the CTU's work with P&amp;G (2007-2010) led to the marketing       of an occluding product, Oral       B Pro Expert/Health - a desensitising paste with the ability to protect       tooth tissue from erosive acid       challenge and block dentine tubules [d, i].
P&amp;G have the       second-leading brand in desensitising       toothpaste, with a 20% share of the market, again benefiting millions of       people worldwide [d,i].
