     Professor Simms's work has served not only to inform policy-makers and       parliamentarians, but also to contribute to public awareness of a crucial       dimension of international politics, that of humanitarian intervention.
While his work has had particular resonance in debates about the Balkans,       it has also had a significant impact on thinking about the       responsibilities of governments to protect their own citizens, and in       certain circumstances those of other states.
The testimonials cited in Section 5 from senior practitioners inside and       outside the UK provide clear evidence for the claim that Simms' research       has had impact in policy-making circles For example the ex-Australian       Foreign Minister and Founder of the International Crisis Group says that       `Brendan Simms's book, and the debate that it generated, contributed       enormously to the perception among policy-makers in Europe and beyond that       terrible errors had been made in the Balkans, and to their determination       to ensure that experience was never repeated' (Source i).
The       ex-British Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina (1996-8), and then senior       member of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with responsibility for       ex-Yugoslavia, talks of `a significant practical impact' which continues       through debates with `immediate operational significance' such as Libya       and Syria, a view supported by a senior military intelligence officer (Sources         ii and iv), while a former speechwriter to David Cameron reports       that Unfinest Hour had been read by the prime minister and `at       least one other influential cabinet minister'.
It `had been such an       influence on the Prime Minister in his approach to intervention abroad,       especially in the run-up to Libya and with its indictment of Conservative       inaction' (Source iii).
Professor Simms is regularly invited to       give talks at parliamentary committee meetings, conferences, and seminars       at the Foreign Office on the conflict in Bosnia, on the British response,       on humanitarian intervention generally and on the associated doctrine of       the Responsibility to Protect.
He has also spoken to the Royal Military       Academy Sandhurst, the Ministry of Defence and the RAF's Air Warfare       Centre at Waddington.
His edited volume on Humanitarian intervention:         a history was launched in the House of Commons in April 2011 just       after the start of the Libyan war, an event chaired by Gisela Stuart M.P.
(Labour) and attended by more than one hundred people including many MPs       and ministerial advisors (27.4.2011).
The research also led to his       participation in the following panels where academics have the opportunity       to influence defence thinking:            Member of the Strategic Advisory Panel, Chief of the Defence Staff,         2010-13.
Member, Military Education Committee, Cambridge University, 2004-10.
The work of Professor Simms has not only been influential in the realm of       government and policy making, but has also been a key reference in public       debates about both the Bosnian tragedy and the balance-sheets of       humanitarian interventions (Sources i and ii).
Since publication       the first output from his research, the book Unfinest Hour: Britain         and the Destruction of Bosnia, has been regularly referred to in       newspaper articles and commentary on all sides of the political spectrum       in regard to British policies in Bosnia (Sources v, vi and viii)       and was warmly received in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
Largely as a       result of this work Simms was included in the Guardian's "top 300       British intellectuals" from 7 May 2011 (Source vii).
In 2012 he       participated in a panel on Britain and Europe at the Hay Festival,       attracting a large general audience, speaking there again in 2013 when he       also spoke at the Edinburgh and Cheltenham Literary Festivals.
He has been interviewed by the BBC 4, Sky Muslim Channel, Channel 4, BBC       World Service, RTE, and numerous Balkan radio programmes and written       numerous articles and reviews on Bosnia and humanitarian intervention for       the Evening Standard, Independent, Independent on Sunday, London         Review of Books, New Statesman, Observer, Spectator, Sunday Telegraph,         Sunday Times, The Times, Times Higher Educational Supplement, and       the Wall Street Journal.
On the occasion of the outbreak of the       Libyan war in 2011, which coincided with the publication of his edited       book Humanitarian Intervention: A History, he took part in a       discussion on BBC 4's `News Hour' with Professor Mark Mazower of Columbia       University on humanitarian intervention (27.4.2011).
