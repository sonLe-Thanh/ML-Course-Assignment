     The research has influenced the review of counter-terrorism legislation       in the UK between 2008       and 2013, at legislative and executive levels.
As the current Independent       Reviewer of Terrorism       Legislation explains: `Professor Walker's work &#8212; exemplified by his       authoritative Terrorism and the         Law, OUP 2011 &#8212; is without doubt the most influential of any       academic working in this       increasingly crowded field ... his work has a unique influence on the       formulation of policy' [A].
The Director General of the Home Office's Security and Counter Terrorism       Office stated       `[Walker's] research has undoubtedly influenced the development of counter       terrorist legislation,       during its passage through Parliament, Select Committee scrutiny and       through direct and indirect       engagement with Home Office policy officials' [B].
i) Influenced legislative debates on Counter-Terrorism Laws            During the passage of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 and the Coroners         and Justice Act         2009, the research into the treatment of terrorist detainees [5]         was utilised to lobby for         augmented oversight by a new inspector of terrorist detainees in police         custody.
This concept         was proposed in House of Lords debates by Lord Lloyd who stated 'The         amendment is based         almost word for word on Sir Louis Blom-Cooper's terms of reference, but         there are some         important additions, which have been suggested by Professor Clive Walker         of the University         of Leeds, who is the leading academic authority on terrorism' (Hansard         (House of Lords) vol         705, col.160, 4th November 2008) [C].
The government         conceded the argument, and new         inspections were established by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,         section 117.
Influence was exerted during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism Act         2008 through         research about the post-charge questioning of persons charged with         terrorist offences and         awaiting trial.
Professor Walker's arguments were recited by the then         chair of the Joint         Committee on Human Rights: 'In particular, [Lord Carlile] mentioned the         importance of judicial         supervision of the exercise of the power and the need to amend the code         to include protection         against repetitive or oppressive questioning.
... That view was shared         by the eminent         Professor Clive Walker and Professor Ed Cape [University of the West of         England], ....
They         both expressed their strong concerns about the need for a number of         detailed safeguards,         particularly because the situation is different after charge, when the         accused is in a         particularly vulnerable position compared with the position pre-charge'         (Hansard (House of         Commons) vol 477, col 189 10 June 2008).
The design of the regime was         then altered         considerably (reflected in the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, sections         22-27), by dropping the         prison governors as primary gatekeepers and by substituting court-based         checks.
ii) Contributed to Parliamentary Select Committees     Parliamentary impact has also sustained within select committees       inquiries:            In the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on the         Constitution on Fast-track           Legislation: Constitutional Implications and Safeguards (2008-09         HL 116) there are         references to Professor Walker's submissions on eight distinct topics         (paras.
65, 68, 72, 79,         143, 145, 159, 181) all of which concern the structuring and review of         legislation which deals         with emergencies, thereby reflecting the author's various works on         constitutionalism.
Following evidence given by Walker concerning post-charge question to         the Joint Committee         on Human Rights (Counter-Terrorism Policy and Human Rights (Eighth           Report): Counter-Terrorism           Bill (2007-08) HL 50/HC 199, 30 January 2008, paras.
29-36), the         Committee         commented at para.36: 'We found Professor Walker's evidence compelling         on the question of         the detailed safeguards which should accompany post-charge questioning.'
Official reviews have adopted an overall framework based on         'constitutionalism' as advocated         by Walker such as in his written and oral evidence to the Joint         Committee on the Draft         Detention of Terrorist Suspects in 2011 (Temporary Extension) Bills         2011].
His argument that         detention periods in excess of four days should be viewed as         extraordinary is repeated         verbatim (Report on the Draft Detention of Terrorist Suspects           (Temporary Extension) Bills           2011 (2010-12 HL 161/HC 893) para 19).
iii) Informed the Home Office's development and review of           Counter-Terrorism Laws     Influence on the Home Office has especially occurred through its       Independent Reviewer of the       Terrorism Legislation who produces annual reviews for the Home Secretary.
Examples include:            The research [4] has influenced the review of control orders, as         confirmed by the then         Independent Reviewer of the Terrorism Legislation [D] who states         that: `Following the Home         Secretary's letter set out in Annex 1, I have received the utmost         assistance from officials with         whom I have raised various questions about control orders.
In addition,         I have enjoyed         significant advice from others, notably Professor Clive Walker of Leeds         University.'
[E]         Walker's representations about the duration of orders helped to bring         about a change of mind         by the Reviewer, reflected now in the Terrorism Prevention and         Investigation Measures Act         2011, section 5, whereby orders must normally expire after two years.
Further influence is evident from the reports of the current         Independent Reviewer of the         Terrorism Legislation who stated that he had relied on Professor         Walker's work [3] in his First           Report on the Operation of the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc.
Act 2010         (Home Office, London,         2011) at para.1.15, and the Report on the Operation in 2010 of the           Terrorism Act 2000 and         Part 1 of the Terrorism Act 2006 (Home Office, 2011) at         para.1.22.
Professor Walker was specially invited to meet with the Home Office         review team in order to         discuss his submission to Lord Macdonald's review of counter-terrorism         in 2011 [F].
Executive         reviews now regularly commence with a statement of values along         `constitutionalist' lines [F].
Sustained influence over, and collaboration with, successive         Independent Reviewers of the         Terrorism Legislation has been uniquely formalised by a research         contract with the Home         Office as from 1 January 2012.
The current Independent Reviewer of the         Terrorism         Legislation has commented that '...
I am delighted that Professor Clive         Walker of the         University of Leeds has agreed to act as Special Adviser to the         Independent Reviewer.
In that         capacity he will ensure that I am aware of the wealth of research and         scholarship, across         several disciplines, that is most relevant to my responsibilities.
He         may also put his         considerable expertise to the service of specific projects, if so         requested' [G] (para.1.22).
iv) Played an important and direct role in equivalent           international reviews of Counter-Terrorism           Laws     The research [3] has been the principal commentary informing the       Australian debates on the       proposed emulation of the UK office of the Independent Reviewer of       Terrorism Legislation or of       UK legislation on executive control orders [H].
This work has been       followed in December 2012 by       an invitation to address a symposium of key stakeholders held at the New       South Wales Bar       Association, Sydney (see http://www.nswbar.asn.au/cpdattachs/Clive%20Walker.pdf       and Walker,       C., `The reshaping of control orders in the United Kingdom: Time for a       fairer go, Australia!'
(2013)       37 Melbourne University Law Review 143).
Key attendees were the       Australian Independent       National Security Legislation Monitor and the Chair of the Council of       Australian Governments       (COAG) panel to review counter-terrorism legislation.
Their reports issued       in 2013 by both make       reference to the impact of Professor Walker's research [I].
The       Australian Independent National       Security Legislation Monitor confirmed that `Terrorism and the Law       [3] (2011) ... was of special       importance in informing my review work given the influence of the UK laws       on the development of       Australia's CT [counter-terrorism] laws' [J].
