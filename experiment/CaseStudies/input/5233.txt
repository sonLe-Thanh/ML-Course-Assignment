     HHB67-Improved was the first pearl millet variety produced by DNA       marker-assisted-selection to reach farmers in India.
In 2005, it was       officially approved for cultivation in Haryana state, followed by       approval of its All-India release later that year.
Large quantities of       Breeder Seed of the parental lines of HHB67-Improved were       distributed by ICRISAT and Haryana Agricultural University in 2005-06 to       public and private seed agencies, sufficient to sow more than 50,000 ha       with Certified Hybrid Seed of HHB67-Improved during the 2006 rainy       season.
Provision of this initially free Breeder Seed to the seed industry       resulted in its widespread adoption in drier parts of Rajasthan and       Haryana, replacing the original HHB67 variety [5.1].
In 2008, large-scale seed production of affordable HHB67-Improved       was taken up in Nizamabad and Kurnool districts of Andhra Pradesh.
Seed       production has continuously increased, reaching 3491 t in 2010/11.
Over       1.1M packets of seed were produced that year and over 900,000 sold in       Rajasthan alone, demonstrating its growing, phenomenal rate of adoption by       the seed industry and farmers across North-Western India.
This replaced       the original HHB67 variety, the seed production of which had risen       from 81 t in 1991 to a peak production of 2835 t in 1999, but by 2008 was       no longer in the production chain because of increased susceptibility to       downy mildew [5.2].
By this time it had been effectively replaced by the       downy mildew resistant and higher yielding HHB67- Improved,       allowing farmers to continue to grow this unique very early maturing       hybrid.
Impact on measures of improved international food security,           increased production and economic value to farmers and their           families       In Rajasthan and Haryana states, the area of HHB67-Improved       cultivation increased from 47,000 ha in 2006, to 875,000 ha in 2011, an       increase from 0.2% to 4.4% of the total Indian pearl millet area in just 3       years [5.1].
Such vast expansions of growth reflect the popularity of the       new variety.
Based on an average farm size of 2 ha, supporting a family of eight       [5.3], HHB67-Improved has brought greater food security to       approximately 3 million people in North-West India, in particular       resource-poor farmers whose cultivation of the original variety HHB67       left their food security highly vulnerable to downy mildew.
Compared with       the original HHB67, HHB67-Improved provides larger grain       yields (about 10%), worth &#163;2.6M per year in central and western parts of       Rajasthan.
Its improved downy mildew resistance has prevented losses of       over &#163;7M: the expected costs in the first year of a major downy mildew       outbreak (assuming 30% loss in harvest from 550,000 ha, yielding 700 kg/ha       and a grain price of Rs 5/kg) [5.2, 5.4].
Compared with HHB67 and       other local varieties in Rajasthan and Haryana, HHB67-Improved       gave a net benefit of Rs 544M (&#163;6.5M) in 2011 alone [5.1].
The higher       yield and early maturity of this staple also released land for crop       diversification with sesame and food legumes.
Furthermore, HHB67-Improved       enabled farmers to continue with the advantageous practice of the       cultivation of a second crop, like wheat or chickpea, during the       post-rainy season, thus effectively transforming single-crop lands into       two-season multicrop fields.
This doubled cropping intensity provides       resilient farming systems, substantially increased income and improved       nutrition compared with systems based on the previously grown pearl millet       landraces [5.1, 5.4].
Commercial impact for those involved in seed production and           improved measures of gender equality       In addition to direct benefits to grain farmers, the production of hybrid       seed benefits a whole industry of irrigated seed producing farmers who, on       average, see 12 times higher net returns than rainfed grain and stover       farms.
In 2011, the production of HHB67-Improved seed gave a net       income of Rs 300M (&#163;3.6M) to the seed producers in Andhra Pradesh [5.1]       and further generated 186 person days per ha of employment, resulting in a       total of 900,000 person days of employment in 2011 alone, of which 45%       comprised women labourers [5.1, 5.4].
Women hired in seed production       account for twice the total labour days of men, demonstrating the improved       gender equality and significant increase in employment opportunities for       women in seed production regions and villages resulting from the improved       hybrid availability [5.1].
As seed production takes place at times and in       regions different to the main millet harvest, these benefits reach       additional households [5.3].
