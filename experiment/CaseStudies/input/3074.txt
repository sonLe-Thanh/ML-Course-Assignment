     The research programme on improving soil and foliar disease control in       greenhouse production       systems at Newcastle University between 2000 and 2013 has led to the       development of integrated       crop management protocols for the control of soil-borne and foliar       diseases in organic and soil-based       greenhouse crop production systems across Europe.
This has resulted in       increased yields       and reduced costs associated with soil disinfection and pest control in       greenhouse production       systems in the UK and Greece.
In addition to these benefits the reduction       in soil steaming       techniques has led to decreased emissions of carbon dioxide.
The impact of Newcastle research on organic production in the UK,         Greece and Crete     The UK produced 89,000 tonnes (t) of tomato and 66,500 t of cucumber in       2011 on approximately       330 ha of high value, environmentally controlled greenhouses (http://faostat.fao.org).
The       British Tomato Growers' Association [E1] state that "The         resistant rootstocks, suppressive         composts and (for some growers) chitin soil amendments identified in         the... [Newcastle research]         programme became part of the standard production protocols throughout         the UK organic         greenhouse production sector for tomatoes and indeed, most greenhouse         crops.
...all large scale         organic producers of tomatoes nowadays use grafted plants and         suppressive composts as a main         fertility/soil health input.
Also, virtually all soil association         registered organic producers have been         able to completely stop using soil steam disinfection to control soil         borne diseases" The research       has led to an estimated "...10-12% increase in marketable fruit yield         and a 10% reduction in         production costs, partly due to the omission of expensive soil         disinfection treatments..." The       improvements in production techniques are "...worth up to &#163;100,000/ha,         depending on the crop..."       and "...have helped to make large scale organic glasshouse production a         viable option to meet the         demands of the UK organic market..."     Greece produced 1,169,900 t of tomato and 174,700 t of cucumber on       approximately 23,000 ha       both in the field and greenhouses (mainly simple plastic greenhouses with       limited environmental       control) with most farms being smaller than 1 ha.
Before the Newcastle       research economic losses       were high (20-45% reductions in yield depending on the season) as a result       of both soil borne       diseases (corky root rot, Verticillium and Fusarium) and nematodes [E2:       Nafpaktos Greenhouses].
After the implementation of the Newcastle protocols there has been a "...15-35%         increase in         yield..." and a "...25% increase in profit margins (&#8364;25,000 per         ha/year), because of the increased         yield and reduced costs associated with soil disinfection and biological         pest control..." [E2]       Currently, "...more than 80% of farmers [in Greece] have implemented         all or parts of [the         Newcastle] new protocols."
In addition, the resistant rootstocks       identified in the Newcastle research       are also now being used by 10-15% of the conventional soil-based       greenhouse production industry       in Greece because of prohibition of the two most effective chemical soil       disinfectants (methyl-bromide       and chloropicrin) [E2].
The estimated value of reduced soil disease       control and pest       management in Crete is &#8364;110,000 per ha/year [E3].
The environmental benefits of the impact of Newcastle Research     The Newcastle research has negated the need for chemical and steam       sterilisation of soil in       greenhouse based production systems.
We estimate that the resultant       reduction in the use of       these techniques is between 8750 and 12500 kg of CO2 per ha of       greenhouse.
This estimate is       based on published data on the diesel fuel use of commercial soil steam       disinfection (3500-5000       litres per ha) and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the burning of       diesel fuel (2.5 kg per       litre of fuel) [E4].
In addition, by providing an effective, and       relatively inexpensive alternative       treatment to methyl-bromide, resistant rootstock/suppressive compost       treatments are also thought       to further reduce the use of this ozone-depleting soil disinfectant in       countries where it is still legally       used; however, this impact is difficult to quantify, due to a lack of       suitable statistics.
