     Peter Hill's research has had three main types of impact: first, the       research informed Hill's creation       of cultural artefacts (his performances, recordings, writings and       broadcasts) and helped preserve &#8212;       and in one case discover &#8212; musical heritage, all of which enriched the       cultural life of the general       music-loving public; second, shaping musical education and performance       interpretation of       Messiaen's music beyond the University of Sheffield, through piano       masterclasses, lectures,       writings and recordings; and, third, economic impact from performances and       recordings.
As described above, Hill's research into Messiaen's music led to new ways       of interpreting the       composer's work in relation to intra-musical processes (goal direction       versus stasis) and their       relationship with extramusical ideas and inspirations (the relationship       between the natural world       and its portraiture in Messiaen's music).
These new ways of thinking       impacted on Hill's creative       practice as a performer, both in terms of creating cultural capital &#8212;       specifically the performances       and reissued recordings that resulted from the research &#8212; and in terms of       the particular musical       expression that those performances take.
The manifestation of this       research in the form of Hill's       recordings and performances is particularly significant because neither       Messiaen nor his wife, and       primary interpreter, Yvonne Loriod, are alive anymore.
While there is a       `school' of followers       influenced by studying with Loriod, Hill was influenced by studying with       Messiaen rather than his       interpreter.
Hill's exhaustive studies with, and subsequent to, Messiaen       now means he has a       different but equally respected and highly acclaimed interpretation.
Hence, Hill's distinctive       contribution to cultural life comes from the way his research enabled him       to create distinctive       interpretations of Messiaen's music that are received as culture- and       life-enhancing.
Hill's performances and recordings are widely regarded as authoritative       interpretations and the       touchstone for future performers, as noted by reviewers: `Few pianists         have more authority in         [Messiaen's] music than Hill, who studied the Catalogue with the         composer ...
He plays it with a         fluency that extends far beyond mere technical accuracy and rhythmic         precision.
The pieces are         thus immediately far more than abstract technical exercises, but become         the richly coloured         portraits from nature that Messiaen intended ...' (Guardian,       2011).
In further evidence of this       cultural impact, his Messiaen recordings were first re-issued by Regis       Records as a 7CD set in       2002 (original recordings 1985-1994, Unicorn-Kanchana) and then in 2008       reissued again by       Brilliant Classics who chose Hill's version of the piano music for their       complete edition of       Messiaen's music.
Moreover, Hill has the distinction of three listings in       1001 Classical Recordings         You Must Hear Before You Die (Universe Publishing, 2008), including       one for Messiaen's       Catalogue d'oiseaux (original recording, 1988-90; reissued 2002 and       2008).
In addition his       recording of Catalogue d'oiseaux was named in The Times'       "The Classical Collection" (2008) as       the best recording of this work.
Hill's recordings and performances are       also a means by which this       musical heritage is preserved.
An extreme example of this is Hill's       discovery and interpretation of       Messiaen's previously unknown piano piece, La Fauvette Passerinette       (Subalpine Warbler), which       emerged during Hill's work in the Messiaen archive 2002-4 (reported in Gramophone,       31 July       2013), and was premiered by Hill in Sheffield, on 2 November 2013, with a       broadcast by BBC       Radio 3.
The impact of Hill's work on the wider public also comes through his huge       number and range of       public engagement activities which include masterclasses, lectures,       broadcast talks, discussions       and documentaries, journalism, and pre-concert talks.
The range and number       of events is       illustrated by Hill's schedule in Messiaen's centenary year (2008), which       included 12 broadcasts       (including a recital at the Messiaen Festival at La Grave, broadcast by       Radio France), 23 public       lectures (including Carnegie Hall, the Library of Congress, the British       Library and the Proms),       broadcast interviews and documentaries (including, `Debussy's year in       1912', `Messiaen as       teacher', and `The Golden Oriole' for BBC Radio 3, and others for CBC,       Radio France and Radio       New Zealand), 12 masterclasses, in addition to 10 solo and 4 duo recitals       in Europe, North       America and Australia.
Solo recitals to non-academic audiences include: in       2008 &#8212; Boston       University, Buxton Festival, Cardiff University Messiaen Day, La Grave       Messiaen Festival, Leeds       University Messiaen Day, Norwich Messiaen Weekend, Queen's Hall Edinburgh,       RNCM Messiaen       Weekend, MITO Festival Milan and Turin; in 2011 &#8212; Boston Conservatory; Le       Poisson Rouge, New       York; Bristol Earth Music Festival (Radio 3); in 2012 &#8212; Festival Louise       Besette, Montreal, for which       he received the award for Best Contemporary Recital and Best Overall       Recital, Synaesthesia       Festival at MONA, Hobart; in 2013 &#8212; Norwegian Academy of Music, Brisbane       Conservatorium.
In       addition, since 2008 he has given 15 performances as piano duo (with       Benjamin Frith) and as       pianist with numerous ensembles in performances of Messiaen's Quatuor         pour la fin du Temps.
Unsolicited individual testimonies and reviews attest to the highly       prized experiences that these       performances arouse in audiences [S3].
For example, the reviewer of a       performance in Glasgow       described the performance as "lyrical and poetic..., intimate...,         meticulously expressive in its         dynamic layering and achingly tender in the ecstatic calm of the love         music" (The Herald, 2008).
The Director of the SoundsNew Contemporary Music Festival remarked "...your         recordings of         Messiaen literally changed my life &#8212; and I sincerely mean that.
The         recording of Books 1, 2 and 3         of Catalogue...inspired me more than words can say.
No one else plays         Messiaen like you" (email       to Hill, 2008).
As another reviewer put it: `Peter Hill does not just         give concerts, he also enriches         one's life with perceptive introductions that illuminate the music,         however well you may think you         know it ...' (Yorkshire Post).
Hill's many public lectures include those for general audiences and       trainee music educators,       totalling approximately 1800 people (2008-13).
In 2008 alone his public       lectures included:       `Messiaen's use of birdsong recordings', British Library Saul lecture;       `Messiaen', Carnegie Hall (to       an audience of 300 people and where his co-lecturer was Pierre Boulez);       `Messiaen's Blackbird',       Chicago Humanities Festival; `Messiaen in War and Peace', Library of       Congress; `Introducing       Messiaen', MITO Festival Milan; `The composer in an age of change',       `Messiaen and birdsong' and       `Why music education matters', New Zealand Music Teacher's Conference;       `Messiaen, Birdsong       and Oiseaux Exotiques', Philharmonia Orchestra, Royal Festival       Hall; `Messiaen's Saint Fran&#231;ois         d'Assise' (broadcast discussion), BBC Promenade Concerts, Radio 3;       `The Crystal Liturgy', BBC       Promenade Concerts; `Messiaen's Quartet', Queen's Hall Edinburgh.
In       illustration of the value       placed on these activities by audience members, the organiser of the New       Zealand Music       Teacher's Conference remarked afterwards: "Everyone is unanimous in         their praise for you and the         time you spent with us.
With your `wonderful communication skills with         voice and piano' you         convinced, converted, and indeed `motivated, encouraged and inspired'         people to explore new         horizons."
(email to Hill, 2008).
He has also made a conscious effort to communicate his research findings       in an accessible way       through written material for general audiences, such as programme notes       and essays for the South       Bank Messiaen Festival, February-December 2008, and booklet notes for a       Messiaen chamber       music CD by the Gould Trio (Hyperion), 2008.
The way in which Hill's       research influences the       general public's understanding [S4] is illustrated by the example of the       Saul Lecture at the British       Library (2008), which examined Messiaen's transcriptions from birdsong       recordings, copies of       which are held in the British Library's sound archive, and their       subsequent use in his music.
As well       as making connections between ornithology and music this work resulted in       interdisciplinary       connections between the curators of the ornithology and music recordings.
Hill's research has also influenced later performers and interpreters of       Messiaen's music through       the numerous public lectures and masterclasses [S1, S2] to audiences of up       to a hundred people       each time at universities and conservatoires throughout Europe, North       America and Australia.
Some of these comprised week-long residencies in which Hill worked       intensively with up to 20       students at a time as well as giving public lectures and recitals.
For       instance, at the Australian       National Academy of Music (in 2012) he coached advanced pianists in       Messiaen's Visions de         l'Amen (taking the second piano part himself) before giving       performances at the Hobart       Synaesthesia Festival, Tasmania.
Participants attest to the value and       influence of his educational       work, one host remarking: `thank you for all your many contributions to         the Conservatorium last         week.
For Colin the experience was priceless but for many others         [pianists named] and all those         who witnessed your infectious enthusiasm and boundless expertise in your         lectures/classes/concerts, we shall remember your visit for a long time.'
(Queensland       Conservatorium, email to Hill, 2013) [S1].
Hill's numerous recordings and performances also create economic       benefits.
Sales of recordings       and tickets directly benefit record companies, and the regions and       organisations hosting the many       festivals at which he performs.
For example, Hill provided four events to       an audience of 400 within       the Synaesthesia weekend festival at the Museum of Old and New Art,       Hobart, Tasmania &#8212;       Tasmania's primary tourist attraction and part of its emerging       `neo-economy'.
More locally, Hill has       contributed to the University of Sheffield's identity as a `Civic       University' through his contribution to       the success of the Sheffield Chamber Festival `Music in the Round',       resulting in expansion of the       Crucible Theatre studio "to accommodate a much larger audience due to         the following built up by         the Lindsays [String Quartet] ...placing Sheffield squarely on the         musical map...
He has truly         enriched all who have heard him and thereby the reputation of Sheffield         as a cultural centre."
(Master Cutler, Sheffield)[S5].
The constant stream of invitations to perform, coach and speak all over       the world attest to the       value placed on Hill's work and his reputation as someone who can       communicate with the general       public.
Moreover it underlines Hill's commitment to communicate ideas,       insights and knowledge       about music to the widest audience and indicates the enrichment to quality       of life this brings.
