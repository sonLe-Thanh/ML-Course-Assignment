     The exhibition in its four locations, its catalogue, extensive website       (including video) and education programme shared the aspiration not just       to show the staggering creativity and variety of the arts of central       Nigeria, but also the complexity of the region's history and the       interdisciplinary methods employed to understand the meanings, uses and       histories of the art objects.
The challenge was to synthesise these,       turning knowledge of the objects and their complex itineraries into an       approachable show of around 200 items, touching on space, style, history       and agency.
This was achieved by interweaving a journey, from west to east       along the Benue River Valley, with object types and styles, such as       maternal figures, masquerades and healing pots displayed as series.
Approximately 1,000 people attended the opening weekend at UCLA's Fowler       Museum in mid-February 2011; 21,500 more visited before the exhibition's       close in July (1, 3, below).
The extensive education programme associated       with the exhibition involved more than 5,500 primary and secondary school       students (2).
Together with museum curators, Fardon helped to produce       simplified, concise versions of the catalogue texts and trained teachers       in the use of educational resources, which remain available online and       correlate with both national and California State standards for teaching       across multiple subject areas.
Three flexible units focus specifically on       the arts of the Middle Benue: `Ritual Intermediaries in Human Form',       `Middle Benue Ironworks', and `Masquerades of the Middle Benue'.
All draw       heavily on Fardon's original research and benefit from his direct       editorial and other contributions.
The exhibition then travelled to the National Museum of African Art at       the Smithsonian Institution in Washington (4).
Between September 2011 and       February 2012 there were 156,853 visitors to the museum when Central         Nigeria Unmasked was the major temporary exhibition.
This       represented a 17% increase in attendance figures over the previous year.
The exhibition received much press attention throughout its US tour (13),       but national press coverage was particularly notable during its time in       Washington: Afrostyle Magazine, with an African-American       readership online, positively reviewed and recommended the Washington       exhibition to its readers (5, 14).
CNN carried extended coverage on its       television and online platforms (6).
The exhibition returned to the West Coast, to the Iris and Gerald B.       Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University south of San Francisco from May       to September 2012 (7).
The online UCLA educational programme was linked to       the Cantor website for use by school visitors.
71,941 visitors attended       the exhibition following positive reviews in the San Francisco         Chronicle and elsewhere.
In a long-running and influential blog       written primarily for African art collectors and dealers, John Buxton       recommended the Stanford leg of the tour, `I initially saw this         exhibition in Los Angeles [...].
It is a superb and important show.
If         you are in the San Francisco area, you need to see this.'
(8)     Further evidence of impact on this constituency is provided by Barry       Hecht, a leading American collector of Nigerian Art, who has confirmed       that the exhibition and catalogue increased interest in the art of the       region, resulting in a number of private gallery shows in Paris in       particular, and a more informed market for central Nigerian art objects       with rising prices and museum acquisitions, particularly for Mumuye       figures, of which Fardon had written a comprehensive reassessment (9).
The Mus&#233;e du quai Branly (MQB), the preeminent non-Western art museum in       Paris, was the final destination of the show from November 2012 to January       2013 (10).
1,800 people attended the opening and there were approximately       275,000 visitors to the MQB over the period (gallery entry figures are not       kept).
The extent of publicity and press interest in Paris was striking.
The annual, dealers' non-western art festival, Parcours des mondes,       in September 2012, was largely Benue-themed.
There were 2,000 posters       around Paris and Le Guide du Visiteur, a special Paris Match       supplement, was distributed with the magazine and at MQB.
The exhibition       was favourably and extensively reviewed in 15 daily newspapers including Le         Figaro and Le Monde, 22 weeklies and fortnightlies and 27       periodical publications (12, 13).
Jeune Afrique introduced the       exhibition as a quiet revolution (`Il est des r&#233;volutions qui ne disent         pas leur nom") and concluded that the exhibition was important on       several grounds: for its interpretation, for overthrowing inherited       colonial conceptions in favour of African realities, and for revealing,       often for the first time, pieces of great rarity.
Radio (France         Culture, Radio France International) and television coverage (TV2,         TV5) was also significant.
Based on the success of this exhibition,       the Fowler Museum and Mus&#233;e du quai Branly signed a collaborative       programme for UCLA shows to tour to Paris (L'Art des Lega opened in       late 2013).
Fardon delivered public lectures, participated in tours and trained       museum guides at the first and last stages of the tour and with Berns       presented the catalogue at FILAF in Perpignan (where it won its category       of art books published in 2011).
One distinguished audience member in LA       was Enid Schildkrout, Chief Curator at the Museum of African Art in New       York, who travelled to attend the opening and generously praised the       exhibition and Fardon's contributions (11):     `I would like to say that your participation as a senior researcher         and curator for the major international exhibition organized by the         Fowler Museum at UCLA made a significant contribution to scholarship and         to the general public's understanding of African art and culture.
Having         been a museum curator for more than three decades, I am well aware of         how difficult it is to translate research on sometimes obscure subjects         to the public.
Exhibitions are an excellent way to this, and in this         case the sound scholarship underpinning this first ever regional         presentation of the arts of the Benue valley was made accessible to         audiences [...].'
