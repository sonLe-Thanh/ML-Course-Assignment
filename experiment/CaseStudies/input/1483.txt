     The research work has made direct significant economic impact/benefits in       several key technical areas, in particular in combined uses of inverse       Finite Element (FE) modelling and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE),       biomechanics led sports footwear design and development, and application       of hardfacing materials for green manufacturing over the assessment       period.
The inverse FE modelling programs with research output 1 and other         developments have been successfully used to test the constitutive         parameters of different materials groups/systems where standard samples         are not readily available.
The framework has made it possible to         integrate material testing with CAE in situations where rapid and         realistic material property identification is crucial.
Through several         major enterprise projects [research projects 1-5], the developed inverse         FE framework has been applied in different application environments over         the assessment period.
Typical cases include: continuous indentation         tests of sports materials (foams and layered structures) for sports shoe         design; in situ study of welded structures for car bodies and         micro spot-welded joints of micro thermocouples; and indentation bending         studies of latex rubbers/nano-composites for curing control and         biological tissues (bladder tissues) for simulating human prostate         movement and bladder filling.
These applications have spread across         several industrial sectors including sports engineering (basketball         shoes), medical engineering (prostate cancer treatment) and energy         sectors (heat exchanger gaskets).
For example, the research has led to         the evaluation of the feasibility of using indentation tests on extruded         packaging materials (plastic properties of extruded cans and plastic         bottles) for the Unilever (Port Sunlight Site) CAE team [source 5.1].
The efficiency of the top load simulation of three new packaging designs         has been significantly improved; the estimated reduction of simulation         time through confined property domain of Design of Experiment is over         20% [source 5.1].
The testing of biological tissues (e.g.
human heel pad         and human skin) using the research in inverse FE modelling has directly         led to the development work of sports footwear, which is detailed in the         next section.
Research outputs 2 &amp; 3 have been used to establish a framework of         combining materials, biomechanics and FE modelling for biomechanics led         product development, enabling the industry to develop products through         targeting key functional areas (e.g.
protection of the 5th         metatarsal bone).
Over the assessment period, these two outputs and         other associated publications have directly led to the development of         sports footwear based on different functional regions of the foot with         specific soft tissue properties and bone structures.
As a result, an         industrial patent has been granted to the industrial user (ANTA,         CN102488352A, 27/12/2011-26/12/2031) to protect the intellectual         property of their new products.
The research has produced a new natural         feature-based basketball shoe design.
The market value for the products,         directly benefitting from the research work, was over &#163;2m worldwide in         2012 [source 5.2].
The research work in biomechanics has also generated         significant social impact in raising the public awareness of science and         technology.
The work has been selected as a major news release by         Inderscience Publisher [source 5.3] during the BBC's 2010 "Strictly Come         Dancing", which has been widely reported by global science and         technology media [source 5.3].
Research outputs 4-6 have advanced the development and application of         crack resistant hardfacing materials.
Welded hardfacing is a cost         effective and environmentally friendly method in the repair/reclamation         of key engineering components/tools (such as forging dies and hot work         rollers) and production of duplex components.
The main original research         development on the use of rare earth oxides [research output 4] has         extended welded hardfacing techniques to high value components made of         steels with poor weldability (e.g.
high alloys steels and tool steels)         without an expensive full scale preheating process.
With increasing         public concern on green manufacturing and environmental issues, such         technologies have been increasingly adapted by industries such as         mining, iron and steels production and general machineries.
The research         work on the machining of hardfacings, cutting tool selection [research         output 5] and structural integrity of the welded structure [research         output 6] have further advanced the technologies, which is essential for         the application of weld hardfacing technologies.
Research outputs 4-6         have directly led to the production of a series of new hardfacing         materials for different application conditions with two new application         patents granted since 2008 (ZL 2008-1-007-9643.4, Yang et al.,         22/10/2008-21/10/2028; ZL 2010-1-0236826, Yang et al.,         23/07/2010-22/07/2030).
A company implementing the findings from these         research outputs has been set up in 2009, producing rare earth-based         welding materials.
The new products and hardfacing services directly         benefiting from research outputs 4-6 have had an annual market worth         over &#163;5m in 2011 and 2012 [source 5.4].
