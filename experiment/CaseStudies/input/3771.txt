     The Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) has had impact in a number of       significant areas in Scotland       but also more widely across the UK            It has changed National Records of Scotland's (NRS) statistical         infrastructure - allowing new         statistical series to be produced       It is used by local, national government and NHS officials for policy         analysis, impacting local         and national policy decision making       The study has trained over 100 researchers in longitudinal data         analysis using administrative         data       The SLS data system has become a model for the newly emerging UK         national         administrative data infrastructure          Changed National Records of Scotland's statistical infrastructure.
The SLS has been       accepted as a Scottish National study and as such it is now co-supported       and housed within the       National Records of Scotland (NRS) &#8212; the National Statistical Agency since       2004.
As a longitudinal       study it replaces the need for expensive traditional longitudinal surveys       collected through face-to-       face questionnaires (often costing up to &#163;10 million) [S1].
The       recognition of the study by the       Scottish equivalent of the Office of National Statistics as being part of       the National statistical       system is testament to the quality and reliability of the study.
The SLS       has changed the type of       statistical series that NRS are producing.
For example the General       Registrars' report (2010) [S6],       on new demographic findings, makes extensive use of the SLS.
(Since 1855 -       the General       Registrars' report is annually laid before Parliament as the major       statement on Scotland's       population).
NRS have used it to ask important questions about the nature       of occupational coding       (and therefore social class) on death certificates (a key statistic for       government), investigating the       potential exaggeration of someone's occupation status at death [S1].
The       achievement of the SLS       in Scotland has had influence across the UK so that the Northern Ireland       Statistical Agency have       argued that the SLS has provided a roadmap for a similar study in Northern       Ireland - "There is real         SLS impact" [S2].
Impacted local and national policy decision making.
Since its       creation, the SLS has also been       used by analysts outside the academy to examine a wide range of research       questions feeding into       government social, health and housing policy.
This has included, for       example, reports and studies       conducted on behalf of the Scottish Government [S10], Scottish Public       Health Observatory [S11]       and the NHS [S12].
To give two examples.
Researchers in Glasgow City       Council used it to       investigate local patterns of housing tenure change and in particular the       slowing of the fall in       demand for social housing [S7].
These findings were incorporated into a       demographic model of       tenure change, which then fed into the research base for a number of key       strategic policy       documents including the Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Housing Needs and       Demand Assessment,       Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Strategic Development Plan, and Glasgow's       Housing Strategy.
A       researcher working within Scottish Government working on `return       migration' [S9] work form key       evidence for the Scottish Government report, `Characteristics and       intentions of immigrants to and       emigrants from Scotland &#8212; Review of existing evidence' (Eirich, 2011),       this in turn was discussed       by Skills Development Scotland, Migrants' Rights Network, National       Coalition of Anti-Deportation       Campaigns and the Information Centre about Asylum and Refugees.
It was       also referenced in the       UK Needs Analysis Report of the EU Portfolio of Integration projects.
Training researchers.
In addition to the impacts of managing for       government a major data base,       and producing research that impacts policy in the areas of health,       education and employment, a       third impact has been in training people in longitudinal data analysis and       in supporting non-       academic research use of the SLS.
St Andrews researchers have been       pro-active in organising       training for those outside the academy wishing to access the SLS.
Since       2008, 14 training events       have been organised by the SLS team in Edinburgh, Belfast, Glasgow,       London, Stirling, and St       Andrews.
In total 125 non-academic users have been trained including 4       people from local       authorities, 6 from health boards, 110 from various sectors of the       Scottish Government, 5 from       Charities or private consulting firms.
Given the relatively small       community of quantitative social       scientists in Scotland, this represents a good proportion of potential       users.
As a result of this       training, 9 longitudinal research projects have been launched by       non-academics in the fields of       health inequalities, migration and employment.
Model for the newly emerging UK national administrative data         infrastructure.
The SLS has       become a path-breaking model that allows the linkage, holding, and       analysis of highly personal       data within appropriately strict legal and ethical constraints.
For       example, the Scottish Government       use it as an exemplar of good practice in their development of national       Data Sharing and Linkage       Service, "The SLS has been of absolute fundamental importance to the         development of the new         National Data Sharing and Linking Service" [S3].
A senior member of       Scottish Government argues       "It is fair to say that the Scottish Longitudinal Study was a vital         element in Scotland being able to         make practical progress in this area quickly.
This is because it had a         solution that had been         developed, tested and trusted.
In particular, our thinking about         governance of privacy and ethics         issues is derived from that used for the SLS.
The same is true for the         processes of indexing and         linking datasets themselves.
These practical considerations would have         taken much more time to         think through if the SLS hadn't been around, risking frustration from         Ministers and loss of         momentum" [S4].
The SLS has become a very important model for other parts of the UK that       are seeking to produce       similar studies.
The Administrative Data Taskforce (ADT) (making       recommendations to David       Willets, the Minister of State for Universities and Science, and BIS over       the future of UK wide       research infrastructure) has used the design of the SLS as a model for       future UK-wide research       centres) [S5].
The ADT argued that future "ADRC [Administrative Data         Research Centres] could         build on best practice from the experience of the ...Scottish         Longitudinal Study (SLS)" (p.5 [S10])       and have a "data linkage process ... similar to that used by the         Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS),         where personal identifying information is not held in the ADRC, but is         matched through a third party         service, such as the National Health Service Central Register"       (p.6).
One senior adviser to the       ESRC comments that "The design, direction and future ambitions of the         Scottish Longitudinal         Study, together with its impressive achievements to date, have provided         the prototype for the bold         step forward that is now being taken by the Economic and Social Research         Council, the statistical         authorities of the UK and government departments.
There is no         doubt in my mind that if we did not         have this valuable experience and example to draw on, we would have been         much less likely to         have attracted the capital funding gained to establish the         Administrative Data Research Network."
