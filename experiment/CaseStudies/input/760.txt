Beneficiaries of this research are:            The creative industries and arts practitioners in Wales.
They have         used the play to reach new audiences and/or used the methodology in         considering new creative and business models for theatre.
The Welsh communities who helped develop the play and those who         watched it.
They have been stimulated and moved by powerful theatre into         discussion of a major national figure and his legacy.
The National Library of Wales and the Lloyd George museum, which have         included material from the project in their archives, further enhancing         public knowledge.
Creative industries and business: The project has changed       attitudes among theatre practitioners and arts funders by conclusively       demonstrating that small-scale touring theatre can succeed commercially as       well as artistically, provided the integrity of the product is linked       throughout its development to an understanding of its potential audience.
A direct impact is the founding of a new theatre company, Theatr Cadair,       which was invited to apply for, and was awarded, an Arts Council of Wales       Theatre Production Development Grant of &#163;20,000, to pursue Britton's       methodology and to research material for a new drama, Windsongs of the         Blessed Bay, to be drawn from the international Welsh diaspora [C1].
Such grants are awarded only to a small number of projects, for activities       that are genuinely exploratory and innovative, and which provide a clearly       focussed explanation as to how the work will be developed with its       potential audience in mind.
Theatr Cadair takes its name from Cader Idris,       the mountain above the Tal-y-Llyn valley, where The Wizard played       in a remote former chapel to an audience of over 50 (the first theatrical       event there in living memory).
The company has also been commissioned (May       2013) by the Rhys Davies Trust, with support from National Theatre Wales,       to develop a biographical play about Rhys Davies and Anna Kavan.
The       Manager for Performing Arts at the Arts Council of Wales comments: "I         have followed the progress of this creative project from experimentation         through to production.
Its high level of artistic achievement has been         recognised both by critics and by fellow professionals.
As an example of         well-researched small-scale theatre with big ambitions, the theatre         industry can learn much from it.
This progressive and collaborative         research-into-performance experimentation has considerable possibilities         for future theatre developments.
Similarly, Britton's achievement ... in         taking difficult subject matter and marketing it effectively to a broad         audience across the nation is something of a breakthrough in itself; the         techniques used ... could well open doors for other ventures which set         out to ... bring serious research-based material to a popular audience."
[C2] Another respected industry figure, Head of Creative Learning at       Sherman Cymru Theatre, Cardiff, comments: "Britton's play impressed me         artistically because of its unusual and innovative synthesis of         theatrical approaches.
This apparently free-wheeling but in fact         highly-focussed style was much-discussed by practitioners and may prove         highly influential on those attempting to create richly imagistic         theatre on a small scale".
[C3]     Public Engagement - reaching new audiences: Box-office returns       show around 4,500 theatre- goers have paid to see the play in Wales, both       in districts where live theatre performances are rare or virtually       unknown, and in major urban venues where it played to effectively full       houses.
This figure is two to three times the norm, and should be       understood in the context of the geographically dispersed Welsh population       and the wider cultural market: sales of English-language literary fiction       published in Wales do not often exceed 1,200.
For comparison, a play       reaching a similar proportion of the population in England would have been       seen by some 74,000 people.
The Welsh live audience may be multiplied many       times over by the numbers tuning in to the BBC broadcast of the play (June       2013 RAJAR figures give BBC Wales audience reach as 499,000) [C4].
The       play has also been performed in Singapore, and has been invited (Sept       2013) to the Vieille Theatre in Antibes, where the action is set.
It will       tour again in 2014 to mark the anniversary of the Great War and BBC Wales       plans to re-broadcast the play in 2016 to mark the centenary of Lloyd       George becoming Prime Minister.
The production was widely covered in the       Press, on television and radio, and was extensively reviewed.
Reviews on       the Theatre Wales website alone have attracted well over 4,000       hits, and interviews and clips on the internet continue to be viewed.
The       play was praised by renowned Singapore playwright Robert Yeo: "During         the Q-and-A a young Singaporean woman said ... what impressed her most         was the moving portrait of a very human figure attempting to justify his         actions ... She spoke for most in the audience ...This production         reminds us of the value of the solo drama form, just how good it can be."
[C5]     Influencing community memory/enriching Welsh cultural life: As       shown by the testimony of those who have been affected, the play has       enhanced understanding and stimulated debate in a variety of Welsh       communities, and has spanned the traditional divide between north and       south Wales and between Welsh-speaking and English-speaking audiences.
The       Head of International Development for Literature Wales comments as       follows: "In Gwynedd, there are strong feelings among older people         about Lloyd George, both for and against.
By focussing on the whole man         (his excesses and frailties as well as his achievements), the play         helped people to re-examine their feelings about him and to talk about         what they felt.
For younger audiences, it opened doors to the         complexities of combining living both a public and a private life.
These         effects became apparent in the post-show discussions, and in the         conversations in the community at large after the performances"       [C6].
The play had a comparable effect when performed in Merthyr Tydfil.
A       viewer comments: "Merthyr, like the other mid Glamorgan valleys, is         historically a Labour stronghold and not best-disposed towards Lloyd         George whose contentious attitude to the miners, and to the         English-speaking culture of the coalfield, overshadowed his contribution         to the development of social welfare.
The play, superbly performed by         Richard Elfyn, was followed by a discussion which demonstrated how         powerfully this dramatic treatment had challenged the audience's         opinions about the man and his contribution to Welsh and British life.
The play itself was very well received and the issues it presented both         engaged the audience and stimulated strong debate."
Further audience feedback corroborates this.
One drama teacher remarked:       "Our students were thoroughly engaged with the narrative and style ...         A valuable theatre experience, it without doubt informed their approach         to their own work back at school ...
The play changed the way our         students related to Lloyd George, a figure they barely knew before         attending the performance.
By seeing him played as a real human being,         and by seeing the political and personal challenges he had to face, they         were better able to understand his role as man and statesman."
National         Theatre Wales's young critics' on-line forum called the play "truly         inspirational" [C7].
In North Wales, one member of the audience       commented: "You bring in so much historical fact in a fascinating way.
I am delighted your play will spread the word about Lloyd George".
Another viewer was moved to reveal a previously unrecorded biographical       fact, and a powerful family memory: "I've just returned home from your         play at Theatre Clwyd ... My father knew Lloyd George, I can sing the         song.
He grew up in a cottage in the grounds of Bryn Awelon, Criccieth         ...
When my Taid was seriously ill in the early 1930s, Lloyd George paid         to take him to London and for the King's physician to operate on him.
Unfortunately my Taid died on Xmas eve.
Lloyd George went to tell my         Nain the news.
He then went into Criccieth and bought my dad a Meccano         set and my two aunts a doll each.
My surviving aunt still has the dolls         ...
I won't have a word said against him.
For all his faults I think he         was a man who cared.
I think that came across."
[C8]     The National Library of Wales has placed materials from the play in its       Lloyd George collection.
The Head of the Political Archive at the National       Library described the play as "an outstandingly brilliant piece of         work, with amazing historical accuracy", and requested permission on       behalf of the National Library to use the play's title for the NLW's major       Lloyd George exhibition, opening in October 2013 to coincide with the 150th       anniversary of Lloyd George's birth.
