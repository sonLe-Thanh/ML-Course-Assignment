     Context     GSDs are an extremely diverse and complex group of rare genetic diseases,       for which diagnosis can be difficult for the non-expert.
There are more       than 450 unique and well-characterised phenotypes that range in severity       from relatively mild to severe and terminal forms.
The accurate diagnosis       of a specific GSD therefore usually necessitates several types of       investigation such as review of the child's medical and family history,       physical examination, genetic testing and radiological evaluation.
Moreover, genetic mutational analysis plays a pivotal role in establishing       the correct diagnosis and in facilitating clinical management, accurate       risk assessment and genetic counselling for family members.
Before Brigg's       discoveries, the diagnosis of some GSDs (i.e.
PSACH-MED-SEMD) relied       entirely upon clinical and radiological methods.
Brigg's research       introduced a completely new paradigm in rare disease diagnosis by       demonstrating that a trans- national clinical and molecular diagnosis       network (ESDN) could dramatically improve patient access to expert       diagnosis for GSDs and also increase mutation detection rates.
Pathways to impact     Development of gene specific DNA tests for PSACH-MED     The identification of causative genes and mutations for PSACH-MED, namely       COMP, MATN3 and the type IX collagen genes (COL9A1-3),       allowed the development of gene specific DNA diagnostic tests.
These tests       were originally offered to 5-10 clinicians on a `research basis' by the       Briggs laboratory, however, the un-sustainability of this approach in a       non-accredited laboratory, led to the inclusion of these diagnostic tests       in the portfolio of the Regional Molecular Genetics Laboratory at St       Mary's Hospital in Manchester.
Initial funding for this service was       provided by the PPP Healthcare Trust (2001-2003) and then subsequently       through the European Commission 5th and 6th       Framework Programmes (2002-2010).
The success of the PSACH-MED diagnostic       service allowed a sustainable financial model to be applied in early 2010       and the referring clinicians now pay for all testing via the NHS or health       insurance (overseas referrals).
Establishment of the first trans-national diagnostic network for           rare GSDs     The European Skeletal Dysplasia Network (ESDN) was first established in       January 2002 with a grant from the European Commission with a remit to       develop an integrated research and diagnostic network for skeletal       dysplasias.
This was the first trans-national diagnostic network       for any genetic disease grouping.
Reach and significance of the impact     Development of gene specific DNA tests for PSACH and MED     Specific DNA tests that allow earlier and more accurate diagnosis (also       prenatal and predictive testing) are now available to UK families through       the Regional Genetic Laboratory (Manchester) [A] and these protocols have       also been widely adopted in other testing laboratories across Europe [B],       North America [C] and elsewhere.
Indeed, there are now 19 diagnostic       centres in Europe [B], three in North America and one centre in Korea [C]       offering DNA testing for PSACH-MED.
In most of these centres, the current       service is still based on Brigg's screening protocols and molecular       diagnosis has been provided to 100s of patients with PSACH, MED and       related diseases.
For example, representative sampling of COMP diagnostic       testing performed by three referral laboratories located in different       geographical areas has revealed the following number of tests were       performed [D-F]:                                                      2008           2009           2010           2011           2012                             USA (Gaithersburg)           38           29           20           15           11                             Korea (Seoul)           11           69           20           20           3                             UK (Manchester)           23           46           32           21           38                          A similar number of tests were also performed for MATN3 and the       type IX collagen genes.
These numbers do not include the testing of       additional family members for prenatal and predictive purposes, which       plays a major role in providing counselling and reproductive options to       families.
From this 5-year sampling it is clear that there was a consistent number       of tests performed each year and that the adoption of a charging policy in       Manchester at the beginning of 2010 did not drastically reduce the numbers       of referrals, thereby demonstrating the clinical requirement and utility       of these tests.
In summary, the availability of these reliable and rapid       genetic tests has had a major impact on the delivery of genetic healthcare       to patients worldwide.
Undiagnosis or misdiagnosis causes considerable psychosocial problems.
Having the correct genetic diagnosis aids prenatal testing and guides in       predictive and prognostic aspects.
Establishment of the first trans-national diagnostic network for           rare GSDs     The European Skeletal Dysplasia Network (ESDN) was one of the first       networks of expertise in the field of rare diseases to use information and       communications technology (ICT) tools for the purposes of tele-expertise       and medical diagnosis [G].
From September 2003, ESDN has received over       1600 referrals through the on-line Case Manager and 450 users have       accessed the ESDN Case Manager from 45 different countries worldwide.
For       example, the following referrals were made in the period 2008-2012       (inclusive) [H]:                                                      2008           2009           2010           2011           2012                             Number of referrals           190           217           179           170           176                          Referrals in 2008-2012 have come from regional genetics centres in 20 UK       cities (240 patients), 23 different European countries (469 patients) and       13 countries outside of Europe (223 patients) including [H]:                                Country           Australia           Brazil           India           Iran           Israel           Malaysia           Pakistan           Saudi Arabia           South Africa           Taiwan           Turkey                             Number of referrals           20           6           108           9           17           2           6           38           3           6           12                          Interestingly, the period 2008-2011 has seen a significant increase in       referrals from emerging economies.
For example, ESDN received 8 referrals       from India between 2003-2007 and this has increased dramatically to 108       during the 4-year period 2008-2012 [H], confirming that ESDN is providing       a solution to an unmet medical need in these countries.
Overall, these data confirm the international reach and impact of ESDN       and demonstrate how this network approach has transformed the diagnosis of       genetic bone diseases worldwide.
