     Edinburgh Designs Ltd., the staff spin-out from the ERPE wave energy       group (http://www.edesign.co.uk/)       specialises in the design, manufacture and installation of a wide range of       wave and tidal generators.
Since 1987 EDL has established itself as a       world leader in the provision of hydrodynamic test equipment, including:            flap-type ocean wave generators;       piston-type coastal wave generators;       wave generating software and measuring equipment;       beaches and movable floors;       scientific tidal, wind and flow tanks and recreational tank equipment.
EDL directly employs 6 full-time staff with a turnover exceeding &#163;2M per       annum [S1].
They sub- contract manufacture and installation to local and       UK companies, depending on the location of each installation, creating       significant indirect employment and onward turnover.
They have supplied over 1000 wave-makers to 50 installations in 19       countries into academic, governmental, defence and recreational facilities       (http://www.edesign.co.uk/list-of-contracts/       ) including every academic installation in the UK.
Examples of       recreational wave makers are surf wave pools, rapid river rides, theme       park waves and flow rides.

Since 2008 EDL has:            supplied the CoAST laboratory at Plymouth University with a coastal         basin, ocean tank, sediment flume and tilting tank.
All four rectangular         tanks are equipped with wave-makers and straight-flow current generators         and the ocean tank has a hydraulic moving floor [S3].
Installed in 2011 wave-making equipment in the 260 m Marin         Depressurised Wave Basin at Waginengen in the Netherlands to generate         bow-on and beam waves during ship-towing tests.
For the first time this         enabled the investigation into cavitation in a wave environment and the         study of air entrapment under reduced ambient air pressure.

The detailed technical collaboration between ERPE and EDL in wave-maker       design and testing was recognised by the 2011 joint award of       (EP/H012745/1, &#163;2.1 Million with EDL) to further explore the design of       several new wave and current generators for stable wave generation in       multi- directional combined tanks and prove that this concept could be       applied to a round tank.
This led to the subsequent award of EP/102932C/1,       &#163;6 Million, to construct the All-UK Waters Combined Wave and Current Test       Facility [4] and subsequent formation of the subsidiary company FloWave TT       Ltd (http://www.flowavett.co.uk.)
with 6 full-time staff.
Complementing these investments and subscription       by the University of Edinburgh, Scottish Enterprise awarded a further &#163;1       Million to enhance the scientific and staff provision increasing the total       investment to &#163;11.2 Million.
"As Managing Director I can verify that Edinburgh Designs continues to         have strong technical collaborations with the Wave Power Group at ERPE.
In particular we have adopted, into our design portfolio, ERPE research         on new methods for integrating waves with current flow generated by an         array of impellers.
The new Flowave tank has 28 computer controlled         impellers arranged in a circle.
Each can be programmed so that the         direction and velocity of the combined flow within the basin can be         controlled in real time.
This was a unique opportunity to combine our         experience of constructing previous project with new research work         conducted within the University.
We are very pleased to have been         selected to design the new Flowave facility as it further extends our         capability from wave makers into full 3D marine current test tank         design", Managing Director, Edinburgh Designs [S1].
"Stephen Salter and his colleagues have provided many technical         advances in the design of wavemakers and their associated drivers for         wave tanks, which have been installed worldwide through the spin-out         company Edinburgh Designs.
This world-leading technical capability has         enabled recent funding for the construction of the new FloWave facility,         which gives the UK a world-wide lead in simulating ocean conditions for         testing tidal and wave energy devices."

This world-unique facility, which combines recent ERPE research [4, 5]       with EDL's commercial expertise, http://www.edesign.co.uk/portfolio/edinburgh-university/,       has had already significant impact on the marine energy and other sectors,       with a pipeline of device developers and academic researchers already       established.
It emulates at up to 1/20th scale the combination       of wave and tidal conditions anywhere around European coastlines.
The       facility simulates conditions at EMEC as a pre-proving ground for       technology developers and investors as part of the UK commercial test       capability, which ranges from 1:100 scale testing in laboratories to full       scale at EMEC and at WaveHub in Cornwall.
