     The stabilisation or rehabilitation of an endangered language requires       processes involving the       use of educational, political and social means to increase the number of       its speakers.
However, revitalisation of an endangered language cannot occur unless the       language is first       documented.
Thus this project, which has resulted in a comprehensive       descriptive account of       Mehri sound structure, word structure and syntax (Watson 2012; Watson       &amp; Bellem 2010,       2011), a set of Mehri texts (Watson/ Sima 2009), and is developing a       community-accessible       database of oral texts is playing a significant role in allowing these       revitalization processes to       occur.
In addition to this contribution, Watson's research has made a       contribution to restoring       the prestige of Mehri language and culture in the following ways:            The involvement of the Mehri language community in the collection of         data since         December 2009 has raised the language community's awareness of both the         precariousness and the value of Mehri language and culture.
Of the six MSAL, Bathari is now extinct (Miranda Morris p.c.)
and the         other five &#8212; Mehri,         Jibbali, Soqotri, Harsusi and Hobyot &#8212; are in various stages of         endangerment.
The         observation of linguistic behaviour within Mahra indicates that Mehri is         critically         endangered.
Census figures give an ethnic Mehri population of c.         180,000, but this belies         the linguistic situation: as a MSAL, Mehri is neither written nor a         language of the media.
The prestige of Arabic coupled with urban migration has led to many         Mehris losing         competence in Mehri; even those living in remote villages are becoming         increasingly         bilingual in Arabic.
Schooling is conducted solely in Arabic and         children are banned from         speaking Mehri on school grounds.
Immigration of Yemeni Arabs into the         province since         unification in 1990 and increasingly in recent years has forced Arabic         to be the main         language of communication in Mehri towns.
Because Mehri is a spoken language, Mehri has not until recently been         used in new         electronic media such as SMS text messaging and e-mail.
Since January         2010, Watson         has been communicating with Mehri speakers in Mehri using Arabic script         in email and         SMS text messaging.
Watson has encouraged language consultants to use         Arabic script in         order to communicate Mehri data in text messages and emails.
Between January 2010 and July 2012, Watson has built up a database of         over 3,800 SMS         messages.
This has created a new cultural phenomenon in which Mehri         speakers adapt         the script with which they are accustomed (Arabic) in order to use Mehri         in electronic         communication.
Watson's research on the sound structure of Mehri and Yemeni Arabic         has resulted in a         corpus of publicly accessible sound files         (http://www.semarch.unihd.de/index.php43?LD_ID=5&amp;lang=en).
The project has generated incremental impact in attracting additional       funding for extension of       the innovative research methodology, with an award of &#163;149,680 from the       Leverhulme Trust to       develop the documentation and linguistic analysis of Sheret, Harsusi,       Hobyot and Bathari.
The       project will also produce a 1,000 word comparative cultural glossary of       the six Modern South       Arabian languages (including Mehri and Soqotri), and develop categories       for a comparative       grammar of the language family.
