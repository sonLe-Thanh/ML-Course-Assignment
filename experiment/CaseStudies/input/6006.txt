     From 2000 research by the Lancaster group has revealed the scale and       nature of the health inequalities experienced by the 1.2 million         people with LD in England, the inadequacy of services for this       population, and the potential utility of national statistics (3.1-3.4,       5.1).
Our report from a DH commissioned study concerning national       statistics on people with LD (3.2) stated: "The establishment of an         Observatory for Learning Disability Statistics could provide a major         ongoing resource for all stakeholders" (p. 52).
A government commissioned independent inquiry into healthcare for people       with LD (5.2) recommended the establishment of a specialist learning       disabilities observatory: "The Inquiry believes (as suggested by Hatton         et al., 2005) that public health experts have a crucial role to play in         helping to strengthen data and information" (p. 43) and "Recommendation         5.
To raise awareness in the health service of the risk of premature         avoidable death, and to promote sustainable good practice in local         assessment, management and evaluation of services, the Department of         Health should establish a learning disabilities Public Health         Observatory" (p. 44).
The Government report Valuing People Now (5.3) accepted this       recommendation and tendered for the first national specialist LD         observatory in the world, to operate from 2010.
The Lancaster       University group, with a public health observatory (now in PHE) and NDTi,       won the tender and manage the observatory (known publicly as Improving       Health and Lives; IHaL), which is now located within PHE (5.4, 5.5).
IHaL collects, analyses and summarises information for policy       makers, service commissioners, service practitioners, the third sector,       family members and self-advocates.
As IHaL is collaborative, certain       impacts are not attributable to a specific partner &#8212; therefore, in this       section we describe impacts where there are clearly identifiable       contributions from Lancaster researchers.
Our website (5.5) is a major vehicle for sharing information, attracting       approximately 40,000 user hits per month as of 31 March 2013.
Examples of reasonable adjustments in health services (set up and       maintained by Lancaster, and cited by DH in 5.6, p. 36) have been viewed       17,459 times.
Lancaster-led reports on the IHaL website are also popular;       e.g.
the 2011 annual report of statistics (downloaded 4,380 times) and the       2011 report of health inequalities evidence (downloaded 5,866 times)       (5.7).
Another major vehicle for sharing information are regionally based       training and learning events (25 events to 31 March 2013; all with input       from Lancaster staff), with approximately 1,200 people attending.
IHaL has       also run two national conferences &#8212; our recent conference in March 2013       included a speech from the DH Minister of State, Norman Lamb, who       was highly enthusiastic about IHaL's work (5.7).
An online survey of potential IHaL users in September 2012 reported that       89%-94% of service managers, professionals and commissioners (total n=263)       found the information provided by IHaL to be useful/quite useful and 92%-100%         of these professional groups reported using IHaL information in their         own work (5.6 p. 29, 5.7).
A recent DH progress report identified IHaL as one of its four         specific priorities for improving the healthcare of people with LD       (5.6 p. 28), and stated "The Observatory has dramatically improved the         quality of information available on the health of people with a learning         disability and the health inequalities they experience.
As a result, it         has helped promote sustainable good practice, becoming a key source of         evidence for local commissioning, benchmarking and accountability"       (5.6 p. 30).
IHaL, in conjunction with the Royal College of General Practitioners       (RCGP) and the Royal College of Psychiatrists has produced evidence-based         guidance for health service commissioners (Oct 2012).
Dr Matt       Hoghton, the LD Champion for RCGP has stated: "The Public Health         Observatory has made a significant impact on the health of people with a         learning disability across all public services.
At a time when the NHS         is undergoing a significant reorganisation it is essential they continue         their work in raising these important issues, ensuring there is a robust         evidence base and translating the research into practical advice for all         health and social care workers" (5.7, 5.8).
Accessible versions of IHaL information are also highly valued by       family members and self-advocates, illustrated by this family carer: "The         IHaL Public Health Observatory work has been very important at strategic         and national level with its excellent guides, research and conference         activity.
However I have found it really useful on a personal level.
I         frequently use the website for info but more often I quote it when         liaising with health professionals and use it to signpost them."
(5.7).
At a national level, IHaL (including Lancaster) staff have regular       meetings with DH policy makers (5.9).
IHaL (including Lancaster) staff       have also been invited to report to two meetings of the All Party       Parliamentary Group on Learning Disabilities.
