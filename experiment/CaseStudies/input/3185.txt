     The underpinning research has delivered clear, international health,       economic and societal impacts, as described below.
Health impact is evidenced through the development of a new test       based on a haemorheological diagnostic medical technology arising from the       rheological research described above.
The test exploits the discovery of a       new functional biomarker for abnormal clot structure formation in blood       (R3).
Clotting abnormalities are inter alia responsible for some 25,000       preventable deaths annually inside UK hospitals (from 60,000       total) and ~1 million NHS outpatients require monitoring of anticoagulant       therapy.
Correlation of existing standard tests to clinical outcome has       been unsatisfactory, with uncertain benefits.
The new test provides       clinicians with the earliest possible indication of altered clot         structure due to therapeutically or pathologically modified       clotting.
No previous diagnostic has been able to detect incipient       clot formation.
It allows clot detection several minutes in advance of any       other test, providing clinicians with an improved ability to monitor the       progression of disorders and responses to treatment.
Conventional tests provide information which can lag significantly on       changes in patient state.
The World Health Organisation has highlighted       the need for improved tests and NICE guidelines (2010) require all 1.3m       annual UK hospital admissions to be screened for clotting abnormalities.
NHS-based trials on patients undergoing oral anticoagulation (by warfarin)       due to venous thromboembolic disease reveal that the new test is the         only diagnostic presently capable of detecting abnormal clots in       patients who appear fully anticoagulated when tested by the current       standard INR haematological assay.
This new test's capability is the basis for the creation (in 2010) of a       wholly new NHS hospital-based unit employing 10 staff in fully equipped       haemorheological laboratories.
This &#163;1.5m NISCHR (Welsh Government)-funded       unit is responsible for evaluation and validation of the test in NHS       operating theatres, treatment rooms and patient wards.
"The new haemorheological clotting test developed at Swansea         University is the key, principal technology underpinning our NHS based         clinical evaluation of patients involving therapeutic intervention in         care pathways including stroke and sepsis."
Director, NISCHR HBRU, ABMU NHS Hospital Morriston Swansea     The test has been used to target care pathways involving over 900 NHS       patients at 2 hospital sites to date (covering stroke, sepsis, diabetes,       COPD and cancer patients, and warfarinised clinic outpatients).
The test       has also been adopted internationally (the Schools of Medicine at       University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, are using the test in       pre-clinical studies of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia).
Economic impact is evident in the technique's use by a medical       device company (Haemair Ltd), which led to an IChemE Industry Award for       Innovation and Excellence in 2008.
"Swansea's haemorheology technology has been a key underpinning and         enabling technology in the development, testing, trialling and sale of         our products.
Our need to exploit it was a principal driver in the         company's decision to locate, recruit and operate at Swansea University         and it is a vital part of our ability to attract ongoing investment".
Operations Manager, Haemair Ltd.     Commercialisation of the research began in 2005 with the establishment of       an IPR portfolio which has since resulted in:     (i) the relocation of one company (Haemair Ltd) to Swansea University,       leading to     (ii) the introduction and sales (ca.
&#163;100,000 in 2011) of two wholly new,       previously unavailable commercial medical device technology products and     (iii) the payment of license revenues to Swansea University (estimated       value &gt;&#163;100,000, source Department of Research &amp; Innovation (DRI),       Swansea University); and     (iv) the establishment of two further Swansea spin-out companies       (Haemometrics Ltd and Haemaflow Ltd) which exploit the technology.
To date, 17 highly skilled jobs have resulted directly from this       activity.
The total value of this work with Haemair to date is in         excess of &#163;700,000 (DRI).
Cash investment of over &#163;2m (to       January 2012) has been raised from private and commercial sources in       addition to &#163;400,000 company- derived grant income to Swansea University.
A Royal Academy of Engineering awarded to PR Williams in 2012 provided       &#163;85,000 for commercial development and IP costs associated with the test.
Patents relating to the test have been awarded for the UK, Europe,       Australia and Canada.
Societal impact has been delivered through public engagement       activities that have raised the profile of engineering research, its       commercial development and healthcare applications.
The research has been       selected by RCUK as an `Excellence with Impact'         Case Exemplar, which highlights research based on fostering       partnerships with business and industry to achieve economic and societal       impact.
It also features in Exhibitions in 2013 at the Smithsonian         (Washington) and the Science Museum, London (with 5,208 visitors to       this exhibit 19-21 February 2013).
The research has also featured in two       television documentaries on medical device technology.
The first How         to Build a Bionic Man, was broadcast on Channel 4 (9pm, 07/02/13)       and attracted an audience of 1.23 million viewers (Source: BARB).
The second will be broadcast in 2013 on the Smithsonian Channel, USA.
