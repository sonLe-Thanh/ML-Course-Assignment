     This project has transformed research that focuses on the therapeutic       value of music technology, by taking it out of the controlled environment       of a laboratory and applying it within in a hospital setting.
It has       brought together developments in brain scanning analysis and automatic       music composition technologies, generating an effective new approach to       the creation of assistive music technology for people with severe physical       disability.
The research conducted at the Royal Hospital for       Neuro-disability had a profound impact upon the patient, raising her       confidence and sense of wellbeing.
The patient - who communicates to a       carer via eye movement to select letters from an alphabet table - sent the       research team a note after the first trial to say "how much I enjoyed         the experiment yesterday.
It was great to be in control again"       (15/05/2010).
Recalling the impact of the experience, the patient       commented on the "freedom it gave me.
There was never anyone to give         me orders, and I was able to take my own decisions.
It was very easy to         follow, and although no Mozart, I soon forgot the passing of time"       (05/06/2011).
The technology enabled her to demonstrate skill and ability       which the able-bodied people around her did not have (e.g.
control of an       eye gaze system).
By embedding innovative music technology into the hectic, busy schedule       of a hospital routine, one of the major barriers of medical research was       broken.
According to Dr Wendy Magee, previously Head of Music Therapy at       the hospital, this research "offered staff an opportunity to see         cutting edge research first hand; enabled them to see the impact of         research on patient benefit; offered opportunity for interdisciplinary         collaboration, particularly in terms of advising on the clinical         practicality of the equipment being developed and publication; brought         science into the clinic; and offers models of collaboration between         clinicians, designers and scientists which is best practice"       (18/07/2012).
Hospital staff stated that "Theoretically, we knew that the system         should be helpful for people with disability.
Now we have the         demonstrable proof" (18/03/2011).
By working with staff throughout       the process the researchers ensured this technology was suitable for the       hospital environment.
The approach helped to create a strong partnership       and encouraged medical staff to embrace academic research to benefit their       own work.
The research introduced resident music therapists, nurses and       carers to a new tool for communicating with patients and a way of thinking       about using BCMI technology in their practice, by demonstrating the system       with one of their patients in situ.
As a member of staff commented: "What         the technology is enabling is to put the complex and severe disability         in the background and someone's creativity and expression in the         foreground.
Beyond the obvious enjoyment that this gives to the patient,         it also enables the clinicians to interact with the patient in a new way         opening up new avenues for therapy and recreational activities"       (06/06/2011).
Following the publication of this research in Music and Medicine,       it was featured in Nature, attracting the attention of the media       worldwide (18/03/2011) including CNN and BBC World Service.
The         Independent hailed the research as "making medical history"       (04/04/2011).
This exposure provided the opportunity to communicate the       research to the public on a global level and generated a great number of       requests by institutions and individuals worldwide interested in adopting       the technology.
Enterprising companies (e.g., g.TEC, Austria and       Grooveshark.com, USA) have made contact to discuss forms of exploitation.
In 2013, The Plymouth Community Healthcare Trust is starting to use the       equipment trialled originally at the Royal Hospital for Neuro- disability       to support a patient with locked-in syndrome.
This research has been further developed as part of our current       EPSRC-funded project with neuroscientists at Reading University,       "Brain-Computer Music Interface for Monitoring and Inducing Affective       States" (2011-2016).
One of its first creative outputs, Miranda's Symphony         of Minds Listening, premiered at the Peninsula Arts Contemporary       Music Festival 2013.
Miranda composed this piece using the new methods he       developed to convert fMRI brain scans information into music.
These       methods, also the basis for the assistive technology for music-making by       people with severe disabilities, are central to the implementation of the       new generation of brain-computer music interfaces he is developing for       inducing emotions.
Symphony of Minds Listening complemented the overarching theme of       the Contemporary Music Festival, that of memory and consciousness.
It was       the best attended event of the Festival, which had a total audience of       approximately 700 (of whom 70% were members of the general public).
The       work prompted debate and critical analysis in the national media, having       been featured in publications such as The New Statesman       (21/02/2013), The Sunday Times (19/05/2013) and The Telegraph       (25/02/2013).
Professor Miranda was also interviewed on national BBC       radio.
In its review, Gramophone commended: "Such experiments can       often impress on a scientific level but disappoint aesthetically and       artistically, but Miranda's Symphony of Minds Listening achieved a       neat balance between both elements" (26/02/2013).
