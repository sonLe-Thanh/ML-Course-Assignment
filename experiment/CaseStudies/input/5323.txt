     Impacts include: commercial       Main beneficiaries include: industry     PolyTherics was established as a joint spin-out company of Imperial       College and London School of Pharmacy.
By 2013, following four successful       rounds (2007, 2010, 2011 and 2013) of venture capital funding, PolyTherics       had raised over &#163;20 million of funding (&#163;2.5 million raised prior to       2008).
This established PolyTherics as one of London's leading life       sciences companies, with revenues of &#163;3.2 million in 2012 [1], and licence       agreements (detailed below &amp; [4-6]) with the potential to deliver       significant milestone and royalty payments from exploitation of the       Imperial conjugation technology (TheraPEG&#8482;) developed by Professor Shaunak       as applied to novel protein therapeutics.
PolyTherics has 45 highly skilled employees commercially exploiting and       developing the TheraPEG&#8482; technology based at the London Bioscience       Innovation Centre and at its site on the University of Warwick Science       Park [2].
The company has recruited a strong management team, experienced       in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, led by John Burt who has       strong links to Imperial.
PolyTherics has been successful at       commercialising the technology developed at Imperial through commercial       licence agreements with Nuron Biotech (TheraPEG interferon 03b2) [3] and       Celtic Pharma [4] and Pro Bono Bio (TheraPEG FVIIA, FVIII &amp; FIX) [5].
In July 2013 PolyTherics announced its merger with Antitope Limited, the       leading provider of antibody engineering and immunogenicity screening       services [6].
The expanded offering will provide the PolyTherics group       with a broad technology platform for growth and a solid financial base       with sustainable revenue streams over the short-, medium- and longer-term.
The enlarged company will deliver a more extensive suite of services and       technologies for the development of better biopharmaceuticals.
PolyTherics       issued new shares to a value of &#163;13.5 million to fund the merger and       provide working capital.
Imperial Innovations led the investment and       brought in new investor Invesco Perpetual with further funds provided by       Mercia Fund Management and Advantage Enterprise &amp; Innovation Fund.
The successful merger and development of Polytherics demonstrated the       strength of the company founded on Imperial technology.
The company has       impacted the UK economy generating intellectual capital, capital       investment, new employment and novel compounds to treat disease.
