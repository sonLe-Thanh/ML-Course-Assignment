     Public policy and services     1.
Impact on public policy and services within the UK     In 2009/10 Underwood was seconded half-time to Becta [Evidence 1a] with       the dual goals of (i) developing a research agenda to provide robust       evidence of the impact of technology for learning, and (ii) acting as a       catalyst for research skills development within this government agency.
"Latterly,         Underwood's major contribution to Becta's work was in the impact arena.
Because of her ability to speak the languages of both research and         policy, we requested a secondment for her into the evidence team"       [Evidence 3b].
Reach: Her report on The Impact of Digital Technology [Evidence       1b] was circulated nationally by Becta and presented to more than 150       stakeholders and policymakers at the then Department for Children, Schools       and Families (DCSF).
Her reports on using technology to personalise       learning (Impact 2007) and "Narrowing the Gap" informed discussions within       the DCSF (2007-10) and were instrumental in convincing the Department that       Becta could take on significant work in this area [Evidence 3a].
A pack       highlighting Underwood's work on the "Narrowing the Gap" Project focusing       on the national issue of low and underachieving adolescents as they       prepare for life beyond the school gate, was distributed to English and       Welsh schools by Becta.
Effect: Underwood was a key figure in bringing an understanding of       the value of quantitative research methods to this government agency.
Her       secondment was used "to up-skill less experienced team members,         provide a forum for professional debate amongst more experienced staff         ... around the potential impact of technology.
This needed a strong,         independent authorial voice that had credibility with both the research         and policy communities" [Evidence 3b].

Practitioners and services:     Maturity Modelling: Underwood's construction of a suite of       maturity models to capture organisational behaviours (see section 2,       Evidence 2a) underpinned the development of the Becta's Self Review       Framework [Evidence 3a, 3b].
As part of the ICT Test Bed project, a       flagship longitudinal study of factors in the use and impact of technology       in schools, "Professor Underwood developed a series of maturity models         which proved highly effective in analysing change.
Becta developed the         model as a self-assessment tool for school leaders and, later, for         teachers and support staff" [Evidence 3a].
Reach: This tool had "4,500 users within the final 18 months of       its availability."
[Evidence 3b].
Warwick University's independent       assessment [Evidence 2b] reported:            17,000 schools registered to use the Self Review Framework, an average         uptake of 50% of schools in each region of England and Wales;       Usage statistics showed at least 72,041 site visits [p. 6].
Effect:             "The response to the Self Review Framework was overwhelmingly         positive" [p. 4]; 83% of respondents (N=788) acknowledging the relevance         of the tool [p. 15]       "The process of going through the Self Review Framework was often         deemed to be of greater value than achieving the ICT mark - the mark may         have been a catalyst to doing the framework but the work itself was         important."
[p. 4]       "Professional discussions arising from the process were highlighted as         a positive result of using the Self Review Framework" [p. 4] with 73% of         respondents stating that the tool had challenged their practice [p. 18]       "I think it's a really useful tool - it throws up the actions you need         to take."
[p. 38]       "It helped me with training.
The framework helped me to see what we         need to do."
[p. 41]          The Self Review Framework sits on the National Archive and National       Association of Advisors for Computers in Education sites [Evidence 2b].
Solutions to Academic Dishonesty: Underwood spearheaded the       Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's mapping of the prevalence,       characteristics and potential solutions to such malpractice.
Reach: Underwood's research on plagiarism is quoted in OfQual"s       guidance to teachers in England and Wales.
The key to preventing dishonest       practice is the development of a culture of honesty that encourages and       promotes original work through "Reducing the opportunities to cheat,         developing environments where cheating is unacceptable and reducing the         acceptability of cheating within any institution should be the foci of a         programme to reduce malpractice" [Evidence 4a, p. 3].
Effect: As a consequence of the original QCA report and the OfQual       Guidelines other stakeholders have accessed Underwood's expertise,       including:            The UKCCIS Better Education e-Safety Academic Group, which         investigated young people's understanding of digital media risk.
[Evidence 4b]       TQA's Masters in Teaching and Learning Writing Group developed a new         professional qualification for teachers in their first five years       The BiERightOnline strategy for The United Church Schools Trust/United         Learning Trust when developing practical ways of reducing online         malpractice.
