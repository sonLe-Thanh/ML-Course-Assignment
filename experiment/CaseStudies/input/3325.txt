     Background       Worldwide, Bacillus species are by far the most important producers       of industrial enzymes, accounting for about half of all production.
They       therefore significantly underpin the global market for industrial enzymes       that was worth around $4bn in the year 2012.
The applications for       industrial enzymes are diverse: for example, they are used during the       production and quality-control of food and drink, they are an important       component of non-food products (such as clothes washing powders), and they       can be used to produce bio-energy sources (such as ethanol).
Industry has       wanted to expand the range of different proteins that Bacillus       could produce (for example, to include therapeutic proteins), because the       bacteria can be grown so efficiently on a large-scale in fermenters, from       which protein can be easily harvested.
However, while Bacillus       secrete native protein- and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes at high levels       (of the order of grams per litre) into the culture medium, they do not       secrete non-native proteins at an economically viable rate.
Yields from       strains engineered to produce non-native proteins were up to ten       thousand-times lower than yields of native proteins.
Knowledge transfer to industry       Harwood conducted research with industrial scientists that led to a       greater understanding of the mechanism of protein secretion in Bacillus.
Insights from that programme of work formed the basis for innovations       within the manufacturing industry.
Of particular importance is Harwood's       discovery that quality-control proteases (such as WprA) and other       proteases, active at the bacterial cell membrane and in the culture       medium, were degrading much of the non-native protein synthesised by Bacillus.
Those research insights fed directly into the development by commercial       companies of strains of bacteria in which those particular aspects of the       protein secretion pathway were altered so that the bacteria secreted much       higher amounts of intact non-native proteins.
Two biomanufacturing companies, Cobra Biologics and Novozymes, have confirmed the significant       and material role of Harwood's research in informing their development of       novel producer strains of bacteria.
Cobra Biologics     is a wholly owned subsidiary of ML Laboratories plc.
Cobra is a contract       manufacturing organisation with three facilities, two in Sweden and one in       the UK, where recombinant proteins, DNA and viruses (many of which are for       therapeutic uses) are produced for other companies in the life sciences       sector: "Based on previous knowledge developed by the Harwood group, a         series of strains [of Bacillus subtilis] with combination       [deletion/downregulation] of the secreted feeding and quality control         proteases were systematically constructed.
Specific strains showed very         substantial improvements in rPA [recombinant protective antigen, a       model protein] production from concentrations in the &#181;g per litre         range to approximately 1 g per litre in industrial fermentations."
(EV a)     Novozymes       is the world's largest producer of industrial enzymes, with a 47% share of       the global market in 2012 and total sales of about $2bn: "There is no         doubt the Harwood group over the past 20 years has provided and         continues to provide very valuable data and has helped us make informed         choices in relation to our strain development program aimed at enhancing         the yield of industrial enzymes."
"... during the late 1990s/early2000s,         Novozymes and the Harwood group jointly generated a series of hybrid         alpha-amylases that helped to elucidate the fate of secretory proteins         following their release from the translocase ...
The discovery that         amylases are degraded significantly in the vicinity of the cell         membrane/wall turned out to be crucial in our understanding and use of         the extracytoplasmic chaperone, PrsA, and the role of membrane- and         wall-associated proteases like WprA.
The data on cell-wall proteases and         their role in the degradation of industrial proteins and the lysis of         cells was also important in cell refactoring".
(EV b)     Commercial impact Both Cobra Biologics and Novozymes have       incorporated new strains of bacteria, underpinned by this research, into       their manufacturing processes after 2008.
The strains are used by Cobra       Biologics in fee-for-service contracts with major biotechnology and       pharmaceutical companies, whereas Novozymes manufactures enzymes and then       sells them directly to industry.
Cobra Biologics:       "... the resulting strains [of Bacillus, with downregulated or       inactivated quality control or feeding proteases] have been used by         Cobra Biologics in two fee-for-service contracts in the period 2008-         2013, one client being one of the largest international pharmaceutical         companies with a multi- billion dollar turnover.
One of the products was         an industrial enzyme (in 2011) and the other a therapeutic protein (in         2012).
Both clients continued to use the expression systems after they         were transferred from Cobra once the contracts were completed."
(EV       a)     Novozymes:       "Since 2008 we have incorporated protease-deficient production hosts,         and are continuously evaluating the use of protease-deficient host         strains as a valuable option in our enzyme production processes.
WprA is         also in this family of proteases which can be beneficial to remove from         hosts.
Several enzymes would have been very difficult to bring to the         market without this knowledge about proteases.
The actual         yield-improvements resulting from the collaboration [with Harwood at       Newcastle University] and the resulting business impact must remain         trade secrets, but the protease-deficient strains have made significant         and valuable contributions to yield improvement."
