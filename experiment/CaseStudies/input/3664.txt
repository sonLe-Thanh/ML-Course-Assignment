     The UoA's security research led us in 2010 to register a community shared       service for SMEs, nuWARP (www.nuwarp.org.uk)       a comprehensive SME Warning Action Reporting Point, within the UK       Government Centre for Protection of the National Infrastructure (http://www.warp.gov.uk/).
This service provides (i) a Filtered Warning Service, (ii) Trusted Sharing       Service, and (iii) an Incident Response Service.
The impacts described       below were achieved through the agency of nuWARP which provides a link       between the academic research and the commercial sector and which arose       from our Cyber Security research.
Influencing Strategy and Policy     ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency) commissioned       nuWARP to write a case study based on device and network security for its       2011 report on Emerging and Future Risks (downloaded more than 950 times       to date &#8212; Source 1 below).
The Senior Expert in Risk Management at ENISA       said the case study was "key" to the successful completion of the       report and its wide readership and that it: "helped in the assessment         of related risks."
This report forms a major part of the latest EU       Cyber Security Directive's backbone: Cybersecurity Strategy of the       European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace (ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda)       (Source 2).
The Government Department for Business, Innovation, and       Skills, as well as national bodies such as the British Computer Society,       have also commissioned reports on cyber security and good practice from       nuWARP.
Information Sharing for Changing Practice     A team from the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)       attended a nuWARP 12-day training course in digital forensic       investigations (09/2010).
This provided a mix of skills development and       instilling a greater understanding of policies and procedures, in this       case the development of best-practice digital forensics investigatory       policies and procedures which will help the EFCC to do their jobs more       effectively     Between April and August 2012 nuWARP worked with Star Spreads, a       Dublin-based SME, providing guidance on online payment procedures, fraud       detection, and vulnerability assessment culminating in nuWARP conducting a       full penetration test.
The work was concerned with securing an online       gambling site, a type of business in which trust and privacy are essential       elements.
nuWARP assisted Star Spreads to develop their online payment       security, policies and procedures leading to a redeveloped business model       (Source 3).
As a result, nuWARP was asked to review the mobile payments       policies and procedures of Excelpoint, a software development SME, as well       as the trust and privacy implications of moving to a cloud environment       (Source 4).
Behavioural change is evidenced by the IT Coordinator for Washington       Metalworks, who confirmed that attendance at a nuWARP workshop (04/2011)       helped: "raise awareness in the company of threats within the business         and to take preventative measures" (Source 4).
Shared Interest, a Newcastle-based financial service provider, asked       nuWARP to undertake a network forensics investigation, from which nuWARP       provided a series of half-day training programmes for senior management,       normal business staff, and their overseas staff (December 2012).
Consequently, Shared Interest updated its security policies and       procedures; in particular they are implementing a social media policy and       procedure, and with help from nuWARP they are reviewing their Bring Your       Own Device (BYOD) policies, especially staff mobile phone usage when       overseas (Source 5).
Directly resulting from being part of the TSB project consortium (RMT       Accountants, PEM IT Services, Security Risk Management Ltd, and the       International Association of Accountants Innovation and Technology       Consultants), Security Risk Management Ltd, an information assurance firm       (www.srm-solutions.com), "have         identified a number of potential opportunities surrounding situational         awareness and sensory planes ...
The generation and maintenance of         Situational Awareness is fundamental to our ability to operate         effectively in what has become known as the Cyber Environment"       (Managing Director of SRM) (Source 6).
SRM are now pursuing these       opportunities in partnership with the University and are seeking to       recruit specialists working in this field.
Public Engagement     Vickers provided advice (Dec 2012, Jan, May, June 2013) on sonification       strategies and the technological solutions available to an independent       freelance sound artist who subsequently secured Arts Council funding to       build a sonified solar system model which was selected for exhibition at       the British Science Festival 2013 (www.thesoniccosmos.com)       (Source 7).
Also selected as part of the British Science Festival (originating from "Securing         Critical Infrastructures and Industrial Control Systems: Approaches for         Threat Protection" (Laing et al.
2012) was a public panel       debate entitled "Cyber Pearl Harbour; Fact or Fiction?"
