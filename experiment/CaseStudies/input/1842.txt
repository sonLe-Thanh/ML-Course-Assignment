     The research has generated the following impacts between 2008 and 2013:     (i) Shaped government EM policy debates and practice:       by supporting moves towards a greater focus on compliance-based work in       sentence implementation and increasing the use of EM to strengthen       community sentences [A] [B].
The findings informed the Ministry of       Justice Sentencing Review [A] [B] and resulting policy changes [A].
The Senior Contracts Manager for EM at the National Offender Management       Service (NOMS) has confirmed that `as a direct result of the research, we       have included `compliance' in our approaches to the use of EM' [A].
He continues `we are currently ... introducing new guidelines for       management of offenders on curfew and this research has influenced our       thinking in making these changes' [A].
The research also informed the direction of government policy by       influencing the content of the tenders for new contracts to operate EM in       England and Wales originally from 2013 worth &#163;1 billion [A] [C].
Hucklesby       provided the only contribution based on empirical research findings at a       NOMS seminar to discuss contract specifications attended by high level       stakeholders from government departments and agencies [A] [D].
Hucklesby       also discussed the implications of the research findings for the future       shape of EM at a meeting with the Head of Contracts and Commissioning at       NOMS in 2011.
The Senior Responsible Officer at NOMS testified: `I would       agree the impact set out in the case study are all accurate, although       possibly still understates the value we place on this piece of research       ... the study ... has proved invaluable to the NOMS and the Ministry of       Justice in developing greater understanding of the electronic monitoring       system and thinking about how policy for EM may need to develop ... we are       currently in a competition to re-tender for EM contracts ... it is fair to       say that the study ... has helped to shape that competition' [C].
The NOMS Contracts Manager wrote `we are currently procuring new contracts       and introducing new guidelines for management of offenders on curfew and       this research has influenced our thinking' [A].
(ii) Directly contributed to practice by identifying           changes to G4S EM services which would increase levels of compliance       [E] [F]: The research identified a number of ways in which       offenders' compliance might be improved and these were implemented by G4S.
They included:            In response to finding that offenders were not made fully aware of the         curfew requirements and their responsibilities (as discussed in Section         2), G4S undertook staff training and allowed for a longer installation         process to ensure that offenders and their families were fully aware of         what was expected [E].
The research found that staff did not recognise the important role         that families can play in increasing compliance and so often failed to         explain EM to them.
Consequently, G4S launched Project Genesis and         instigated staff training to facilitate greater appreciation of the         families' role in EM and improve interactions and communications with         them [E].
As a direct result of the concerns about staff safety uncovered by the         research, emergency response alarms were provided to all G4S working in         the community to reduce their anxieties and to provide a safer working         environment and therefore increase the length and quality of time spent         interacting with offenders.
G4S stated in a letter from the Communications Director: `I cannot       emphasise enough the impact that the compliance research has had on our EM       business ... we continue to learn from this research and to make       operational changes based on its findings' [E].
(iii) Led to policy innovation through the setting up of           pilot projects: with the agreement of NOMS [A] [C],       G4S [E] [F] ran a pilot project in partnership with probation       trusts and the courts to test out different mechanisms recommended by Hucklesby's       research, with the aim of improving working practices and increasing       compliance rates.
Mechanisms included: texting reminders to offenders       prior to installation, at the start of their curfews and when they are not       at their curfew address; rewards for complying; and practical help for       offenders with applying for changes to curfew requirements.
Staff were       trained in motivational interviewing techniques and given greater       discretion when dealing with breaches.
A second pilot was also initiated       to increase the compliance of female offenders &#8212; a group which the       research highlighted had lower compliance rates than men and different       experiences of EM to men.
Hucklesby acted as a consultant on both pilots, drawing on the       findings and recommendations of the research described in Section 2.
One       aspect of the pilot project (texting) is referred to as an example of       innovative working in a government Green Paper [B] and a range of       the mechanisms have been rolled out across G4S EM operation and included       in the new EM contract specifications by NOMS.
(iv) Informed the work of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of           Probation (HMIP) and government responses to it, the research       supported recommendations relating to breach policies and enforcement       thresholds made in HMIP's 2008 thematic report of EM, which NOMS had       resisted implementing [G].
These recommendations included greater       levels of discretion when dealing with breaches and tighter but more       transparent enforcement thresholds.
The research reinforced HMIP's unusual       decision to undertake a follow up thematic inspection of EM in 2012 which       focused specifically on the 2008 recommendations.
HMIP noted that during       discussions with NOMS about its 2012 report there was `a more positive       attitude amongst NOMS officials to promoting compliance.
It was clear...       that they were aware of Hucklesby's research and had been       influenced by it' [G].
HMIP was also aware that a pilot had been       implemented `as advocated in Hucklesby's research, which was said       to be producing positive results'.
NOMS confirmed that their responses to       HMIP 2008 and 2012 EM reports were also informed by the research which       gave them a better understanding of EM and the factors that influence       compliance [A].
(v) Contributed to debates about the use of EM curfews           amongst magistrates and judges and other key stakeholders: The       findings relating to the correlation between compliance rates and the       length and duration of curfews (i.e.
offenders were less likely to comply       if curfews were the maximum 12 hours, ended later in the morning and were       imposed for a maximum of 6 months) were fed back to magistrates and       judges.
The aim was to persuade them to use EM curfews more smartly to       increase compliance i.e.
to move away from routinely imposing 12 hour       curfews overnight 7 days a week for the duration of the order.
The findings have been used extensively in training with Youth Offending       and Probation Services to encourage them to: (i) make more targeted       recommendations to courts; and (ii) increase the value of curfews through       targeted use (e.g.
imposing curfews as part of a strategy to address       offenders' behaviour) [E].
Additionally the research informed       debates at NOMS seminars across the country to `encourage more appropriate       use' [A].
