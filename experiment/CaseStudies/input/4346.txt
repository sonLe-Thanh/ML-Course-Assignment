     This research programme has enabled the ERA information requirements in       licence application       dossiers for the release of non-native biocontrol agents to be       standardised across national       regulatory authorities in different European countries, thus reducing       costs of commercial       production and use.
The main method of biocontrol in the UK and Europe more generally is the       augmentative release       of non-native predators and parasitoids into glasshouses &#8212; such species       are not intended to       establish outdoors.
Currently, around 170 species (mainly insects and       mites) are used in       augmentative biocontrol with Europe accounting for 75% of the &#163;260m annual       world market.
The       UK regulates the import and release of non-native biocontrol agents under       the Wildlife and       Countryside Act 1981, but in the late 1990s it was recognised that the       information required from       companies seeking to release non-native species was not `fit for purpose'.
For example, the climatic origin of a species was used as a proxy for the       direct assessment of cold       tolerance and overwintering ability; and there was no required assessment       of diapausing ability       (diapause being a dormancy mechanism used by many insect species to       survive unfavourable       environmental conditions such as low temperature).
It was an undiscovered       diapause trait in the       glasshouse predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus first released       in the UK in 1991 that led to its       outdoor establishment by 1998.
In 1998 Defra commissioned a project at Birmingham to assess the cold       tolerance and       overwintering ability of previously released non-native agents, as a       possible means of predicting       establishment potential.
This study provided a retrospective explanation       for the establishment of N.         californicus (high level of cold tolerance and diapause trait) and       the failure of other released       species to do likewise.
[s1] On submission of the final report from       this project, Defra modified the       information requirements for applications to release non-native       invertebrate biocontrol agents in       the UK.
[s2, s6]     Based on the publications arising from the work, Bale then supervised a       number of CASE PhD       studentships in collaboration with leading European biocontrol companies       (Koppert, Biobest)       interested in acquiring `independent data' on the establishment potential       of non-native biocontrol       agents as part as the information required by national regulatory       authorities in applications for       release licences e.g.
Defra in the UK.
These data have been used to         support successful         licence applications for a number of species in different EU countries         over the period 2008-13.
As an example, data produced by Bale's laboratory in Birmingham on the         predatory mite         Amblyseius swirskii was the basis for successful release         licence applications by Koppert to         regulatory authorities in the UK, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and         Canada.
[s7]         Koppert have said "The research performed by Prof. Bale and           his team from the University           of Birmingham to produce a laboratory method to assess the           overwintering potential has           offered a major improvement and resulted in an easy, quick and           reliable method which           replaces the time consuming and doubtful outdoor test".
[s3]         Research conducted by Bale         in Birmingham thus has world-wide importance and impact.
As more species were added to the database of laboratory measures of cold       hardiness and       duration of winter survival in the field, a predictive relationship was       established and confirmed, in       which survival at 5&#176;C in the laboratory was found to be strongly       correlated with the maximum       period of survival in the field in winter.
This relationship is currently       based on 10 species, with       studies underway on a further 2 species.
It was envisaged that with       confidence in this relationship       companies would be able to carry out their own studies to collect data on       overwintering potential,       and that it would also be possible to predict likely field survival from       laboratory studies alone,       providing a rapid, robust and reliable method of risk assessment; both of       these objectives have       now been achieved.
[s3, s5]     In 2011, a `commercial in confidence' dossier was submitted by a       biocontrol company to the       Netherlands regulatory authority to release a non-native predatory mite       for glasshouse biocontrol.
The company cited the `Bale methodology' to assess overwintering         potential, and estimated         winter survival from laboratory data alone, based on the published         correlative analysis.
[s8].
The regulatory authority granted a release licence.
Such reliable ERA       laboratory methods are more       cost and time-effective than field studies, an important consideration for       biocontrol companies,       which are mainly SMEs with limited R&amp;D budgets.
[s3, s5]     The ability to identify `safe' biocontrol agents is also relevant to the       EU's `Sustainable Use       Directive' (2009/128/EC published in October 2009), which places an       emphasis on integrated       approaches to pest management and reduction in the usage of pesticides.
The EPPO Standard       PM 6/3 (Safe use of biological control) contributes to this agenda by an       annually updated list (the       so-called `Positive List') of `biological control agents widely used in       the EPPO region' (Europe and       North Africa).
This list comprises species that have been used in at least       5 EPPO countries for 5 or       more years without reported negative effects, and serves as a valuable       advisory tool for countries       with limited expertise in biocontrol.
Bale is a member of the EPPO panel       that reviews the list.
After       its initial release in the UK and the Netherlands, A. swirskii was       widely adopted across Europe and       added to the Positive List in 2011.
Research in Birmingham thus         underpinned a series of         licence applications for Amblyseius swirskii in         several EU countries and its rapid addition         to the EPPO Positive List.
[s7]     The development of biocontrol in Europe has been hindered by, amongst       other challenges, the       absence of agreed methods by which to acquire ERA data.
The Birmingham         methods to assess         overwintering and establishment potential have been accepted by a number         of regulatory         authorities in northern Europe, as evidenced by the successful       applications for release licences       that have incorporated data produced by Bale's group.
[s3, s5, s7]       In a wider context, through       international collaboration with scientists with similar interests in ERA       methodology development       and harmonisation of regulatory requirements across Europe (van Lenteren,       Bigler, Loomans), a       comprehensive approach to ERA was produced and adopted as a `Standard' in       2010 (`Import and       release of non-indigenous biological control agents') by the European       Plant Protection       Organisation (EPPO) &#8212; Standard PM 6/2(2).
