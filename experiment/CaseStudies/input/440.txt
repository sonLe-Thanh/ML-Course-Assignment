     The phenomenon of children living in AIDS-affected families in       sub-Saharan Africa was first       identified in the mid-1990s, and has risen to massive proportions, with an       estimated 3-4 million       AIDS-affected children in South Africa alone.
This programme of research       has been explicitly       designed to maximise impact on three key sets of stakeholders responsible       for policymaking for       AIDS-affected children: 1) the South African government; 2) NGOs (UNICEF,       Save the Children       and local NGOs providing care to AIDS-affected children); and 3) the US       President's Emergency       Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR-USAID).
The direct utilisation of these       studies by policymakers and       practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa has contributed to the mitigation of       the effects of AIDS on some       of the world's most vulnerable children.
Impact 1 - South African government policy and planning       In South Africa, three government departments have joint responsibility       for AIDS-affected children:       the Department of Social Development (lead), the Department of Health, and       the Department of       Basic Education.
The research team has worked closely with all three       departments at national       level, and all were partners in the research design and implementation,       including the former       Minister of Social Development, Dr Zola Skweyiya.
As a result, the South       African government has       extensively used and cited the research findings [Section 5: C1].
For example, at the South       African National Orphans and Vulnerable Children conference (Durban 2013),       the Minister of       Health, Dr Aaron Motsoeledi, quoted the research in his plenary       presentation (Cluver et al, 2013 on       tuberculosis risks for child carers).
The team's papers have been cited in       a number of major policy       documents that are used to determine the provision of services for       AIDS-affected children.
These       include the SA National Action Plan for children affected by HIV/AIDS       [C2] (5 citations), which       provides a five-year national framework for all government agencies and       NGOs working with these       groups, and based on the findings now includes a requirement for       programmes to support young       carers, youth-headed households and psychosocial support.
The research was       also used in the       development of the government's National AIDS Council's National         Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS         Information Resource (7 citations), which provides a broader       national framework for HIV/AIDS       programming.
Findings have been directly used in training manuals for       government health and       community workers, for example the Department of Social Development's `Training         in psychosocial         support for orphans and other children made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS'       [C3] (7 citations).
In       addition, the research has led to Dr Cluver being appointed, as one of       only two researchers, onto       the influential policymaking body the South African National Action       Committee for Children       Affected by AIDS (NACCA), as an advisor to the National Department of       Basic Education, and the       National HIV+ Paediatric and Adolescent Technical Working Group in the       National Department of       Health.
Impact 2 - International NGO policy and programming       Five key international NGOs and supra-national bodies are stakeholders in       the provision of policy       and interventions for AIDS-affected children in sub-Saharan Africa.
The       research team has worked       closely with UNICEF, Save the Children, the Regional Interagency Task Team       for Children       Affected by AIDS and the Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative, and has       engaged with World       Vision, which works closely with PEPFAR-USAID (see below).
The team's       findings on child       physical, sexual and emotional abuse and mental health influenced the       development of Save the       Children's programming for abuse prevention for AIDS-affected children, as       set out in their 2012       policy document Child Protection in the Context of HIV and AIDS [C4]       (5 citations).
These findings       were also instrumental in the child protection policy developed by UNICEF       in 2013 Building         protection and resilience: synergies for child protection systems and         children affected by HIV and         AIDS (15 citations).
Both of these documents set out the       intervention approaches that will be       undertaken by Save the Children and UNICEF's direct programmes and       beneficiaries, between       them reaching millions of children in the region.
By demonstrating the       negative impacts of AIDS-related       poverty on children, this research also contributed to UNICEF's 2012         report on HIV-sensitive         social protection [C5] (8 citations) and was instrumental in       their policy decision that AIDS-affected       children required targeted social provision.
In a further contribution to       this debate, UNAIDS       has invited Cluver to speak on a panel on HIV-sensitive social protection       at the 2014 International       AIDS Conference, alongside President Banda of Malawi and the Special       Advisor to the UN       Secretary General [R6].
In an example of direct influence on       programming, the Regional         Psychosocial Support Initiative, an African NGO reaching over a       million children, used the findings       of the Young Carers study to directly inform their 2011 training manual       for community workers:       Programme guidelines for households in which young people are caring         for other household         members [C6] (2 citations).
Impact 3 - US government foreign aid policy and programming       The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR-USAID) is the       largest single funder of       programming for AIDS-affected children globally, with a       congressionally-mandated budgetary       requirement of 10% of the US HIV/AIDS budget, comprising around $4.6       billion annually.
PEPFAR-USAID       funds national government programmes as well as a large network of NGOs       primarily       within sub-Saharan Africa, all of which are required to follow their       seven-yearly programming       guidance.
The research team were extensively consulted in the development       of the PEPFAR-USAID         Guidance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming (2012) [C7]       (7 citations,       (more than any other research group), with six recommended in the       `Evidence Matrix').
The team's       research was used to strengthen the evidence-base for the development of       programming in       psychosocial support, economic strengthening and child abuse prevention       within PEPFAR-funded       programmes reaching an estimated 4.5 million children per year.
The       studies have also been used       to inform PEPFAR's programming for South Africa in particular &#8212; see PEPFAR-USAID         Southern         Africa's SA Government Capacity Development and Support Activity (1       citation) and were an       important contribution in their focus on promoting psychological support       for HIV+ adolescents, as       shown in the PEPFAR-USAID Technical Brief `Transitioning of care for         adolescents living with HIV         in Sub-Saharan Africa' [C8] (4 citations).
An entire module       of the training for USAID Peace Corps       volunteers working with orphaned and vulnerable children (around 2000       volunteers per year,       working in all sub-Saharan African countries) is based directly on the       research findings (9       citations).
To summarise, this research has had considerable impact both in terms of       reach and significance.
This is evidenced by a comment from a Regional HIV and AIDS Advisor at       Save the Children: `By       sharing rigorous evidence on how children affected by HIV faced increased       vulnerabilities over       time, Dr Cluver has engaged major policy makers, donors and program       implementers in critically       "rethinking" and redesigning programs with an emphasis on effectively       measuring results.
Based       on Dr Cluver's research, UNICEF, PEPFAR have launched new technical       guidance (UNICEF:       From Evidence to Impact; PEPFAR: OVC Guidance: 2012) for program       implementers.
Her work is       a testimony of how rigorous research is the foundation for effective       programming...a clear example       how a true partnership between researchers, policy makers and implementers       can result in       programs that actually make a difference in children's lives.'
[C9]       A senior advisor for PEPFAR       also stated: `I have quoted Dr Cluver's data more than any other research       to support our work and       also to justify and set policy for our global portfolio.
All of the data       presented from these studies       has been influential, however of particular influence has been the data       discussed in Cluver [et al]       (2011) [R2] and 2012.'
