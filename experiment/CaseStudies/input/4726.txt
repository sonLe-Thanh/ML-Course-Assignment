     A.
General Public (Buddhist and non-Buddhist): Findings from the       research have been used in       different ways, including Widening Participation activities at the       University of Bristol (master class       on `ghosts' on 24/6/2009, 20 participants).
A digital exhibition in       Birmingham Museum on the       occasion of Buddha Day (24/4/2010) attracted `an audience of more than         100 people who were         touched by the depth of sensitivity and authenticity of the visual         descriptions of death rituals in         South-east Asia being portrayed' [c].
Heise (1/12/09), Ladwig       (10/11/09) and Langer (15/12/09)       were invited by the University of Hamburg to give talks (audience of ca.
100 from the general       public) and show their films (audience of ca.
70, general public) as part       of their public lecture       series, `Tod und Sterben im Buddhismus' [g].
They also contributed       material to two exhibitions of       photographs, film, manuscripts and objects designed to offer an insight       into the topic.
The two       exhibitions, `Ancestors and Hungry Ghosts' (Bristol, 23/10-11/11/09, ca.
150 visitors; Leeds 1-25/2/10,       ca.
650 visitors) [h] and `Tod und Sterben im Buddhismus' (Hamburg,       8/10-18/12/09, ca.
2,000 visitors) were aimed at the general public as well as those with a       specific interest in the       subject.
The venues (Photographique gallery in Bristol, Department of East       Asian Studies at the       University of Leeds and the foyer of the University of Hamburg main       building) were chosen for their       public outreach potential [h].
The most accessible and accessed venue       (Hamburg), with its       spectacular set-up of large photo boards on two levels of the foyer of the       University's main       building, attracted the widest audience and appealed particularly to       `mature, experienced travellers'       [g].
The Bristol exhibition was publicized by way of an interview in a       programme called 'Face to       Faith' on BCFM Bristol community radio.
The films and images have       attracted interest and have       been shown at various venues including the universities of Bristol, Leeds       and Hamburg; the Max       Planck Institute (Halle); Ecole fran&#231;aise d'Extr&#234;me-Orient (Paris); and       the Conference of the       International Association of Buddhist Studies (Atlanta, USA).
The       discussions during and after the       events indicated that the public view of Buddhism had been changed.
Buddhism is often labelled a       `philosophy' rather than a `religion' and evidence shows that recent       research has begun to       challenge this.
The project also invites reflections on death and dying       more generally, which       prompted the organizers of the Edinburgh Festival 2011 to ask Langer to       take part in a panel       discussion (Ritual and Memory, ca.
100 audience).
The audio-visual       material has been available       online on the website since 2010 [4] and the site was refreshed and       refurbished in 2013 with a       number of additional features (image archive, audio section, tabs for       target audiences).
The results       of the anonymous Bristol Online Survey available on the project website       [e] showed that the       resources were used in a great variety of contexts, including GCSE       preparation, chaplaincy work,       undergraduate projects, school and undergraduate teaching, publishing       work, school visits at       monasteries and inspiration for e-learning material.
Of those surveyed,       82.2% said they would use       the resources again; 46.3% said the resources had changed their attitude       or practice and backed       this up with personal statements such as `I have started to contemplate         death more often and         started chanting too'.
It is significant that the resources appealed       to non-Buddhists and Buddhists       alike (57% of participants considered themselves Buddhist) and to a great       range of nationalities       including Australian, Sri Lankan and Thai [e].
The download statistics for       SoundCloud (3,225       downloads), Vimeo and YouTube (combined downloads 1,329) indicate that the       material has       international appeal.
The chants were played in a total of 50 countries       including the USA, Russia,       Egypt, Laos, Canada, Sri Lanka, Australia, Germany, China and Latvia [f].
Easy online access and       the increasing number of links to the research material in blogs and on       Twitter has led to a       widening audience and user base.
The secretary of a Buddhist temple in the       UK said: `It is         wonderful to have such a free resource for teaching, chaplaincy and         personal education for users         ... We have residential family events at the monastery as well as         frequent school visits.
So I have         passed on your email and the link to the website to the various monks         and nuns who are involved         in these areas, as well as adding it to our general resources for all to         use' [a].
Some people shared       moving testimonies of how the resources had affected them personally: `I         had been witness to a         ceremony while in Sri Lanka and wanted to know what had happened.
I was         deeply affected by         what I now know was a funeral, so this film has been really helpful to         me.'
[e].
Traffic has more       than doubled since the launch of the new web pages; the number of       referrals shows that there is a       sustained need for the project materials [f].
B. Multi-faith Chaplaincies: The Government Office for National       Statistics refers to the 2001       Census which states that there were 149,000 Buddhists living in Great       Britain, which is 0.3 % of       the population.
However, the World Buddhist Directory lists 513 Buddhist       temples, organisations       and meditation groups in the UK, which indicates that a considerably       higher number of people are       involved in the practice of Buddhism.
Consequently, there is a greater       need for information on the       care of ill and dying Buddhist patients, and training is under way.
Short       videos of interviews with       chaplains and a downloadable pamphlet [4] were developed in cooperation       with NHS chaplains       and hospice workers to provide background information.
The pamphlet has       been endorsed by the       Multi-faith Group for Healthcare Chaplaincy (MFGHC), which in turn informs       organisations such as       the NHS, the Army and the Prison Service and is instrumental in the       training of chaplains [c].
The       material was regarded as exemplary and has prompted a forum discussion       about the feasibility of       developing similar materials for other religions such as Hinduism.
The       Chairman of the Buddhist       Healthcare Chaplaincy Group (and member of the MFGHC) [c] is involved in       the training of NHS       Buddhist chaplains: `The research work presented via this media was         incredibly useful and         informative to these Chaplains whose understanding of the various         cultures was greatly developed         from this experience.
In due course the material will be used again,         with the University of Bristol's         permission, as part of on-going Buddhist Chaplaincy training.'
Again, personal testimonies from       chaplains indicate that the material affected individuals on a deeper       level: `the resources would be         useful in understanding what Asian families need at the time of death to         support them'; `I would         also recommend this site to anyone who is working closely with Buddhists         in hospitals or in the         wider community'; `I have been a Buddhist Chaplain at a prison,         this has inspired me maybe to be         a chaplain at a hospital'; `The Chaplaincy booklet is a useful         resource as I do get asked to lead         Buddhist funerals outside my own tradition' [e].
C. Educators: Many of the documented rituals are not specific to       the death context and the project       material is suitable for teaching the more practical aspects of Buddhism.
The audio-visual material       [2, 3, 4] and the subject matter (particularly ghost festivals) are       both accessible and well-suited to       outreach activities.
In cooperation with teachers, project findings were       translated into e-learning       materials.
The head of religious studies at a UK secondary school [d]       piloted the study resources       with A-level Buddhism students: `I know I will be both using and         directing my students to use the         resources in the future.
Even with a number of years' experience         teaching A level Buddhism, it is         always good to have an injection of new resources to breathe new life         into one's work.'
The head       of RS at another secondary school [b], not currently offering Buddhism at       A-level, states: `After         looking at the resources available I am considering adapting our         existing work on Buddhism in         KS3-4 and introducing it as a unit of work in KS5 [A-level].
The         resources would support me         greatly as a teacher, and the lesson plans and resources are easy to use         and adapt to fit with our         lessons and the introduction of a new scheme of work at A-level.'
And yet another head of RS at a       secondary school decided to move over to an examinations board which       allows more Buddhist       content and approached the department with the idea of a collaborative       project to develop more e-learning       resources for the study of Buddhism.
The overwhelmingly positive       reaction of educators       and students to the website indicates that high-profile research can be       made accessible to schools.
Some comments from the online survey: `Photos, films, chants, lesson         plans.
Excellent and rich         resources &#8212; immensely useful for my teaching practice'; `Has lead         me to a more hands-on         approach when teaching.
Possibility to show students images, films,         etc., I deem now as very         important'; `I have no doubt that my religious studies GCSE grade         was significantly helped by         these resources'; `I gained ideas about current practices.
Usually, I have rather a (classical) text-based         view on Buddhism' [e].
The material is highly adaptable and equally       valuable in       undergraduate teaching provision, as a UK lecturer in Thai language and       culture [h] observes:       `These resources are very valuable for our students taking my Buddhist         module.
Students can get         in-depth insights into this important topic thanks to the fantastic work         you and your team have         done.
I am particularly impressed with the film material.
This will         certainly help to enthuse students         in their study of Buddhist ritual and thought world.
Having         access to these films now will enable me         to make some significant changes to the way I teach my Buddhism module.'
A lecturer at a       German university remarked in an email how the material changed the       perception of the students       and helped them move away from labelling Buddhism as simply `a       philosophy'.
Apart from       benefiting individual educators and students, the material attracted the       attention of educational       publishers and exam board representatives: `Although as free resources         they compete with our         commercial publications, actually for a less studied area like Buddhism         it is good when resources         are created and distributed freely, as they would not be viable         otherwise.
We would certainly         reference them in relevant publications and direct teachers and students         to them' [i].
This goes to       show that there is demand for high-profile research in the field of       Buddhist Studies and that making       the findings of just one project widely available can have a large-scale       impact.
D. Personal development: Two of the Research Assistants moved to       posts at prestigious       institutions before the end of the project: Langer was appointed full-time       lecturer at the University       of Bristol and received &#163;25,459 funding under the AHRC Research Leave       Scheme for a four-month       follow-up project (`Preacher and Ritualist: the role of Theravada Buddhist       monks', 2010).
Ladwig followed Langer as RA and was offered a research position at the       Max Planck Institute for       Social Anthropology in Halle (Germany).
Kieschnick was appointed professor       at Stanford       University (USA) and Heise was offered a two-year postdoctoral position in       Taiwan.
The high       quality research outputs have also contributed to the University of       Bristol's Centre for Buddhist       Studies' growing status as an institutional centre of knowledge.
The       centre was founded in 1993,       was the first of its kind in the UK and has hosted visiting scholars from       Croatia, India, Japan and       the USA and continues to attract scholars from abroad.
The research       project was also publicised       on the AHRC website as one of the first case studies and as such served as       an example for other       projects in the field [j].
