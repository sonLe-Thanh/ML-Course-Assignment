     The book has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the       interpretation and application       of the Hague Convention on Child Abduction by courts in various countries       in the world including,       unusually, civil law and mixed legal systems eg Germany (Supreme       Court, Bundesgerichtshof,       XII Zivilsenat Decision of 16 August 2000, BGHZ 145), Quebec (Court of       Appeal, F.(R.) v G. (M.)       [2002] RDF 785 and the Superior Court, EA v LM 2010 QCCS       4390) and South Africa (Supreme       Court of Appeal, Pennello v Pennello 2004 (3) BCLR (SCA)).
The pre-2008 cases continue to be       influential in the development of the relevant jurisdictions' case law on       this issue.
The impact of the book on case law in the United States of America       is very significant.
The book       has been described by two US Circuit Court of Appeals as `the leading       treatise on the Convention'       (Mozes v Mozes (9th Cir.
2001) 239 F. 3d 1067       and Delvoye v Lee (3rd Cir.
2003) 329 F.3d 330)       and the book continues to be relied on by US Circuit Court of Appeals (eg       on the meaning of       "settled" in Article 12 of the Convention in In re: B. Del C. S. B.
(minor) (9th Cir.
2009) 559 F. 3d       999 and on the appropriate use of undertakings and safe-harbour orders in       Baran v Beaty (8th Cir.
2008) 526 F. 3d 1340.
The book's treatment of "settled" has also been       influential in some       decisions of US state courts of appeal, see the Court of Appeal of       California in Esquivelzeta v       Sohn, 2013 Cal.
App.

LEXIS 1792 and by the Court of Appeal       of Florida in Wigley v Hares,       82 So.
3d 932; 2011 Fla. App.
LEXIS 11786.
Finally for the US, the book       continues to be cited       positively in first instance decisions on child abduction, often due to       its extensive citation in earlier       decisions of higher courts like Mozes, above, and Gitter v       Gitter (2nd Cir.
2005) 396 F. 3d 124, eg in       Headifen v Harker, 2013 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 80819, judgment of       7 June 2013 and White v White,       2012 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 104044, judgment of 20 July 2012.
The view that the book is the "leading treatise" on the Convention has       recently been reiterated by       several courts in Australia in the course of giving significant       weight to a variety of points made in       the book (see the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in Harris       v Harris [2010] FamCAFC       221, paras.
33, 35 and 152 and in Zotkiewicz v Commissioner of         Police (No.2) [2011] FamCAFC       147, paras.
80-82 and104; Bennett J in the Family Court of Australia in State         Central Authority and         Camden (No 2) [2011] FamCA 666, para.
117; and by the Family Court       of Western Australia in       Soysa and Commissioner, Western Australia Police [2012] FCWA 28,       paras.
153-156).
In Canada the Ontario Court of Appeal has placed reliance on the       book in several cases including       (Jackson v Graczyk, 2007 ONCA 388, paras.
3-39; Cannock       v Fleguel, 2008 ONCA 758, para.
26;       and Ellis v Wentzell-Ellis, 2010 ONCA 347, para.
20) and       the British Columbia Court of Appeal       made significant use of the book in Kubera v Kubera, 2010       BCCA 118, paras.
38 and 90, to give a       balanced construction on the meaning of "settled" and other matters in       Article 12 of the       Convention.
The book has been cited by the highest courts in Australia, New         Zealand and the UK (DP v       Commonwealth Central Authority [2001] HCA 39, paras.
35, 38, 84,       102, 124, and 125; Secretary         for Justice v HJ [2006] NZSC 97 at footnotes 93, 103 and       104; In re M and another (Children)         (Abduction: Rights of Custody) [2008] 1 A.C. 1288, para.
22; In         re E (Children) (FC) [2011] UKSC       27; [2012] 1 AC 144 in the judgment of the Court given by Lady Hale and       Lord Wilson, para.

Again, the earlier cases, as leading authorities, have been influential in       the development of the       jurisprudence in these countries in the REF census period (see, for       example, the Australian       decisions above and the English and New Zealand decisions below).
The book has also been cited by the English Court of Appeal in Re W         (Minors) [2010] EWCA Civ       520, para.
17 (cited in turn by Cobb J in LCG v RL [2013]       EWHC 1383 (Fam), para.
79), by the       Irish High Court in P v P [2012] IEHC 31, para.
29, by the       New Zealand Court of Appeal in C v H       [2009] NZCA 100, para.
25 and by the New Zealand High Court on appeal in RCL       v APBL [2012]       NZHC 1292, para.

One specific example of a judge being influenced by the book to give an       interpretation that widens       the application of the Convention by giving a later date to when a       `wrongful retention' takes place       and thereby protecting the rights of left behind parents to get their       child back is RS v KS, LS (By         his Guardian Marion Werner-Jones) [2009] EWHC 1494 (Fam): [2010] 1       FCR 338.
Macur J said:     "37 In that [case Wall J] decided as a matter of law that an intention         to wrongfully retain does not         have to be communicated to the left behind parent/custodian in word or         deed for the purpose of the         twelve month period which triggers a prospective exception to summary         return on the basis of         `settlement', I respectfully disagree.
I adopt the argument of Beaumont         and McEleavy, in The         Hague Convention on International Child Abduction at page 41, that this         approach would "threaten         certainty" and "penalise an applicant by commencing the limitation         period before he could [or, I         insert, should] have been aware that his rights had been breached.""
In the first case on the Hague Child Abduction Convention to be heard by       the US Supreme Court,       Abbott v Abbott, 130 S. Ct. 1983 (2010) the petition for a       writ of certiorari contained references to       arguments from the book on pages 29-30.
This case was an attempt to get a       uniform       interpretation of Article 5 of the Convention on the important point that       a person who simply has a       right to object to a child leaving a country has a custody right for the       purposes of the Convention       and can get his or her child back under the Convention if the child is       removed from one Contracting       State to another without that person's consent (or authorisation of a       court in that country).
The       book argued in favour of this interpretation at a time when views were       divided and this has helped       push the argument in favour of this approach in the courts of several       countries that have analysed       the issue (eg Australia, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa,       Switzerland and the UK)       and was the view adopted by the majority of the US Supreme Court in Abbott.
As of 26 July 2013 the Convention is in force in 90 States in the world,       see above.
The book is       frequently cited in the notes on the cases in the official database on the       Convention (INCADAT)       that is available to everyone free of charge, see http://www.incadat.com/index.cfm     As a result of his acknowledged expertise in the area Beaumont was a       consultant to the UK and       Scottish Governments from 1996 to 2013 on private international law.
He       represented the UK at       the Special Review Commission on the Hague Child Abduction Convention 2006       and advised the       UK delegation to the 2011 Special Review Commission to help develop       Recommendations and       Good Practice in relation to the Convention.
He has also given advice to       those Governments on       submissions to the Court of Justice of the European Union on the       appropriate interpretation of       provisions of the Convention which have been given effect to in EU law by       the Brussels IIa       Regulation (eg Case C-195/08 PPU Rinau v Rinau [2008] ECR       I-5271; Case C-211/10 PPU Povse       [2010] ECR I-6673; and Case C-497/10 PPU Mercredi v Chaffe       [2010] ECR I-14309).
The research contributed to and flows from Professor Beaumont's       membership of the UK Private       International Law Advisory Committee (since 1997) and his role as a lead       negotiator for the UK on       Hague Conference on Private International Law Conventions (Choice of Court       Agreements       Convention 2005, including the Working/Expert Groups on a possible sister       convention on       recognition and enforcement of judgments in 2013 and Maintenance       Convention 2007, including       the Special Commission of 2009 on that Convention) and of EU Regulations       (Brussels I (including       the recast in 2012), Rome I (2008), Rome II (2007), Succession (2012) and       Maintenance (2009)).
His role in creating these important new private international law       instruments is inextricably linked       with his research and they feed on each other.
This impact study concerns the impact on the law of international child       abduction of the OUP       monograph on that Convention of 1999 based on Paul Beaumont's co-authored       contribution to it.
