     The growing incidence of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis associated with       the increase in the aging       population presents a significant challenge in healthcare delivery.
Bone       cement is widely used in       joint replacement surgery, both within the UK and internationally.
In the       UK, cement fixation       (according to the UK National Joint Registry data) is used in around 50%       of the 75,000 total hip       replacements carried out each year and in over 80% of the 80,000 total       knee replacements.
Specific impacts of this research are:            The development of two new orthopaedic cement mixing and delivery         systems in         association with Summit Medical (Gloucester), enabling that firm to         achieve significant new         penetration of UK and international markets [A].
ncorporation of research outcomes on the mechanical enhancement of         screw fixation in         osteoporotic bone as a key element enabling Stryker Osteosynthesis to         obtain clinical         product approval of injectable cements and thus achieve significant new         penetration of the         global market [B].
Improved clinical outcomes in orthopaedic interventions resulting in         improved quality of life         and reduced healthcare costs.
Summit Medical: bone cement mixing and delivery systems       The impact on Summit Medical through the Teaching Company Scheme as       manifested in the       2008-2013 assessment period has been to gain new knowledge and       capabilities in respect of bone       cementing systems.
Original collaborative research has contributed to two       new commercial       products &#8212; Enhanced HiVac Bowl Bone Cement Mixing System and the HiVac         Bone Cement         Mixing and Delivery System.
The two HiVac systems are now in       widespread use with cemented       joint replacements.
Market share is stated by Summit Medical as: UK vacuum       bowl mixing systems       70%; UK syringe mixing systems 35%; US overall 15%.
These figures       translate into total global       sales 2009-2012 of &#163;36.1M (Summit Medical Ltd annual turnover at       31/03/2011 of &#163;13.27M       represents f0bb 50% of the Summit Medical Ltd turnover of &#163;27.62M) [A].
The 2012 sales of &#163;9.1M represent approximately 13% of the global market       estimated at $100M       (&#163;70M).
The HiVac systems also enjoy excellent clinical outcomes,       as evidenced in National Joint       Registries.
These outcomes impact directly on improved quality of life for       patients and reduced       clinical costs.
The development of testing and evaluation protocols during       the collaboration       contributed to the clinical adoption of these systems for their cemented       implant portfolio by leading       international orthopaedic companies (e.g.
DePuy Orthopaedics, Zimmer,       Wright Medical) [A].
Development of the HiVac systems has contributed to Summit       Medical becoming a world leader in       the supply of cement mixing systems.
Additional research insights gained       into the associated fields       of wound drainage valve design and femoral seal have further positively       impacted on raising the       professional image of Summit Medical within a very technical and       competitive commercial area.
The quality of the collaboration between the University researchers and       the company was       acknowledged with a TCS Certificate of Excellence that awarded the       programme `... the highest         grading by the TCS Grading Panel for its achievement in meeting ... TCS         objectives' in terms of       transferring knowledge, providing industry based training and enhancing       the partnership between       the university and business [C].
Additional impacts for Summit Medical from the TCS activity with Bath are       stated in [A] as:     `TCS scheme helped establish a training structure for new graduates/       young engineers.'
and the establishment of a product development department:     `R&amp;D Personal currently 5 persons at Summit Medical.'
Stryker Osteosynthesis: calcium phosphate cement for screw         augmentation in cancellous         bone       It has been estimated that more than 40% of women and 14% of men over the       age of 50 years will       experience fractures related to osteoporosis.
Dealing with these fractures       is significantly       complicated by poor bone quality.
Stryker Osteosynthesis had developed Hydroset,       an injectable       calcium phosphate cement for use in bone void-filling designed to augment       screw purchase in       weak osteoporotic bone.
Stryker sponsored research at Bath that led to new       knowledge about the       clinical benefits to be obtained from using Hydroset and       indicating significant improvements in pull-out       strength.
The chief impact of this work was in generating the technical       file compiled by Stryker       to obtain EU regulatory approval and FDA submission (ongoing) for clinical       use of this injectable       cement in screw augmentation procedures.
Approval was granted in 2008 and       Hydroset is now a       mainstream product of Stryker with an associated total income of $180M       since 2008 (income 2012       = $32M) representing a market share in this field of greater than 20%.
It       is stated, [B], by the       Senior Director, Biomaterials R&amp;D and Technical Marketing, Stryker       Osteosynthesis that:     `The first ever regulatory claim for CaP cement augmentation of         orthopaedic screws in         cancellous bone was granted by the T&#220;V Rheinland LGA in 2008.
This claim         (the data         submitted to the LGA) was substantially supported by studies done by the         Centre for         Orthopaedic Biomechanics, University of Bath.
....The added clinical         value is significant ... Bath         has been a key part of developing both the claim and enabling the         commercial success of         Hydroset.
The Centre for Orthopaedic Biomechanics is considered a centre         of excellence in this         field by Stryker Corp ...'     These products have also resulted in impact in terms of improved clinical       outcomes, as evidenced       by practitioner-generated publications:     `This cadaveric study indicates that supplementation of angular stable         screws with calcium         phosphate cement for the fixation of proximal humeral fractures         significantly reduces the risk of         glenohumeral screw penetration and enhances resistance to failure.'
[D];     `... augmentation with calcium phosphate cement (Hydroset) in the         treatment of proximal         humeral fractures with locked plates decreased fracture settling and         significantly decreased         intra-articular screw penetration.'
[E];     `... We believe that injectable osteoconductive calcium phosphate         bone cements may be a         useful adjunct in treating osteolytic cysts around well-fixed         knee-replacement components.'
[F].
In summary, in the case of the Summit Medical, the Enhanced HiVac         Bowl Bone Cement Mixing         System and the HiVac Bone Cement Mixing and Delivery System,       and the Stryker HydroSet Injectable Cement, that the market shares are testament to their       clinical adoption by practicing       orthopaedic surgeons from around the world.
