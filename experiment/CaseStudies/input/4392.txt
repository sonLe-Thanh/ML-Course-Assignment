     At the political and policy levels, Allen's research has informed         political thinking, encouraged engagement, and seen him established as a         key adviser to the British Government on Islamophobia and       anti-Muslim hate.
At the public and community levels, he has raised         awareness and facilitated debate across broad audiences       whilst sharing research findings and policy developments.
Allen's engagement activities began in 2009 when he was involved in a       range of different activities with Muslim organisations across the UK &#8212;       including the Muslim Council of Britain, Islamic Society of Britain,       Cordoba Foundation and Muslim Safety Forum &#8212; identifying the need for       Islamophobia to be afforded greater recognition politically.
In November       2009 Allen was invited as an expert panellist (one of five panellists,       including MEPs) to debate the problem Islamophobia presents to social       cohesion with Members of the European Parliament at the European       Parliament in Brussels.
The following month, he facilitated a symposium at       the University of Birmingham with approximately 150 local policymakers and       community activists where the outcomes from that year's activities were       shared and discussed.
These activities contributed to the calling of a closed Parliamentary         meeting in March 2010 that drew together a collaboration of       concerned parties to lobby for the establishment of an All Party       Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Islamophobia.
Allen supported the above       groups (also including the Runnymede Trust and the European Muslim       Research Centre) to draw together the necessary evidence to successfully       submit to Government.
An APPG on Islamophobia was duly launched in       November 2010.
Coinciding with the publication of Allen's monograph       entitled `Islamophobia' (Ashgate), the three co-chairs of the APPG &#8212; Simon       Hughes (Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey &amp; Old Southwark), Jack       Straw (Labour MP for Blackburn) and Kris Hopkins (Conservative MP for       Keighley &amp; Ilkley) &#8212; requested copies of the book.
This led to Simon       Hughes requesting a meeting with Allen in February 2012 to discuss the       future direction of the APPG and the best way to inform Government         thinking and the subsequent policies required.
A few months after,       Hughes approached Allen to research and deliver an independent report &#8212;       `"A momentous occasion": A report on the All Party Parliamentary Group       on Islamophobia and its Secretariat'.
In it, Allen identified some of the       challenges that might be encountered, those relating to Islamophobia's       contested nature, its lack of definition and the need for it to be seen as       an exclusionary phenomenon comparable with other similar phenomena such as       racism, homophobia and others (see source 1 below).
On 14 November 2011, Allen presented these findings in the form of both       oral and written evidence to the APPG (source 2).
Making nine       recommendations to the APPG including the need to establish a         policy-based working definition, the need to explore the         evidence base for Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate, collate       quantitative data relating to anti-Muslim hate crimes and to work closely       with the mooted Cross-Government Anti-Muslim Hate Working Group, Hughes       suggested these would provide the APPG with an indicative work programme       (work continues to move this forward).
Since then, Allen has worked in       partnership with the APPG and its Chairs, offering advice and support as       also presenting further oral and written evidence (Muslims in the media,       24 October 2012; Islamophobia post-Woolwich, 16 July 2013).
The co-chairs       of the APPG are clear that through his work with the APPG and beyond `Dr.         Allen's research and knowledge on Islamophobia has been, and will         continue to be, crucial in influencing the debate in           Parliament and amongst the public' (source 3).
In line with Allen's recommendation to the APPG, in January 2012 Allen       was approached to sit as an independent expert for the newly established       Cross-Government Anti-Muslim Hate Working Group in the Department of       Communities &amp; Local Government (CLG).
As part of this, he participates       in bi-monthly meetings to support Government in trying to improve         political understanding about Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate, its         drivers, causes and manifestations.
In doing so, Allen regularly       shares the findings from his existing and ongoing research to shape and       influence political and policy thinking.
This includes written       submissions, a number of which have focused on: the social and political       engagement of Muslim women; the political engagement of Muslim       representatives; similarities with the phenomena of anti-Semitism; and       Islamophobic attacks on mosques.
As part of his role on the Working Group,       Allen has been appointed co-lead of the Group's research workstream, a       role that requires him to highlight to Government where there are gaps         in evidence and knowledge in relation to Islamophobia and       anti-Muslim hate.
Allen's contribution has been described as `instrumental',       indeed, one policy advisor from CLG states that Allen's work on the group       and research contributions have helped him to `develop and improve           Government policy, particularly as it relates to         increasing reporting of anti-Muslim hatred' (source 4).
Out of the Working Group emerged a government funded project named `TELL       MAMA (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks)', a third party reporting service for       anti-Muslim hate crimes and incidents.
Having been requested to sit as a       member of the project's steering group by Government, Allen also spoke at       both the London and Birmingham launches where he noted how he had called       for the establishment         of something similar in an article written for the Daily         Telegraph in February 2010 (source 5).
He also welcomed the project       given it supported his earlier identification of the need for greater         evidence.
In November 2012, the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg       announced further funding for the project following a recommendation from       the Working Group (source 6).
Given her keen interest in the topic of Islamophobia and having seen the     various written submissions made to the APPG and Working Group by Allen,     Baroness Sayeeda Warsi (Minister for Communities &amp; Faith) has since     December 2012 been working in collaboration with him to raise awareness       and promote greater political recognition.
On 24 January 2013,     Baroness Warsi referenced what she described as Allen's "excellent" research     findings in a keynote speech in London (source 7).
At the same event, Simon     Hughes reiterated his admiration for Allen's research in a further public     speech.
Most recently, Warsi drew upon Allen's research knowledge about     Islamophobia in the West Midlands following a series of bomb attacks on     mosques in the Black Country region.
Meeting face to face (16 July 2013),     they discussed what might be an appropriate response by Government.
Indeed,     Warsi stated that `the advice and evidence provided to us by Dr Allen &#8212;     through his membership of our Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group; his position     on Tell MAMA's steering group and through his direct engagement with policy     makers and analysts &#8212; has helped us to develop our understanding of     this complex issue.
His depth of understanding of the issue following a     decade of working on it, and the rigour of his approach are particularly     valuable to us' (source 8).
In trying to ensure that research findings and policy developments are shared         at the public and community levels, in November 2012 Allen       facilitated an ESRC Festival of Social Science an event in Birmingham       titled, "From Pavement to Parliament: Shaping the policies to tackle       Islamophobia".
Bridging the divide geographically between Birmingham and       London as also the public and the political, the event brought together       those involved in the APPG and Working Group with local policymakers,       activists and communities.
Allen also has an active and well-followed       Twitter feed (@DrChrisAllen &#8212; around 1000 followers, daily tweets) and       blog (http://www.chris-allen.co.uk/), which       he uses for this purpose.
Allen's engagement with traditional media in the       UK and internationally is frequent and diverse, ensuring his research       reaches wide audiences.
Some examples of that coverage in the 2008-2013       period are through: Daily Telegraph (source 5); New Statesman (source 9);       Huffington Post (source 10): BBC Radio WM (source 11).
