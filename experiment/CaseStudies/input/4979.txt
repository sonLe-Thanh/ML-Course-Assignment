     IVFpredict informs National Institute for Health and Care           Excellence (NICE) guidelines on fertility     Improved prediction of IVF success allows women to be better informed       about the procedure, as well as to cope with emotional pressures and the       demanding treatment regimens.
The IVFpredict model was used to develop       best practice on prediction of IVF success and provision of patient       information in the NICE "Fertility: assessment and treatment for people         with fertility problems" guidelines published in February 2013.a       Nelson acted as external advisor during the development of these       guidelines.
In Chapter 13, "Prediction of IVF success", Nelson's       2011 PLoS Medicine paper1 was cited as one of four       studies used to define the factors that predict live birth success from       IVF therapy, which underpin recommendations 120-122 of the guidelines:            Recommendation 120: "Inform women that the chance of a live birth           following IVF treatment falls with rising female age."
Recommendation 121: "Inform people that the overall chance of a           live birth following IVF treatment falls as the number of unsuccessful           cycles increases."
Recommendation 122: "People should be informed that IVF treatment           is more effective in women who have previously been pregnant and/or           had a live birth."
A great deal of controversy exists surrounding which groups of women       should be eligible to receive NHS-funded IVF treatment.
Chapter 14 of the       NICE guidelines, "Access criteria for IVF", used the IVFpredict       model as one of two calculators to develop the NICE economic costing       model, which produced recommendations for access to NHS-funded IVF for       women aged 23-39 years.
The model defined estimates of IVF costs by age       and treatment strategy.
Furthermore, a total of 198 patient scenarios,       modelled for cost-effectiveness, are provided in the guideline appendix,       thereby providing a detailed reference for clinical decisions on access to       free treatment.b     Stimulating HFEA policy debate on embryo transfer number     The most significant risk of IVF therapy is the high probability of       multiple births, which is associated with increased rates of miscarriage,       premature birth, low birth weight and perinatal mortality (infant death       immediately before or after birth).
Approximately 20-30% of all IVF       pregnancies are multiple births, resulting from the transfer of multiple       embryos during treatment (intended to increase the chance of a successful       pregnancy).
HFEA imposes strict multiple birth targets on all licenced IVF       centres in the UK (set at 10% in October 2012), permitting the transfer of       three embryos only to women above 40 years (since 2009).
Shortly after the       publication of Nelson and Lawlor's 2012 Lancet paper,2       HFEA released a public statement acknowledging the value of their       findings,c which were subsequently reviewed by the HFEA       Multiple Birth Stakeholder Group and brought to the attention of the HFEA       Authority &#8212; the overarching committee determining HFEA Code of Practice       for IVF unit regulation &#8212; at their June 2013 meeting.
Key findings and       data from Nelson and Lawlor's 2012 Lancet paper2 were       presented at this meeting and consequently members agreed the following       decision to:     "Develop guidance for the Code of Practice which discouraged centres         from carrying out three-embryo transfers" (recorded in the meeting       minutes, 9.11, page 11)d     The revised HEFA Code of Conduct came into force on 1 October 2013.
According to 2011 data, around 48,000 women undergo IVF in the UK each       year.
Through influencing the development of evidence-based clinical       guidelines and stimulating revision to regulatory codes of practice,       University of Glasgow research has contributed to recommendations on       information and clinical treatment delivered to patients, and defined the       criteria for access to NHS-funded IVF therapy for all patients in the UK.
IVFpredict helps patients to understand their options and manage           expectations     The freely-available online IVFpredict calculator is a simple       questionnaire (nine questions) providing women with rapid (approximately 1       minute), accurate, evidence-based estimates of their percentage chance of       having a successful pregnancy and live birth following IVF treatment.
Armed with this information, women can make informed treatment choices and       have realistic expectations of the outcome.
The questionnaire is also       available via a smartphone application (at a small cost).f       Shortly after its release online in January 2011, IVFpredict received       extensive media coverage and promotion both nationally and worldwide,       including a 5-minute feature on ABC News in the USA (May 2011).g       Since then, more than 5 million individuals have accessed the IVFpredict       website (predominantly from Europe [39%], North America [24%] and Asia       [19%]), according to site traffic data), and over 700 people have       purchased the IVFPredict app providing them with a simple and accessible       way to obtain information about their treatment choices and outcomes.h     Recognition of the University of Glasgow work on personalised IVF     The impacts described above formed the basis of a University of Glasgow       submission to the Times Higher Education `Research Project of the Year'       awards (a category showcasing `significant economic, social, cultural         or other public benefit') and was one of only six entries       shortlisted.
The awards recognise `the excellence and amazing         achievements of UK higher education institutions' (winner to be       announced on 28 November 2013).i     Influencing patient access and prioritisation of IVF therapy     University of Glasgow researchers were the first in the world to       demonstrate that AMH levels could predict ovarian response before       commencement of IVF therapy.
This strategy has rapidly become recognised       as a leading mechanism by which to classify patients for treatment.
The       AMH Gen II assay was subsequently developed by Beckman Coulter, a       multinational company supporting innovations in biomedical testing.
The       EMEAI Scientific Manager Immunoassay, Beckman Coulter UK Ltd.,j       states: "The measurement of anti-M&#252;llerian hormone (AMH) is just         starting to become accepted into routine clinical practice in fertility         centres throughout the world.
Professor Nelson's work has clearly         established the benefit of the measurement of AMH in this setting by         demonstrating that use of AMH levels to individualise therapy results in         increased pregnancy rates and reduced complications."
Before any new       diagnostic test can become established in the healthcare pathway, clear       evidence is required that it both improves patient outcomes and reduces       the cost of care.
University of Glasgow research enabled Beckman Coulter       to establish this evidence base for the AMH Gen II assay and Nelson's       published papers are used as key proof and guidance for healthcare workers       who are unfamiliar with the use of the assay.
As such, "it is integral         to and underpins our whole marketing strategy which has resulted in the         transition of the measurement of AMH from a research tool into routine         clinical practice.
AMH is a premium product for Beckman Coulter and one         of our flagship immunoassays &#8212; European sales have trebled from 2008 to         2009."
The University of Glasgow research also formed the evidence basis for       inclusion of an AMH criterion in the NHS Scotland Pre-Implantation Genetic       Diagnosis and Screening Service framework (2011)j and has       therefore been instrumental in the access decisions and prioritisation of       women for IVF therapy across Scotland.
As a consequence, all women in       Scotland are required to meet a threshold level of circulating AMH levels       (of greater than 6 pmol/L) in order to be referred for IVF treatment.
