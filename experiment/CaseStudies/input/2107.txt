     Research work at Newcastle University has contributed to major       international standards and to the       development of the worldwide middleware software market currently valued       at $20bn [E1].
The       impact of this research work dates back to the late 90's and it has       continued to have substantial       impact into the 2008-13 period.
Hence the next section provides relevant       background.
Route to impact       Arjuna Technologies Ltd, whose origin dates back to 1998, is a spin-off       company founded by the       researchers (Shrivastava, Caughey, Wheater, Little and Ingham) to       commercialise the ground-       breaking results of the research into middleware technologies (Arjuna       system).
The structure of Arjuna [P1] and Activity Service [P2]       directly led to the development of two       transaction standards released by the international computer industry       standards consortium, OMG       [E2]; Object Transaction Service (OTS) and its enhancement, Additional         Structuring Mechanisms         for the OTS also known as the CORBA Activity service.
The       company built on this success by       creating a standards compliant transaction system product of the Arjuna       system ready for the       upcoming Java middleware market.
In 2005, the major Java middleware company, JBoss, bought the Arjuna       transaction system       software to enhance its product line (JBoss application server), and "gain       advantage over its main       competitor", BEA Inc. [E3] (now part of Oracle).
JBoss was later acquired       by Red Hat Inc., the       impact of which was market advantage and leadership for Red Hat in the       international open-source       enterprise application server market.
Red Hat subsequently opened the JBoss         Middleware         Development Unit at Newcastle in 2006.
A study [E4] conducted by the ACM Impact project in 2008 "to seek, on         a technology-by-         technology basis, the sources of the ideas, designs, and working         prototypes of widely used         software technologies" clearly identified the distributed systems       research work at Newcastle as       having played an influential part in the development of the multi-billion       dollar middleware industry,       specifically mentioning the Arjuna transaction system.
These developments have continued to affect the international middleware       market throughout the       impact period and have paved a path for further impact.
Contribution to open standards       The success of the middleware software industry is dependent on       conformance to open standards       for software components and services that "stimulate innovation, grow         global markets, and protect         the right of free choice of technology" (https://www.oasis-open.org/org).
OASIS is a global       standards consortium with members including Google, Microsoft, IBM and BAE       Systems.
The CORBA Activity service (see section Route to Impact),       itself an industry standard, formed the       basis of the OASIS WS-TX family of Web-service transaction standards which       include WS-AtomicTransaction         (WS-AT), WS-BusinessActivity (WS-BA) and WS-Coordination (WS-C)       approved by OASIS in 2009 [E5].
Dr Ian Robinson, Distinguished Engineer at       IBM and the Chair of       OASIS WS-TX Standards Committee, confirms that the origins of WS-C are in       the CORBA Activity         service [E6].
OASIS Web-service transaction standards are the de facto       standards so all major vendor's       products implement them; in addition to IBM (WebSphere) and Red Hat       (JBoss), these include       Oracle (WebLogic) and Microsoft (.NET on Windows).
It is conformance to       open standards that       has allowed the successful growth of the middleware industry.
Creating new business, improving the performance of existing         businesses       Within Red Hat, the original Arjuna transaction system software (ATSS)       continues to be of use in       enhancing their middleware products with customised transactional services       to meet new       application requirements.
ATSS was instrumental in the design of WS-TX       conformant Web-service       transaction protocols within JBoss that enabled Red Hat to produce, in       2008, the world's first       implementation [E7].
Two additional cases, both spurred on by the       increasing popularity of cloud       computing deserve specific mention.
(i) `RESTful' Web-services &#8212; a new way of application structuring &#8212; has       gained prominence lately       but unfortunately these services are unable to make use of WS-TX       transaction protocols.
Red Hat       were the first to produce a customised transaction solution, in 2010, and       theirs is the only open       source product offering RESTful transactions [E7].
(ii) Cloud based applications are increasingly making use of new types of       database systems, often       referred to as NOSQL databases, for gaining high scalability;       unfortunately most of these       databases have little transactional support.
Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a       notable exception,       offering transactions.
JBoss has allowed Red Hat to compete in the middleware market with other       major vendors with       products like WebSphere (from IBM) and WebLogic (from Oracle).
In fact,       the Web-service       transaction module (WS-BA) within IBM's WebSphere application server, the       world's dominant       commercial application server, is also implemented as an Activity         service (result of Newcastle       research) [E6].
In summary, ATSS has helped Red Hat to produce enhanced products.
In       2011, Red Hat released       their new product OpenShift, a PaaS (Platform-as-a-service)       solution for the cloud which integrates       closely with JBoss (which uses Java Enterprise Edition), indicating that "With         this new integration,         OpenShift becomes the first PaaS in the industry to deliver Java         Enterprise Edition (EE) 6,         simplifying how application developers build and deploy Java in the         cloud".
In 2012, Red Hat       announced its cloud computing strategy, with "plans to deliver the         OpenShift cloud application         platform available as a PaaS for enterprises in an open and hybrid         cloud.......we expect the         enterprise PaaS market to be worth more than $3 billion by 2015"       (press archives [E9]).
Besides the benefit to Red Hat, follow-on beneficiaries include those       that use this software to       enhance their operations, e.g.
Autotrader UK, Brazil's Ministry of Health       and Frost Bank USA who       have all reported benefits like improved business performance, better       security, reliability and       efficiency (case studies available at [E8]).
Arjuna Technologies, economic benefits &amp; transfer of knowledge           to industry       The impact presented above is on the growing international middleware       market of Web       technologies and cloud computing.
The research has also had an impact by       bringing part of the       economic benefit of this growth to the UK.
It is estimated that Arjuna       Technologies has contributed       over $19M gross value-added (GVA) to the region in shareholder return,       salaries and infrastructure       spend (all from US-based software companies), and provided over 150       person-years of high       technology employment [E10].
The purchase of the Arjuna transaction system software and proximity to       research expertise in the       areas of middleware and cloud computing played a large part in Red Hat       deciding to create an       R&amp;D centre outside of the USA in 2010 [E11].
The centre is estimated       to have contributed $15M       GVA and 75 person-years of high-tech employment.
The presence of Arjuna and Red Hat has strengthened the UK's links with       &amp; investment from major       global businesses in the field [E10].
A number of highly skilled people       have taken up specialist       roles in industry that draw on their research at Newcastle University: the       researchers, Caughey       and Wheater are respectively, CEO and CTO at Arjuna Technologies.
Ingham       is a Program       Manager at Microsoft, Redmond, and Little is Vice President of Engineering       and Fellow at Red Hat.
