     Ford's research (and other Scriptural Reasoning research hosted by CIP)       has led to SR activity in       multiple contexts outside academia.
The underpinning research explores the       nature and       implications of SR; it has now been put into practice in these varied       contexts.
The flow is not simply       one-way, however: reflection on the experience of SR in these contexts       feeds into on-going       research and shapes extension of SR to new audiences.
In this way, diverse       audiences are drawn       into SR practice, and into the process by which SR theory and practice are       refined and extended.
Examples include:             Schools and young people.
Following discussions with         Ford and CIP, London-based         inter-faith group, The Three Faiths Forum, developed (from 2008) a form         of SR aimed at         schools: `Tools4Trialogue', drawing on Islamic, Christian and Jewish         texts on themes         relevant to school children.
Their most popular programme is `Bling!
Beauty, Modesty and         Clothing'.
They reach c. 5000 children in 70 schools each year, in 17         London boroughs and         some districts beyond.
The programme's effectiveness was confirmed by an         independent         team from the University of Warwick's Religions and Education Research         Unit, led by Julia         Ipgrave; she found that `contrary to common assumptions about the lack         of appeal of         sacred texts to young people', the programme enabled teenagers to         `engage in detail with         the texts' in ways that interested them and facilitated dialogue         (Ipgrave, 2011, 8 [4]).
Medical practitioners in Israel/Palestine.
CIP has         funded a project by the Middle East         branch of The Three Faiths Forum.
In 2010, following discussions with         Ford and CIP, 10         Scriptural Reasoning groups, each comprising 20 to 40 doctors, nurses         and medical         students from Israel and the Palestinian territories, were created in         Hadassah Hospital, Ein         Karem, and Kaplan Medical Centre, Rehovot (with a similar level of         activity in subsequent         years).
The impact of the activity is described in (Feldman-Kaye, 2011         [2]).
As one         participant summarised it, `I have never studied Torah with Christians         and Muslims, even         though they are good friends of mine.
It was difficult but in the end         eye-opening,         challenging ...
I am now rethinking the way I view others in Israel, and         my interactions with         them in hospital when I become a doctor ... it was completely new,         enjoyable, and         surprising - every student should do this.'
Stephen Shashua, Director of         the Three Faiths         Forum, said that SR was `highly innovative as a model for engagement and         pushes         participants to explore areas that oftentimes they have never explored         before.'
Local communities.
CIP has facilitated the creation of         community Scriptural Reasoning         groups around the country, and is in regular contact with groups in         Manchester,         Birmingham, Preston, Dundee, St Andrews, York, Durham, Berlin, T&#252;bingen,         Heidelberg         and elsewhere and in touch with groups in Blackburn and Bolton,         Bradford, Kirkby Stephen,         Edinburgh, and several groups in London.
CIP currently employs a         part-time SR facilitator         to assist new and existing groups.
St Ethelburga's Centre for Reconciliation and Peace.
St         Ethelburga's is an inter-faith         centre in central London, with which CIP has been working since 2006.
Thanks to that         partnership, Scriptural Reasoning has become a key strand of St         Ethelburga's work.
It is         part of their `Faith and Citizenship Training' (in co-operation with         London Citizens) (Diocese         of London, 2012) and part of their core approach to `build[ing]         inter-religious relationships         [5; see also 1].
Prisons.
Since 2012, CIP has been developing a programme         of Scriptural Reasoning with         prison chaplains (trialling SR with regional chaplains at Highpoint,         contributing to the         National Offender Management Service regional prison chaplain training         and beginning a         programme of SR with chaplains and staff in Whitemoor and prisoners (a         trial SR group         with 25 Christian and Muslim female prison inmates in Holloway).
The         chaplain to         Whitemoor Prison said, `I would judge the experience of SR as the most         significant         development towards a deeper level of multi-faith working within         chaplaincy teams that has         taken place since their instigation some ten years ago when the guiding         principles were set         out' and that his hope `would be that SR becomes established as a         regular tool in the         working of prison chaplaincies and used at prison team meetings and         Regional meetings /         national conferences.'

Online SR. CIP was awarded &#163;288,680 from the Research         Councils UK Digital Economy         `Research in the Wild' Programme to develop an online implementation of         Scriptural         Reasoning.
The programme ran for 18 months from September 2011, during         which time 15         groups, comprising a total of 60 individuals, participated in SR groups         on the system         (Higton, 2013 [3]); Online SR is now an established component of the         programme (see         http://www.scripturalreasoning.org/scriptural-reasoning-goes-virtual).
