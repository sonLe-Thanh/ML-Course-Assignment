     The impact of the research is evidenced as follows, under the three       themes identified above.
The introduction of contemporary creative practices into strategies         for teaching and learning     4.1 A key partner and collaborator institution, Tate Liverpool,       the research into contemporary       creative education has brought about changes in the methods gallery staff       use to work with the       public.
Their professional development and training is affected by       doctoral research at the gallery,       supervised by Adams, into participatory, learner-centred pedagogies.
The       impact of these new       approaches is evidenced in the Tate's research and policy reviews (2013).
4.2 Room 13, the young children's `International Community of       Creatives' have collaborated with the       iJADE and RECAP conferences (2011) and Adams has carried out       extensive research into their       work over many years, influencing their unorthodox pedagogical approaches.
Adams was a       contributor delegate at Room 13's presentation to the Scottish       Parliament's symposium (Hollyrood,       Edinburgh, April 2013) on creativity.
Adams's work and influence is cited       on the Room 13 website.
4.3 In Finland, with key collaborator Theatre Academy of Finland       (TAF), Owens' Master Courses at       TAF, spanning 17 years (1995-2013) for multi-professional groups, have       seen the establishment of       Pre-texts by professionals in theatres, prisons, education, health and       business.
Owens' Pre-texts       publication has been translated into a joint edition with a new foreword       on impact in 2010, and is       required reading for drama pedagogues in Finnish universities.
Owens has       also worked on 15 other       projects in the universities, prisons, city theatres and the Tampere       Theatre Festival, reaching       approximately 2,000 participants.
4.4 RECAP is supervising four doctoral students (drama and theatre       practitioner educators) from       Sweden with a visiting research fellow from the University of Stockholm.
Practice-based research       here (2007-2013) has lead to the widespread reconceptualisation and use of       creative approaches       with young people and other client groups, emanating from the four groups       and Swedish arts       institutions in which our students are based.
The significance of contemporary creative pedagogies for intercultural         understanding and         conflict resolution     4.5 In Palestine (1996- 2013) Adams' and Owens' research into the       comparative intercultural use of       creative pedagogies, with key collaborators the University of Bethlehem       and An Najah University,       with 20 primary school beginning teachers in the British Academy funded       research (2012-15).
Owens has been researching with Palestinian institutions and cultural       groups since 1995, including       all 11 universities in the West Bank and Gaza, including the World Bank       project (2011/2012), see       World Bank report).
New artistic forms have brought about change in       educational practices in arts       and community groups (e.g.
creative pedagogy at Al Rowwad Children's       Theatre in the Aida       Refugee Camp), and in West Bank institutions (e.g.
the introduction of       creative pedagogies in West       Bank primary schools in partnership with Bethlehem Univeristy) and in       colleges (new creative       practices and resource room at Alrowwda Technical College, Nablus).
The       number of colleagues       participating in workshops between 1996 and 2013 is approximately 1,400.
4.6 For education professionals in Cheshire Local Government, the       impact has been around the       means of creating spaces for dialogue about tensions between Gypsy, Roma       Traveller and settled       communities; Owens has held 21 research based workshops and performances       with 350 young       people, 254 teachers and members of the wider education workforce       including governors councillors       and local government officers (2010-2013).
The incorporation of creativity into education policies and curricula         worldwide     4.7 The creativity research in Japan (2000-2013), with key       collaborators Taichi Kikaku Theatre       Company Tokyo, Japan, NEC, Tokyo University of Technology, Japan, and       National Children's       Theatre Association, Japan, has seen the application of Pre-text workshops       incorporated into the       training of voice actors, including NEC (the largest training course in       Japan), children's theatre       practitioner training (NJCTA).
Owen's 22 performances and workshops in       Japan and the UK, over       13 years, have involved approximately 2,500 participants and included       three reviews in the       Japanese National Children's Theatre Association's publication.
4.8 Adams has twice been invited to the Korean Art Education       Association (KoSEA), 2012-13, to       deliver keynotes and publish papers in the Association's annual       international conference publication.
The 150 delegates represent schools and colleges across the Republic.
Practitioner contributors       (submitted to iJADE and iJADE conferences, 2010-13) from       Korea cite Adams' work and use his       critical methodology in their pedagogical development.
4.9 Eighteen executive managers and business consultants engaged       in the Tekes National Finnish       funded research project Manager 2.0 Investigating `New       Leadership'.
(2012/2013).They have       employed arts based initiative methods in their own organisations and       consultancies; they range       from small to medium enterprises employing between 100-150 people; A       leading feature article in       the leading Finnish business journal FAKTA ( No 20, 2013 (3) pp.18-23)       reported on the project.
NB: Owens' and Adams' combined body of practice-based research has       attracted more than       &#163;270,000 of funding.
