     Visitors to Agents of Change commented that the exhibitions       changed the way in which they       perceived photography and, through photography, understood global       politics.
There was also an       impact on the artists who participated in the Biennial &#8212; some of whom       re-conceptualised their work       as a result of the exhibition &#8212; and on a particular group of students, who       saw art history, and the       connections between art and politics, in a new way.
The impact is       confirmed by quantitative       indicators, critiques, citations in various media and evidence of public       engagement.
Impact on visitors       The Biennial attracted 63,100 visitors from 6 October to 4 November         2012, an improvement on         the next-largest Biennial attendance in 2010, with 60,000 visitors [see         Section 5, C1].
The         special issue of Photoworks magazine had a readership of over         10,000 [C2].
The specific impact on visitors and readers can be demonstrated through         documented         responses, in terms of formal evaluation [C3], posts on online blogs and         forums [C4] and short         responses posted on social networking sites such as Twitter [C5].
There         were about 40         mentions of BPB12 or @photoworks_uk on social networking sites each day.
These frequently         make reference to a new or expanded engagement with the role that images         play in relation to         political activism, and show a heightened awareness of specific issues         spotlighted through         Burbridge's research, including the use of military drones in Pakistan,         the effects of Control         Orders, the aims of squatters, and the way in which urban explorers use         photography to lend         transparency to the urban environment.
When BPB12 featured among the         most-used Twitter         hash-tags in the Brighton area during the Biennial's opening weekend,         visitors were responding         to discussions and exhibitions generated through Burbridge's research.
Agents of Change received significant local, national and         international media attention.
This         drew attention to the politics of the exhibition as framed by Burbridge         and, because of the         density of coverage, had the potential to influence numerous members of         the public both to visit         the Biennial and to think about the issues Burbridge raised [C6].
In         addition, Burbridge was         invited to write about his work on art and squatting for the Guardian         website; he appeared on         BBC South TV to talk about the images of local protest, and was         interviewed twice on local         radio about the overarching framework for Agents of Change.
The         festival was also reviewed in         all the major photography publications, including Aperture, Foam,           Source, Photo Monitor and         Culture24 [C7.1, C7.2].
It received a substantial review from         Sarah James in the January issue         of Frieze [C7.3].
Impact on students       The Biennial outreach programme targeted 70 AS-Level students from         state-run sixth-form         colleges.
The sessions with the students dealt with issues including the         political uses of         photography, the impact of digitisation, the roles played by museums and         galleries, and the         relationships between context and meaning.
Evaluation shows that many of         the students had         not thought about these issues before; several had never attended an         exhibition of this nature         [C8].
Their responses show that Agents of Change also increased         their understanding of Art         History as a discipline, a type of impact important for the field.
The         Biennial also attracted         registered visits from at least 15 colleges and institutions of         learning; UCL lecturers notified us         that essays on Agents of Change were written by the group from         UCL Art History.
Impact on artistic practice       Burbridge's research affected artists, activists and staff involved         with the Biennial.
It shaped         understandings of their own practices through an engagement with the         Biennial's overarching         theme, at the same time as creating further professional opportunities         based on the exposure it         provided.
Staff at the Biennial have spoken about the ways in which the         research affected their         understanding of photography's place in contemporary culture, and         recorded that Burbridge's         self-reflexive approach to curating will shape their future work.
For         example, Oliver Whitehead,         Programme and Participation Coordinator with Photoworks, has         started a collaborative project         based upon artistic interventions in different public spaces [C9.1],         while Photoworks has         revised its approach to commissioning to open further dialogues between         art photography and         mass cultural image-practices corroboration [C9.2].
Political activists         and academics Alex         Casper and Bradley Garrett have commented on ways in which the Biennial         made them aware         of links between their activities and aspects of contemporary-art         practice [C9.3].
Artists Ronnie         Close, Corinne Silva, Jason Larkin and Thompson and Craighead have each         spoken about the         importance of the dialogues manufactured through Burbridge's research in         understanding their         own practice, and the work they plan to produce.
[C9.4] They have also         pointed to the         invitations to exhibit and lecture about their work that have arisen as         a direct result of their         involvement with Agents of Change.
