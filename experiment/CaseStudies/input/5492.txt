     The research carried out for the UK Health and Safety Executive resulted       in changes in its recording of accidents at work; the establishment by the       HSE of a migrant workers website (http://www.hse.gov.uk/migrantworkers/worker.htm)       designed to provide essential information, guidance and advice on       workplace health and safety for workers from overseas and their employers.
The HSE also now employs five health and safety officers with a direct       remit on investigating health and safety in workplaces where migrants are       employed.
It also operates a confidential telephone service with advice in       different languages and translates its basic materials into 20 languages,       all as a direct result of McKay's research as the Head Policy Adviser,       Vulnerable Workers Health and Safety Policy Team, Strategic Interventions       Division, Health and Safety Executive states:     `Sonia McKay's 2006 report for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE),         The Health and Safety of Migrant Workers in England and Wales, was         important in shaping HSE's future policy and operational approach to         ensuring the health and safety of migrant workers.
A number of the 11         recommendations addressed specifically to HSE in the report directly         influenced the development of HSE's policies on this topic, while all of         the remainder were influential in shaping more broadly the         organisation's thinking and approach.'
(26/06/2013)     The ACAS commissioned research resulted in an ACAS policy paper on       employer use of migrant labour published in December 2011 as part of its Future         of Workplace Relations Discussion Paper Series.
The paper offers a       new model for future workplace relationships arguing that they will be       dependent on the extent to which employers can accommodate the wider       social and welfare needs of migrant workers.
The Acas Senior Policy       Advisor, Acas Strategy Unit, has provided the following statement:     `We've worked a lot with Sonia over the years, most recently on a         discussion paper about work place relations and migrant work.
This is         part of a series for practical use by organisations.
It has an external         circulation list of over 900, to a mixed audience of employers, trade         unions, policy people and the press'.
(04/06/2013)     McKay's work has also impacted on wider migrant communities as the       Director of the Migrant Rights Network, indicates:     `Sonia's work has helped us better understand the situation and         informed a lot of our influencing work with government.
It takes several         years to see change happen in an environment which is hostile though.
But there is now greater appreciation among policy workers that migrant         workers are not all criminals, and that they are people struggling to         get by and earn a living.
There is also a greater awareness of how         enforcement measures, by bodies such as the UK Border Agency, have been         influenced by race discrimination as witnessed by their focus on closing         ethnic businesses.'
(04/06/2013)     Additionally McKay's work on vulnerable and migrant workers is also       acknowledged in the following statement from the Head of the Economic and       Social Affairs Department of the Trades Union Congress:     `Sonia's research helped highlight the challenges for vulnerable         workers and to improve their conditions of work.
The immediate impact of         the research was that it was included in the Commission's final report.
As this was presented to the PM (Gordon Brown) and to Ministers across a         range of departments, it contributed to the political debate.
There were         moves to reform Employment Rights Enforcement, including removing some         of the legal barriers to sharing information between different         departments, in areas such as the minimum wage and HMRC.
This report         helped that process.
A cross-departmental Pay and Workers Rights         Helpline was also established, which people could call on for a wide         range of issues.
As well as providing extensive support it was also an         attempt to move away from the former pattern where people would have to         phone different departments for different things.
The Helpline still         exists, with extended out of hours access, and following on from one of         Sonia's recommendations it is available in over 100 languages.'
(21/06/2013)     McKay also produced for the European Commission an EC policy brief based       on her Undocumented Workers' Transitions research.
Directly       arising from her research she was appointed as one of three peer reviewers       on the government inquiry into the underlying causes of construction fatal       accidents, resulting in the report to the UK Parliament: One Death is         Too Many (July 2009).
She has been an invited keynote speaker at a       number of policy directed conferences, including a TUC conference on       vulnerable employment (December 2011); a round table discussion with film       maker Ken Loach (November 2010); to a 200 strong conference in Frankfurt       of civil servants and lawyers organised by the European Labour Law       Network, the advisory group to the European Commission (October 2013) and       at the Centre for Parliamentary Studies, Brussels (January 2010).
