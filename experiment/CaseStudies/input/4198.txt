     Since 2008 impact has been on an international scale with close       collaborations having been developed with major multinational medical       device company DePuy Synthes (Johnson &amp; Johnson), the largest, most       comprehensive orthopaedic and neurological business in the world.
New       surgical techniques being disseminated to the international orthopaedic       community.
Furthermore the research can be related to current and future       improved quality of life for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery.
Custom Hip Technology     The aim of the custom hip factory was to enhance survival outcomes of       total hip replacements through restoration of natural geometries,       biomechanics and fixation.
Over 4,000 custom hip joints were implanted         during a 15 year period, commencing in 1991.
The hip joint factory       (consisting of precision CAD/CAM manufacturing tools and two full time       staff, employed by DePuy Synthes) in association with DEB's surgical team       consistently achieved hip joint placement within 6mm of natural joint         centre.
Joint placement tolerance of 10mm and above is perceptible       to the patient and was the standard achieved for conventional hip joint       replacement surgery over the same period.
The aims have been realised and outcomes continue 20 years on from the       first joints being implanted.
The major impacts being on patients'         qualities of life and confidence in their activities to maintain         employment and leisure pursuits.
A 10 year outcomes review indicated       77% of patients were still living in 2008 and, of the 464 cases reviewed,       only 2.2% had required full revision surgeries within the review period       compared to rates of 10% revision reported elsewhere [3].
Of the 23% of       review cases that had deceased prior to 2008, all died with a functioning       total hip replacement in situ [reference 2, section 3].
Surgical Device Development     Instrumentation originally designed to facilitate accurate placement of       custom hip implants continues to be used and developed by the QUB team to       reduce the incidences of leg length inequalities.
In the majority       of cases, it is the misplacement of the femoral component that results in       a clinically significant leg length discrepancy.
This can transform an       excellent clinical result with respect to range of motion, pain relief and       function into a surgical failure due to patient dissatisfaction.
Leg         length inequality, particularly a long operated leg, is also the most         common source of litigation following joint replacement in the United         States [4] and fourth most common in the UK.
Through use of a calliper measurement instrument, improvements in leg         length discrepancy have been achieved and demonstrated.
The first       generation calliper has been used in over 4,000 conventional hip         replacement surgeries since 2005 (over 2,000 since 2008).
This       device achieves placements within 6mm of target measurements and below the       level of patient perception.
This has been through collaboration with       DePuy Synthes, Leeds, UK, who have provided long-term funding and       technical support.
The third generation calliper has now been designed and is based on the       same fundamental principles as the first generation device.
Prototypes       have been both manufactured and laboratory validated using QUB facilities.
This project is now in partnership with DePuy Synthes, who have provided       funding in the region of &#163;115,000 for its development.
The benefit of         the third generation device is that it is independent of hip joint         design, therefore can be used for placement of any design produced by         any manufacturer.
Once the design is finalised, it will undergo       clinical trials with the eventual aim of launching the device to their       entire hip joint replacement market.
The only alternative to using the calliper is computer-aided surgery       (CAS) for assisting the surgeon in achieving correct component placement.
However, the added cost and increase in theatre time have inhibited       widespread take-up of CAS.
Therefore the calliper technology is the         only economical and clinical proven method to achieve accurate component         placement on a repeatable basis.
