     Given the social salience of gender, and the potential for our beliefs       about it to perpetuate inaccurate stereotypes and justify discrimination,       it is important that the findings of language and gender research, and the       arguments they give rise to, should be put in the public domain,       contextualized and made accessible to those without specialist linguistic       knowledge.
Cameron has done just that, bringing to public attention the       erroneous nature of many common assumptions about male and female language       use, enabling more informed debate, and dislodging some entrenched myths.
In 2007 Cameron published The Myth of Mars and Venus, a book       written at her own instigation for a general audience but based firmly on       academic research, including substantial reference to her own.
The book       gained significant media exposure.
Reviewers for newspapers, journals,       blogs, and customer feedback websites regularly commented on the force and       wit with which it debunked the account of gender and language popularised       by John Gray's Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus - a myth       that, at the time Cameron entered the debate, had `mutated to scientific       fact' (Daily Telegraph review).
`Cameron exposes numerous       weaknesses in how such books substantiate their claims', wrote one 2008       reviewer: `She shows that they over-emphasise insignificant linguistic and       cross-cultural research findings of difference between men and women's       talk, whereas the more common finding, that there are very few differences       between them and significantly more variation among groups of the same       gender, goes unreported.
... [W]hy does all this matter?
Myths ... shape       our beliefs and influence our actions.
This particular myth is deeply       embedded in our culture and provides a way of talking about and explaining       social relations that is deeply flawed and harmful.'
(Red Pepper       February 2008).
Numerous members of the public responded to the book on-line: `We need       more books like this one', is a typical comment: `[Cameron] describes how       scientific evidence can be manufactured or twisted to suit the prejudices       of our society.
She explores why these myths so often "ring true" for so       many people (humans are suggestible and prone to remember things that fit       their stereotypes, while forgetting things that don't), and why we're so       obsessed with gender and gender difference in the first place' (comments       collected on amazon.co.uk).
Parts of Mars and Venus were serialised in The Guardian,       with a follow-up article by Steven Poole (20 Oct 2007).
To date, the book       has sold more than 682,300 copies and netted revenue of &#163;49,450 for OUP.
Its high profile opened up opportunities for other kinds of engagement       with non-academic audiences such as teachers, school students,       professionals, and the public at large.
The range of the activities       outlined below gives evidence of the interest this work has generated       outside academe, and the benefits it has had for particular groups of       non-academics.
Updating and enriching the teaching of language and gender in           secondary schools.
`Language and gender' is a standard topic on         the main examining boards' syllabi for English Language A-level.
Cameron's research has had direct impact on the teaching of the topic at         A-level.
The Myth of Mars and Venus is recommended reading for         A-level students (see the AQA Resources Lists for English Language A and         B); in addition, she features extensively on Kerboodle (online resources         produced by Nelson Thornes, the publishers of the two A-level textbooks         originally sanctioned by AQA as the "official" resources for the two         A-levels in English Language; these sell around 20,000 copies a year to         A-level students).
She has taken part in training events for teachers         and English subject advisors, and speaks regularly at conferences for         English Language A-level students organized by the English and Media         Centre in London and by Language Live around the country -large events,         typically attracting 800 or 1000 participants.
Through the book and         through her subsequent contact with teachers and students, Cameron's         work on language and gender has helped to update and enrich the teaching         of the subject at A-level, feeding in recent research findings and         moving the approach used at A-level closer to the approach used by         academic researchers.
The current Chair of Examiners for AQA reports         that `Cameron's books have been very useful within our English Language         examining community' and that the exam board has used extracts from The           Myth of Mars and Venus on exam papers `to counter the types of         gender discourses promoted by writers such as John Gray'[1].
EMC conference organiser Dan Clayton confirms that `Debbie's talks at         the English and Media Centre's English Language Conference have gone a         long way towards updating both teachers' and A-level students'         understanding of the field of language and gender.
In the past, there         has often been a tendency for A-level students to uncritically accept         stereotyped models of gender difference in spoken interaction, so         Debbie's work, drawing on The Myth of Mars and Venus, has been         excellent in offering a more nuanced understanding of differences         between and within the sexes.
In addition to the lectures at the         conference, her research update, published on the EMC website, has         proved very useful in helping teachers keep up to date with the most         recent work on gender'[2].
In 2011 Cameron was invited to         become a patron of the English and Media Centre.
Enabling professional groups to engage with issues of language and           gender.
As noted under (2) above, there are various professional         groups other than educators to whom issues of language and gender are of         practical relevance and concern.
Cameron has been approached by         representatives of some of these groups to write articles for their         professional or trade publications, such as The Psychologist,         published by the British Psychological Association, and In Depth,         a trade journal for qualitative market researchers.
She also contributed         on 6 November 2010 to a day seminar for women in (or considering going         into) politics, organised jointly by Camden Speakers' Association and a         number of women's political organisations.
Laura Nelson, who organised         the occasion, reports that Cameron's `impassioned and informative speech         ...designed to inspire young men and women to aspire to leadership         positions and not to be bound by false limitations of gender stereotypes         ... helped the audience understand more about how powerful language is         in restricting our perceptions of ourselves.'
Enhancing public understanding of language, linguistics and gender           research.
Thanks initially to the public interest in Mars and           Venus, Cameron has been widely sought after as a contributor to         broadcast media and other forms of public engagement with language.
She         is regularly interviewed about her research and its topic.
Several of         these interviews have been on serious radio and TV programmes which aim         to educate as well as entertain.
Some programmes in this category are         specifically devoted to language, e.g.
BBC Radio 4's series Fry's           English Delight, which made an extended version of the broadcast         interview available as a podcast; Swedish National Radio's weekly         programme Spr&#229;ket [`the language'][4]; and the         Canadian TV documentary `Love in 2013: Mars and Venus today' made by         Endless Media and broadcast on CBC, 14 Feb 2013 (9pm) (repeats on CBC         News Network Sat 16 Feb, 11PM ET and Sunday 17 Feb at 6 PM ET).
The         producer and editor of Spr&#229;ket comments that Cameron's         `knowledge of the international trends in linguistic research and her         ability to make theory clear to a general audience were valuable         contributions to the program and much appreciated and commented on by         our listeners.'
Cameron has given invited talks at public events connected with         language-themed exhibitions, such as the `Our Speaking Selves'         conference (17 May 2009, 104 attendees) which accompanied an exhibition         devoted to the human voice at the Institute for Contemporary Art in         2009, and the British Library's `Evolving English' exhibition in 2011.
In 2010 she was one of four panellists at a forum debate on `Gendered         Behaviour: What Can Science Tell Us?'
(Kings Place, London, 16         November), hosted by the University of Cambridge Centre for Gender         Studies in association with The Guardian and supported by         Cambridge University Press.
The extent to which Cameron set the         parameters for discussion is indicated by how The Guardian         framed the debate in advance: `She takes issue with one of the central         claims that women have superior verbal abilities; some speculate that         this is linked to brain structure, others that it has an evolutionary         explanation.
Cameron sees both as purely speculative, and insists that         explanations of difference must take account of three much more prosaic         factors.
... [1] that verbal behaviour is linked to "activity type" -         what someone usually spends much of their time doing.
... [2] verbal         differences reflect differences in power and status.
...where status is         not a factor there is no difference between men and women.
... [3]         Cameron argues that we use language to project our identity ... to         distinguish our sense of who we are in terms of class, life role as well         as gender, and all of these identities are socially constructed.
Factor         out these variables, and you're left with no clear-cut differences in         how men and women use language.'
The podcast recording on the Guardian         website attracted 132 comments in the 2 days open for responses.
In 2012         Cameron spoke on language, gender and sexism in a series of public talks         organised by the Instituto Cervantes in London under the heading         `Linguistica para todos' (`linguistics for all') and attended largely by         Spanish-speakers living in the UK (total audience c. 30).
She is         regularly contacted by listeners and audience members who wish to canvas         her opinion on questions of language, and features extensively on         popular blogs and discussion sites debating these matters.
Contributing to the quality and vitality of our cultural life.
Cameron has spoken about her work on language and gender at the Oxford         Literary Festival (April 2008), The Edinburgh Book Festival (August         2008), the Cambridge Festival of Ideas (October 2012), and most recently         the Hay Philosophy Festival in conversation with Simon Blackburn and         Carol Gilligan on gender, language and thought (May 2013; tickets sold         out).
She has contributed to the work of the Royal Shakespeare Company,         which asked her to conduct a workshop on language and gender conflict         for the cast of its 2008 production of The Taming of the Shrew         as part of their rehearsal and preparation programme; she         contributed a short essay on the same topic for the programme offered to         audience members at performances of the play in Stratford.
