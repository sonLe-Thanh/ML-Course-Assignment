     This research has positively impacted the way in which public, private       and third sectors specifically approach PPP procurement at the following       levels:                                Impact                 level 1:            Economic,               commercial and organisational - through improving             processes; increasing effectiveness of practice; and the governance             of private business entities.
Impact                 level 2:            Public policy             - through helping shape public sector PPP procedures, thereby             improving infrastructure delivery to the benefit of society.
Impact                 level 3:            Environment             - through positive influence on professional practice to inform PPP             guidelines and shape future service provision.
4.1 Evidence     The above three levels of impact are verified in the following five       evidence descriptors.
In order to aid clarity, each descriptor is       cross-referenced with `sources to corroborate each impact' (Section 5)       along with their associated `impact levels'.
This correlation is presented       in parentheses form at the end of each descriptor.
1) UoA research continually and directly influences international and       organisational industrial practice.
Examples of this include:     a) National Public Private Partnership Guidelines (Queensland       Government, 2009).
The PPP research report by Akintoye on `VfM         and Risk Allocation Models in Construction PPP Projects' informed       the development of the risk allocation element, of the High Level Value       Drivers of an Abridged Partnership Model within the Queensland Guidelines.
(Impact levels 1 and 2; Corroborative source 1).
b) The Asian Development Bank (ADB) report `Public Private         Partnership Infrastructure Projects: Case Studies from the Republic of         Korea' (Asian Development Bank, 2011) relied extensively on the PPP       research products of Akintoye.
The ADB report informed development       of institutional arrangements and performance for the Republic of Korea,       to underpin development of an institutional PPP framework and regulatory       PPP reforms.
(Impact level 2; Corroborative source 2).
2) Internationally, CIB TG72 has positively impacted on understanding,       awareness and the practical application of PPP.
For example, in 2009,       Kumaraswamy and Akintoye led the CIB TG72 Conference, "Revamping       PPPs: From `Revisiting and Rethinking' to `Revamping and Revitalising'       PPPs".
Participants included government bodies, contractors and consulting       firms in stakeholder management engaging in: benchmarking for Private       Finance Initiative (PFI) risk assessment; the production of PFI risk       management case studies; and direct knowledge diffusion through industry       engagement.

Revamping PPPs, University of Hong Kong,       February 2009, &gt;200 international industrial delegates; and Major         Infrastructure Procurement Addressing the Constraints, Queensland       University of Technology, December 2010, &gt;70 delegates from the       construction, public and financial sectors).
(Impact levels 1, 2           and 3; Corroborative sources 1 and 3).
3) The International Conference on PPP Body of Knowledge (March 2013)       co-hosted by the Centre for Sustainable Development (within the UoA),       built on earlier Akintoye research to actively engage prestigious,       international academics and industry leaders from across construction in       debates around contemporary PPP practices (&gt;80 delegates from the       construction, public and financial sectors).
Resulting outcomes were       formalised for professional practice adoption within an industry guidance       document by the Constructing Excellence Lancashire Best Practice Club (Impact           levels 1, 2 and 3; Corroborative source 4 and 7).
4) Ongoing engagement with industry continues to shape knowledge and       performance at the workface through formal workshops, seminars, keynote       addresses, technical guidance publications and policy influence.
The       textbook `Public Private Partnership: Managing Risks and         Opportunities' (op.
cit.)
&#8212; the first definitive reference       source on this subject &#8212; has complemented this engagement and has directly       influenced approaches to construction risk allocation.
(Impact           levels 1 and 2; Corroborative source 4).
5) Outcomes of the COST project have permeated industry and professional       practice at the highest levels, particularly through the Transport         Research Arena conference in April 2012 and the International       Conference on PPP Body of Knowledge in March 2013.
Outcomes were also       evidenced in the TG72 Doctoral Research Workshop (Impact levels 1           and 3; Corroborative sources 5, 6 and 7).
The UoA's       benchmarking protocol for transport sector PPPs actively employed       multidisciplinary partners and cross-sector collaboration to help shape       PPP selection, implementation and operation among EU transport projects.
Outcomes are also positioned within extant knowledge in a textbook.
