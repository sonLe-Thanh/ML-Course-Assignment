     Two specific areas of international food and health policy have been       influenced by our underpinning research:             Dietary Folate Recommendations: In revising dietary         recommendations for folate in the United States in 1998, a new direction         was adopted, i.e.
that of expressing the recommended levels as dietary           folate equivalents (DFE).
The DFE recognised for the first time         the much lower bioavailability of natural food folates compared to the         synthetic vitamin folic acid and the decision to adopt it was influenced         considerably by the findings of our landmark paper (Cuskelly et al           1996).
Over the years, this paper has continued to have major         impacts on informing dietary folate recommendations worldwide (e.g.
US         2001, Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Dietary Reference Intakes; Australia         2006, National Health and Medical Research Council's Nutrient Reference         Values; 2006, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ); UK 2006,         Scientific Advisory Committee (SACN) [1-4].
Food Fortification Policies: A policy of mandatory folic         acid-fortification of cereal grains was implemented in 1998 by the US         government with the aim of reducing pregnancies affected by NTD.
This         strategy was deemed necessary because alternative policies for NTD         protection which recommended increasing folate intake from natural food         sources had been reported by us to be ineffective, together with the         widespread problem of poor compliance by women with periconceptional         folic acid supplementation.
In more recent years, our research papers         have continued to inform health services and regulatory authorities on         the beneficial effects of voluntary food fortification with B-vitamins.
Evidence provided by Hoey et al 2007 was integrated into the         Health Council of the Netherland's 2008 advisory report [5] and         also featured in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's (FSAI) 2008         report to the Department of Health and Children [6].
Global impact for populations and the consumer: The achievement of       optimal folate status to prevent NTD is a global concern and a driver of       food policy worldwide.
Through our published work and other dissemination       activities, we have contributed substantially to the scientific       evidence-base thus influencing the necessary players internationally who       have incorporated our research insights into major reports, including       those of US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and similar       bodies internationally [7].
Other impacts have included       contributions to international meetings involving scientists, government       ministries, and non-governmental bodies, such as meetings of the Flour       Fortification Initiative (FFI), an international partnership of       organisations, which is striving to encourage folic acid fortification of       grain foods on a mandatory basis worldwide to reduce NTD.
Professor       McNulty has contributed (as invited speaker and chair) to international       meetings of FFI and other significant partners e.g.
Bucharest Romania,       October 2008 and Ankara Turkey June 2012; FFI conferences jointly hosted       with UNICEF [8].
Evidence of the success of such initiatives is       that, as of July 2013, as many as 74 countries worldwide have passed       regulations for mandatory fortification of staple foods with folic acid.

In addition, links with industry are proving highly relevant in       translating folic acid issues to the consumer.
For example, the Kellogg       Company has incorporated our research findings at a 2009 meeting of the       Associate Parliamentary Food and Health Forum (FHF) [9], a forum       for the exchange of views and information on food policy in the UK       Parliament.
Our general portfolio of media interest and citations includes       features on various websites associated with the food industry and the       provision of scientifically based nutrition information to health       professionals and consumers [10, 11].
In summary, our underpinning research in relation to folic acid has had       important impacts, not only on the development of food and health policy,       but also in translating this policy to the consumer.
