     Central to maximising impact has been Wolffe's AHRC Knowledge Transfer       Fellowship, `Modern Religious History and the Contemporary Church'       (working title, `Building on History'), in partnership with Kings       College London, the Church of England Diocese of London and Lambeth Palace       Library.
The primary initial aim was to work alongside the main stakeholder, the       Diocese of London, to:            promote learning amongst churchgoers, clergy and others, informing         them about the modern history of the Church of England in ways that         enhance the self-understanding of the diocese and its parishes       shape contemporary ministry and engagement through increased         historical awareness.
The `Building on History' project engaged with its stakeholders and the       wider user community in a variety of ways.
There was a comprehensive programme of seminars and workshops,         summarising recent research in modern religious history, and suggesting         applications to the work of the present-day church.
These were attended         by over 450 lay leaders, clergy and ordinands in London between 2009 and         2011.
In 2011, three regional events for leaders from other Church of         England dioceses attracted a further 100 or so participants from as far         afield as Cornwall.
Feedback suggests significant impacts on thinking         and practice: for example in embedding new and more practical approaches         to the use of history in clergy training, and in inspiring the         restoration in 2012 of the important Victorian decoration at St Mary         Magdalene, Enfield.
The project has aimed to inform strategy and policy through applying         historical insight to contemporary problems.
Events were held in 2010         for the staff of St Paul's Cathedral and archdeacons and area deans, and         reports and recommendations submitted to the Bishop of London and to his         senior staff.
The project has informed development of the diocese's         future strategy, `Capital Vision 2020', launched in June 2013.
The         Bishop of London writes (printed project report p.3): `This project has         been a powerful contribution to enhancing the character of the Church in         the Diocese as a learning organism.'
In June 2010, the project launched an innovative online resource         toolkit which provides expert advice on how to find out about the         history of local congregations, churches and communities.
This online         resource is a significant legacy of the project, facilitating new         `grassroots' historical research in the coming years.
Dr Clive Field OBE         (formerly Head of Research and Collections at the British Library)         regards the project as an `exemplar for developing an appreciation of         the relevance of the past, and the importance of historical records,         among contemporary faith communities' (printed project report, p.22).
The project has developed the concept of a `history audit', which         individual churches can undertake in order to contextualise their         current activity and planning for the future.
This approach was outlined         in a published pamphlet: John Maiden and Neil Evans, What Can           Churches Learn from their Past?
The Parish History Audit         (Cambridge: Grove Booklets, 2012).
The pamphlet is now embedded in the         diocese's strategy and included in its Mission Action Planning         guidelines.
The Bishop of Willesden describes this development as one of         `real importance'.
The success of the project partnership with the Diocese of London formed       the basis for wider engagement with other faith constituencies in London.
This engagement developed in a subsequent Open University- and AHRC-funded       follow-on project, `Building on History: Religion in London', in       collaboration with Royal Holloway University of London and a range of       practitioner stakeholders.
A series of ten events involving Baptists,       Black Majority Churches, Jews, Methodists, Muslims and Roman Catholics was       held in late 2012 and early 2013.
Attendance averaged approximately 40,       with at least 200 individuals attending on at least one occasion.
Accompanying resources were provided on the website.
Very positive feedback was received.
For example, Dr Jamil Sherif (Muslim       Council of Britain) judges that the project `really brought people       together', raised the profile of history and has stimulated a more       positive attitude to record-keeping among Muslims in London.
Dr Tim Powell       (National Archives) regards this project as `a very important strand in       the delivery of the religious archives support plan'.
There was also       significant engagement with schools: Mr Marlon Chetty (The Urswick School,       Hackney) considers the impact on his students (from two workshops in the       autumn term 2012) to have been `really profound'.
Examples of pilot       teaching material have been made publicly available on the website.
The programme for Wolffe's `Protestant-Catholic Conflict' project       included, in 2012, a series of seminars with users and stakeholders in       Belfast, Birmingham, Liverpool, London and Milton Keynes.
The final       project conference in Belfast attracted numerous non-academic delegates.
Participants at the seminars and conference included religious leaders,       senior civil servants, police officers and key representatives of       non-governmental organisations and voluntary organisations.
There was       enthusiastic affirmation of the value of the research, especially in       adding to understanding of the religious dimensions of societal division       in Northern Ireland, and the long-term context of politico-religious       tensions in Britain through informed comparison between historic       anti-Catholicism and contemporary Islamophobia.
