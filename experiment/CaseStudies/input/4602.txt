     The Thames Discovery Programme (TDP) set out explicitly to develop a new       model of community-engaged foreshore archaeology, where &#8212; as in all       community archaeology &#8212; volunteer members of the community whose own       heritage is the subject of investigation were trained to use tools       developed by researchers, but here specifically adapted to the fieldwork       conditions of the intertidal zone.
The first phase of the TDP (2008-2011)       was initiated within the UCL Institute of Archaeology in close       collaboration with the Museum of London, the Thames Explorer Trust and       UCL's Thames Estuary Partnership, and hosted by UCL.
It was supported by a       grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund with matching funding from a variety       of other sources [1].
The Steering Group included representation of all       these bodies, as well as of English Heritage, Port of London Authority,       Council for British Archaeology and the Environment Agency.
Since 2011,       TDP has been hosted by Museum of London Archaeology, but is still directed       by Milne; TDP's team leader, Nathalie Cohen, is an Institute alumna and       Honorary Research Associate.
Since its establishment in 2008, TDP has grown to a community of 400+       trained volunteer members (FROG, the Foreshore Recording and Observation       Group [2]), able to systematically and regularly monitor archaeological       features threatened by erosion on a long-term, sustainable basis.
The       group's work has made very significant contributions to the archaeology of       London [3].
Among beneficiaries of the TDP, it is therefore FROG members       who have been most intensively and sustainedly engaged with the values and       goals of the research.
FROG was established as an archaeology project in which local people         can become involved, rather than a community project with       archaeology as the vehicle for community engagement.
During the first       phase, 331 volunteers completed the FROG training, of whom 139 had no       previous archaeological experience (34.4%).
The majority of those with       experience were members of local archaeological societies, students, or       had taken part in digs in the past.
FROG members lived in all London       boroughs: of the 331 who had completed training, 149 (45%) came from local       authority areas which are among the 30% most deprived in England [2 p.12].
There was a good spread of ages, including many in both the 18-21 and       over-60 age groups (Health and Safety restrictions prevent under-18s from       becoming members).
Of these 331, 147 had gone on to participate in       fieldwork by September 2011 (survey respondents indicate that where they       did not go on, this was often due to other commitments rather than lack of       interest [2 p. 25]).
An independent report for the HLF, covering the       period 2008 to September 2011 [2], evaluated their experiences based on       145 FROG members' survey responses.
Commitment and enthusiasm were high:       87.4% of survey respondents who had done fieldwork said that they would       continue as FROG members in the future, while 12.6% were not sure (their       reasons were cited as other commitments, the possibility of moving away       from the area, or health problems) [2 p. 38].
Part of the satisfaction obtained by FROG volunteers comes from participating         in the knowledge-gathering process (`citizen science').
As one FROG       volunteer put it, "I have got one O level.
This has been a great         opportunity for me to work with academics, which I wouldn`t have been         able to do otherwise" [2 p. 15].
FROG surveys [3] have revealed       submerged prehistoric forests, remains of a late Bronze Age bridge or       jetty, Anglo-Saxon fish-traps, a medieval timber jetty, the baseplates of       Tudor waterfront structures, the footings of the 18th-century Putney       Bridge, and many examples of waterman's causeways used by the once       ubiquitous Thames ferries, as well as river-wall repairs from bomb-strikes       in the Blitz and a complete mine-watching observation post from the 1940s.
They have also recorded vessel remains in quantity, representing       everything from ballast barges to the 131-gun HMS Duke of Wellington       of 1852.
During the first phase all the classroom training sessions for       the FROG members were held on UCL's campus, usually at the Institute of       Archaeology, and all the professional project staff were Institute alumni.
To progress this aspect of its public engagement, in 2009 TDP also created       the Riverpedia, a web-based River Thames archaeology and history database       which documents work at the twenty key sites that FROG has been       monitoring, and puts them in a thematic context, with research articles by       FROG volunteers.
To widen the reach of the impact and engage with London audiences beyond       the core FROG membership, TDP has also raised awareness of the         capital's foreshore heritage through its annual conferences held in       London, its extensive events programmes, its award-winning website,       reports, articles and a series of TV features.
During the HLF-funded       period the TDP organised not just training programmes for FROG       participants, but also over 100 other events ranging from children's       activities, to training workshops and guided walks, attended by in total       7,000 persons [3].
TDP's success as a model of community         archaeological engagement was recognised within the field in July       2012, when TDP won the award for `Best Community Archaeology Project' at       the annual British Archaeological Awards organised by the Council for       British Archaeology.
TDP also won the Institute of Field Archaeology's       `Archaeology Training Forum Award' for 2013; the citation states that it "demonstrated         a coherent set of objectives and benefits, was clearly a good         partnership between the professional and volunteer sectors, helped         individuals kick-start their careers, was responsive to the training         needs of volunteers, and provided a practical solution to a real         archaeological problem" [4].
In February 2011 the project was one of       only five nominated by Current Archaeology magazine for `Best       Research Project of 2011'; and in 2013, TDP Project Director Gustav Milne       was one of three nominees for Current Archaeology`s Archaeologist       of the Year (runner up).
Current Archaeology (circulation 17,000)       aims to build a bridge between professionals and a volunteer/lay-interest       archaeological readership: its awards are chosen annually from work       published in Current Archaeology, and the final selection is based       on votes cast by readers.
The nominations reflect TDP's and Milne's       success in public engagement.
The TDP website itself       (www.thamesdiscovery.org) won the British Archaeological Award for       `Best Representation of Archaeology in the Media' in 2010.
This award from       the Council for British Archaeology recognises, among other things, the       website's contribution to enhancing public education and understanding in       relation to archaeology, and its accessibility and appeal for its intended       audience.
Website traffic analysis shows that it has had substantial       impact in its own right with 135,271 visitors from its launch in January       2009 to 31 July 2013.
Each visitor spent an average of nearly 3 minutes on       the website, indicating the significance of this resource [5].
TDP       maintains an additional online Scribd repository of its newsletters,       articles, recording guidelines, etc.
(66 uploads, 54,469 views to       26/10/13), and a Flickr photo archive (2,780 photos, 352,500 views to       4/11/13).
TDP has also produced 10 short video documentaries and three       training videos which are available online, and which received a total of       52,000 views to 26/10/13 [6].
The reach of this project was expanded further nationally and       internationally through appearances in numerous newspaper and TV news       items, and has featured in several prime-time programmes broadcast       on terrestrial TV including the first episodes of Peter Ackroyd's         Thames (ITV, 2008; Ep.
1); Alice Roberts' Digging for Britain       (BBC2, 2010; Ep.
1); and Dan Cruikshank's The Bridges that Made London       (BBC4, 2012; Ep.
1).
Perhaps most substantially, a Time Team Special       `Brunel's Last Launch' (C4, 2011; 1.5 million viewers [7]) followed FROG       archaeologists who had made a dramatic discovery in 2010, on the foreshore       at Millwall, of the substantial remains of the 150-year-old slipways used       to launch Isambard Kingdom Brunel's huge steam ship, the SS Great         Eastern.
The programme used these new discoveries as a narrative       entry point to examine not just the history of Brunel's ship, but its       influence on subsequent British shipbuilding.
In addition to these impacts       on community archaeology along the Thames foreshore and consequent wider       public engagement, TAS and TDP have had substantial impacts on the         planning process and the conduct of archaeological mitigation work.
All development projects on the Thames foreshore in London are now       required to conduct archaeological work mitigating the effects of       development in the intertidal/foreshore zone [8].
The Inspector of Ancient       Monuments for London and the English Heritage officer responsible for the       statutory consultations from the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) for       the London Region, is responsible for recommending licence conditions for       any works which will impact upon archaeology within the intertidal zone.
She testifies that: "I regularly request the MMO to place         archaeological conditions on the licences they issue, to ensure that         these archaeological remains are carefully recorded before either         potentially or certainly being damaged through works.
The types of work         range from repairs to river defences to major infrastructure schemes         such as the proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel.
Such schemes have the         potential to significantly damage archaeological remains, but this can         be mitigated by careful recording, recovery and publication of remains.
I consider the methods devised by Gustav Milne and team members of the         Thames Discovery Programme to be best practice for the types of site I         deal with regularly, often of national significance.
These methods,         which I have seen many times in the field, are efficient, diligent,         comprehensive and accurately capture the detail of these often complex         sites.
Working within the intertidal zone can be fraught with difficulty         and so robust methodologies are crucial.
The methods are used by all         professional teams working on the Thames foreshore in association with         the marine licences mentioned above, and such working practices are         required by myself, and my colleagues in the City of London Corporation         and the London Borough of Southwark, who have their own archaeological         officers" [9].
The recording system and approach developed by the       TAS and TDP staff has also been adopted nationally, e.g.
by community       archaeology projects at Purton on the Severn and at Forton Lake in       Hampshire [10].
