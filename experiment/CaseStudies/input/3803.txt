     The Politics of Christmas report was widely read and discussed,       indicating changed levels of       awareness of the topics considered, and changed public discourse; it also       led to changed practices       around the celebration of Christmas in churches in the UK (at least).

Widespread increased awareness and discussion at an international         level of the political         context and claims of the gospel narratives            a.
Changed international awareness          The Politics of Christmas [5] report attracted immediate media       attention, including an extensive       article in the Daily Telegraph [S4], a comment piece in The         New Statesman, and online reports in       the Huffington Post and elsewhere.
At least eight BBC local radio       stations carried items on the       report in the weekend after its release, which strategically came in the       run-up to Christmas.
As a       result of the publication, Holmes was invited to write reflective pieces       drawing on the report for The         Times (appeared online 9/12/11), for politics.co.uk [S5], and for       the Australian Broadcasting       Company's prestigious religion and ethics website; he was interviewed by       BBC Radio Manchester,       Radio Rhema in New Zealand, and several faith-based media sources,       including an interview       resulting in an article covering the whole front page of the Baptist         Times, subsequently highlighted       as one of the most significant stories of the year in that newspaper's       annual review.
This story was       picked up and republished by the American Ethics Daily.
Other       articles appeared on the CNN       website in the USA, in church news stories in the Irish Republic, in the       leading Tanzanian       newspaper The Citizen, and extensively across the internet.
The       Director of Theos attests that their       data demonstrate significant take-up by `a variety of communities         beyond academia: believers and         non-believers, a range of age groups and genders' [S1].
The extent       of this media and public       engagement demonstrates a widespread impact on awareness and understanding       of political       themes within the biblical nativity narratives.

Changed international discourse     More direct public responses to The Politics of Christmas report       included a somewhat hostile       response from Daily Telegraph comment writer, Peter Mullen [S6],       whose piece received several       hundred comments (since edited down to just over 130) online, and many       other online discussions.
The energy of some of these discussions &#8212; particularly in response to       Mullen &#8212; demonstrates that       the report succeeded in generating widespread public discussion on the       themes it treated.
Analysis       of the comments on the online versions of news reports indicate that the       range of those reached       included a wide variety of age groups, and people of varying religious       affiliations, including many       people of no religious affiliation [S1].
Discussions took place on sites       serving communities from all       over the world: local media from New Zealand to Manchester, on at least       four continents [S1].
Mullen's article was shared over 300 times on social media sites [S4],       which is indicative of wide       readership, interest, and engagement (this figure is considerably higher       than many other articles       from the same website).
Theos estimate that social media content       referencing the report reached       15,000 [S3].
There can be little doubt that the awareness of these themes       across a substantial       audience &#8212; plausibly numbered into the hundreds of thousands, given the       known reach of the       various media outlets &#8212; was increased; given the relative invisibility of       such themes in popular       culture prior to the publication of the report, as demonstrated by polling       data included in the report       (only 19% of the population saw any political relevance in the Christmas       story, a figure that did not       change significantly with different levels of religious commitment), the       increase was significant.
Theos state that the report `distinctively coloured public         conversations about the practice of         Christmas for the final months of 2011' [S1].
The report was       included in a resource pack produced       by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 2012 for schools and churches       to engage the Christmas       story.
The inclusion of the report in this pack, extensively disseminated       across the UK, is another       indication of its reach, encompassing the younger generation, addressing       schools and children as       well as churches and adults [S10].
2.
Changed practices in churches     There are a number of examples from individuals indicating changed       practices, mostly from       Christian ministers (including bishops), suggesting that their public       celebrations of Christmas were       revised as a result of their reading of the report [S1; S2].
Leaders spoke       of how the report had       informed their sermons, and how positive comments from many congregation       members had       indicated that this had changed their thinking and their practice in       celebrating Christmas [S1; S2].
Given that the change of practice of one minister will lead to a changed       experience for one or       several congregations which may each number into the hundreds, and given       the significance of the       celebration of Christmas in the liturgical year of many Christian       denominations, but particularly the       Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church, even a small number of       changes of practice       like this suggests a substantial impact in terms of changed experience of       numbers of people at a       significant moment in their cultural and religious life.
Since the       available evidence of changed       practices comes simply from those who chose to contact the author and/or       publisher of the report       to express gratitude, it is almost certain that the number of people, and       hence congregations,       celebrating Christmas differently as a result of the research is in fact       significantly larger than can       yet be demonstrated in statistical terms [S1].
There is evidence of some       level of changes in       practice in regard to core issues of religious and cultural celebration       [S1], and reason to suppose       that this change in practice may well have been extensive.
By demonstrating what it does and does not mean to read foundational New       Testament narratives       with an eye to their political content, the report had significantly       increased awareness of the reality       that the birth of Jesus was &#8212; irreducibly and with radical implications &#8212;       a political event [S1; S2].
In       offering a popular window on scholarly research on what the Bible might actually       be saying about       Christian origins, it had led a wide range of people to rethink their       notions of Christmas as merely a       celebration of domesticity or an opportunity for excess.
One influential       church leader in England       commented that her preaching was specifically `informed' by the       report: `I talked about how         Christmas isn't just to be a cozy family time, but should incorporate an         outward focus and that we         should not be nervous of being overtly political at Christmas time.
Many         people said how helpful         that was' [S2].
