     The impact of this research has been on two main groups of beneficiaries:            the ceramic &amp; glass industries;       the sustainable building materials industry;          Ceramics and Glass industry (Impact on studio and industrial           production)       Collaborative research developed by Binns and Bremner, bridging art       practice, craft, design and industrial manufacturing, has had a       significant impact in a number of ways on the creative, technical and       sustainable development of silicate-based materials.
Binns' research into       adapting clay bodies has freed clay artists and designers from a reliance       on traditional surface treatments such as glaze, expanding the repertoire       of aesthetic approaches to the material.
A number of key internationally       published ceramics texts highlight the distinctiveness of these processes:            Standon,K., 2013.

Impact on the wider professional practitioner and academic audiences has       also been achieved through Binns being invited to participate in a number       of international conferences and symposia:            Meeting the Masters programme, The International Ceramic Studio,         Hungary (2008).

Binns research, examining how recycled ceramic materials may be       integrated into ceramic production, was presented at the NCECA conference       in Seattle, USA and is featured in a new book: Harrison, R., 2013.

The process is being       adopted increasingly within both studio and industrial environments and is       having a significant impact in promoting sustainable practice.
Sustainable building materials industry (Impact on Environment)     Following receipt of an AHRC Large Research Grant 2008-2011 (&#163;163,454) `The         Aesthetic of Waste' - an investigation of the creative &amp; commercial         potential of kiln cast re-cycled mineral waste (Grant Reference:         AH/E009492/1), the researchers developed a unique material, made       from recycled glass, ceramic and mineral waste, offering applications       within a variety of architectural contexts.
Binns &amp; Bremner's       collaborative development of this new material, which offers innovative       solutions to architectural products, has a number of sustainable       characteristics, which sets it apart from other architectural materials:            It is made from 97-100% recycled waste;       It avoids any cementateous or synthetic polymers, common to many         current `green' composite products;       It requires a lower firing duration and lower temperatures than         conventional ceramic production, which lowers carbon emissions;       All manufacturing waste (trimmings, sludges) can be re-introduced into         the raw material input stream (Zero Waste, Closed Loop Manufacturing);       It can be recycled at end of life and re-introduced into the raw         material input steam (Cradle to Cradle Design Paradigm, End of Life         Manufacturing).
The project offers a number of significant environmental impacts:            The material provides architects and designers with a sustainable         alternative to products such as clay tiles and stone cladding; products         derived from non-replenishable virgin materials.
It diverts low value waste streams from landfill into the production         of a high-value product.
The process utilizes locally sourced waste (avoiding excessive         transportation of raw materials).
Impacts have been delivered through knowledge exchange with an       international design audience, and through participation in a number       design projects:     `Ceramics &amp; Architecture', Dutch Design Week, Eindhoven 2009.

Prototypes of the new material, exhibited at 100% Design, London, 2010,       generated considerable interest from Architects and Designers (including       ARUP, Foster &amp; Partners and White Design).
The utilization of waste, lead-bearing CRT glass, offers significant       additional environmental impacts.
The recycling and disposal of CRT glass       is a pressing global environmental problem due to the lead content,       prohibiting its use in most established recycled-glass applications.
Globally, it is estimated that at least 1.9 billon screens are still in       use.
The process of safely encapsulating lead-bearing CRT glass in their       new material, developed by Binns &amp; Bremner, offers a real solution to       the global problem of hazardous CRT glass recycling.
Testing has also       verified that the CRT glass bearing material can be either recycled or if       necessary, safely land-filled at end of life.
A spin-out company is       currently being established, to exploit these new technologies and a       patent has been filed to protect the IP (International Patent Application       No PCT/GB2013/052820 Claiming priority from GB 1219511.1)
