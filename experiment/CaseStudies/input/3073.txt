     The underpinning research on firms, exports and exporting developed key       insights into the effects       of export market entry on the performance of firms and determinants of       export market entry.
Using       UK data, as well as data for other countries, this was amongst the       first research on exports and       exporting undertaken at the micro level.
This started a process of       engagement between       researchers in GEP and the Economics and Evaluation team at Trade         Partners UK (the       forerunner of UKTI) that is on-going and has yielded access to the       use of confidential UKTI data       and commissioned research.
In turn, these research projects were developed       into further academic       papers for publication in peer reviewed journals.
The research conducted       in the report for TPUK       listed as [A] in Section 5 was published as [1] in Section 3; the research       in the report for TPUK [B]       was published as [4]; and the report for UKTI in [C, D] was       published as [5, 6].
Dissemination          GEP researchers have also disseminated research on this topic more widely       within UKTI and BIS       through invitations to research seminars and workshops (in 2008, 2009 and       2011) and by the       attendance of UKTI staff at conferences and workshops hosted by GEP.
Heather Booth di       Giovanni, head of the Economics and Evaluation Team at UKTI, is an       External Policy Associate in       GEP.
Kneller and Upward (also a GEP internal Fellow) have both       acted as external advisors for       external research projects conducted on behalf of UKTI and on the       evaluation surveys       commissioned by UKTI (known as PIMS).
Greenaway is a       member of UKTI's `Asia Task Force',       a high-level body helping to boost UK exports and investments in       Asian countries.
Impacts          The work of conducted by researchers within GEP has provided a       knowledge base from which       government policy towards exports and exporting has been evidence-led.
Relevant research has       included the evidence on exporting and finance and the barriers to       exporting as well as the effects       of export market entry on performance of manufacturing firms and       characteristics of service       exporters.
Direct evidence of impact can be found from the references for       a wide range of UKTI       and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills working papers       and submissions to House         of Commons committees.
Examples of references to GEP       research include those to [5] and [E]       in the BIS report listed as [G] and references to [B] in the House of         Commons report on       `exporting out of recession' [reference H].
The research reports conducted       on behalf of UKTI have       also been published on the Economics and Evaluation Website of UKTI.
Evidence that GEP research has been used as an evidence base       under-pinning export promotion       policy can be found from the number of citations of GEP research       within the BIS document entitled       `The economic rationale for government support' (reference [F]) published       by BIS in 2011.
This       includes references to the research in [3], [5] and [E].
In addition, the       document cites the following       GEP research: Driffield, Girma, Henry and Taylor (2010), Girma       (2005), Girma and Gorg (2003,       2006, 2007), Girma, Gorg and Pisu (2008), Girma, Kneller       and Pisu (2005), Gorg, Kneller and       Murakozy (2008), Greenaway and Zu (2004), Kneller and Pisu       (2007a,b).
(Gorg, Pisu and Zu are       all now external GEP Fellows, and previously internal GEP       Fellows.)
Some impacts have also been more narrowly focused.
The research conducted       within [D] and       published as academic outputs in [5] and [6] was used as evidence to       underpin the launch of a       new trade promotion scheme called `Gateways to Global Growth' (GGG)       which was introduced       at the end of 2009.
This scheme is targeted at firms with between 2-10       years of previous export       experience, and was grounded on evidence that these firms reported more       barriers to exporting       (see [4]).
This research provided evidence that these barriers in fact       occurred at the level of the       export transaction, and therefore could be present even for firms that had       previously exported to       the same market (and were trying to identify new customers) or were       expanding into new markets.
Evidence for a link between the research and motivation to recommend this       new service can be       found in (UKTI Departmental Report and Resource Accounts 2008-09: http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0809/hc04/0482/0482.pdf)       which states that:     "In the previous year UKTI commissioned research into the barriers         faced by more         experienced exporters and as a result of the findings in 2008-09, it         launched a new         package of support called Gateway to Global Growth."
It can also be found from correspondence with the Head of the Economics       and Evaluation team at       UKTI when GGG won an award from the Trade Promotion         Organisation, a joint agency of the       United Nations and the World Trade Organisation.
To quote:     "The service &#8212; called 'Gateway to Global Growth' &#8212; was developed in         response to a         need identified by a review of evidence, including the analysis which         you had done         for us of how barriers to exporting relate to business characteristics.
On the basis of         this review of evidence, we recommended that such a service should be         developed.
The work to develop and implement this idea was then done by         UKTI's         teams of advisers in the English regions, and it has indeed proved very         successful."
The ultimate beneficiaries of the impact are the firms that have been       assisted to export.
According       to UKTI data up until September 2012 some 3,400 firms had       participated in GGG       (http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/aboutukti/ourperformance/performanceimpactandmonitoringsurve         y/item/393220.html).
UKTI data shows that 67% of companies       improved their business       performance as a result of GGG and 80% increased productivity and       competitiveness.
UKTI       estimate that in the financial year 2011/12 the GGG scheme helped       generate &#163;539 million profit for       supported firms, and &#163;285 million in 2010/11.
Kneller was invited to testify to the House of Lords Select         Committee on SMEs and Exporting       as an expert witness in October 2012 and also submitted written evidence       to the committee.
The       report published under the title `Road to success: SME exports' in       February 2013, includes various       quotes from the verbal and written testament (see Chapter 2 `SME export       performance' in [I]).
Kneller was also commissioned by the Department of Business         Foresight project into the       Future of UK manufacturing to write a report on the Future of UK         Manufacturing Exports in 2012.
This forms part of the Foresight project into `The future of       manufacturing', which is expected to be       published in the Autumn of 2013.
