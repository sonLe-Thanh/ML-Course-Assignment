     The underpinning University of Leeds research has had a direct and       substantial economic impact       during the review period through sales generated by Agilent Technologies.
Our research has also       had a broader impact through the companies within the electronics sector       that have bought the       Agilent Technologies instrumentation for the design and testing of new       products, which were       themselves released onto the market.
Further impact has been generated       through the use of this       instrumentation in, for example, the metrology and standards industry.
The PNA-X platform, which is the microwave industry's highest performing       network analyzer in       terms of its noise performance and accuracy, together with portable RF       analyzers incorporating the       same technology (the FieldFox platform), are sold to the wireless,       aerospace and defence       industries and were all directly brought about by research at Leeds [A].
The results from the       research on noise measurement [1] were incorporated into the PNA-X       platform as an option from       2008.
Customers include (but are not limited to) in aerospace and defence:       Northrop Grumman,       Astrium, Selex, Raytheon, multiple defence agencies; in       telecommunications: NSN, Ericsson,       Motorola; in computing: Cisco, Huawei, Intel; and, in microwave       electronics: Mini-circuits, Miteq,       and Filtronic (itself an earlier spin-out from the School).
This work       contributed to Agilent becoming       a global leader in network analyzers, with a greater market share than all       other companies       combined.
Owing to commercial sensitivity, Agilent is unable to provide       precise figures for sales of       its products, however, a senior Agilent executive confirms: "The         revenue from the noise figure         option to the PNA-X is in the tens of millions of dollars annually"       [A].
The algorithms described in reference [2] were incorporated into the       Agilent dielectric probe       measurement kit (model number 85070E) in 2009 [A].
The University of Leeds       related work with       Agilent on the extraction of material parameters from substrate integrated       waveguide cavity       resonators [3] led directly to the Agilent Technologies scanning probe       microscope range, with       models 5400 and 5600LS first brought to market in 2009.
Specifically, this       work led to a new       modality being incorporated into this instrumentation (SMM mode), which       enables complex       impedance (resistance and reactance), calibrated capacitance, and       topography measurements       within the same instrument [A].
This microscopy modality outperforms       traditional AFM-based       scanning capacitance microscopy techniques, since it does not require any       contact between the       probe head and the sample.
The instrument is now being sold routinely to       the semiconductor       industry for calibrated dopant density measurements on silicon wafers, as       well as to research       organisations worldwide [A].
Again, precise sales figures of the       dielectric probe kit and scanning       probe microscope range are not available for commercial reasons, but a       senior Agilent executive       states: "I can confirm that the key academic work on which these         developments were based was         published in two papers by Pollard and co-workers (References [2] and         [3]) ...
The specific revenue         from these solutions is in the tens of millions of dollars annually"       [A].
Furthermore, "collective sales         of all these products (network analyzers, open-ended dielectric probes,         and scanning probe         microscope) have been in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars         per year" [A].
To give one example of the broader impact that University of Leeds       research has achieved through       the organizations that have bought Agilent Technologies instrumentation,       there has been       substantial impact in the metrology sector, with the network analyzers       being used by, for example,       the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) for accurate calibration of high       frequency instrumentation       [B].
Agilent's network analyzers, incorporating technologies developed at       Leeds as discussed       above, are now considered to be the industry standard for these       measurements - "we have         specifically chosen Agilent Technologies Network Analysers for the high         precision that they offer,         for their ability to offer state-of-the-art error correction routines,         and, for their ability to provide         implementations of the very latest measurement and calibration         techniques" [B].
NPL has also       confirmed that the availability of this Agilent Technologies       instrumentation has enabled them to       offer a wide range of measurement capabilities to its customers "that         have led to an income over         the period 2008-2013 of approximately &#163;50M" [B].
The fan-out/impact       from the customer       calibration services also provides a major source of income for many       third-party laboratories       involved as links in the measurement assurance/traceability chain &#8212; for       example, one calibration       from NPL can validate tests made on many thousands of devices on many       industrial shop floors       and production lines [B].
This case study exemplifies how the School of Electronic and Electrical       Engineering at Leeds       adopts a long-term and sustainable approach towards ensuring the impact of       its research.
Agilent       Technologies (and formerly Hewlett Packard) have sponsored 15 PhD students       in the School over       this on-going period of collaboration.
Furthermore, the School has also       trained a number of       researchers who have taken up employment with Agilent, providing further       impact from the       research.
Four current staff at the company obtained their doctoral       degrees through work       performed in collaboration with Leeds, under the supervision of Pollard.
The staff are: Mark       Pierpoint (PhD completed 1987), who is currently Vice President/General       Manager of the Software       and Modular Solutions Business section of Agilent; Loren Betts (PhD 2009),       an engineer       responsible for many of the Agilent's vector network analyzer products;       Dave Blackham (PhD       1999) who specializes in measurement uncertainties; and, Joel Dunsmore       (PhD 2004), an Agilent       Fellow developing measurement applications.
