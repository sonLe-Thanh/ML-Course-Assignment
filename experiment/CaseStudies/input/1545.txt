     The Institute is widely recognised for its role in uncovering the threat       of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, and for its influence on       shaping responses.
Through engagement with policy makers, other regulators       and industry, Sumpter, Jobling and Routledge ensured their       findings were key components of evidence leading to regulation of       pharmaceuticals.
In 2004, the UK government accepted evidence that steroid       oestrogens posed a significant risk to aquatic life.
End-of-pipe         treatment of effluent was chosen as the risk management approach,       placing this responsibility on the water industry.
In 2007, the       Environment Agency developed a draft environmental quality       standard (EQS) for ethinylestradiol &#8212; a target concentration which could       be used for regulatory compliance &#8212; based on a predicted no effect       concentration of 0.1ng/L, albeit this was further refined to 0.035ng/L by       the European Commission, based on the results of Professor Sumpter's       collaborative studies with the pharmaceutical industry (see Caldwell et       al., 2008 in the research section).
To quantify the wider consequences and costs to society of the proposed       management approach and balance them against the benefits, it was       necessary to evaluate the efficiency of various existing sewage       treatment approaches in removing steroid oestrogens and their biological       effects.
The water industry, therefore, conducted The Endocrine Disruptor       Demonstration Programme (2006-2010), through which they gained an improved       understanding of the effectiveness of different treatment technologies and       the sources of chemicals entering the sewerage system.
Jobling       (then a senior research fellow) and Dr Mark Scrimshaw (senior       lecturer) were both advisors to the Environment Agency during the       development of the experimental protocols for the "Demonstration       Programme" of work (budgeted &#163;40 million).
The standardised test protocols       developed by Tyler, Routledge and Sumpter were used to test the       efficacy of sewage treatment technologies in this programme and Jobling       participated in the programme, performing testing for two water companies.
The information gathered is currently supporting regulators and the Water       Industry in defining the best environmental solution to the problem,       taking into account costs and carbon footprints.
Sumpter and           Tyler's' fish tests now form the basis of two OECD standard           reproductive toxicity tests for (OECD tests 229 and 2301)           adopted in 2009.
The US EPA (2009) has also adopted modified versions           of these tests for regulatory purposes.
In large part due to the Institute's research, for the first time in         history, the European Commission placed three pharmaceutical compounds         (the contraceptive pill hormones, ethinylestradiol and estradiol, and         the painkiller diclofenac) on a draft list2 of priority         chemicals (2012) thought to pose a risk to the safety of surface water.
Priority chemicals require control under the Water Framework Directive         (WFD; the primary legislation for protecting and conserving European         water bodies).
Lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry recently       (2/07/2013) ensured movement of the three pharmaceuticals onto a new       'watch list'3 of emerging aquatic pollutants and an extension       of the deadline for achieving water quality targets for the       pharmaceuticals from 2021 to 2027.
There is now a new article in the         text of the Water Framework Directive stating the EC's intention to         develop a strategic approach to pollution of water by pharmaceutical         substances "aimed at reducing their discharges, emissions, and losses to         the aquatic environment".
Once implemented, the standards for       steroid oestrogens will be taken into account in the 2015 River Basin       Management Plans and associated `Programmes of Measures' for the Water       Framework Directive across Europe.
In the UK alone, this change in       European law will eventually require the upgrade of almost 1400 sewage       treatment works in order to produce effluent that allows compliance with       the environmental standards set for pharmaceuticals and natural steroid       oestrogens.
There is currently a vigorous debate over the economic costs of       regulating pharmaceuticals (described in Owen and Jobling "The hidden       costs of flexible fertility" Nature, 485,           pp441, 24th May, 20124).
The       pharmaceutical industry claims the combined pill is the most popular       contraceptive in the UK and the most effective; a loss of &#8364;4 billion         in sales, 217,000 additional unintended pregnancies and a social       cost of around &#163;26.2 million per year, equivalent to around &#163;382         million over 20 years would result if it was not used.
The water       industry claims the total costs of treating the ~1,360 wastewater       treatment works in England and Wales with EE2 failures are between &#163;27-31       billion over the same period5.
Despite this debate, in some countries, full-scale treatments aimed at         removing pharmaceuticals have already been implemented, ahead of the         inevitable EU regulation.
For example, such treatment technologies are         now operating on more than 100 Swiss WWTP, treating about 80 % of the         Swiss municipal wastewater.
Comparable programmes have been carried       out in other European countries and in the USA, Japan and Australia,       through the Institute's efforts to promote the transfer of their knowledge       and practice in this area to many other countries.
Practical examples of       knowledge transfer include the "effect mapping techniques", pioneered by       the Institute and now applied in projects in Japan and Australia (the       UK-Japan initiative http://www.uk-j.org       and the Australia-UK initiative www.ecotox.org.au/edcsig/history.html),       together with the dissemination of the yeast oestrogen screen (used to       identify pharmaceuticals as the oestrogenic culprits of the feminisation       of fish) to more than 200 laboratories across 32 countries of the world,       along with training in its use.
The raised awareness of pharmaceuticals in       water has led to much media attention and to a study commissioned by the       Drinking Water inspectorate (DWI) to determine the worst case scenario of       potential human exposure to pharmaceuticals in drinking water in England       and Wales and a WHO report also on this topic6.
In the USA,       steroid oestrogens are included on a list of 104 contaminants EPA will       evaluate to determine if national drinking water regulations are needed to       protect public health7.
As a leading example of excellence in       impact, contributing to positive change on an international scale, the       Institute's work in this area was awarded a Queen's Anniversary Trust         Prize8 in November 2011.
Professor Sumpter was       awarded the 2009 Toxicology Award from the Royal Society of Chemistry9       for transforming our view of ecotoxicity, particularly our understanding       of the role of pharmaceutical pollutants in the aquatic environment.
