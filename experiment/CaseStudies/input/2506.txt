     Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.
Economic benefits derived from carbon credit and land-use schemes     Pathway: The research team has been actively involved in advisory       work with carbon and land-use certification schemes, as well as developing       tailored research outputs for a range of end-user organisations.
Ryan and       Mitchard have advised, reviewed, and redrafted a land-use standard for the       technical committee of the UK `Plan Vivo Foundation' [A].
The work       on fire in miombo woodlands has resulted in a Tanzanian partnership with       the NGO Mpingo Conservation and Development Initiative (MCDI) and LTS       International to develop a new Voluntary Carbon Standard for fire-prone       tropical woodlands [B].
Research on the impacts of timber       harvesting on Kenyan mangroves was instrumental in developing a new carbon       offset payment scheme, launched in 2011 with funding from Aviva, as can be       corroborated by their Head of Environment and Climate Change [C].
Finally, Mitchard has generated specific biomass and deforestation rate       models for several African REDD projects over the period 2008 - July 2013.
Significance and reach:            One of the development projects that uses the Plan Vivo standard to         sell carbon credits, the Sofala community in Mozambique, occupied 1,500         farms and 100 km2 of forest as of 2009 and has led to         voluntary carbon market credit sales worth $1.3M over the period 2003 -         2009.
Additional benefits include increases in rural employment and the         fraction of households raising commercial crops (32% and 72%         respectively in 2008, up from values of 8% and 23% when previously         audited in 2004).
All of these statistics are sourced from a 2010         Case-Report in the journal Carbon Management [D].
One of the projects for which Mitchard supplied biomass and         deforestation data, the RSPB Gola Forest Project in Sierra Leone (data         supplied in 2011), covers over 71,000 ha.
Formation of land-use / management policy     Pathway: Governments, NGOs and companies have made extensive       direct use of the research outputs in developing land-use policies and       strategies.
Other pathways include: I) a sabbatical year (2010 - 2011) by       Woodhouse that provided capacity building training in remote sensing       techniques within the Governmental Forest Research Institute (GFRI) of       Malawi, as corroborated by senior forestry research officials [E],       and II) Mitchard being an official member of Gabon's delegation to the       COP15 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting.
Significance and reach:             A workshop and conference based on the research at the GFRI of Malawi         (June 2011) led to a Policy Briefing to the Malawi Director of Forestry         [E,F].
The research is cited in the following policy-relevant NGO reports: I)         the 2010 International Institute for Environment and Development report         on REDD in southern African woodlands [G] and II) the         Observatory for the Forests of Central Africa report on The Forests           of the Congo Basin &#8226; State of the Forest 2008.
The Government of Mozambique uses the Edinburgh research as evidence         in 2012 planning documents related to preparation of REDD strategies [H].
The biomass mapping informed the Gabonese Government in its policies         and publications at COP meetings 2009 - 2011 and the countries land-use         plan for 2013.
In 2009, the research underpinned a POSTNote briefing for UK         parliamentarians on the needs of African nations in REDD, the drivers of         deforestation and possible solutions [I].
Approval of the BIOMASS satellite mission     Pathway, significance and reach: Building on the radar derived       research, the Edinburgh group have been key players in developing the       BIOMASS satellite proposal (estimation of biomass stocks from space has       only been possible at the coarsest levels), through the European Space       Agency (ESA).
In March 2013, ESA recommended BIOMASS for development and       launch as one of three Earth Explorer missions.
The influence of the       Edinburgh research in this decision is corroborated in the Report for       Selection [J].
This is the first ever forest-specific monitoring       mission, with a preliminary budget of &#8364;420M that will include large       investments in satellite technologies.
