     It is important to heighten awareness of IAS with the public for two main       reasons: firstly, their actions may be changed if they are better informed       (e.g.
in terms of purchasing and/or releasing exotic pets or plants);       secondly, they may be used in monitoring programmes to spot newly arrived       or spreading IAS.
`Citizen science' projects can have a major role in       both.
We have used relatively high profile organisms (starting with the       harlequin ladybird H. axyridis) in projects to engage the public       in the science of IAS.
The generation of interest and enthusiasm led to a       large and high quality dataset.
This was then used as a model for       development of a public recording project for other invasive animals and       plants (Recording Invasive Species Counts &#8212; RISC &#8212; www.nonnativespecies.org/recording/)       launched in 2010.
Peter Brown carried out development work for RISC, which       is led by Helen Roy and operates in collaboration with the GB Non-native       Species Secretariat and National Biodiversity Network.
Specifically, the research has had impact through:     (i) Informing conservation policy through collecting and analysing         wildlife data            The Harlequin Ladybird Survey not only led to the development of RISC         but also to the Non-native Species Alert (surveillance and monitoring)         system that Helen Roy leads as part of the GB Non-Native Species         Information Portal.
The driver for this is the importance of early         warning and rapid response in reducing the &#163;1.7 billion that non-native         species cost the UK economy (see CABI report http://cabiinvasives.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/the-economic-impact-of-invasive-species-on-great-britain-revealed/).
The following two quotes refer to the RISC project:            Welcoming the [RISC] project Wildlife Minister Huw Irranca-Davies         said, "Non-native species that become invasive are one of the greatest         threats to wildlife worldwide.
They are estimated to cost the British         economy at least &#163;3 billion a year, and their impacts can be far         reaching &#8212; they have adverse impacts on our native wildlife by         predation, competition and spread of disease.
They can threaten economic         interests such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and development."
Dr Niall Moore from the Non-native Species Secretariat said, "The         Non-native Species Information Portal is a key outcome of Governments'         long-term commitment to tackle the serious problems posed by invasive         non-native species.
It provides us with the basic information we need on         which to base objective and sound policy: we need information on trends         to see where to put our effort in future years and we need greater         public involvement &#8212; provided through RISC.
We also need to be alert to         new species turning up so we can respond rapidly and hopefully keep them         out &#8212; the Asian hornet is a good example."
We calculated long term (1990-2010) trends for Britain's 47 ladybird         species (Roy et al, 2011) for use by the Joint Nature Conservation         Committee (JNCC) as a biodiversity indicator.
Due to lack of data there         are few taxa for which equivalent trends are available.
Indeed, with         ladybirds, only five other taxa (bryophytes, moths, bees, wasps and         ants) are covered by the 2013 JNCC report &#8212; see http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/488_Webv2.pdf.
Such reports are produced for the UK Government and used to steer         policy, e.g.
in helping meet obligations under EU law to halt         biodiversity loss: our work helps address Convention of Biodiversity:         Aichi Biodiversity Targets 1 and 9 (see www.cbd.int/sp/targets).
Politicians' awareness of IAS was raised: a parliamentary question         relating to our H. axyridis research was answered in the House         of Commons (25/01/2011); Parliamentary Office of Science &amp;         Technology Postnote 303 (2008) features our research.
Our research featured in three DEFRA reports:       England Biodiversity Strategy: promoting the recovery of declining         species and habitats (17.
Impact of Invasive species in England) (2011).
Of more than 3,000 non-native species the 49 (including H. axyridis)         with the greatest potential impact on native wildlife were independently         identified.
Nuisance Insects and Climate Change (2009).
Summary of Responses to the Consultation on (1) The Review of Schedule         9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and (2) The Ban on Sale of         Certain Non-native Species (2009).
(ii) Utilizing `citizen science' and changing public attitudes to IAS     The way that IAS are recorded has been changed, as have attitudes towards       them.
This was achieved through successfully engaging the public in       citizen science projects, and the use of new technology:            Over 950,000 unique visitors (and over 1.1 million website visits &#8212;         data available from October 2006 - July 2013) to www.ladybird-survey.org,         www.harlequin-survey.org         and www.nonnativespecies.org/recording         thus substantially raising awareness of IAS.
15 exhibitions for the public, including three very major ones: 1.
Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition (30/06-04/07/2009; 5,500         visitors; 77 press articles generated); 2.
Moscow Science Festival         (08-10/10/2010; over 30,000 visitors) by invitation of the British 		        Embassy (Moscow) in a scheme to link British and Russian science; 3.
BBC         Gardeners' World (15-19/06/2011; over 100,000 visitors).
50 public outreach events (2005-13), e.g.
bug hunts &amp; insect         displays.
26 television interviews and features (e.g.
BBC 1 10 O'clock News         07/11/2006; BBC Autumnwatch 16/10/2009); 80 radio interviews, including         20 on national radio; over 200 newspaper and magazine articles featuring         our research (2005-13).
Articles in major magazines such as BBC Wildlife (one major feature         and three smaller ones), National Geographic (one page feature,         September 2008) and Observer magazine (three page feature, 15 January         2012).
Annual column on ladybirds in the popular journal British Wildlife         (readership of 25,000) written since 2009.
Helen Roy and Peter Brown were members of the Royal Entomological         Society National Insect Week steering group in 2006 and 2008.
(iii) Educating and training the public on IAS and ladybirds            Our research was used extensively for education purposes.
For example,         our work on H. axyridis spread was used: 1. by OCR in a 2009         GCSE examination question; 2. as a case study for an AQA Human Biology         book (Lowrie &amp; Goodger, 2009); 3. in a schools activity pack         published with BBC Breathing Places (April 2011).
7 training workshops run (over 100 people trained in ladybird         identification and ecology).
52 talks (2005-13) delivered to wildlife societies, schools, etc.
Our book on the ladybirds of Britain and Ireland (Roy et al, 2011)         sold out within 9 months and went to reprint (over 700 copies sold).
Our colour field chart for identifying British ladybird species         (Majerus et al, 2006) sold over 34,000 copies (2006-12).
Over 20,000 free copies of a ladybird identification chart downloaded         or distributed at outreach events.
