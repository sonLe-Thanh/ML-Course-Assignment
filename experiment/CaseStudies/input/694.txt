     One Extreme to Another was toured nationally in UK schools/other       community spaces (2008-13) by GW Theatre (circa 500 performances, total       audience of circa 100,000 people).
The play was advertised via the GW       Theatre website and a linked 'Extreme News' site and was especially staged       in cities where there had been recent inter-community tensions (e.g.
Bury,       Oldham, Rochdale, and Luton).
The direct beneficiaries have been secondary       school pupils, college students, their teachers and members of community       groups who have been enabled to discuss issues of far-right and Islamic       extremism raised by the play (in schools and colleges using pre- and       post-performance resources: http://www.gwextreme.com/resources.html).
Feedback was collected via the play's website (http://www.gwextreme.com/feedback.html)       and there were positive evaluation reports.
A number of government       documents also referred to the play's effectiveness.
Evidence of the two       types of impact is provided below.
1.
Used drama to open up for discussion by young people and teachers a         sensitive topic which can be difficult to approach in classes or other         public spaces.
Feedback to the GW website (Source a) suggests that the play had       impact on awareness of extremism and of its complex origins, as selected       quotations show:     'I have been involved in anti-racist work all my life and thought this       was one of the best plays I have ever seen.
Dealing with complex issues       the play moved along quickly and held the attention of all our Key Stage 4       pupils.
It was very "real" to our pupils'.
(Peter, teacher, Burnley       10/03/2008)     'I watched the play in a predominantly white school ...
I dislike the       fact that they have been sent to a predominantly white school where they       have not met many people of other backgrounds and therefore have extremely       narrow minds.
I hope the plays opened the minds of a few people'       (anonymous pupil 25/2/2008)     'A well-researched play bringing a lot of political/cultural issues to       the forefront and encouraging community cohesion.
A very true image of       what is going on and how we are being brainwashed (Najma, 30/04/2008)     'The play tackled a very difficult subject and made you think about your       own opinions and communities.
The hot seating at the end gave everybody an       opportunity to participate in the content of the performance (J,       30/04/2009)     These individual responses can be put in context by two evaluations with       detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of the impact of the play       on student attitudes.
The Bury Report (Source b) concisely       summarises teachers' views: 'theatre productions provoke discussion and       reaction more than any other input', 'It took the lid off a controversial       area and allowed open discussion', 'the play allowed pupils to discuss       sensitive issues through the characters, taking it way from the personal',       'they found that the parallel stories in the play made them feel "more       comfortable" about dealing with the issue of violent extremism, which was       shown to be an issue for all groups rather than just for one (paragraphs       5.3, 5.5).
It also reports on 1200 questionnaires completed by students to       evaluate the effects of the play, as in these three (of seven) questions:                                Questions           %Pre           %Post           % Shift                             I understand what is meant by               Political Extremism                                                                                                  Yes           35           73           +37                             No           33           10           -23                             Not Sure           31           17           -14                             Being British is about being               white and speaking English                                                                                                  Yes           16           12           -4                             No           75           82           +7                             Not Sure            9           6           -3                             Any young people may be drawn               into the extremes of political activity                                                                                                  Yes           40           68           +28                             No           16            9            -7                             Not Sure           44           23           -9                          The Greater Manchester schools' report, July 2011, (Source c)       draws on data collected after performances at Abraham Moss High School,       Burnage Media and Arts College, Chorlton High School, Little Lever       Languages College and Manchester Health Academy.
Quotations from the key       findings of the Manchester report occupy the remainder of this section       (emphases as in original):     'What the play has to say to young people     One of the main things young people commented on was how the play had         increased their awareness of their own vulnerability to exploitation       by extremist political and religious organisations.
The play made them       realise that religion can be used as a manipulative tool...
The play had       made them more wary as a result; many commented that it had made them       realise the importance of making up their own minds and not         being blinded by prejudices which are often reinforced by the media       and sometimes by parental views.
They felt empowered to question         things more.
A positive feeling was that pupils recognised through       the play that there was more that united people in communities than         divided them.
They felt that the play encouraged them to find out       more about other people's cultures, which would lead to greater       understanding and tolerance.
Many pupils followed up the idea of cultural         identity, particularly what it means today to be `British' and       whether we truly have a `multicultural' society: this would seem to be         a fruitful avenue for schools to explore with their students.
There       was a definite sense in the interviews that pupils felt that the play       `filled a gap' or met a need in the curriculum.
They are aware of how       difficult it might be for teachers, who often steer clear of these       difficult topics; pupils see this as `unhelpful' as school is probably the       only place where the issues could be discussed safely and in a balanced       and informed way.
The play's effectiveness     Pupils said that the play's effectiveness was partly owing to the fact       that it was even-handed; the issues were presented as common to both       the Asian and the white families: it was clear in discussion that this was       a key factor in the play's being taken seriously by young people.
They       were able to identify especially with the two young boys in the play, and       commented that they found all the characters realistic and credible.
They also commented on how well the play demonstrated the fact that       children are often more open-minded, and that we become more closed as we       get older and are exposed to prejudice.
Many pupils felt that the play       offered a hopeful ending and that this was important as it gave       them the idea that things might change for the better...
Some pupils       commented, however, that they would have liked more exploration of the       class and religious issues raised in the play.
It was appreciated that       presenting the issues in an entertaining and humorous way made       them more accessible to young people.
Humour was seen as a release         valve in a play which dealt in essence with very serious subjects.
Pupils felt that the use of racist language was a useful       way of highlighting a contentious issue and that this allowed       discussion in follow-up which might otherwise have been difficult.
It       reflects the way language is often used socially and lent authenticity       to the play.
Pupils were very appreciative of the openness of the       play and of the fact that it did not talk down to them or gloss over       difficult areas.
Some pupils recognised that there were wider issues       beneath the main storyline, such as personal and social problems,       prejudices, cultural differences, all of which influenced the characters'       actions.
They appreciated the multi-layered aspect of the play and       felt that it gave them much material to think about and discuss.
The play's impact     Pupils made links between the play and other areas of PSHCE such       as bullying and domestic violence, commenting that these too were       forms of violent extremism.
They realised how easy it would be for         anyone to be radicalised and that they were especially         vulnerable as young people.
The play was presented to them at the       right time in their development, when they were adult enough to be made       aware of these topics, but still flexible enough to work out their own       views.
They had been forced to re-examine their own prejudices and       made to realise that they too stereotyped people...: The play illustrated       ... how we use generalisations as excuses to dislike and persecute       others, lumping them together rather than seeing them as individuals.
Interviewees had been stimulated to recognise the difficulties         inherent in different communities living together and of making       disparate groups aware and appreciative of one another's cultures...
The       issue of `Britishness' was no longer clear-cut, and it may       not be the `be-all and end-all', although most pupils felt that it was       necessary to hold on to their culture as a means of identity.
They       felt that people should be proud of and celebrate their cultures but that       no one culture should be valued exclusively above the others.'
In Appendix 2, the Report also discusses a performance for an audience       from two schools ('Little Lever Languages College, a school with mainly       white pupils and very few from ethnic minority groups, and Burnage Media       Arts College, a single-sex (boys only) school whose pupils come from a       wide range of ethnic backgrounds') which had a marked impact on students:       'Prior to the performance the pupils felt apprehensive.
They thought that the experience would be `nerve- wracking'       and were very unsure of what to expect or how they would be received.
However, as a result of the support and guidance they were offered       on the day when they split into groups for follow-up activities after the       performance, pupils gradually relaxed and worked together on their       own presentations.
The project was so successful that quite a       number of pupils exchanged mobile phone numbers and have continued their       contact, and there are plans for the two schools to work together again in       the future.'

Contributed to a government policy intervening in a serious social         and political issue     The play was performed for MPs at Portcullis House on 26/3/2009 as an       example of initiatives which might help communities resist extremism.
The       effectiveness of the play in this role was discussed in relevant national       fora, including Youth Work Now (Source d), Eastern Eye       (Source e) and the British-Asian redhotcurry site (Source         f).
Youth Work Now says the 'power of theatre has been       harnessed in a production that encourages young people to explore complex       topics'; Eastern Eye comments that the play 'is an attempt to get       people to openly debate extremist views and challenge them' while redhotcurry       refers to Hazel Blear's announcement of funding for projects including       this play which 'have mainly national reach and scope'.
Hazel Blears (as       Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government) judged the play       to be effective, saying 'I am delighted to be supporting G. W. Theatre to       deliver their play...on a national basis.
We have seen that extremists       promote a world-view based on division and difference and prey on people       who feel ignored or frustrated about their chances in life and confused       about their identity.
[The play] provides a means through which issues are       brought to light, where they can be acknowledged, discussed and addressed'       (cited in Source g).
The play is similarly cited as a successful       example of counter-extremism in the government's Prevent Strategy - a         Guide for Local Partners (Source h): 'it is a hard-hitting       but also a very entertaining and funny piece of theatre which stimulates       debate around extremism amongst young people'.
Indeed, performances of the       play have also been part of local government initiatives to address       community cohesion, including the Leeds Bringing Communities Together       Conference (Source i).
Dates of impacts: 2008-2013.
