     Since 2008, Prof Rivers has led developments in applied bullying       research, monitoring and intervention internationally.
In March 2011, his       work with Paul Poteat (Boston College) on challenging homophobic epithets       was cited at the first ever White House conference on bullying attended by       the President of the United States, the First Lady, the US Secretaries of       Education and Health and Human Services [see Source 3].
Subsequently, in the same year he served on two US Department of Education       sponsored expert panels to advise on (i) the determination of a uniform       definition of bullying behaviour to be incorporated into public health       surveillance for 9th-12th grade students in US high       schools (Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System; YRBSS &#8212; see Sources         4 and 5) and (ii) understand better the relationship between       bullying and suicide-related behaviours among American youth, supporting       the CDC's strategic direction on suicide prevention at a national level.
As part of the expert panel to develop a uniform definition of bullying,       and provide items that represent constructs of bullying for the YRBSS       (which is conducted in the majority of states in the US), together with       co-panellists, he argued for a definition that includes single incidents       that have the potential to be repeated.
This represents a significant       departure from existing definitions of bullying used in the majority of       states, and challenges legislation introduced by some states that require       a pattern of behaviour to be evidenced before the term `bullying' can be       used.
This approach assists teachers in taking preventative action when       `bullying' behaviour is first identified.
The short definition now used by       the US Department of Education (stopbullying.gov) in promoting its       national anti-bullying strategies is based upon that devised by the expert       panel (see Source 6).
Rivers' work (conducted in the UK) on bystander wellbeing continues to       build momentum and has led to significant media interest worldwide.
This       research now informs part of the US Government's federal education       priorities for creating safe schools (see Source 7) and has been       showcased by members of the current administration in promoting `the       Washington Agenda'.
For example, on 2 June, 2011, his work was       incorporated into a presentation entitled `Understanding Bullying' by       Kevin Jennings (Assistant Deputy Secretary and Director of the Office of       Safe and Drug Free Schools, US Department of Education) to the American       Federation of Teachers (AFT) (see Source 1).
Subsequently,       it was cited by the US Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, in a speech he       gave at the 2nd Annual Federal Partners' Summit on Bullying in       Washington, D.C. on 21 September, 2011:     Ian Rivers' research on students' mental health shows that students         who witness bullying are more likely to use tobacco or alcohol, to be         depressed, and to miss or skip school [see Source 2].
Beyond the school context, this research is changing the way that       discrimination is understood in the context of anti-bias and anti-genocide       education.
For example, Beth Lilach, Senior Director of Education &amp;       Community Affairs at the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center in New       York state, has incorporated the findings from his research published in School         Psychology Quarterly into anti-discrimination training for the       following groups of practitioners in the state: law enforcement personnel       (cadets and commanders); parents; educators; school administrators; school       support staff; faculty and students at Nassau Community College, Dowling       College, Long Island University, Adelphi University and Hofstra University       (Sorority and Fraternity Leaders); the US Naval Reserve Officers Training       Corps; the Immaculate Conception Seminary; North Shore-Long Island Jewish       Hospital; holocaust educators &amp; tolerance facilitators (see Source         8).
Since 2012, Rivers has written a regular column on school behaviour for       the Times Educational Supplement (TES Professional) highlighting       how the findings from his own and others' research can be used by parents,       teachers, governors and leadership teams in schools to combat all forms of       bullying.
His series of articles provides guidance to education       professionals on approaches to combat bullying and discrimination (see Source         9).
As of 27 September 2013, the TES has over 2.7 million online       users in over 275 countries and territories (see Source 10).
