     Thailand became a pathfinder in 2001 when it introduced UHC while a lower       middle-income       country.
Hughes' research on the Thai reforms had impact by (1) providing       a case study         demonstrating the viability of UHC in poorer countries to the       international policy community,       (2) highlighting the importance of policy implementation challenges       such as the `equity of       distribution' problem and (3) suggesting changes in the Thai resource         allocation mechanism       to safeguard the finances of community health services.
Evidence from the       study has been used       by the National Health Security Office (NHSO &#8212; the UCS purchasing       organisation for 47 million       beneficiaries) to support technical changes, like ring-fenced         budgets for health centres and         national priority services (see extracts from testimonials from       high-level officials).
Regarding (1) above, the 2007 article [R1] provided an accessible account       of the Thai reforms and       the financing mechanism.
It was cited to illustrate the viability of       pro-poor health reforms in       developing countries in the WHO World Health Report         2008 (p.112) (C1), and the World Health           Report 2010, Background Paper 28 (p.         31) (C2).
It was one of two illustrative case studies       featured in the launch document for the Ministerial Leadership           Initiative for Global Health           Reform, funded by the Bill and Belinda Gates Foundation (file       on RIS).
As Prof. Yip states above,       the 2007/2010 papers [R1, R2] are seen as adding a political economy         dimension to economic         analysis, which has extended the `reach' of the impact beyond         Thailand.
No other published       study of the UCS involves a large field study by a Western academic.
Strengths and weaknesses       of the Thai reforms identified by Hughes are discussed in the India           Health Report 2010 (C7       p.121), Global Healthwatch 3 (Alternative World Health         Report 2011, p. 93) (C6), and in       publications from the International Labour Organisation (C3), Rockefeller       Foundation (C4, C5), the       World Bank, and the Public Health Foundation of India (C8, pp.
17, 101).
R1 has been used as         source material for policy workshops on UHC in India organized by       Results for Development       and the Joint Learning Network for UHC.
See for example:       http://www.ilo.org/gimi/gess/RessShowRessource.do?ressourceId=18697       (Page numbers above       show where Hughes' research is cited.

Under (2), the study found problems in implementing the UHC reforms relevant         to both Thais and         policy makers in other countries.
The Rockefeller Foundation, Senior       Advisor Health, Bangkok,       writes that Hughes' research is 'useful not only to the Thais but the         broader development         community like ours' (testimonial on file).
Thai policy makers       addressed the problems identified by       conducting further studies (e.g.
Srithamrongsawat, 2010).
A testimonial       from the Director of HISRO       says, `Evidence from the 2007/2010 papers was a factor that led HISRO         to carry out a larger         national survey published in 2010 [that] confirmed there had been         problems in some areas.
These         early studies have helped us to evaluate ... policy options in this         area, and to provide evidence to           the NHSO and MoPH in support of a policy that separates off [some           budgets]'.
This led to (3) impact via changes in the resource allocation         mechanism.
The Director Bureau       of Policy &amp; Planning, NHSO writes: `The research by Professor         Hughes suggests the need to           "ear-mark" some monies specifically for health centres and to           prioritize certain areas of           public health activity by funding these from the centre,         and so supports a strand of policy we         have strengthened in recent years' (testimonial).
This led to         more funding for health promotion         projects and benefit for rural people among the 47 million UCS members.
The substantial       improvements the reforms have made to health care for poorer Thai people       regarding access to       care and reduction in catastrophic health expenditure are documented in       the recent 10-Year         Assessment of the UCS (R5).
Hughes was invited by HISRO to join the 10-year assessment team, focusing       on evaluation of       policy implementation, and helped plan and administer research interviews       for the assessment       exercise.
Hughes co-authored A Decade of Thai UCS Implementation       (Srithhamrongsawat et al.
2011 &#8212; R4), which borrows some implementation theory from the 2010 paper       [R2], and he was in       the Thai team that helped prepare the main 10 Year Assessment       (`synthesis') report (R5).
The NHSO Director comments: `Professor Hughes' past studies helped him         make a useful         contribution to our analysis, and we borrowed parts of his           implementation theory framework       for our team report.
We also discuss the "equity of distribution"         problem in both the implementation         theme report and the main synthesis report... Another major recommendation       that was also in         [Hughes'] early papers, is to strengthen area-based           commissioning, so that there is a stronger         local purchaser to operate beside the (..) provider'.
The HISRO       Director confirms this, saying that       Hughes `assisted with the [10 year] research', `took part in         the discussions about the overall         synthesis report', and `commented on the various drafts'       (testimonials on file).
The 10 Year Assessment received national press coverage.
In       February 2012 the WHO Office       for SE Asia quoted the report and endorsed the Thai UCS as an         attractive model for other low       and middle income countries.
The Rockefeller Foundation announced support       for a capacity-building       programme (`CAP UHC') in which Thai experts offer training on       technical aspects of UHC       to healthcare managers and professionals from other countries.
At the       ASEAN +3 Health Ministers'       conference in Phuket in 2012 members agreed to set up a shared UHC       network, with Thailand       providing the secretariat for this initiative.
Dr Samrit Srithamrongsawat,       formerly of HISRO (co-author       R4-R6), led the writing of the Thai health sector plan for 2013-15,       which contains         proposals for area-based commissioning and other recommendations       from the 10-Year       assessment report; he was promoted to Deputy Secretary-General of the NHSO       in 2013.
