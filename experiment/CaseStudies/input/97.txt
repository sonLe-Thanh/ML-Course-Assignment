     The WHO recognises "The Importance of Pharmacovigilance - Safety       Monitoring of Medicinal       Products" for impacting drug regulation, clinical practice and       international health       (http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4893e/).
Pharmacovigilance imparts an impact by       empowerment and reassurance through knowledge.
Negative results (results       not supporting a       signal regarding medication risk) are as important as positive results,       but the impacts are less       demonstrable, and do not attract media attention.
In 2006, the European       Medicines Agency       adopted a guideline on "The exposure to medicinal products during       pregnancy: Need for post-       authorisation data".
Within, EUROCAT is listed as a source of information       for human pregnancy       data collected post-authorisation (pg 9)       (http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Regulatory_and_procedural_guideline/2         009/11/WC500011303.pdf).
Our research does not and should not stand       alone.
It is a component       of the wider global pharmacovigilance agenda.
Evidence of impact described as:        1.
Enhancing awareness of women of childbearing age suffering from           epilepsy and           prescribed AEDs, and their Healthcare Professionels (HCPs), empowering           both to make           informed decisions through evidence-based practice that will           reduce/prevent the risk of           teratogenic harm to unborn children potentially exposed to AEDs.
The valproic acid study[2] based on birth defect information         of nearly 4M births had visibility in a         high impact medical journal (NEJM) and in media (Source 1).
The         reemphasis and further         clarification and quantification of the known teratogenicity, was an         important part of changing         awareness and practice.
The lamotrigine study[1] which was         largely negative was also important in         helping women/HCPs make optimal medication choices based on updated         patient information         (Source 2).
Our research has been included in systematic reviews which inform         evidence-based practice         (Source 3) for women with epilepsy, but also with bipolar disorder, now         a more common indication         for use of some AEDs.
Contribution to Medscape, Motherisk and Patient.co.uk -         authoritative, trusted, accessible         online information for pregnant women/HCPs regarding the safety/risk to         the developing foetus         associated with maternal exposure to drugs.
Rigorous literature         reviewing allows rapid integration         of new practice-changing evidence, such as our research on carbamazepine         and lamotrigine         (Source 4).

A change in the process by which GSK practices post-marketing           pharmacovigilance in           relation to lamotrigine       In 2006, based on a signal from emerging data of the North American AED         Pregnancy Registry,         GSK alerted HCPs to a possible association of lamotrigine exposure with         orofacial clefts.
A US         Federal Drugs Agency (FDA) warning followed         (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/u           cm126225.htm).
GSK, FDA, UK Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency         (MHRA) and European         regulators (EMA) revised patient information, and agreed new research         was needed to         independently confirm this finding.
GSK approached Prof. Dolk (2006) to         establish the possibility of         funding feasibility research by EUROCAT (Source 5).
EUROCAT offered more         appropriate and         powerful observational research methods (Source 2, 6 and 7), than         heretofore possible using the         GSK run International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry (1992-2010) The         results of the EUROCAT         research that ensued were disseminated by confidential report to GSK         (Source 8) and scientific         paper[1].
GSK shared the results with regulators who endorsed         a revision to the core safety         information provided in the Pregnancy and Lactation section of GSKs         Global Data Sheet for         lamotrigine, by insertion of - "A case control study did not           demonstrate an increased risk of oral           clefts compared to other defects following exposure to lamotrigine"         (Source 2).
Based on our data,         the regulators expressed an interest in monitoring a potential signal         for club foot and lamotrigine         (Source 2), a study now underway (http://www.eurocat-network.eu/content/Poster-Lamotrigine-           Mejnartowicz.pdf) within the GSK-funded research.
Following         closure of GSK's Registry, Prof.         Harden, Director of Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center, published a         commentary explaining its         replacement by further use of EUROCAT data (Source 9).

Benefit to the practice of other researchers in Europe.
EUROCAT guidelines[5] are utilised as the gold standard         methodology by others when conducting         research into birth defects and AEDs and are helping overcome         non-comparability between studies         (Source 10).
Another important impact is strengthening the system of         signal generation and signal         evaluation in AED pharmacovigilance among research groups worldwide,         such that signals         generated by one research study are evaluated by one or more others, as         our methodology clearly         adheres to and has promoted this approach.
An indirect impact of this         research is that, in order to         ensure scientific independence and transparency in industry-sponsored         research, Prof Dolk         chaired, for four years to 2012, the European Medicines Agency Working         Group which developed         a Code of Conduct for Scientific Independence and Transparency         (http://www.encepp.eu/documents/encepp_studies/ENCePP%20Code%20of%20Conduct_201005           07.pdf).

Sustainable Impact       These studies were the first to use EUROCAT data for investigation of         specific drugs.
Since then         we have had many queries from pharmaceutical companies/researchers         requesting         data/information on other medications.
A PhD student at the         University has analysed the         EUROCAT data in relation to antidepressant safety; an ongoing GSK funded         study continues to         study lamotrigine [4].
EUROmediCAT is looking further at         newer generation AEDs, insulin analogs,         antidepressants and antiasthmatic drugs, is testing new methodologies         and has a wider aim of         building a European system for reproductive safety evaluation.
