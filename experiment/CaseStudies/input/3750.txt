     Results of the MIDAS group on the quantification of contamination levels       on 'clean' surgical instruments have been used to formulate, and are       continuing to influence, government policy.
As a minimum estimate, this       policy helps the work of 20,000 NHS sterile services hospital staff and       contributes to the health and safety of all patients who now undergo       surgery, and the technology has been considered at an operation level at       the Home Office for use in the aftermath of a CBRN incident.
The new       EFSCAN technology is in the final stages of commercialisation.

Public NHS policy: surgical equipment contamination monitoring and         decontamination     The MIDAS group's research findings described in section 2 have been used       in the formulation of 2012 Department of Health policy.
The 2012/13 policy       framework, CFPP-01-01 (Choice Framework for Local Policy Procedures for       Decontamination) is the code of practice for the management and       decontamination of surgical instruments that is adopted throughout the       NHS, as required by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 with regard to NHS       Decontamination (Sterile Services; Parts E and work acknowledged in Parts       A and B) facilities.
[S1]     CFPP-01-01 explicitly cites the researchers and describes the studies       completed by the MIDAS group: Part A, see text on P8, paragraph 2.40       (section on 'Protein quantification using epifluorescence scanning'), p29,       paragraph A1 (chapter on 'Inactivation of prions using novel technologies'       describing 'instrument exposure to cold plasma' and further references on       p38, paragraph A86.
It also cites the report 'ESAC-Pr: New       Technologies Working Group Report on Prion Inactivating Agents' written by       the working group (2008), of which R. Baxter is a member.
[S2] This report       includes citations and references to the MIDAS research on pps       8,20,21,26,27,29.

Health     MIDAS has extended the technology through research trials currently       underway with Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Ninewells (Dundee), Glasgow       Dental Hospital.
The consultant microbiologist, leading the work says "The         introduction of new detection technology, such as EFSCAN, is essential         to drive improvements in the standards of decontamination of medical         instruments throughout the Health Service".
[F1] Data obtained in       these projects will inform supplements to CFPP-01-01[S1] with regard to       defining maximum permissible levels of protein contamination on       reprocessed surgical devices and driving the adoption of new detection       technology (such as EFSCAN) when commercial systems become available.
A       letter of support from a DoH Senior Principal Research Officer states "We         will continue to use the outputs from this study as we develop aspects         of the CFPP in future and anticipate that successful commercialisation         of your technology for assessment of instrument decontamination will         make it available to NHS Trusts for their surgical sterilisation         departments".
[F2]     The CONTEST funded research demonstrated the efficacy of the EFSCAN       technology for both detection and decontamination of material from       possessions and equipment clean-up after a CBRN incident.
In a       corroborating letter, the DoH CBRN Research Manager states "There is a         clear concept of use of the research findings, namely to detect         contamination and provide clean possessions and other sensitive items in         the aftermath of a CBRN incident... results from the projects have been         considered at an operational level at the Home Office".

Economic: commercialisation of EFSCAN for detection of         contamination     Through Edinburgh Research Innovation, MIDAS exploited the IP developed       in the 2002-8 research.
Working with Edinburgh Biosciences, a       proof-of-concept EFSCAN instrument for hospital Sterile Services       Departments use was constructed in 2011-12.
In early 2013, Edinburgh       BioSciences was awarded a SMART:SCOTLAND grant of &#163;100k by Scottish       Enterprise to develop and bring the EFSCAN system to market by the end of       2013.
Edinburgh Biosciences UK has four salaried people now developing the       EFSCAN proof-of-concept design into commercial prototypes for manufacture       and marketing.
Two are PhD level engineers, one Masters (mechanical       engineering); and an electronic engineer (honours degree).
The Edinburgh       Biosciences CEO said "Following the successful development of a         proof-of-concept instrument, Edinburgh Biosciences Ltd. sees commercial         exploitation of this instrument as a key element of its business launch         plan.
As the reliability and performance characteristics of the system         are confirmed, marketing and sales of the instrument will expand         internationally from a UK base.
The US is a target market given that         awareness of the problems of contamination of surgical instruments is         already in the public domain".
[F4]     A portable `hand-held' fluorescence detector for fast detection of       biomolecules on surfaces, in the context of homeland security, has also       been developed.
The press (Telegraph, Guardian, Scotsman newspaper articles; BBC News and       radio, and specialist publications) note the value to public and the       profession, and cite MIDAS's work directly.
Examples include BBC       reports,[S3],[S4] and an Association for Perioperative Practice report       which cites [S1], stating "The prevention of infection is one of the         fundamental principles of patient care...The effective decontamination         of surgical instruments is critical in the management of healthcare         associated infection and patient safety; therefore it is essential that         practices and processes applied to thorough decontamination of all         surgical instruments is of the highest quality and reflects modern day         standards".
