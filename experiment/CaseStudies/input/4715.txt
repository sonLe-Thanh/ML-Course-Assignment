     (i) Improving access: The online catalogue represents a major       advance in the public accessibility of the archive.
One key beneficiary of       the online catalogue (and of the Penguin Archive Project generally) is the       Penguin Collectors Society (PCS).
The PCS is a registered charity with       more than 500 members internationally.
It encourages and supports the       study and collecting of works published by Penguin.
The Chairman of the       PCS, states that the improvement in the catalogue `has been the greatest       achievement of the Project for researchers into the history of Penguin       Books' [a].
As an example, the archive prompted Gaby Wood's Daily         Telegraph article 'A Touch of Frost: the Story of Penguin's Secret       Editor' [b].
The article draws on the archive's holdings of the personal       papers of Eunice Frost, an editor at Penguin in the 1930s and the first       female director, aiming to recuperate `one of the [publishing] industry's       most significant, yet forgotten, forces'.
Following the archive's       cataloguing, Penguin Books have solicited assistance from the archivists       in the preparation of their own catalogues and lists, including requesting       information to identify typography and text designers through Penguin's       history and a list of Pelican publications.
The archive also provided       assistance during the relaunch of the Penguin English Library on 26 April       2012, including a request for journalist to do a feature on the       archive/PEL by Penguin Press Officer, Mari Yamazaki.
The archive is valued       by members of the public conducting independent research, or with an       interest in publishing history, for example an independent scholar, who is       using the archive in order to write a chapter on the Penguin Classics       editorship of Betty Radice for a forthcoming book on women Classical       scholars.
She is also working on a study of the reception of Modern Greek       poetry, in which the Penguin Four Greek Poets played a crucial       role [c].
The improved access to the archive can in part be measured by       the significant increase in the number of visits to the archive, from 51       in 2006 to 284 in 2010, or from the number of items signed out from the       Penguin Archive, which rose from 643 in 2008 to 2009 to 1000 in 2010 to       2012 (the latter figure representing 40% of all items signed out from the       Library's archives).
(ii) Raising awareness:     Penguin Books was founded in 1935 as a `means of converting       book-borrowers into book-buyers'.
The company had an `impact agenda in       making books available to huge audiences through high quality inexpensive       paperbacks, so it was natural that the project which brought the Penguin       archives into the public domain should be mindful of its own impact.
From       the launch onward the project has engaged and informed the wider reading       public that has been shaped by Penguin Books and the publishing revolution       it helped to bring about.
The launch of the project was covered in       articles in the national press and broadcasting media, e.g.
Toby       Clements's Daily Telegraph article 'History of Penguin Archive'       [d] which celebrates the status of the archive as "a record of `the       democritisation of reading'".
The launch event in Bristol on 2 December       2008 included a poetry reading by James Fenton at the Watershed (and       featured a mini-exhibition), with an attendance of 240 (sold out).
The       project hosted conferences and study-days, all of which included events       open to the public and generated media coverage:            `Lady Chatterley and Her Consequences' (2 July, 2009).
This event         included plenaries from Fiona Becket and Alistair McCleery and a         mini-exhibition.
Donaldson was interviewed about Lady Chatterley's           Lover in February 2011 on The One Show, BBC1 [e], which         has an average daily audience of 5 million viewers.
`75 Years of Penguin Books: an International Multidisciplinary         Conference' (29 June&#8212;1 July, 2010).
This event featured plenaries from         Christopher Ricks, David Cannadine, Kim Reynolds, and Simon Eliot, a         panel discussion from Penguin's current editorial staff, a mini         exhibition and tours of the archive.
The audience of 75 included members         of the PCS, publishers, graphic designers and writers.
Public lectures         on the history of Penguin design by Phil Baines and James Pardey         attracted an audience of 200.
The conference was favourably reviewed in         The Penguin Collector, which described `three fascinating days of         Penguinary investigation, dissection, explanation and celebration' [f],         whilst the Chairman of the PCS described it as `a considerable         contribution to the overall knowledge of the history of Penguin books         and the extraordinary contribution which the firm has made to the social         history of the century' [a].
The event prompted an article, `Picking up         Penguins for 75 Years', by Clare Matheson, Business reporter, on BBC         news online [g], which raised awareness of the role of Penguin Books in         publishing history.
`The New Poetry and Penguin Modern Poets: 50 Years', 16 March 2012.
This conference stemmed from Wootten's research on Al Alvarez [6].
It         featured a plenary lecture by Edward Lucie-Smith, and panels on Penguin         Poetry and Translation, Al Alvarez and The New Poetry, and         Penguin Modern Poets, attended by 25 conference delegates.
The public         face of the conference featured a Q &amp; A session with Al Alvarez         (introduced by William Wootten) and readings by three of the poets         published in the first series: John Fuller, Edward Lucie-Smith, and Tom         Raworth, and attracted an audience of 300.
A programme sparked by the         conference entitled `The Paperback Poets', in the BBC Radio 4 series Archive           on 4, commemorated the Penguin Modern Poets series and featured a         visit to the Penguin Archive [h].
A series of Penguin Readers' Days (for the general public) was devoted to       the place of Penguin Books in popular cultural memory, inviting Penguin       readers to share personal memories:            'Introducing Penguin: A Penguin Readers' Day', 24 October, 2009.
Included workshops by members of the project and talk by the biographer         of Allen Lane, Jeremy Lewis.
Featured mini-exhibition.
Attendance: 30.
'Puffin Study Day', 15 October 2010.
Included talks by Puffin editors         past and present and author and illustrator Jan Pienkowski.
Featured         mini-exhibition.
Attendance: 65.
'Penguin, Puffin, and the Paperback         Revolution', a programme presented by the author Michael         Morpurgo&#8212;son-in-law of Allen Lane, founder of Penguin Books&#8212;featured a         visit to the Penguin Archive as part of a history of the firm and his         own involvement with it (j).
'Writers and Publishers', 26 November 2011.
Speakers included         historian of Penguin Steve Hare and current Penguin authors and editors         reflecting on editorial processes past and present.
Attendance: 40.
The project contributed to the InsideArts festival, the University of       Bristol's major public-access arts event, in October 2011, with a display       and mini-exhibition of material from the archive, and a panel discussion       (18 October) led by Lyon, Donaldson, and Hannah Lowery (Special       Collections Archivist).
The event was fully booked with an audience of 30.
Feedback revealed a mixed audience including members of the public from       Bristol.
Attendees found the event `stimulating and interesting' whilst       one individual noted, `I wallowed in nostalgia' [i].
(iii) Links with Penguin     Throughout the project there have been extensive links with Penguin       Books.
Current Penguin employees have participated in Readers' Days and       the three-day conference, and events have been carefully coordinated with       Penguin.
Archive staff have helped Penguin with queries over the archive,       being of particular assistance to both Penguin and Penguin USA in their       gathering of archival material for the 75th anniversary of Penguin Books.
The excellent relationship between Bristol and Penguin was confirmed when       former Penguin MD Helen Fraser was awarded an honorary degree in 2010.
The       2010 conference, `75 Years of Penguins', included a special session       'Judging a Book by Its Cover', with guest lectures on Penguin design by       Phil Baines and James Pardey.
The event introduced current members of       editorial, design and marketing staff at Allen Lane, The Penguin Press,       Penguin and Puffin to an academic audience and to members of the general       public.
It was reported back that issues raised at the conference were fed       into Penguin's discussions of current publishing strategy.
The Department of History has secured corporate sponsorship from Penguin       Books for an annual `Penguin History Lecture', partly on the basis of the       company's links to Bristol through the archive.
Professor Robert Bickers,       Director of the AHRC-funded British Inter-University China Centre, secured       funding for a post-doctoral researcher to work for Penguin Books examining       the archive's holdings of editorial files on early Penguin publications       related to China.
Penguin China want to capitalise on the press's heritage       identity as part of its marketing in China.
They aim to republish some of       the work, and this research will help to inform that programme.
The project was instrumental in securing two major donations to the       archive, the first of books from the personal library of Penguin founder       Sir Allen Lane (given by his daughter Christine Teale), the second the       Rough Guide archive (given by Mark Ellingham, founder of the Rough         Guides).
