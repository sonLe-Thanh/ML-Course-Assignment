     This research has had longstanding influence on policy and practice in       the UK, on government, schools, charities and local authorities (LAs) and       international influence on policy and practice in some areas of Europe,       Asia and Australasia.
In England, according to evidence from the DfE, the       research formed a `major part of the evidence base for policy         development' in the Department for Education's children's services       delivery mechanisms over the decade that included 2008-11 (senior research       officer DfE) (IMP1).
Our research informed (in 2008) a move in       national policy from having one extended school in each LA area to       focusing attention on the availability of extended services in every       school and locality.
It provided evidence for scaling up the policy,       defining the expanding elements of the extended services model, and led to       the decision to make funding available to schools post-2010.
A senior       research officer at the DfE explained the impact on school funding: `funding         was made available (by the DfE) to schools from 2010 onwards (a subsidy         pathfinder) to help them provide a wide range of activities for children         and young people who were disadvantaged by economic circumstances, and         children in care', and that our research `supported the expansion         of the (DfE) policy to help address a wide set of social goals rather         than just the educational attainment aims which were the initial focus'       (IMP1).
Our work also provided the government `key pieces of         evidence to inform spending reviews and policy development' (IMP1).
The same DfE testimonial indicates that our research has had influence on       recent government policy, that it provided evidence to `inform the         recent publication of More Affordable Childcare (2013)' setting out       the Government's plans to increase the amount of affordable provision (IMP1).
In addition, the recent development by Save the Children Fund of three       `Children's Zones' pilots in England are based directly on our research.
Pathways to impact have varied.
From 2008-10 the DfE reported the       Newcastle research findings to practitioners and policy makers via its       website.
When in 2010 decision-making about extended services was devolved       to schools, the DfE commissioned from the Newcastle-Manchester team a       manual for head teachers based on all our previous research in this area.
Our distinctive partnership research design enabled schools and LAs to       reflect on and apply our research.
Our four day-conferences since June       2012 on extended services have been well attended (each 40+) and valued       (evaluation form comments): `the opportunity to do things differently';       and `raise awareness within the services of the importance of         children's zones aims and encouraging multi-agency work'.
Todd and       Dyson have accepted invitations to present to large practitioner and       policy-maker audiences (from 50 to 500 people).
For Todd this has included       countries in Europe (UK, Spain, Sweden and Netherlands), Asia (Vietnam)       and Australasia (New Zealand and Fiji).
Our impact on schools, LAs, and partner organisations is demonstrated by       repeated references to our research in policy documents (i.e., Northern       Ireland Assembly (IMP2), Hotspur Primary School in Newcastle         (IMP3), Solihul LA, W. Sussex LA, ContinYou) and that we were       engaged to conduct local evaluations of extended services provisions for       seven English LAs, from Northumberland to Wiltshire, and to edit, from       2007-11, a national practitioner publication on extended schools for       teachers, the `Extended Schools Update' (circulation in 2010: 456       schools/LAs) (IMP4).
This publication informed and stimulated the       actions and policies of extended schools and local authorities and       contains many examples of the impact of Newcastle's research (IMP4).
A director of extended services in one LA noted our research had: `played         a significant part in helping the schools in the (...) area to: develop         policy and practice in `Extended Services'... [and to...] stimulate         and inform our direction of travel'.
We are quoted as being       responsible for their nomination as a Children Zones pilot.
The       manager of Rural Youth Offending Service demonstrated how our research       evidence was used in 2013 to bid successfully for further funding.
Our       theory of change methodology has been taken up by schools, LAs and other       organisations to research organisational change.
The impact of this       approach is evidenced by comments from senior education managers in       Durham, North Tyneside, and Manchester (IMP5).
The specialist       educational psychologist in Durham said: `this model ... seemed to         offer a way of navigating through the (sometimes messy) complexities of         researching organisational development, and giving validity to observed         changes at a number of levels (student, staff, systems etc).
I was also         interested in the process of theory building'.
Impact on schools is       evidenced by a deputy head of a primary school in Manchester, who said: `We've         used your change document... it's helped us to ensure the impact of         things in a way that we hadn't thought of' (research interview       quote) (IMP5).
There has been a cultural shift as a result of our       research.
It has influenced government thinking, inhibiting the policy of       `raising aspirations'.
This was a key aim of many extended schools; but       the research found no evidence of its utility, instead showing that a       better focus was sustaining aspiration.
The finding has been communicated       through invitations to speak at well-attended practitioner, manager and       policy-maker conferences (2011-13) organised by the DfE, various English       councils and the Bevan Foundation (Wales).
JRF representatives took the       research to the UK Cabinet Office where it has influenced thinking about       pupil premiums, and Todd was invited to discuss the research with the       Minister for Education in Wales.
In February 2013, Michael Gove referenced       a statistic which was based in part on our review, in a speech to the       Social Market Foundation (IMP6).
Practices of professionals have       changed as workers in city councils (i.e.
Newcastle, North Tyneside,       Northumberland and Oxford) recognise the need to change their language.
For example, `Children North East' consulted us on the changed wording of       their mission statement to remove the words `raising aspirations' (IMP7):       `We now see our charitable purpose to create opportunities for children         and young people to realise their aspirations' (Chief Executive,       Children North East) (IMP7).
`Many Local Authorities in the NE         are currently reviewing their child poverty documents and we expect that         language surrounding aspirations (in many North East LAs) to be markedly         different as a result of the research findings' (Regional Child       Poverty Research and Action Plan Co-ordinator).
The research is cited as       evidence in the Education Endowment Fund toolkit against adopting       interventions that focus on raising aspirations.
Internationally our research has informed debate and policy-making.
The       Cabinet Leader of the borough of Amsterdam West, refers to decision-making       that increased the out of school hours opportunities for disadvantaged       young people, and asserts: `To me a policy maker from West Amsterdam,         (Todd's) research offers great opportunities for discussion between         policy makers from the local government and the school board         representatives, because of its `hands-on' character' (IMP8).
An NGO in Vietnam attributes its current success partly to our research,       according to its director: `We are now leading in renovation of the         mental health care system in Vietnam...pioneer in...courses on social         work...related to women and children...Contribution on this change,         certainly has come from your work and our collaboration' (IMP9).
Our research is extensively quoted by the Foundation for Young Australians       in their literature review for National Collaboration Project: Extended       Service School Model (IMP10).
Our outputs have influenced teachers       in other locations nationally (Glasgow and Belfast) and internationally       (Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand).
