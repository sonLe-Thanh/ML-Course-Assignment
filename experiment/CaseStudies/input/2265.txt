     In addition to having been cited widely in the UK's and Scottish       Government's policy documents, the core impacts from the desistance       research are that it has supported a challenge to conventional wisdom       around approaches to `offender management'; stimulated practitioner       debate; and has helped to effect a cultural change in the practices of       probation and prison services across several jurisdictions.
Shaping new practice skills models for probation professionals       The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) &#8212; an Executive Agency of       the Ministry of Justice which coordinates probation and prison services       across England and Wales &#8212; used desistance research as part of the       evidence base for a new practice skills model for probation professionals.
The Deputy Director of Commissioning and Competitions at NOMS explained       that NOMS drew in particular upon McNeill and Weaver's 2010 Changing         Lives?
Report, which they had commissioned, with the principles       outlined in the report `feeding directly' into the design of Skills         for Effective Engagement and Development (SEED) [1].
SEED combines `core correctional practices and evidence-based         approaches with emerging thinking and evidence from the desistance         research' [1].
The model involves ongoing training for probation       professionals, including: professional development covering       relationship-building; pro-social modelling; motivational interviewing;       the risk need and responsivity principles, and cognitive behavioural       techniques.
Participants also received training on desistance research       specifically.
Early evaluations show the positive impact of the pilot,       with 87% of participants stating that the model is very important to their       practice [2].
Influencing Training, Practice and Service Delivery in Probation           Services 		  The research has influenced policy and strategic       planning in several Probation Services and Trusts, particularly in       Merseyside, and Avon and Somerset.
Merseyside Probation Trust: Senior management at the Wirral, a       local delivery unit (LDU) within Merseyside Probation Trust, sought and       funded their participation in the DesKE project (outlined above, S.2) in       late 2012 (this was in addition to the work funded by the ESRC).
These       additional DesKE workshops brought probation workers and service-users       together, for the first time, to discuss issues around probation and       reoffending.
`The Road From Crime' film prompted discussion and       debate, particularly around the use of the term `offender', which has       since been replaced by `service user' [3].
Wirral LDU staff have made a clear commitment to adopting desistance       principles in their working practices and to involving the `service user'       in the process [3].
A Desistance Planning Team comprising of Wirral staff       and service users has implemented a number of innovative measures,       including welfare reform workshops which acknowledge and address obstacles       to change, and a film club aimed at debating moral and ethical issues.
In       addition, probation staff attended a series of workshops where they agreed       to make three changes based on desistance principles, which run counter to       conventional ways of working [3].
The Wirral LDU has expressed its desire       to extend the desistance principles to both its staff induction and risk       assessment procedures.
The research can therefore be seen to have helped       redirect the training, working practice and service delivery of probation       professionals in important and innovative ways.
Avon and Somerset Probation Trust (ASPT): Similarly, Avon and       Somerset Probation Trust (ASPT) has benefited from the desistance research       and from links with the DesKE project.
The Trust is committed to better       supporting desistance in its practice, an agenda that has been supported       by the recruitment of a dedicated Desistance Development Officer.
Motivated by the eight key principles outlined in McNeill and Weaver's Giving         up Crime: Directions for Policy (2007) report, ASPT developed a new       operational framework and discussed the implementation of       desistance-supporting-practices at an `away day' for ASPT and its       multi-agency partners.
According to the Chief Probation Officer of ASPT,       the clarity of the principles outlined in the report provided staff with       greater focus and direction [4].
To further promote the desistance agenda, ASPT arranged a screening of The         Road from Crime at the Curzon cinema, North Somerset, in November       2012 [5] and invited McNeill to deliver a presentation on the creative       implementation of desistance at their 2013 Annual Conference.
Feedback       from the events showed that the film had improved understandings of the       importance of working within desistance principles.
[4].
The Voluntary and Community Sector: One of the barriers identified       by people working in the criminal justice sector to desistance is a lack       of clear and practical steps to support implementation in daily practice.
To that end, Clinks, a charity that supports VCS organisations working       with offenders, devised a practical guide for practitioners.
This guide       draws heavily on McNeill's research [6] and the DesKE project is also       listed as a key resource on Clinks' website [7].
Instrumental Impact on Policy and Practice in Scotland and Northern           Ireland       Scottish Government:       Speaking at the launch of The Road from Crime at the University in       June 2012, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice (Kenny MacAskill MSP)       commented that DesKE had improved Scottish Government Officials'       understanding of the reality of desistance from crime, and influenced       their thinking about how public policy can better remove obstacles to       desistance [8].
Additionally, it provided an evidence-base to support the       Justice Directorate's development of the Scottish Government Reducing         Reoffending Programme, with McNeill being invited to join the       Programme Board to contribute his expertise [8].
The Scottish Government has subsequently invested &#163;10m in a change fund       to provide more people leaving prison with mentors, and funded `Positive       Prisons?
Positive Futures...', which represents the views of people with       convictions in policy-making and service development.
Both initiatives       reflect the DesKE ethos around engagement, dialogue and co-production of       knowledge.
In addition, McNeill was recently appointed to the Review Board for the       Scottish Prison Service (SPS), which is currently redesigning its       operating philosophy and approach around desistance principles.
SPS, which       employs approximately 4200 staff who work with the 8000 people detained in       custody in Scotland, recently commissioned SCCJR to review and develop       models of staff training (at all career stages and for all grades) to       support desistance.
Northern Ireland (NI) Prison Service:       The Justice Minister for Northern Ireland commissioned a comprehensive       review of Northern Ireland's Prison Service in 2010, resulting in the       Northern Ireland Prison Review Team's Final Report in October       2011.
McNeill was invited to serve as the sole academic member of the       high-level Review Team in order to contribute his knowledge of desistance,       reintegration and penal reform.
The Final Report outlines the vision for       the `New Prison System' which is to be organised around 3 key objectives,       including: `Desistance: a wider picture' [9].
Following the start       of the Strategic Efficiency and Effectiveness Programme,       established by the NIPS to implement the Review Team's recommendations,       the Justice Minister outlined plans in March 2013 for a &#163;202m investment       into reforming the NIPS; a significant feature of his announcement on the       funding was the need to fund reforms that support desistance by `changing         attitudes towards offender management through positive engagement and         interaction' (see: NIPS Press Release: Link).
Internationally, the research has exercised similar influences on       penal policy and practice.
McNeill has been invited to lead DesKE       workshops in mainland Europe, Australia and the USA.
For example, after a       workshop in Adelaide, probation practitioners in Mobilong Prison rethought       the ways that they communicate with people with convictions during       one-to-one and group intervention conversations.
The Manager of Offender       Development for the prison noted that, in stressing the importance of       creating an identity alternative to that of `criminal', McNeill's research       greatly assisted workers in framing their conversations with prisoners in       new ways [10].
