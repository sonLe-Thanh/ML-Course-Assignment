     The rapid spread of avian and human H5N1 infection throughout Asia in       2004 occurred less than 12 months after the global SARS outbreak, which       almost reached pandemic proportions (8,273 cases worldwide, 9.6% fatality)       in 2003.
Not surprisingly the unknown and significantly more deadly human       H5N1 virus, with a fatality rate of 60%, became a high priority concern to       the WHO.
Fortunately, unlike SARS, first responders soon realised that       human cases of H5N1 were mostly contracted through direct contact with       birds, reducing the frightening possibility of human-to-human infection.
As a result, containment of H5N1 in humans has been relatively successful.
The WHO recently reported a total of 608 confirmed human cases of H5N1 and       359 deaths between 2003 and 2012.
As Vietnam faced the third largest number of all cases worldwide (after       Egypt and Indonesia) the University of Oxford's OUCRU researchers in       Vietnam were at the frontline of the global investigation into H5N1.
As a       result, Oxford's research into the epidemiological and pathological       features of human H5N1 infection provided the WHO with key evidence for       rapid clinical guidelines for the management and investigation of H5N1       infection globally during the period from 2006-2013.     WHO rapid advice guidelines on pharmacological management of humans           infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus7     In early 2006, as mortality rates rose and infection spread throughout       the world, the WHO assembled an international panel of experts and       clinicians, including Professor Jeremy Farrar (Director of OUCRU Vietnam),       to assist in developing rapid advice for the pharmacological management of       patients with human H5N1 infection.
The early research from OUCRU1 provided the panel with key       data on the clinical features of H5N1 infection in humans, as well as       preliminary epidemiologic findings.
Research from OUCRU Vietnam directly       led to the WHO's strong recommendations for the use of Oseltamivir       antiviral drugs in patients with, "confirmed or strongly suspected H5N1       infection"2,3.
The 2006 guidelines also included a clinical algorithm adapted from an       algorithm used at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, in Ho Chi Minh City,       by OUCRU's Dr Tran Tinh Hien7.
The WHO guidelines for the       management of H5N1 have remained in place since 2006 and have been the       major instrument for the treatment of cases in the period 2006-2013.     WHO guidelines for investigation of human cases of avian influenza           A(H5N1)8     The WHO's 2007 guidelines provide a framework for public health       authorities and researchers to investigate H5N1 infection in humans.
Based       on research from OUCRU the guidelines recommend that clinicians       investigating patients with possible H5N1 infection should obtain       background information on the patients family and household, including all       people who have come into contact with the patient within two weeks of the       onset of symptoms.
This information directly cites research from OUCRU,       which shows that H5N1 virus is mostly detected in respiratory specimens       within two weeks of symptomatic illness2-4.
Studies from OUCRU       also underpin recommendations for the collection of specimens (for       laboratory testing) in patients with fever or respiratory symptoms,       followed by appropriate medical management, including antiviral therapy       (Oseltamivir)8.
The WHO guidelines for the investigation of       H5N1 have been used continuously for the investigation of sporadic cases       since 2007 without modification.
WHO guidelines for pharmacological management of pandemic influenza           A(H1N1) 2009 and other influenza viruses.
Part II - review of evidence9     OUCR's research on H5N1 has additionally had important impact on the       management of other forms of influenza since 2008.
H1N1 influenza or       "Swine Flu" was first identified in April 2009, claiming the lives of over       294,500 people globally in just 12 months.
After declaring H1N1 a pandemic       in June 2009, the WHO published recommendations for the Pharmacological       Management of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in August 2009.
In the       absence of any systematic reviews for the treatment of H1N1, the WHO used       OUCRU Vietnam's 2009 study of H5N1 to provide key evidence regarding       safety concerns for corticosteroid treatment in influenza A viruses6.
As a result of this research routine use of corticosteroids is no longer       recommended in patients suffering from influenza A viruses9.
Reduction in mortality     Cases of H5N1 infection have slowly been decreasing since the height of       the outbreak in 2006, when a reported 115 cases resulted in 79 deaths       worldwide10.
In 2012 these numbers had reduced significantly,       down to just 30 cases and 19 related deaths worldwide.
Although the       reduction in mortality is in line with the reduction of cases, a small       decrease can be seen in mortality rates from 68.6% in 2006 to 63.3% in       2012.
In Vietnam these rates have fallen even further from 69% mortality       in 2006 to 50% in 201210.
While there are many factors involved       in the reduction in human cases of H5N1, improved clinical management       (particularly in Vietnam) has been a key determinant of increased       survival.
