     a) Access to justice     Peysner and Seneviratne's work has been influential nationally and       internationally.
Peysner was consulted as one of a small group of distinguished academic       lawyers as part of the Review of Civil Litigation Costs (Ministry       of Justice, 2009) by The Right Hon Lord Justice Jackson (5.4 below).
Peysner's article "Predictability and Budgeting", (2004) 23 Civil Justice       Quarterly 15 was cited in evidence.
Prior to this review he also worked       with The Law Society's Civil Justice Committee in formulating ideas for       the project management of litigation.
The Peysner/Seneviratne report was cited (5.1 below) in the Report of         the Scottish Civil Courts Review (2009), at p 105, as evidence that       case management conferences were one of the main successes of the civil       justice reforms in England and Wales but also that the system of       allocating cases to judges could be improved.
The findings of the report       were also cited in relation to telephone conferences, pre action       protocols, settlement offers, the disclosure regime and wasted costs       (references in 5.1 below).
The Peysner/Seneviratne report has been widely influential in reviews of       civil justice systems in Australia.
For example, the report's findings       were a key influence underpinning the view in Attorney General of New       South Wales, ADR Blueprint Discussion Paper (2009, 5.2 below) that       similar reforms, if introduced, should not be prescriptive about the       action that a lawyer must take, since this could lead to higher consumer       costs in some cases.
It was also noted in this report, based on Peysner       and Seneviratne, that it was unclear that court annexed mediation produced       significant costs savings.
Peysner and Seneviratne's findings that the       overriding objective gave too much discretion to the courts, resulting in       a lack of guidance and inconsistent interpretation of the rules, and that       the certainty of the previous system resulted in costs savings, were noted       by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 2010 consultation paper on       Discovery in Federal Courts (ALRC CP 2) (5.3 below).
b) Complaints handling in the insolvency profession     In the present economic climate public confidence in the operation of the       insolvency system is high on the agenda as evidenced by the 2008-9 report       on Insolvency Practitioners by the House of Commons Business and       Enterprise Committee, which cited the work of Seneviratne and Walters.
The timeliness of the research therefore magnified its reception and       impact.
The immediate beneficiary of the research was its sponsor, the         Insolvency Practices Council ("IPC"), a public interest body established         by the government in 2000 to advise the insolvency profession and its         regulators on professional and ethical standards and on matters relating         to the regulation of, and complaints about, insolvency practitioners.
The research provided the IPC with an evidence base for its         recommendations for reform of complaints handling in its Annual Reports,         including in 2008 (5.6 below).
The IPC closed in December 2011 but the         issue of complaints handling by insolvency practitioners remains under         review (5.9 below).
The IPC's Annual Reports and recommendations were considered by the         Joint Insolvency Committee, the body that co-ordinates regulation across         the eight organisations that are authorised to license and regulate         insolvency practitioners in the UK.
The research therefore fed directly         into the formal structures that are in place for the co-ordination of         regulatory practice.
The references to the research in the IPC Annual Reports are         indicators of its influence in informing policy/policy review in respect         of complaints handling, potentially influencing insolvency practitioner         regulators and affecting the entire community of c.1700 licensed         insolvency practitioners.
The Seneviratne/Walters research was also cited in a report of the         House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee in 2009 (5.5 below)         and directly informed the Committee's recommendation that the Department         of Business, Innovation and Skills should undertake a cost/benefit         analysis of the case for establishing an insolvency ombudsman.
The research informed the IPC's call for the Financial Ombudsman         Service's jurisdiction to be extended to cover complaints by personal         debtors about bad advice received from any insolvency practitioner         regardless of whether the practitioner is operating under a standard or         group consumer credit licence.
The recent application by the Insolvency         Practitioners Association for a group consumer credit licence suggests         that this recommendation, which derives directly from the research, has         gained traction, in spite of its rejection by the Office of Fair Trading         (5.8 below).
The research has also informed a review of complaints handling and         disciplinary practices in the Australian insolvency profession (5.10         below).
The research was relied upon by the Irish Law Commission upon as an         authoritative account of UK insolvency practice and complaints handling         (5.7 below).
