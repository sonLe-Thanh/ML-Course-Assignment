     Context: Researchers and policy makers have traditionally viewed       direct transfers in cash as a       tool that worked best in addressing short term poverty, smoothing out the       impact of hazards on       household consumption (e.g.
World Bank's Social Risk Management Strategy).
This research       demonstrates that transfer programmes reaching people in extreme and       chronic poverty can also       be effective, through raising their consumption and strengthening their       productive capacity.
Pathways to Impact: The research has engaged governments, the       development community and       academia at a national and international level.
In addition to       publications in leading journals,       outputs have been disseminated through international conferences, the       production of accessible       resources for practitioners and the general public, and through direct       advisory work.

Subsequent to the international conference `Social Protection       for Chronic Poverty Risk, Needs       and Rights &#8212; Protecting What?
How?'
(2005), UoM (and partners) organised       two major         conferences where research was disseminated, and research users       (policy makers and       practitioners) were engaged: `Social Protection for the Poorest in Africa:       Learning from       Experience' (Kampala, Uganda, 2008); and `Ten Years of War Against       Poverty: What we have       learned since 2000 and what we should do 2010-2020?'
(Manchester, 2010).

The research has produced two key sources on antipoverty         transfers facilitating outreach to       non-academic audiences.
Firstly, the research was published in an       accessible format within the       book Just Give Money to the Poor: the Development Revolution from the         Global South which       has figured prominently in international and national policy dialogue on       antipoverty transfers,       and featured in the Guardian's shortlist of key development studies texts       for first-year students       [1].
Secondly, the `Social Assistance in Developing Countries Database'       has become a widely       used and cited evidence source on antipoverty transfer programmes for both       researchers and       practitioners, and builds on the work of the CPRC in encouraging more       countries and agencies       to disaggregate data in their poverty analyses, further recognising the       chronically poor and       persistently vulnerable [2].

The research has been influential through advisory work on         antipoverty transfers.
The       researchers have contributed directly to national government policy &#8212; for       instance leading a       feasibility study for the Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment       Programme (SAGE) pilot       phase in Uganda &#8212; and have provided advice to the Governments of Pakistan,       Kyrgyzstan,       Chile, Mozambique, Zambia, Bangladesh and Uganda, amongst others.
Advice       is also       regularly given to multilateral and bilateral agencies (e.g.
DFID, World       Bank, UNICEF, ILO,       FAO, ISSA, WHO, UNDESA, EU, and the Caribbean Development Bank) with UoM       researchers providing capacity building to officials from UNICEF, DFID,       ILO, FAO, WFP, and       GTZ.
Key Impacts: The impact of this research has been twofold.
Firstly, in raising awareness and       understanding of the essential role of direct antipoverty transfers in       reducing global poverty among       policy makers and the general public.
Secondly, via the development of a       knowledge base to       demonstrate that direct antipoverty transfers are financially and       politically sustainable in low to       middle income countries.
The research has shaped policy debates in         three arenas:     [I] Shaping UK policy thinking and practice on antipoverty transfers:       In June 2010, the book       Just Give Money to the Poor &#8212; conceived by the authors as a tome       `that a Minister could read on a       4 hour flight' &#8212; was instrumental in persuading the incoming government to       commit to expanding       their support for antipoverty transfer programmes in sub-Saharan Africa       and south Asia.
At the       request of DFID's Director of Policy, advanced copies were circulated       within DFID.
This followed a       Guardian article by Aditya Chakrabortty on the role of antipoverty       transfers based on UoM       research "...the world of aid turned upside down" [3] and a       follow-up letter to the Guardian from the       Secretary of State for International Development (Andrew Mitchell MP), who       affirmed that the new       government "will explore using cash transfers more often" in UK       efforts to eliminate poverty, further       outlining that: "The new government is determined to give people in         developing countries more         power over their own lives.
I've seen for myself in Ethiopia just how         effective this approach can be.
Thanks to rigorous evaluations, we know that giving very small sums of         money can enable poor         people to invest in small businesses, increase their productivity and         send their children to school.
That's why my department will explore using cash transfers more often,         where appropriate.
Methods like this will go alongside our work to build capable and         effective states" [3].
Subsequently, the key message of the book, on the role of direct       antipoverty transfers in       addressing extreme and chronic poverty, received extended media coverage.
It was the `Idea of       the Day' in the New York Times, and was covered by the Boston Globe and       the Economist,       amongst other publications [1].
The research was also picked up by a       number of radio outlets,       including an interview with Barrientos on the BBC World Service radio       programme Newshour, in a       slot entitled `Affording Old Age' (a special edition for `Pensions Day').
[II] Shaping international policy and practice on antipoverty         transfers: The research has been       influential in informing policy and policy priorities among several UN       Agencies, bilateral and       INGOs, including: on the politics of social protection; on the need to       promote more sustainable and       institutionalised forms of assistance in developing countries; and on       social assistance for the       elderly.
Impact has been threefold.
Firstly, through collaboration           and citation.
As the Director of       Strategic Development for HelpAge International confirms: "CPRC's work         helped to inform         HelpAge International, in our work on the adoption of cash transfer         programmes, specifically in our         case universal basic pensions, by developing country governments as a         means to address chronic         and extreme poverty".
This included the co-authorship of a HelpAge       briefing document `Pensions,       poverty and wellbeing' [4].
Other examples include Barrientos providing an       `overview synthesis' for       the 2010 ILO report `Extending Social Security to All';       collaboration with UNRISD for the flagship       report `Combating Poverty and Inequality' (2009-2010), providing a       thematic paper `Social       Protection and Poverty'; citation (alongside Hickey and Hulme) in the 2010       European Communities         Development Report `Social Protection for Inclusive Development';       and the provision of a short       piece for the 2010 IPC-IG (UNDP) publication `Can Social       Protection Help Promote Inclusive       Growth?'
[5].
Secondly, research has been employed through direct         consultation, including       Barrientos' background paper for the UN High Level Panel Report on the       post 2015 development       agenda [6].
Thirdly, the work has been discussed via contributions to high-level         conferences, such       as the UN Commission for Social Development's 50th Session [7].
[III] Shaping national government policy and practice on antipoverty         transfers: The       researchers have engaged with several national governments based on the       cited research.
In       Uganda the Minister of Finance, in his closing speech to the 2008       CPRC International Conference       `Social Protection for the Poorest in Africa: Learning from Experience',       announced the       implementation of a pilot antipoverty transfer programmes (SAGE program)       and acknowledged the       role of UoM research.
Consequently, a country-level `Social Protection       Working Group' was formed       to support this initiative, and facilitate public and political dialogue       on social protection.
As noted by       a former DFID Senior Officer (now UNICEF): "[the] conference held in         2008 played a key role in         exposing Government and civil society to international evidence of the         success and         implementation of cash transfer programmes.
This led to the adoption by         the Government of         Uganda of a cash transfer programme targeting 14 districts and a target         group of over 600,000         people with a focus on groups identified as chronically poor, from 2010         onwards" [8].
The largest       social assistance programme in the country was also revised in its second       phase to include a       stronger role for local government as a result of CPRC research, with the       phrase `chronically poor'       now seen a part of the political lexicon.
In Bangladesh the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has       enlisted BWPI to support       the Government of Bangladesh in reforming and reorganizing the existing       social protection system.
As the UNDP Resident Representative confirms: "The contribution of the         Manchester team has         been one of the most significant.
I would specifically         highlight: First... local and global research on         the role and effectiveness of social protection... has informed and         spurred Government interest,         and helped to foster a consensus among civil society actors for the need         for change.
Second...       direct technical inputs... Third, their co-development of the Action         Plan for Building a National         Social Protection Strategy (March 2012)... led the Government to convene         a cross-ministerial         committee to develop the national strategy, and has defined the         preparation efforts which are now         underway".
Additionally, CPRC research informed the design and       implementation of the DFID       funded `Chars Livelihoods Programme' for the chronically poor with       research findings on the       importance of intergenerational transmission (alongside local media       interest) leading the Minister       of Education to increase the size of the stipend by 40%.
Similarly, in the       new state of Southern         Sudan, a plan has been approved for a US$2 per month grant to all       children born on or after the       2006 Peace Accord date until their 16th birthday [9].
The work of Barrientos and colleagues has also impacted on the practices       of civil society groups in       the West, magnifying the scope for future impact.
For instance, engagement       with the Church of       Sweden helped informed the Swedish Government in its work on social       protection; as their policy       advisor attests: "the research... undertaken at BWPI led directly to         an improved understanding         among Church of Sweden...
In particular, BWPI collaborated with the         Church of Sweden in         producing a briefing paper on social protection and the post-2015         development agenda and in         briefing staff at the Swedish Minister of international development on         the evidence based around         social protection.
This contributed to raising the profile of cash         transfers and social protection... of         strategic importance since the Swedish minister was a member of the UN         High level panel on the         post MDG development agenda" [10].
