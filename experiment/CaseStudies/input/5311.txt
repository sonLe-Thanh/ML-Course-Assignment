     Between 2008 and 2013, 98 research projects were defined by industry,       completed by Imperial and disseminated to public transport operators       worldwide.
The global funders and users of the research have included over       70 public transport operators and authorities from 60 cities worldwide,       spanning all 6 developed continents.
These industry partners have then       applied research findings, leading to the significant impacts described       here.
The impacts have been in the form of significant financial savings (in       maintenance, capital expenditure), changes to operational practices       (leading to lower costs, higher revenues and improved service quality),       informing strategy (using key performance indicators), improving the way       operators measure their performance and providing evidence for metros to       influence government policy (such as pricing).
The high impact of the research during the REF period is based on a long       term strategy of innovative engagement with the urban public transport       sector, pursued consistently over the past 19 years, over successive       generations of researchers and industrial collaborators.
We have designed,       developed and now continuously manage a formal process that organizes       interactions with and dissemination to industry.
The key innovation was to       establish five industry clubs (consortia), each steered by transport       operators and authorities and facilitated by Imperial.
The Community of Metros (CoMET) and Nova Group of Metros (http://www.cometandnova.org)       consortia comprise 31 metros from major cities such as Paris and Beijing.
The International Bus Benchmarking Group (IBBG http://www.busbenchmarking.org)       joins 14 large bus operators and authorities including London Buses and       New York City Transit.
The American Bus Benchmarking Group (ABBG http://www.americanbusbenchmarking.org)       is a consortium of 17 mid-sized bus agencies in North America from cities       such as Rochester and Chicago.
The International Suburban Rail       Benchmarking Group (ISBeRG http://www.isberg-web.org/)       includes 15 operators such as the East Japan Railway Company (Tokyo) and       Sao Paulo CPTM.
On an annual basis, the transport operators present their own challenges       and problems to identify areas of research of direct relevance and       application which they then fund Imperial to undertake.
Six to seven       months after the research is commissioned, results are presented by       Imperial at annual consortia meetings where CEOs and COOs discuss       Imperial's research findings and how they can be implemented by their own       organisations.
Further research is often commissioned to enrich       understanding and bring the recommendations closer to implementation;       on-going work is, frequently facilitated by additional workshops, led by       Imperial and attended by experts from transport operators.
We have       established confidential website forums where industry experts can share       further information and ideas based on the research.
International       adaptation of research recommendations is aided by the translation of       reports into 6 different languages.
Wider dissemination to secondary       stakeholders of the research (including governments, NGOs and academia) is       achieved through industry conferences, meetings and academic publication.
Below, we give some selected corroborating quotes and examples offered by       the leaders of many of the world's most important public transport       operators.
Capital and maintenance savings from Imperial's research [5]:     "LU...benefitted significantly from the identification of peer metro         good practices and learning arising from the CoMET benchmarking work and         underpinning research led by the RTSC at Imperial College, London....
The most substantial and readily quantifiable impact was from the CoMET         Escalators Management Study .. in 2009.
Projected savings arising from         the study amount to circa &#163;100 million over 30 years and projected         savings are expected to exceed &#163;500 million over the whole-life of LU's         escalator fleet.
......The CoMET benchmarking studies and research, led         and delivered by Imperial, play a significant role in identifying         opportunities for improvement and changes in approach covering all         aspects of London Underground's policies and activities. "
&#8212;         London Underground, Director of Capital Programmes, David Waboso,         (2013)[A]     Performance evaluation using use of the Key Performance Indicators         developed by Imperial [3]     ".. the KPI system that has been developed with the RTSC has proven         its efficiency to compare different Metro operators and to understand         structural differences in operating costs, and therefore identify areas         of improvement...COMET KPIs have been used by RATP to assess its         competitiveness, and to set the productivity targets during our last         business plan.
Paris has indeed improved its staff productivity by 1.5%         per year ($22m per year) during the last 4 years."
&#8212; Paris RATP,         Executive Vice President, Philippe Martin (2013) [E]     "... the work that the RTSC does to normalize data is a great benefit         allowing us to "see" our KPls more clearly.
CMBC utilized IBBG KPls and         definitions to redesign our board report in 2010.
An example of this is         when CMBC adopted the IBBG method of measuring on-time performance.
Since 2010 CMBC has been reducing spare ratios and recovery time based,         in part, on information we have received from other IBBG members as well         as IBBG benchmark indicators.
Recovery reduction initiatives will return         savings to CMBC in the range of 50 million dollars from 2010 to 2014 and         reducing our spare ratio has allowed us to operate with 42 fewer buses         without affecting service saving CMBC over 32 million dollars in capital         costs.
- Coast Mountain Bus Company, Vancouver, Vice President,         Operations, Stan Sierpina (2013) [C]     Changes to operating practices from Imperial's research on comparative         practices [6]:     "Responses to the TTC's 2006 study through Nova heavily influenced         procurement of the new subway fleet.
Higher reliability standards from Bombardier: The Toronto Rocket           cars [are specified to be] 50% more reliable than previous generation           of subway cars as built by the same car builder.
Justified move from two car-pairs to through gangways saving           several million dollars and improving capacity by 10%.
Toronto Transit Commission, CEO, Andy Byford (New trains in service           2011)[D]           "Research on the determinants of metro reliability has been used by         the Hong Kong MTR to set annual train service reliability targets by         applying our estimates of increased delay incidents associated with         forecast patronage growth" - Hong Kong MTR, by email, 2012     "In the last decade Metro Sao Paulo took the decision of turning our         network full accessible to all customers, including the users with         reduced mobility.
This effort was achieve by using the lessons learned         from studies developed by CoMET and Nova - Metro Sao Paulo &#8212;         Mario Fioratti, Operations Director (2013)     Providing evidence for operators to influence government policy [4]:     "... the recent fare study which analysed the fare mechanism of         various metros ...has been providing valuable information in our         discussion with the Government on the revision of Fare Adjustment         Mechanism in April 2013.
This agreement on fare adjustment provides         assurance of stable fare income ..." &#8212; Hong Kong Mass Transit         Railway, Jacob Kam, Operations Director[B]     "lCL's benchmarking expertise has played a significant part in         supporting strategic policy assessment at senior managerial and         political levels.
The existence of the IBBG means that ICL is able to         act as an independent advisor on the comparative performance of London's         bus network."
&#8212; Clare Kavanagh, Performance Director, London         Buses     Impact of the industry consortia meetings facilitated by the RTSC:     "The CoMET meetings.. have been an excellent opportunity to meet on a         face to face basis the other metros&#180; participants, to exchange ideas...         the CEO/COO&#180;s day during the Annual meeting is a unique opportunity for         the high administration officers to meet each other, and to strength the         cooperation among their organisations."
&#8212; Metro Sao Paulo &#8212;         Mario Fioratti, Operations Director (2013)     RATP has indeed benefited from bilateral exchanges on specific         subjects, going further in sharing experiences and good practices....the         forum available on COMET website is helpful to deal with topical issues.
By facilitating the meetings, visits and bilateral exchanges, the RTSC         plays thus a major role in the quality and interest of the exchanges         that we have within the COMET Group.
