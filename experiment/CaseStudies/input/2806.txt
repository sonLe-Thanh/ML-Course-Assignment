     Socio-economic impact:     Drs Stewart and Peck helped to pioneer the concept of teams of       `para-biologists' (Section 3, R7): locally recruited staff who receive       special training to carry out technical tasks ranging from the collection       of field data following a standard protocol, to the preparation, digital       imaging and preliminary identification of specimens, databasing and the       initial analyses of results.
As an approach to the scientific study of       hyper-diverse ecological communities, this model is now being copied       widely around the world (see Section 5, C1).
It has not only proved to be       a most efficient way to conduct conservation research but has also, in       itself, resulted in significant social and economic benefits within the       local community that are tangible and far-reaching.
For example, as a       result of the parabiologist concept, Drs Stewart and Peck have established       the Binatang Research Center in Papua New Guinea &#8212; one of the       three top parabiologist teams in the world &#8212; and the Santa Lucia         Research Station in Ecuador, a community-owned reserve that hosts       the largest biodiversity database for plants and animals in North West       Ecuador (C2, C3).
These centres provide a sustainable income stream for       conservation programmes for the local community by:            Providing training in research and conservation within the local         community.
For example, the parabiologist training scheme (C3) and the         Darwin Initiative projects have enabled Dr Stewart to bring 14 PNG         nationals (12 parabiologists and 2 MSc graduates) to the UK for         intensive training at major institutions such as The Natural History         Museum in London and the Royal Botanic Gardens Herbarium at Kew.
On         return to PNG, most have taken up posts in biology-/conservation-related         employment, including several prestigious senior positions.
Similarly,         through Dr Peck's PRIMENET project, 80 community-level `parabiologists'         from indigenous and forest communities were trained between 2008 and         2012, giving them a voice through direct links with NGOs, scientists,         and local and national government (http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:Parabiology).
Participants in the PRIMENET project have also now established Neotropical           Primate Conservation (http://www.neoprimate.org/),         an NGO that addresses impacts on primates throughout South America.
Encouraging other researchers &#8212; either international scientists or         volunteer researchers coming as ecotourists - to come to the centres.
Visiting scientists pay land fees for forest use, employ local research         assistants, as well as and pay subsistence.
The Santa Lucia Research         Station provides a sustainable livelihood from the general public, who         engage via the Earthwatch Project.
They pay to participate in and         support on-going research and for their food and accommodation during         their stay.
Between 2008 and 2012, 350 volunteer scientists and 85         undergraduate students attended bespoke training courses contributing 25         per cent of the community-run reserve's annual income.
These activities         provide a sustainable income to the local communities (C4, C5, C6, C7         and C8).
Establishing conservation charities that manage outreach programmes         and attract additional income for conservation and infrastructure within         the local community, including from the private sector.
For example,         staff employed on Dr Peck's PRIMENET research project founded two         Ecuadorian conservation charities, Fundaci&#243;n Mam&#237;feros y Conservaci&#243;         (Mammal conservation foundation) and the Cambugan Foundation.
These organisations have translated the scientific information generated         by research into educational outreach, have informed policy at local and         national levels, and have underpinned practical, grassroots conservation         action.
In addition, Dr Stewart's projects in PNG have leveraged         additional finance for direct conservation action, including private         sources such as John Swire &amp; Sons (PNG) Ltd. and Steamships Trading         Co. Ltd. (who provided US$200,000 for infrastructure, direct         conservation and research).
This work has transformed the village social         structure in Wanang, including infrastructure support for a new school         (for 130 children in 5 classes from 7 local villages for whom there was         previously no school) and the development of a 50ha forest research plot         that is part of the global network of 42 such plots coordinated by the         Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science (http://www.ctfs.si.edu/site/Wanang).
Ecological/conservation impact:     By improving our knowledge and understanding of biological diversity in       the tropics, Drs Stewart and Peck have enabled non-governmental and       governmental organisations to plan conservation efforts more       strategically.
For example, the Darwin Initiative projects in PNG were       instrumental in initiating the process whereby the Binatang Research       Center assisted one remote village community to set up 10,000ha of its       lowland rainforest as a legal entity (the Wanang Conservation Area, WCA)       thereby protecting it from logging.
As a direct consequence of Dr       Stewart's work, a proposal has been submitted to the PNG Department of       Environment and Conservation for designating the WCA as a government       protected area (C9).
This village lies within vast lowland rainforests on       the floodplain of the Ramu River, where concessions have been granted to       log 110,000ha of forest.
Active logging started in 2006, has been       expanding ever since, and now completely surrounds the WCA.
Similarly, Dr       Peck's research describing risks to spider-monkey habitats was sent to the       Ecuadorian government as part of an environmental impacts assessment.
As a       result, in August 2008, an area of 18,000ha was declared the first       municipal protected area (C10, C11 and C12).
