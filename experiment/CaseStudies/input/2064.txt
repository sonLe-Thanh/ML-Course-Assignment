     Influencing the education and training provided to police officers       Parr's writing has been central to the research team's presentations at 9       major national UK police Knowledge Exchange events since 2010, including       the Society of Evidence Based Policing and the US Federal Bureau of       Investigation National Academy Associates, with attendance ranging from 10       to 200 police officers across the events.
The team have created new       Knowledge Exchange networks in the EU via a project event in Brussels, led       by Parr and administered by the SIPR secretary (May 2013; 30 attendees       from 5 countries), and 2 presentations in Washington, US (April 2013; 200       attendees) held as part of an International Police and Justice Evidence       Based Network with SIPR.
Parr designed, wrote and led the major launch of       the project findings and missing stories at the first       International Conference of Missing People, held in June 2013 (150       delegates), following which the UK Association of Chief Police Officers       Lead for Missing Persons observed (in a subsequent e-mail to Parr) that:     I believe the work being done to really understand what happens when         people go missing is crucial to improving the police response.
Listening         to a presentation on the findings so far made a huge impact on me and         gave me a greater insight into the psyche of those who go missing than         anything I had experienced in the past 30 years.
This work will provide         a sound foundation for the future development of police tactics and         indeed the way in which the public in general can better understand         those who go missing.
In July 2013, Parr contributed research-led core materials and data to a       scenario-based resource workshop delivered by team members Fyfe and       Woolnough to the UK National Search Centre training for 30 specialist       search officers in Bramshill and the UK Missing People Bureau.
The quotes       below represent the responses on signed evaluation sheets when various       ranked officers were asked how they would use the materials in       practice after training:     Police Tactical Support Group Officer: to assist officers in         initial phase of inquiry, and influence search areas.
PolSA (specialist Police Search Advisor): good for potentially         planning search areas.
Response Inspector: to explain why I wanted to search a         specific location and to support a search strategy.
Police Search Advisor: training initial responders for missing         persons, people who respond to incidents and speak to missing persons on         return.
Inspector: for an awareness of family needs and why I should         value their input.
Intelligence officer: to think more about the person and their         habits, rather than that they are 25, mental health issues etc.
Police Advisor (Foreign and Commonwealth Office): increased         knowledge to assist in finding missing people: a very helpful day.
Sergeant: as information to reinforce the value of regular         communication.
Sergeant: any indication of how a missing person works out a         leaving strategy is helpful.
Police support unit: this is a subject all officers should         have an in-depth knowledge of ... use the knowledge to think from a         missing person's perspective ... on all missing persons enquiries.
This event was followed by input to the Police Scotland's Sergeants       Leadership Programme training week in late-July/early-August 2013, which       generated similar evaluations, notably:     Police Scotland Officer: it was good to hear the mispers'         point of view and how and why they avoided detection.
In particular,         mispers have not committed a crime by being missing and I will ensure my         offers treat mispers respectfully and with sympathy.
Of the 120-page report &#8212; substantially written by Parr with Stevenson &#8212;       on the research results, the Manager of the UK National Police Bureau of       Missing People stated in June 2013:     Until now no research or study has been available to help explain why         adults go missing.
The record of experience in the following pages will         help develop policy, help build prevention strategies and supporting         provisions for missing people and their families.
As such, this report         has an immediate relevance and utility in evidence-based operational         practice.
Parr has now secured new University of Glasgow Knowledge Exchange Funding       to extend the long-term legacy of the project, via a contact brokered by       Fyfe of SIPR, but to be delivered by Parr and Stevenson, for the UK       National Police College e-learning programmes `Missing People Module'.
This module has reached 5,000 officers in the last 3 years.
Supporting the families of missing people       In June 2013, 10 stories of missing experience were made accessible via       the website of the Missing People Charity as a public awareness and       learning resource intended to prompt professional and public interest in       the experience of being missing.
Between launch on 17th June       and 30th July, 2013 there were 140 downloads of stories from missingpeople.org.uk       with social media alerts planned for the futures.
As a representative of       the Charity testified in June 2013:     These are stories that we have to hear, and we have to share.
We must         learn from them.
We must allow these stories to affect us, to ground us,         to help us empathise with adults who go missing as we seek to find and         support them.
And we owe this team [Parr's team] our thanks for bringing         us these stories.
All our current and new staff and volunteers will hear         these recordings and read the transcripts, and they will bring their         training to life ... And the families who we support will hear these         stories, and they will read the reports, and I hope that they will feel         less alone, and have greater understanding of what missing adults         experience.
And, most importantly, people who come to our charity, who         are missing, have been missing, or are thinking they might go missing,         will find the stories ...     Public awareness, education and recognition       The research has attracted significant press attention, both radio and       print media (11 radio broadcasts, 17 print media articles and 2 web-based       media platforms).
Between launch on 1st July, 2012 and 30th       July, 2013 the website designed by Parr has enjoyed 99,270 page views,       with 5,197 unique visitors from 72 countries (UK 51%; EU 11%; US 17%).
In       one month June-July 2013 the launched stories on this site were played 257       times, while the full research report was downloaded 1,170 times.
In March 2013, the Geographies of Missing People project was       awarded the 2013 Scottish Policing Award from the Scottish Government for       `Applied Policing Research'.
This competitive honour was awarded from a       shortlist of five selected nominees and was presented by the Scottish       Government Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill.
