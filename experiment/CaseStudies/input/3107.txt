     A. Informing Government Policy       SERC through the AD centre has worked closely with the Welsh Government to       encourage the       deployment of anaerobic process technology for waste treatment and energy       generation.
During       the late 1990s and early 2000s the Local Authorities in Wales, following       the general UK steer were       largely pressing ahead with the implementation of composting facilities,       which demanded       significant energy input.
Through the research of Esteves and Patterson,       and their continued       dialogue with the WG, led to a new approach to meet legislation and       financial conditions.
SERC       research provided input to government (see letter 4), local authorities       and companies in developing       AD plants as a viable option.
Building on the research output, a thorough       review of AD plants       across Europe was commissioned in 2007 (see report 3) with subsequent       evidence and support       provided in the last 5 years to AD stakeholders (see letter 5).
As a       result of SERC's research, the       Wales Centre of Excellence for Anaerobic Digestion was established in 2008       with a remit to assist       with the development of AD.
Since its launch the Centre has provided a       number of key outputs to       Government and local authorities:            A number of awareness raising events aimed at disseminating technical         and non technical         information relating to AD in order that decisions relating to the         procurement of AD plants         could be made.
Provision of direct advice and support to Government (see letter 4) in         order to allow the         development of a centrally led procurement process.
This has included         specific input         relating to digestate characteristics, treatment options and end of         waste criteria (Esteves,         see report 4) and the life cycle impacts related to the AD and biogas         processes (Patterson         and Esteves).
The Centre has also attended regular meetings with         Government groups         including the Planning Task Group which provided advice to local         authorities relating to         planning issues associated with developing AD plants and the AD         Digestate Marketing         Group which considered how best to manage the digestate produced from         the AD process.
The impact achieved is worldwide, as research findings and guidance are       disseminated through       the Wales Centre of Excellence's web portal available to stakeholders all       over the world.
The       website statistics show that every month around 300 to 500 users access       the information globally.
For example, consultants working on behalf of the Australian and Canadian       Governments have       benefitted from the research and guidance provided.
B.
Development of Industry Guidance, Best Practice and Regulation     SERC through the AD Centre has worked with a number of industrial and       regulatory groups to       develop the framework of guidance, best practice and regulations within       which the emerging AD       industry will work.
This has included:            Animal By Products Regulations       Environmental Permitting       PAS110 (see report 4)       Anaerobic Digestate Quality Protocol       Utilisation of Biogas from Non Conventional Sources          C. Driving innovation and the implementation for more efficient         anaerobic digestion and         biohydrogen production technologies, nationally and internationally     The Wales Centre of Excellence for Anaerobic Digestion / SERC has worked       with companies       across Wales and the UK in order to develop a robust AD infrastructure and       to develop new and       improved processes.
To date, this has included assisting 45 companies in       Wales (through ERDF       funding to the AD Centre).
The AD Centre has also provided technical       services to over 30       companies across the UK who are directly involved in the development of AD       opportunities.
In the       (&#163;6 million ERDF funded) CymruH2Wales project, 125 companies have been       assisted in the area       of hydrogen and biomethane technologies, resulting in 13 spin-off R&amp;D       collaborations worth more       than &#163;2 million additional industrial and government investment.
We are       one of the two research       partners supporting all the activities included above (A-C) through the       IEE Biomethane Regions       project (2011-2014) in 11 European countries; and our impact is extended       through this project to a       wider European audience.
Research activities are also developing a number of monitoring protocols       and methods that allow       future operators to run their plants more efficiently.
These include:            A methodology to measure the biogas potential of feedstocks that has         been developed and         implemented in our laboratories and provided to the companies listed         above funded by the         International Water Association (see report 5)       Non invasive Fourier Transform &#8212; Near Infra Red spectrometer based         method for         monitoring the performance of AD reactors       Microbiological assays for the monitoring of microbial populations in         anaerobic reactors -         applied in the field to monitor the performance of AD plants.
