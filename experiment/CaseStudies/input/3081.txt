     The research has influenced healthcare policy makers, changed practice       and raised awareness through conventional dissemination and the innovative       use of a play, Inside out of Mind, to communicate the       research findings directly to stakeholders.
The full report had been downloaded from the SDO website by         researchers and policymakers 369 times by 31 March 2012 (when       counting ceased).
Schneider also spoke about the findings within the       `Delivering better health services' session at the 2010 SDO network.
The       Royal College of Nursing hosted a webinar (web based seminar),       `Re-evaluating the role of the Health Care Assistant in dementia care' on       13 May 2010, which was attended by 40 nursing managers, workforce       planners, those involved in planning care for people with dementia and       their managers.
The study has influenced commissioners of research who       have used its findings as the basis of further NIHR HS&amp;DR calls for       research into the delivery of care, e.g.
(A).
In addition to reaching policy makers, it was felt important to disseminate         the research findings directly to HCAs themselves in order to reach       those to whom they are most relevant.
The research findings were therefore       also published in The British Journal of Health Care Assistants       (5) which is the only UK journal intended for healthcare assistants.
The journal has a circulation of 5,000 and an estimated readership of some       25,000.
Inside out of Mind was conceived of as a way of portraying       the key research findings vividly and in an accessible way to the widest       possible audience.
For example, the play's soliloquy of a nurse going off       duty after an exhausting night: "I take all these voices home with me ..."       powerfully presents the effects of the working environment on staff.
The       challenge of the emotional climate is shown in the responses of patients       to noise and bustle, often seen through the eyes of the ethnographer       character, playing the role of the original fieldworkers.
A scene       featuring a ward visit from a supercilious doctor, characterised as a       `tour de farce', humorously portrays to the audience many of the `us and       them' issues that are commonplace amongst unregistered staff including       HCAs.
The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) at the University of Nottingham       funded a Managed Innovation Network (MIN) (7) which brought together NHS       providers, research and arts leaders to explore production possibilities,       leading to a theatre workshop performance of excerpts from the script to       an invited audience in July 2011.
Financial support from the University's       Science, Technology and Society Research Priority Group and the School (8)       enabled the production of a 10-minute documentary (B) about the       development of the workshop performance.
This film has been presented         to 12 conference audiences totalling 800 people.
The MIN used the       positive feedback on the workshop performance to seek financial support       (9), together with a great deal of support in kind from the NHS and       University of Nottingham to develop a full production.
Funding was       secured from Comic Relief (10) for a video trailer (C) for the       full production.
Inside Out of Mind had its premiere         run at the University's public arts centre, Lakeside, in June, 2013,         with 15 public performances, 8 of them reserved for local HCAs released         by their employers.
These performances included a discussion         between the artistic team and the audience.
1,109 HCAs attended the play (D) and participated in discussions       and activities about dementia.
Ninety-three per cent of participants       judged the day as `good', `very good' or `excellent', while 92% of the         participants who work with people with dementia felt that the experience         would have a positive impact on their work (E).
The impact of the play in stimulating HCAs' analysis and reflection of       their work is evident in their comments:     I have been working in dementia for some time and today's play gave me         more insight into dementia, quite inspiring... fantastic.
(25/1/4)     Now have a better understanding of dementia.
Brilliant day.
(25/4/14)     It has been an amazing day.
I have learnt that people with dementia         have feelings and I have learnt to appreciate how they must feel.
(25/4/18)     Wonderful, knowledgeable play, excellent for giving an insight to         people unaware of dementia and what can be experienced.
Should be shown         nationwide.
(26/2/07)     Participants were invited to specify how they intended to apply their         new insight to improve dementia care within their workplace, and 481       took up this opportunity, for example, to set themselves a goal:     Take time to look into their background to get a better understanding         of that person.
(17/6/8)     To try to make less noise and to remember each patient as an         individual and treat them accordingly.
(18/1/7)     To be understanding more and step back to evaluate the situation more,         we got to do this watching the play.
(18/3/18)     The testimonies of HCAs can be found in a YouTube documentary, seen 799       times in the period 9 July-14 October 2013 (F).
The programme for the production was also designed with the needs of       family carers in mind so that it would provide information about where to       turn for help and advice.
A free on-line resource (G),       funded by a philanthropic donation to the University's Impact campaign       (11), was created to bring together information about dementia care.
The site         receives 100 new visits per week and has registered 500 users in the         first four months since it was launched in June 2013.
Many of the       nearly 1000 people who came to the public performances had some connection       with health or social care, and the blogs posted by Francois Matarasso,       former chair of the Arts Council East Midlands (H), and Eileen Shepherd of       the Nursing Times (I), illustrate the impression made by the play on         an informed audience.
This original approach to research dissemination and the scope of the       play in working across the arts, health and academia, was highlighted in       an edition of the PM programme (J) and was featured on BBC TV         East Midlands Today (K).
BBC Radio Nottingham interviewed       Professor Schneider and the director of the play, Tanya Myers twice: first       trailing the production, and then, during the run, they were joined by a       carer, Meryl, in a longer interview about the issue of dementia (L).
Plans are in hand for a national tour in 2014, in partnership       with the University of Nottingham, RCN Foundation Trust and NHS employers,       conditional on a Strategic Touring Fund grant from The Arts Council.
A digital         recording is also planned which, in addition to use in care homes       and domestic settings, can be broadcast to cinemas and therefore widen       audience access, especially in remote and rural areas.
