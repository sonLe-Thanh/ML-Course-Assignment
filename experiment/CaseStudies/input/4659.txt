     Regardless of the civil or military setting, the occurrence of a storage       incident is likely to have significant national and international impact.
The work of Scott, and others within the IAC, is part of the effort to       make uranium storage safer and better understood in terms of reactive       chemistry.
As demonstrated by the three examples, the IAC has broad reach,       connecting with national and international partners.
All efforts translate       detailed, focused scientific research into tangible outputs and advice for       the industry.
Our advice has been taken up by both the AWE and Sellafield       and this has led to changes to protocols, be it from changing the way       uranium (and daughter products) are stored (i.e.
the safest environmental       conditions or storage configurations) through to improved understanding of       the reactive chemistry of uranium in different possible storage       environments.
For CERN we have not only provided underpinning research but       we have also developed and implemented, from scratch, a processing route       for fission target wastes.
Beneficiaries of impact       The nuclear industry, including the AWE, CERN and Sellafield in particular       have performed extensive programmes of targeted research work to assess       the corrosion of uranium in conditions which reflect those which are       expected to present in the storage areas.
For the AWE, the data feeds       directly into the programme for the safe storage, maintenance and       management of the UK's nuclear deterrent.
For Sellafiled, the data feeds       directly into programmes of work for the retrieval and treatment of the       legacy wastes.
Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE)       The AWE plays a crucial role in the defence of the United Kingdom,       responsible for the manufacture and maintenance of warheads for Trident, a       submarine-launched ballistic missile.
Since 2004, the AWE has collaborated       closely with the IAC, Bristol in relation to research directed at better       understanding and predicting the corrosion of uranium and its alloys.
To       date, research has been primarily focused on determining the factors       influencing the initiation of hydrogen corrosion on uranium surfaces.
This       research has had a direct feed-through to the safe storage of uranium and       associated materials within the MoD estate, considered to account for a       significant proportion of the operational cost of Trident and the cost of       running Aldermaston (AWE expenditure between 2008 and 2011 was about       &#163;2.6bn)[d].
"Over the past 9 years, extensive experience and valuable data         relating to the corrosion of uranium metal has been accumulated by the         Bristol group.
This knowledge has furthered our understanding of some         uranium corrosion processes (particularly the reaction between uranium         and hydrogen) and helped to validate and quantify some important         predictive uranium corrosion models developed at AWE.
For example, the         fundamental relationship between oxide thickness and the severity of         hydride attack, which is an underlying mechanistic assumption within         several corrosion models applied at the AWE, was directly verified by         Bristol in a 2006 technical report.
The use of such models enables         corrosion predictions which are used unequivocally to reduce the need         for physical examination, intervention and measurements of stored         materials; all of which account for a heavy financial burden on the UK         Government.
"[a]     The potential magnitude of the problems being addressed by Bristol are       best coined by a further quote from the AWE: "The storage of uranium in         all but the driest of atmospheres can inevitably lead to the generation         of hydrogen gas and the later formation of uranium hydride.
This         presents serious safety hazards during the long term or even medium-term         storage of metallic waste (prior to eventual treatment/disposal) with         explosions and fires being a risk on the eventual exposure of the         payload to the atmosphere."[a].
Consequently although no specific details may be supplied, the AWE are       strongly voiced in their opinion that The "contribution to the AWE         [from Bristol], and by association the UK, has been significant and much         needed."
Sellafield Ltd (SL)       One of the primary missions of the Sellafield Site is the       characterisation, retrieval, treatment and safe interim above ground       storage of the legacy wastes which were produced from the earlier       operations of the UK nuclear industry.
These waste streams contain       substantial quantities of uranium metal (from spent nuclear fuel) along       with components of the fuel cladding such as Magnox and aluminium.
The       wastes have been stored under conditions which have lead to the formation       of corrosion products such that their characteristics are expected to be       significantly different from those of the materials originally consigned       to the plants for storage.
Unanswered questions pertaining to the state of       uranium in storage are key to the safe retrieval and treatment of the       legacy wastes [b].
Whilst the research relationship between Bristol and SL.
is relatively       new, the technical input provided to date, has had a positive influence on       several Sellafield programmes which predate the formation of the link,       providing late-stage but valuable supporting data and expert advice that       have reinforced and influenced decisions relating to waste retrieval and       treatment programmes' such as Magnox swarf storage silos (MSSS), the silos       direct encapsulation plant etc.
The Bristol research has allowed SL to "better         predict the current state and residual reactivity of uranium and         reactive metal bearing wastes across a number of the legacy plants on         the Sellafield site".
More specifically, SL (and by association the National Nuclear Laboratory       who are performing the package of experimental work for Sellafield) has       used the specialist uranium research facilities at the University of       Bristol to perform contract measurements (ongoing since April 2012) in       relation to determining the proportions of alpha- and beta-UH3       forming at different temperatures and formation rates [b].
We recommended to SL that spent uranium fuel should be stored in a       semi-dry and open containment system such that the potential for       significant hydrogen accumulation is prevented.
SL has contracted the UK       company Croft Ltd to manufacture a series of test storage casks, to       provide a full-scale demonstration of such a storage concept.
SL has so       far investing approx.
&#163;1M in this project.
The work on hydride formation has affected the SL safety case for       recovery of legacy wastes by reducing uncertainty in quantifying the risk       associated with the occurrence of thermal excursions.
We have helped to       confirm that there is not a significant safety issue posed by uranium       hydride in the recovery of legacy waste from SL storage silos.
SL is now       continuing with the MSSS (&#163;387M) and other legacy retrieval projects       including the solis direct encapsulation plant (&#163;1.28B) and pile fuel       cladding silo project (&#163;341M); projects worth a total of ~&#163;1.9 billion       [e].
Our work on encapsulation of uranium metal in cement (using       synchrotron X-rays) has proven that hydride can be a developing corrosion       product.
SL will use this information to inform its safety case for waste       encapsulation.
Correspondingly our research has had "a direct bearing         on UK national level programmes for the safe and cost effective         remediation of the Sellafield site" [b].
CERN (ISOLDE Facility).
The safe disposal of radioactive waste arising from experimental fission       studies at CERN is a key objective for the organisation; "As a         by-product of our experimental activities at the ISOLDE on-line isotope         mass separator facility, the site has a stockpile of spent uranium and         thorium carbide targets from which we have produced fission product         gases.
These wastes have historically been stored on site and have         gradually accumulated, awaiting the development of a suitable processing         route for conversion of the material into a waste form that is         acceptable to the Swiss authorities" [c].
In 2010, CERN instigated       IAC funding for a 2-year research project to develop a process for the       controlled chemical conversion of their uranium carbide fission targets       into an acceptable waste form.
Scott's research has solved this specific       problem; "It is considered that the work conducted by Dr Scott and his         team has allowed us to develop and implement (from scratch) a processing         route for our radioactive fission target wastes.
This has had a direct         and positive bearing on the operations at the ISOLDE facility and at         CERN in general" [c].
This method for processing ISOLDE fission       wastes has "constituted the building of a specialist         hot-cell facility for handling waste targets and a gas treatment system         for converting the targets.
This investment was in the order of 1.4         million Euros" [c].
Indirect beneficiaries of this programme       includes other EU research facilities such as the SPIRAL2 project at       GANIL, Caen, France and the SPES project at INFN, Italy.
According to       CERN: "Members of these facilities are already enquiring about the         work done by the University of Bristol in order to assume the         elimination pathway of their actinide material".
Other indirect beneficiaries include the UK public and the US public       through trans-Atlantic sharing of information between AWE and the       Department of Defence.
Impact, as a pull-through, is garnered through the       uptake of advice and change to protocols; be it from changing the way       uranium and uranium carbide are stored or processed through to improved       understanding of the reactive chemistry of uranium in different possible       storage environments.
