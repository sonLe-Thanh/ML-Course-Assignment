     The overall significance of Aston's research to water industry reforms is       demonstrated by Dr.       Saal's inclusion in Ofwat's Future Challenges advisory panel, which met in       2011-12 and brought       together water industry experts to help develop Ofwat's reform proposals.
(http://web.archive.org/web/20130411201350/http://ofwat.gov.uk/future/advisory/prs_web_10advi         sorybio#S)     More specifically, the research impacted the shaping of water industry       reforms culminating in the       Water Bill 2013-14.
It therefore benefited policy makers at Ofwat, DEFRA       and the Water Industry       Commission for Scotland (WICS), as well as regulated water and sewerage       companies.
Indirectly,       the research will also benefit future UK consumers of water and sewerage       services, who are the       ultimate intended beneficiaries of the water industry reforms.
Thus, the       research impacted the       Water Bill by: changing understanding and awareness of the costs       associated with vertically       separating water companies (Impact 1) and influencing the Bill's       provisions with regard to       mandatory company separation and the establishment of a retail market for       non-household water       customers (Impact 2).
The research also changed regulatory policy       makers' awareness of panel       cost and productivity assessment methods, thereby influencing       consideration of their future       application to regulatory cost assessment (Impact 3).
Impacts 1 and 2: Influencing the Water Bill 2013-14       In its early regulatory reform consultation documents, Ofwat almost       exclusively focused on the       benefits of vertical separation to facilitate competition, with little       consideration of the costs.
Thus,       Ofwat's May 2008 consultation (Ref 5.1) cited Ref 3.3 to extrapolate       benefits of competition, while       providing an incomplete discussion of the costs of vertical separation.
In       fact, Ofwat (Ref 5.1)       selectively cited evidence from Ref 3.4 favourable to vertically       separating sewage services, while       ignoring Ref 3.4's evidence on the costs of vertically separating water       services.
Similarly, while       Ref 3.3 &amp; 3.4 are cited, the 2009 Independent Review of       Competition and Innovation in Water       Markets (Ref 5.2), barely reviewed academic evidence on the costs of       separation.
Subsequently, Severn Trent Water funded a 2010-11 &#163;62,200 project (Ref       5.3, Saal Principal       Investigator) reviewing evidence on the costs of vertical separation, (Ref       3.6), and applying Ref       3.5's methodology to quantify the monetary costs of vertical separation.
As this evidence was       contrary to policy positions favouring vertical separation, its       dissemination at a February 2011 ABS       workshop (Ref 5.4) sponsored by the Environment Agency, Ofwat, and Water       UK and attended by       17 of the 23 UK water and sewerage companies, shifted the policy debate.
Letters from Severn       Trent Water and WICS (Refs 5.5 and 5.6), both support this significant       impact on understanding       and awareness, and the resulting contribution to the prohibition of       mandatory separation in the       Water Bill.
Further evidence showing that our research changed the debate is provided       by a United Utilities       report published in June 2011 (Ref 5.7) which relies heavily on References       3.1, and 3.4-3.6 and       the Severn Trent funded project's results for evidence.
In reference to       this report, United Utilities'       website states that: "We have helped drive debate through the         publication of `(Ref 5.7)' , which         looks at what structures best deliver secure, sustainable and affordable         water services.
Its core         recommendation that vertically integrated water companies are the best         means of delivering water         and wastewater services was adopted in the White Paper."
Ofwat's December 2011 review of the evidence base for retail competition       and separation (Ref 5.8)       further demonstrates Ofwat's changed awareness of the costs of separation.
Ofwat cites       Reference 3.3, but directly identified References 3.4, 3.6, and the Severn       Trent funded research,       applying the methodology of Reference 3.5, as "the most relevant studies       detailing the costs       arising from the loss of economies of scope".
Moreover, the United       Utilities report (Ref 5.7) is also       carefully discussed, thereby demonstrating the percolation of the       underpinning research's impact in       the debate.
As Ofwat particularly noted that the Severn Trent research       identified "significant       economies of scope for vertical integration of water (but not retail           with the rest of the value       chain" (Ofwat's bolding), this reference demonstrates a       further impact of the methodology       identified in Reference 3.5.
Thus, our evidence also impacted the Water       Bill's provisions focusing       on the establishment of a Great Britain wide retail market for       non-household water customers.
This further impact is supported by the above mentioned letters of support       (Refs 5.5 and 5.6)     Impact 3: Increasing Regulatory Policy Makers' Awareness of Panel         Assessment Methods       A May 2011 report (Ref 5.9) was specifically commissioned by Ofwat to       assess the regulatory       implications of academic panel cost approaches and the underpinning       research (Refs 3.1,3.3,3.4,       and 3.6) in particular.
Ofwat's website states that: "CEPA (Cambridge         Economic Policy         Associates), working with Dr David Saal of Aston University, looked at         the feasibility of using panel         and sub-company data" and "... conclude that using panel data would be         beneficial for setting price         limits at the next price review, and beyond."
Further impact from this report is illustrated by Ofwat's September 2012       response to DEFRA's call       for evidence on the reform of the water industry's special merger regime       (Ref 5.10).
Ofwat noted       that the ability to use panel data to overcome the loss of comparators in       its regulatory efficiency       assessments was not as strong as some indicated because: "The         introduction of accounting         separation has reduced our ability to use panel data in the short term         because companies have         been required to reallocate costs.
For this reason, although CEPA         recommended the use of panel         data when setting price limits at PR14 it noted that `greater care will         be needed as the panel will         only be for three or four years".
