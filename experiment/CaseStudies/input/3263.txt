     Reynolds wrote and presented a 90-minute historical documentary `1941 and       the Man of Steel',       about Stalin, Churchill and the war on the Eastern Front, 1941-2, which       was first shown on BBC4       on 13 June 2011 (5a).
The audience figure of 557,000 was       exceptional for BBC4, being one-third       of the number watching `Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die' at the same time       on BBC 2.
Reynolds'       film was repeated at prime time (9pm or 10pm) on four more occasions (22       Sept. and 13 Nov.       2011, 10 April 2012 and 9 Jan. 2013), in the last two cases still       attracting 447,000 viewers (1.9%       audience share) and 286,000 (2.4%).
On these five primetime showings       alone, the film reached       nearly two million viewers (5c).
There are no recorded figures for those who watched the film in       late-night viewings, on i-player or       via pirated downloaded versions on youtube, e.g.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRlOt-wqFHY       But that site alone had received 161,763 hits up to 23 Sept. 2013.
The film set out for a wider audience leading themes of Reynolds'       research, such as the       importance of Soviet resistance in 1941-2 for Britain's eventual victory       in WW2 and also the       excessive faith that Churchill placed in building a personal relationship       with Stalin.
The film earned a judges' nomination (25 Sept. 2012) for the Grierson       Prize, awarded for the best       historical documentary screened in 2011-12.
Nominations are for four       finalists in the competition       (5b).
Reynolds wrote spin-off articles published in the Daily Telegraph,       13 June 2011, p. 30, and BBC         History Magazine, June 2011, pp.
50-4 (5e, 5f).
As a result of this film's impact, Reynolds was commissioned by the BBC       to write and present a       follow-up film also based on his research about World War Two (`1942 and       Hitler's Soft-Underbelly')       which was first shown in October 2012.
The production company (Clearstory) sold the film to SBS (Special       Broadcasting System) &#8212;       Australia's leading public broadcasting network &#8212; who aired it in April       2013.
Clearstory       subsequently arranged deals in Poland (TVN 24), New Zealand (Foxtel),       Turkey, Hungary, Georgia       and Estonia (BBC Worldwide) (5d).
