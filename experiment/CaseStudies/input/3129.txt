     Sensory science is an essential aspect of the food industry, particularly       in terms of product development and maintaining quality once a product is       launched.
The success of a product, the developing company and their       contribution to the UK economy is dependent on the quality of the sensory       testing and sensory research carried out by industry.
It is not uncommon       for UK companies to recruit sensory specialists from abroad due to the       lack of trained home-based individuals, and this demand continues (Source         1).
The University of Nottingham developed a sensory training       programme, which now plays an important role in providing a broad, but       postgraduate level of training in sensory and consumer science.
The       training was initially developed using funding from a `BBSRC Modular       Training for Industry Programme' grant (Ref BIG/3/1/1, &#163;40K), in       collaboration with Campden BRI.
Campden BRI are still significant partners       in the programme and see the relationship with Nottingham as very       beneficial through access to research understanding and its dissemination       to their members.
This has been achieved through additional workshops, at       which Nottingham researchers have been invited to present (Source 1).
Registrants to the UoN industry training courses may take a full PG       Certificate in Sensory Science, or can access stand-alone modules for       continuing professional development.
There are 6 modules related to the       Sensory training courses; Sensory evaluation and Techniques; Sensory         Evaluation: Statistical methods and interpretation; Psychophysics,         Perception and Physiology; Consumer Studies and Market Research; Food         Flavour and a final industrial based project module for those taking       the full post graduate certificate.
Each of these modules comprise       lectures, practical activities or draw upon datasets that link directly to       research programmes carried out at Nottingham.
For example since 2008,       Nottingham's work on brain imaging has been an element of the Psychophysics       module and is a unique offering on sensory training courses in the UK.
Prof. Hort's research on multimodal perception forms a significant element       of the Psychophysics module and provides industry with an       understanding of the sensory impact of changing ingredients in product       formulation.
The new consumer methodology developed at UoN is incorporated       into the Consumer Studies and Market Research module.
The       investigations students carry out for the project module draw upon the       research expertise of their tutors, founded in UoN research programmes.
Recent delegates on the course have highlighted its importance in       underpinning their own research.
For instance JTInternational (Source         2) commented that the course has enabled them to `apply effective         state of the art sensory science in the Fast Moving Consumer Good Market'.
Similarly, a senior Mars Associate described `Through attendance I have         been able to directly transfer the theory and practical experiments to         our research at WALTHAM.
The regular contact with the University of         Nottingham and demonstration of academic excellence has given us the         confidence to fund research.
The outcome of the research has enabled us         to jointly publish and patent research which is a first for sensory         science at Mars.
Having been able to prove the value in Sensory Science,         my budget has grown from &#163;0 in 2009 to &#163;100K in 2013' (Source 3).
Although sensory science is taught on some food related degree courses       most individuals working in sensory departments, at all levels, enter the       profession via a different route and so do not have the important training       required.
UoN influence on industry is summarised by Tesco's International       Quality Manager (Source 4): 'The reputation of Nottingham         University in sensory science and its link with the industry and         involvement in research, encouraged Tesco to send five of its members of         staff on its PGCert in Sensory Science.
The valuable knowledge and         insight into the various sensory methodologies gained has led this to be         a compulsory course for Tesco sensory scientists, who help shape the         future of the Quality Team.
Furthermore, a key learning and benefit to         Tesco is the end project our staff undertake on the PGCert.
This project         has enabled our team to develop specialist panels such as profiling that         has added value to the business and also allowed our staff to experience         what it is like to create business proposals and identify solutions to         problems.
The course has allowed us to further strengthen         processes we have in place e.g.
panel performance and monitoring of         profiling panels.
It has also allowed us to keep up to speed with the         latest methodologies, statistical software and thinking.
We have also         gained a strong network of those in the industry whereby we are able to         bounce ideas and share common problems".
The flexibility of the programme means that those working at a technical       level can attend relevant modules as stand-alone courses (they run       intensively over 4 days to meet industry needs) or those at a management       and research and development level can attend all modules to gain a       postgraduate certificate.
This further improves upon their professional       development.
"Completing the Post Graduate Certificate in Sensory         Science part-time has been one of the best things that I have done for         my career.
All the modules have given me valuable information and         guidance which I use every day.
I particularly enjoyed the statistics,         descriptive profiling and consumer studies modules; these have given me         the information I need to advise clients on the best test for their         products and ensure that I get the best out of my panel.
Although it is         hard work the benefits are definitely worth the effort and the course         has the added advantage of allowing me to meet fellow sensory         colleagues.
I would recommend anyone who is starting out in the sensory         science field or those who want to gain more knowledge complete this         course" (Sensory Dimensions delegate 2010-2013) (Source 5).
Delegates have up to four years to complete the PGCert.
To date, 27       students have graduated, with 14 currently registered.
As shown in Figure         1, since the inception of the Sensory Science courses (2002)       Nottingham has provided training to over 200 industrial delegates.
The       influence of the courses has increased markedly since 2008 and numbers of       new registrations for the PGCert and Professional development courses       increased 20% between 2009 and 2013.
The Agrifood Training Partnership (AATP) is one of four higher-level       training partnerships that have been awarded 5 years of funding by BBSRC       to deliver skills and training to businesses in the agrifood sector.
UoN       is one of four leading internationally recognised university and research       institute partners (the others are, Cranfied University, Harper Adams and       Rothamsted Research) working with industry partners including Campden BRI       and Cambridge University Farm.
The AATP scheme (Source 6) has       attracted additional delegates to the Sensory Science training; about 2       per course and Nottingham have had 3 enquiries to begin Masters in       Research in Sensory science through this scheme.
In addition to the PGCert       attendance, UoN have had between 8 and 20 additional short course       delegates each year attending the modules as CPD training from similar and       additional companies, and some educational establishments (See Table 1).
Thus it is evident that the sensory training Nottingham provides and the       research that supports this is far reaching in terms of its effect in the       UK food industry.
Importantly, several of these individuals and companies       are based in Europe, e.g.
JT International, Mars, Diageo, RHM, and       consequently, the course is extending the impact of the research and       training across the globe (Source 2).
Joanne Hort's 2013       appointment as Chair of the European Sensory Science Society has also       added to the reach and consequent impact these courses attain.
