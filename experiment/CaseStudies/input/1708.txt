     O'Neill has spoken to dozens of audiences about the topic of trust:       mainly professional and managerial bodies, charities, civil service.
Significant audiences since 2008 have included:     - Royal Statistical Society, Beveridge Memorial Lecture 2009 [5.1]     - National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Hinton Lecture 2010,       Onora O'Neill `Can Trust be Rebuilt?'
[5.2]     - BBC Radio 4: `Analysis', January 30 2011 [5.3]; and `A Point of       View', 7 December 2012 [5.4]     - Philosophy Bites Podcast 'Onora O'Neill on Trust' (on 5 Jul 2013 there       had been 45,802 downloads) [5.5]     - British Humanist Association Bentham Lecture 2012, Onora O'Neill       `Perverting Trust' [5.6]     - TED talk, Onora O'Neill `What we don't understand about trust' June       2013 (on 3 October 2013 there had been over 200,000 views) [5.7]     However, the focus of this case study is the impact on policy debate       achieved via her contribution to the Leveson Inquiry into the culture,       practices and ethics of the British press following the recent phone       hacking scandal, chaired by Lord Justice Leveson in 2011-12.
O'Neill was       called as an expert witness to the Leveson Inquiry in July 2012.
Her       contribution [5.8] was acknowledged and endorsed at a number of       different points in the final report [5.9]:     (1) Volume I, &#167;2.19: the nature of the free press: the report endorsed       O'Neill's statement of the problem of the freedom of the press; the       question is what conception of freedom is required.
(2) Volume I, Part B &#167;4.15: The report endorsed O'Neill's `six principles       of openness' for journalism:     (a) openness about payments from others     (b) openness about payments to others     (c) openness about the interests (financial or otherwise) of owners,       editors, programme- makers and journalists     (d) openness about errors     (e) openness about (most) sources, with an adequately drawn test of the       public interest to allow sources to be kept secret, for specific reasons       and in particular situations     (f) openness about comments from members of the public.
(3) Volume II, Part F, Chapter 6, &#167;9.16: the report endorsed O'Neill's       claims that public has an interest in `assessibility' of the evidence base       for claims made in the press: `Overall, the identification of the source       or sources would go a long way to meeting what Professor Baroness O'Neill       has described as the public interest in "assessibility"; and that should       be the default position, only to be displaced if the public interest in       confidentiality requires it'.
(4) Volume II, Part F, Chapter 7 &#167;3.4: The report endorsed O'Neill's       views about the importance of the extent to which media content is       unchosen `particularly by children, those in institutional settings, and       those in public places' and her view that `regulation should have regard       to the realities of media penetration rather than assuming that it always       reflects consumer choices'.
(5) Volume IV, Part K, Chapter 4, &#167;8.21: O'Neill commented on how there       are limits to the effectiveness of codes, and the weaknesses of       `self-interested regulation'; the report stated that this was particularly       so `where "professions" lack powers or willingness to discipline their       errant members.
This, [O'Neill] says, sets limits to the effectiveness of       any ethical codes adopted by parts of the media and means that ethical       codes, while important, are not enough'.
