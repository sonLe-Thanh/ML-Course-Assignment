     Newcastle research on methanogenic oil biodegradation has had widespread       impacts, not only in academia but on the oil industry (e.g.
Statoil,       Woodside, Shell [E1-E4]), related companies (Permedia, [E5])       and oil industry regulators (Alberta Energy Regulator, [E8]).
The       research principles and concepts have "...fundamentally revised         understanding of the subsurface process of the biodegradation of         petroleum, which once and for all finished off old obsolete and wrong         process models" (Leader of Petroleum Systems Analysis in Exploration       Research, Statoil [E2]), and "delivered a step-change in our       understanding of biodegradation in hydrocarbon reservoirs" (Principal       Technical Expert for Production Geochemistry, Shell [E4]).
Importantly, take up of the research by industry has been rapid "In         more than twenty years of working in petroleum industry in Europe and         Canada I have never seen industry grasping, and so rapidly applying,         concepts developed by academia as it is case with findings from research         projects led by Drs.
Larter and Head" [E1].
The impacts of our research on in-reservoir biodegradation and heavy oil       have been numerous:            Improved production strategies for heavy oil reservoirs       New methods for fluid property (viscosity) determination       A biodegradation module for basin modelling software       A successful spin out company, Gushor Inc., providing services to the         heavy oil sector       Provision of concepts used by the regulatory authority for oil sands         development in Alberta       Impact on popular culture          1.
Improved production strategies for heavy oil reservoirs     The identification and explanation of biodegradation-induced oil viscosity       gradients in heavy oilfields has impacted substantially on production       technology.
"Vertical compositional gradients of biodegradation         susceptible compounds, another product of biodegradation identified by         the Newcastle/Calgary researchers, have also very rapidly been utilized         by industry for predicting behaviour (rate) of steam growth in thermal         recovery processes" [E1].
Evaluation of viscosity gradients       in heavy oil reservoirs now forms an important part of production process       design in the oil industry with several major oil companies (e.g.
Statoil,       Woodside, Shell) with a global footprint incorporating these insights into       their heavy oil businesses [E1-E4].
One project sponsor       specifically highlights how the science developed in the Bacchus project       has had a direct influence on the value of a specific field, "understanding         of the reasons for fluid property variability influenced the decision to         sell the field to another company and also added significant value         (probably in the $10's of millions) to the asset" [E3].
Well       placement to avoid highly viscous oil in poorly producing zones is       informed by knowledge of oil property gradients.
It allows detection of       barriers in reservoirs and allocation of the source of production in       complex compartmentalised reservoirs [E1- E3, and E8].
These are now important components of cold and thermal heavy oil recovery       in many parts of the world (e.g.
Canada, Oman, Cameroon, Mauritania; E1-E3,         E8).
Improved recovery efficiencies with existing heavy oil recovery       processes have resulted from avoiding difficult to recover hydrocarbons       and well placements that could not have worked, improving cost-benefit       ratios and project net present value (NPV) &#8212; "the improved picture of         the reservoir fluid state saved the drilling of at least one well at the         cost of ~ $US 50 Million" [E3] and "Considering the number         of projects and tens of billions of dollars of investment in oil sands,         the impact of their new findings can be estimated to be measured in         hundreds of million and perhaps even billions of dollars in the long         term" [E1].
Moreover principles developed from our research       are "routinely used as (i) a screening criterion for caprock integrity         for thermal recovery processes (i.e.
presence of gas indicates good         caprock under reservoir conditions) (ii) a tool for evaluating the         geometry and size of these zones and their volumetrics.
This is a         critical development risk (water and gas are `thieves' for injected         steam in reservoir and significantly impact the economics of thermal         operations" [E1] and "Numerous projects that have suffered         in the near past would have been a success stories if these principles         had been applied!"
[E1].

New methods for fluid property (viscosity) determination       Design of optimum production processes requires high quality data on oil       heterogeneity across a reservoir.
Understanding the detailed chemical       changes in oil composition during degradation has allowed the development       of geochemical methods for assessing oil viscosity, enabling reliable       viscosity logging from drill cuttings in heavy oilfields "The         temperature-viscosity relationships elucidated in the Bacchus project         helped us predict that traps flanking the anticlinal structures and         hence at slightly higher temperature could contain producible oil" [E3].
This technology is now routinely deployed around the world [E1-E3],       and is being used to reduce costs by providing a low cost alternative to       expensive well testing procedures that rely on obtaining cored reservoir       material that is costly and technically challenging.

A biodegradation module for basin modelling software       The fundamental principles developed from our research and specific models       developed have been incorporated into practical software tools developed       in-house by oil company sponsors [E2- E4], for example, "A         predictive framework resulted from the synthesis of data from laboratory         simulations and field studies, and this provides a basis for our         in-house development of improved basin modeling tools" [E4].
Permedia, a company that develops and markets basin modelling software [E5]       worked closely with Bacchus researchers to couple Permedia's high       resolution modelling software with the science base from our oil       biodegradation research.
The product is a 3D fluid property prediction       tool that integrates the dynamics of active oil charging with biological       degradation of oil in reservoirs across individual accumulations or for       whole basins.
This substantial technical challenge has been met and a tool       ("BaccPath") within Permedia's MPath software platform can effectively       predict oil density and viscosity for accumulations through time and       space.
An interrogation tool ("Gnawd") developed within our research       spin-out company, Gushor Inc. [E6], models individual reservoir       segments and estimates vertical compositional gradients related to       biodegradation [E6].
Permedia has recently been acquired by       Halliburton and BaccPath has been incorporated into Halliburton's       proprietary software [E5].

A successful spin out company providing services to the heavy oil         sector       In 2006, the research led to the formation of a successful spin out       company, Gushor Inc., [E6] which provides services to the heavy oil       industry.
Gushor develops reservoir characterisation technologies for       heavy oil reservoirs and specialises in applying understanding of       in-reservoir petroleum biodegradation and its impact on petroleum fluid       properties to design and monitor heavy oil production systems.
Gushor       quickly dominated the Canadian heavy oil fluid property characterisation       market and won both technical and commercial accolades including an       Alberta government ASTech award for commercial success in 2009 [E6].
One of the services Gushor provides, ProxViscTM, provides high       resolution oil viscosity data based on geochemical measurements conducted       on drill cuttings and a range of geochemical analysis services for the       heavy oil sector.
It also provides the biodegradation modelling software,       Gnawd, and bespoke viscosity reduction technology (BRUTUSTM).
In 2012-2013 Gushor Inc. employed 19 staff and had a turnover of C$3.4       million (&#163;2.08 million).
It has provided services to the heavy oil       operations of many major oil companies in China, the North Sea, Columbia,       Brazil, Oman, the Gulf of Mexico, California and Canada [E6].
This       not only underlines the success of Gushor Inc. itself, but provides       evidence of the global application of knowledge and technology that has       been developed as part of our research on biodegraded petroleum reservoirs       and heavy oil.
In June 2013, Gushor Inc. was sold to the world's leading       oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, for an undisclosed sum [E7].

Provision of concepts used by the regulatory authority for oil         sands development in Alberta       In addition to the industry impacts detailed above Newcastle research on       heavy oil has meant that we have advised regulators such as the Alberta       Energy Regulator (AER) on best practice in energy production from heavy       oil and bitumen reservoirs [E8].
The AER have used our research to       "teach Applications staff the basic principles of oil-sands geology and         technology" and specifically contribute to "understanding bitumen         viscosity variations, and determining recovery factors of bitumen and         heavy oil in oil sands reservoirs to give realistic estimates of         reserves numbers that go into the Province of Alberta budgets" [E8].
