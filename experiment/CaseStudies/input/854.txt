     The MABC is recognised as a universal standard in the assessment of motor       impairment in children, including DCD and other developmental disorders       such as dyslexia, attention deficit disorder, autistic spectrum disorder,       speech and language disorder and cerebral palsy.
It has also been       described as a "gold standard" for measuring and describing the severity       of children with motor impairment [A].
With the information       provided by the Test and the Checklist together, both an       individualised and group programme of intervention can be developed from       the Ecological Intervention manual, helping to determine       strategies to improve the lives of children showing movement difficulties.
Educational and Clinical usage &#8212; indicating ease of and widespread use         with potential for beneficial effect on children's lives     The MABC is seen as the first choice for clinicians such as       paediatricians, educational psychologists, physiotherapists and       occupational therapist from across the world, including the UK, Europe,       USA and Canada [A - H].
Head of Research at The Children's Trust,       a national charity working with children with acquired brain injury and       multiple disabilities, describes the MABC as "the assessment of choice         for therapists working with children with coordination difficulties"       and that it is "easy to use and children readily engage with it" [C].
The Director of the Dyscovery Centre, a centre of excellence in the UK for       children and adults with specific learning difficulties, further describes       the MABC as "integral in our education/clinical and research work".
Initially set up to co-ordinate services for children across the UK, the       Dyscovery Centre now sees children and adults from as far afield as       Ecuador, Hong Kong and the UAE, successfully treating thousands of       children and training over 10,000 health and educational professionals [D].
Research usage &#8212; indicating reliability and validity     Research articles regularly feature in prestigious journals examining and       noting the excellence of the reliability and validity of the MABC, with a       recent example in Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology,       which noted that, "The MABC-2 is a reliable and valid measure to assess         motor competence in children with DCD and the scores provide the         reference point for clinical decision making in the management of the         individual child."
[E]     The establishment of the MABC as an internationally reliable and valid       research tool therefore allows researchers and professionals in       laboratories and developmental centres across the world to agree on       perceptions of children's movement difficulties, contributing to accurate       evaluation of intervention and provides a reliable assessment tool to       document improvements in the motor performance of thousands of children.
Examples of its research use include:            A team in Germany conducted the largest survey of diagnosis,         assessment and intervention methods for children with DCD, and published         it as the Swiss-German guidelines in 2011.
Accepted by other         international bodies, including the European Academy for Childhood         Disability, it awarded MABC an `A', positioning it as the nearest         instrument available to a gold standard (A* is the highest standard; no         instrument has achieved this) [F]        In the USA, a major longitudinal study is being directed by Stanford         University, examining the early childhood trajectory of children born         prematurely with very low birth weights.
The study chose MABC as the         assessment tool to assess the motor development of these children [G]        In the UK, a longitudinal study involving 7000 premature children is         being carried out the University at Bristol, which chose to use the MABC         to assess the motor capabilities of the children at various stages of         their development [H]           Usage worldwide &#8212; indicating global impact &#8212; and requests for clinical         and research training     The field of motor disorders involves individuals who are both       educators/clinicians and researchers, with their work encompassing both       empirical work in schools and clinics and practical work with the       children.
Conferences on the topics also involve both research and       practical work.
Since 1993 there have been nine world conferences on DCD       in the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, USA and Switzerland, and the       MABC is used more than any other instrument for the for the selection of       children in the research and professional papers.
Moreover, in the last 15       years there have been four special editions of Journals totally devoted to       DCD: Research In Developmental Disabilities; International Journal of       Development, Disability and Education; Journal of Human Movement Studies       (2).
For the identification of children the majority of research papers       have used the MABC.
The co-authors have all conducted training workshops in the UK and       abroad, with specific named invitations to Sugden to conduct       workshops in UK, Ireland, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Canada, USA and South       America.
Sugden has also successfully supervised six PhD students       using the MABC, and has been external examiner for ten others.
Furthermore, Sugden has made over ten keynote addresses at       international meetings and conferences about the MABC since 1993, and as       further evidence of its global reach, the MABC has been translated into       German, Dutch and Swedish, with French, Portuguese, Italian and Japanese       currently being planned by the publisher.
