     Athreye's unique work highlighting the economic benefits from patenting       and the effects on R&amp;D spending has profound implications for       understanding firms' investment behaviours and for policies relating to       investment strategies.
The significance of the research not only relates       to the UK, through the direct involvement of the IPO and the effect on       their policies and practices, but also reaches to the international       community as evidenced by the uptake of the findings in the influential       World Intellectual Property Report (WIPO, 2011): The Changing Face of       Innovation.
The findings have informed policy debate on IP and have been       used by the IPO and the WIPO to formulate policy and define best practice.
Athreye's early research demonstrated that patenting and formal ownership       of IP greatly facilitates the international trading of technological       knowledge in the form of international licensing.
In 2005 The Economist       used Athreye' estimates of international licensing in a special issue       devoted to investigating The Market for Ideas.
Hitherto, much of       the evidence for technology markets had rested on anecdotes and special       cases, but Athreye generated the first estimates of the possible extent of       such markets by using International trade data.
Later in 2011 updated figures using Athreye's data and methodology shaped       WIPO corporate strategy, placing IP at the forefront of innovation policy.
The research outcomes were used in the WIPO annual report Changing         Face of Innovation to support the argument that the increasing       demand for intellectual property had made the model of distributed       innovation more prevalent - where firms buy R&amp;D services and licensing       from other firms, in addition to their own R&amp;D, to generate       value-adding innovations for themselves.
Such distributed innovation would       not exist without a market for technology marked by strong ownership       rights.
Athreye's data showed that over the period 1990-2009, royalty and       licensing receipts (and payments) in the world economy grew at a sustained       rate of 9.9% per annum.
These estimates of the growth of           international licensing were included in the above report as           well as in a press release issued by WIPO.
They were then cited by the           business media (e.g.
Washington Post).
Data generated by       Brunel supported the central message from the report that distributed       innovation is an advantage for both developed and developing countries.
In recent research (2010-2013) undertaken in collaboration with Prof.       Arora (Duke University) Athreye developed and estimated a frequently used       model of innovative behaviour where firms invest in R&amp;D due to the       anticipation of patenting some activity and receiving higher profits on       products that embody patents.
Their estimates suggested that on average, a       unit increase in perceived patent effectiveness results in incremental       profits of just over 32%, and would induce an increase of between 11 - 27%       in R&amp;D expenditures.
In November 2012, these estimates were           presented to corporate stakeholders of the IPO (firms that license           innovation and firms that own patents) and other policy making           institutions at a workshop organised by the IPO's Economic Research           and Evidence Team at the Big Innovation Centre.
They also formed the           basis for the patent incentives report (Returns to Patenting and the           Inducement for R&amp;D, 2012)     In 2012, Athreye designed the questionnaire for the Survey of Innovation       and Patent Use (SIPU) which aimed to collect information needed to       estimate patent propensity (of innovations) and technology in-licensing in       the UK, as well as shed light on the factors associated with greater       patent propensity and in-licensing.
This survey has provided the first       estimates of the market for technology licensing in the UK and the       distribution of licensing activity among different types of firms (Arora         and Athreye, 2013).
The IPO is making this a regular survey           that runs concurrently with the Community Innovation Survey.
The SIPU showed that whilst only 11% of firms surveyed take advantage of       patenting, when looking at those firms which innovate new to the market       products this number rises to 40%.
About 28% of firms used patenting to       protect their most significant innovation.
Further, the analysis showed       that the size of the organisation does not influence the likelihood of       patenting; rather it is the ability to create novel innovations and the       volume of R&amp;D which is the strongest factor in determining whether a       business is likely to patent.
This information has been requested           by the IPAN (Intellectual Property Awareness Network) for           dissemination to SMEs.
Another key finding of the SIPU survey was that firms are relying more       often on technology licensing to keep up with the market, especially when       innovation is limited by constraints on resources.
Between 2009 and 2012,       the expenditure on technology in-licensing was estimated to be around &#163;6.9       billion a year in the UK- almost 40% of the total business enterprise       spending on R&amp;D. These results along with the estimates for           other countries were presented to stakeholders and discussed at           conference organized by the IPO on September 9, 2013 in London.
The           conference was attended by 65 delegates, most of whom were businesses           involved in patenting activities and/or IP professionals.
Informed by Athreye's research, discussion centred on the policy measures       designed to increase the use of licensing to enable greater circulation of       technological knowledge in the UK economy.
Further, UK findings based on       Brunel research were bench marked against findings from surveys in the US,       Japan, Australia, France and Germany.
