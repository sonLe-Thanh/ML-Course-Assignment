     The research conducted by Prof Nick James has had a significant impact on       clinical practice and       patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.
Impact on patients     The demonstration by the BC2001 trial that combination chemotherapy and       radiotherapy can offer       the potential of disease cure whilst preserving conservation of bladder       function means that it can       now be offered as a definitive treatment option compared to the previous       standard of       chemotherapy followed by cystectomy.
Cystectomy is a major operation and       is associated with       considerable morbidity and mortality, and permanent loss of urinary       function.
Patients can now       make a choice in their treatment to choose a non-surgical option.
The new       options available for       patients with bladder cancer were detailed in an editorial in the New       England Journal of Medicine       2012 (1), which stated that `The development of organ-sparing           procedures in breast and           prostate cancer was promoted by vocal patient advocacy groups with the           use of the           Internet and social networking.
We anticipate that the publication of           this important study           will help patients with bladder cancer to find their voice'.
In addition, cystectomy is unsuitable for many elderly patients and as       such these patients were       previously considered suitable only for palliative radiotherapy which       offered no prospect of cure.
This was articulated in the NEJM editorial by Shipley (1), who commented       that `35% of patients           between the ages of 70 and 80 years received no potentially curative           therapy at all, a           proportion that increased to 55% among patients 80 years of age or           older'.
As the number of       elderly people increases, the importance of this less invasive and       potentially curative therapy       becomes even more significant.
Impact on practice     There is already clinical evidence that the BC2001 trial has changed       clinical practice in the UK.
The number of cystectomies for bladder cancer had shown a relentless       increase over the last few       years and peaked at 150 per month in October 2012.
Since that time the       rate has fallen by 23% to       115 in May 2013, the latest time for which results are available (2).
The       change in clinical practice       described and associated reduction in the number of cystectomies has and       will continue to deliver       economic impact to healthcare providers, as the cost of treatment and the       number of in patient       days will be reduced.
The change in clinical practice has been confirmed by the Chair of the       National Cancer Research       Institute Bladder Clinical Studies Group, who detailed in a statement that       "it is confirmed that the           chemotherapy plus radiotherapy regime is now acknowledged as the gold           standard non-surgical           treatment schedule for muscle invasive bladder cancer and is now the           standard           arm for any future studies in this area" (3).
The outcomes       from the research have also changed       clinical practice internationally, with the use of the combined       chemo-radiotherapy being used as       the new `standard of care' and the incorporation of the bladder sparing       regime as a standard arm in       US trials, this is strong evidence of a change in clinical practice and       can be evidenced by the trial       being run by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group at the US National       Cancer Institute (4).
The change in clinical practice is further evidenced by the National       Cancer Research Institute       Bladder Clinical Studies Group Annual Report 2013 (5), which states: "The           BC2001 trial of           chemoradiation versus radiation alone (Chief Investigator: Professor           Nick James) has           changed standard of care for patients with T2-T4 bladder cancer in the           UK and           internationally.
The study is the largest ever chemoradiation or           chemotherapy study in           bladder cancer, showing improvements in local control equivalent to           those seen in cervical           cancer chemoradiation.
Many centres both in the UK and internationally           have adopted its           treatment schedule as standard practice".
The change in clinical practice is now reflected in published guidelines,       e.g.
the Pan Birmingham       Cancer Network Guideline (6).
Point 8.5 details: "Based on the           results of the BC2001 trial           patients receiving radical radiotherapy should be offered synchronous           chemotherapy with           continuous infusion 5FU plus a single bolus of mitomycin C on day 1.
The trial showed a           50% reduction in invasive recurrence with no increase in late toxicity           or impact on bladder           capacity at 1 year.
The synchronous regimen toxicity was not adversely           impacted by prior           neoadjuvant chemotherapy".
Impact on Surgical Education     Professor James has been an invited speaker at Educational sessions for       practitioners at nine       International conferences to date and contributed a chapter to the       President of American Society of       Clinical Oncology's `Building Bridges in Oncology' supplement for       30,000 oncologists at the       American of Clinical Oncology meeting in 2013 (7).
James has been invited       to author the chapter       on Bladder Cancer for the highly influential US text Perez &amp; Brady's `Principles         and Practice of         Radiation Oncology' (8), one of a very small number of non-US       authors and as clinical trainees use       this textbook worldwide this will lead to the work being embedded in       practice globally.
This work in bladder preservation has taken a long time to recruit and       mature.
This has been       driven by a strong sense in the surgical community that cystectomy should       be offered to as many       patients as possible, with radiotherapy reserved for palliation or the       very elderly on unfit.
To recruit       large numbers of patients to a randomised trial thus required substantial       efforts to convince       clinicians of the importance of improving non-surgical therapies.
To       achieve this, investigators'       meetings and workshops were held to emphasise the importance of studying       alternatives to       surgery.
This was backed up by writing review articles in major journals       and speaking at meetings       on the topic.
As the trial progressed, the recruitment rate improved as       clinicians had more       confidence in the safety and efficacy of the schedules being tested, hence       just running the trial       prepared the ground for a change in practice.
