     1) This was the first such research, which has since been followed by       significantly increased focus       elsewhere in Europe and the UK.
2) Led to a WAG publication on raising awareness of older people with       ASD, available online and       distributed to appropriate groups and individuals.
3) Led to a conference (incl.
keynote address by Ian Stuart-Hamilton)       funded by WAG in 2010 to       discuss older adults and ASD.
Inter alia, senior WAG officials and       ministers, and representatives of       18/22 of local authorities and all health boards attended.
4) The report is an integral part of the continuing WAG ASD policy.
5) Led to WAG adopting the report, pursuing further study and       consideration for inclusion in       strategy for care of older adults.
6) Formal adoption of the recommendations as WAG policy is expected, but       the WAG revision of       the same is not expected before early 2014.
Hence, no evidence can be       provided at this time.
