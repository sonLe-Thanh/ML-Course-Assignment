     Geman has served as a scientific advisor to major banks, energy and       mining companies and       commodity trading houses.
Her articles and books are the references used       in trading rooms,       Commodity Exchanges and in prominent court cases, e.g., one in 2011       between the State of       California and a major agrifood company (the name of which is covered by a       non-disclosure       agreement) on the subject of the use of futures contracts for tax       purposes.
The following are four specific impacts:            The results obtained by Geman (3.2, 3.3, 3.5) are used in the         periodic rebalancing of the         composition of the UBS-Bloomberg commodity index.
As a result of the         importance of her         scientific contributions, and their recognition by practitioners, Geman         joined the Board of the         UBS-Bloomberg Commodity Index as the only academic member in 2008 (5.3).
She remains in         this position and by occupying this role she is able to make a direct         input into the construction         of the index.
The rebalancing of the composition of the index in terms         of the commodity prices         makes use of her results on the shape of the forward curve, since the         rolling futures position         has a key impact on the performance of the index.
References (3.2)         and (3.3) above analyse         the forward curves for crude oil, natural gas and all base metals         (copper, nickel, tin).
The level and volatility of agricultural commodity prices represent         crucial issues for         governments of developing countries where they may create severe         problems as witnessed in         the last few years.
Since 2010, Geman has been a Scientific Advisor to         the European         Commission, and she has defined early indicators of price and volatility         spikes.
The usual         explanation given for these spikes in volatility is the somewhat         populist one that it is due to         speculation in futures contracts.
However, Geman has demonstrated,         through a series of         empirical examples, that scarcity of the physical commodity is the key         factor driving the spikes.
She has shown that useful indicators need to use data that reveal         scarcity and can measure it         continuously.
She has shown that data on inventories is crucial for this         (3.3, 3.5, 5.5, 5.6).
These results are used in the European Commission's indicators.
In a world of food scarcity, limited arable land and soil erosion,         fertilizers represent a crucial         asset class.
In 2011 and 2012 Geman delivered a series of talks in         Casablanca for the Office         Ch&#233;rifien des Phosphates, the gigantic phosphate producing company and         the major source of         revenues for Morocco.
In reference (3.1) (which was circulated as         a working paper in 2011),         she explains, first why fertilizers can represent a desirable investment         for financial institutions         and crucial working capital for the industry; second how the use of         phosphate derivatives, such         as forward contracts and swaps, can be integrated with the `old'         activity of the physical export         of phosphate rock, allowing the company itself, as opposed to the banks         who advise it, to         optimize its revenues over a larger feasible set, by combining physical         and financial trading in a         consistent manner.
These findings are now used in the strategic         decisions of the Office         Ch&#233;rifien des Phosphates all along the supply chain of the phosphates         and at the corporate         level.
Geman explained this combined physical/financial optimization in         the production of         phosphates in private sessions with the President of the company (5.2).
Geman's research on electricity, crude oil and natural gas (3.3,           3.4, 3.5, 5.1) is implemented at         EDF Trading, the trading arm of the giant utility Electricite de France         (which owns London         Energy).
Geman was Head of Research at EdFT during the years 2001 and         2002 when the         company was built.
The new developments of her research, including the         analysis of the WTI/         Brent spread according to the methodology of her 2009 paper (3.3)         make a key contribution to         the trading and investment strategies implemented by EdFT.
Her papers         are quoted in the         EdFT's technical reports which explain their strategies (5.4).
Geman's book Commodities and Commodity Derivatives, published by Wiley       Finance in 2005 (3.5)       has become the standard reference book in trading rooms and commodity       companies.
In 2006, it       was endorsed by Robert Merton, MIT, Nobel Prize winner and his comment       that it is destined to be       a "must have" supports the argument for influence and impact post 2008:     In Commodities and Commodity Derivatives, H&#233;lyette Geman shows her         powerful         command of the subject by combining a rigorous development of its         mathematical         modelling with a compact institutional presentation of the arcane         characteristics of         commodities that makes the complex analysis of commodities derivative         securities         accessible to both the academic and practitioner who wants a deep         foundation and a         breadth of different market applications.
It is destined to be a "must         have" on the subject.
http://www.amazon.com/Commodities-Commodity-Derivatives-Modelling-Agriculturals/dp/0470012188     Geman has disseminated her work through more than 100 peer-reviewed       academic publications in       top finance Journals.
She has been (since 2005) the Keynote Speaker in a       large number of       conferences, both academic like the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences       conference on Energy in       2009, and organized by practitioners, like the annual World Mining       Association conference or       Euromoney.
In the case of the US court case, mentioned at the beginning of Section       4, trading in futures by a       corporation to hedge its revenues (a so called `commercial activity') has       a social utility recognized       by governments, and it benefits from tax advantages.
However, an entity       labelled as `commercial'       may also engage in speculative activities which should not generate the       same tax shield.
The       frontier between two activities is very difficult to identify.
Geman was       appointed by the Government       of California to identify this frontier because of her research on the use       of futures contracts for       `hedging' versus `trading' purposes.
The case was subsequently won by the       Government of       California.
