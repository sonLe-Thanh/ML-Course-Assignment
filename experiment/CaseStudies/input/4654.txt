     There are three sites of impact:     AstraZeneca     This company can now identify ligands for transition metal catalysis       (mostly with Pd, Rh, Ru and Ir) more efficiently.
The Ligand Knowledge       Base principal component analysis feeds into a Design of Experiment       programme that defines the `chemical space' within which ligands will be       tested and how most efficiently to explore this space.
This could not be       done well previously because there were no 'coordinates' for the ligand       space (unlike, for example, the parameterisations available for solvents).
AstraZeneca estimated at the end of Phase 2, that this advance has already       led to about &#163;250k cost saving and it anticipates on-going savings will be       in the region of millions of pounds, through faster development of       scale-up processes with reduced development time and costs and ultimately       a reduction in manufacturing costs with the potential to reduce the       environmental impact of their processes.
The impact of these developments were recognised in the form of an       AstraZeneca Science &amp; Technical Award (to Murray and Osborne) in       October 2010.
The award nomination read "The design and application of         high quality ligand descriptors in this way is a scientific breakthrough         and leading academics refer to this innovation as `revolutionary'.
This         capability is now in routine operation and supporting Discovery in         gaining access to high value areas of chemical space".
Murray,       quoted in an internal AstraZeneca document announcing the award, suggested       that savings derived from the breakthrough are "estimated at around         $200k per project to produce 60 kilos of drug substance for a clinical         trial.
This saving would rise with a market launch to $2.5m for 600         kilos or $25m for six tonnes", (a).
CatSci Ltd     this company, which predominantly arose from activities conducted in the       labs of Murray at AZ under the auspices of the Ligand Knowledge Base       programme, has a mission "To establish new and improved chemical         reactions and processes through a world-leading understanding and         application of transition metal catalysis".
A major component in the       portfolio of services offered by CatSci is "Optimisation of processes         through predictive catalysis: Identification and development of         an optimised catalytic process and for the interrogation of reaction         space in line with Quality by Design principles delivered through         exploiting unique predictive catalysis techniques".
These techniques       derive directly from Phases 1 and 2 of the collaboration, and solely use       the Ligand Knowledge Base descriptors and principal component       analysis-derived ligand maps developed at Bristol.
Initial investment in       facilities has been &#163;0.52m in equipment and 5 staff, with &#163;1.2m of       business already secured.
Further investment by the Welsh Government has       been made in a CatSci-University of Bristol collaborative project to       develop an improved ligand screening protocol for homogeneous catalysis,       integrating fully the computational evaluation of catalyst properties with       CatSci's high-throughput automated catalyst screening and analysis       facilities.
Focusing on the need to ensure 'manufacturability' in the       chemical industries, this two-year project aims to deliver efficient,       stable and selective catalysts that are economically viable for process       scale-up and discovery (b).
Phosphonics Ltd     Concepts arising during the initial phases of the research led to the       design of unique `catalyst capture/release' technology.
This concept is       now being studied in the School of Chemistry and made ready for the market       by Phosphonics via a collaboration supported by the TSB/EPSRC through the       Technology Strategy Board "Sustainable Manufacturing for the Process         Industry" programme.
This &#163;700k project ("Recyclable Catalyst         Technology for Cross-Coupling Reactions at Manufacturing Scale")       draws together Phosphonics, CatSci, Syngenta, AstraZeneca, Albany       Molecular Research and the University of Bristol, to explore and design       novel functionalised silica materials that allow purification of reaction       products by temporary capture of the Pd catalyst in heterogeneous form,       capable of triggered release back in an active form into solution.
The       technology will be employed in semi-continuous format, with application       possible across multiple process industries.
Initial applications towards       the manufacture of pharmaceuticals &amp; agrochemicals will be a       demonstrable output during 2013-2015 (c).
