     It has been estimated that globally there are almost as many mobile phone       subscriptions as there are people.
Rigorous, high quality, independent       research is vital for governments and agencies responsible for       safeguarding public health against a background of increasing concern over       potential harms.
Impacts on health and welfare and public policy and services           International policy     The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) produces       monographs on environmental factors and the risk of human cancer providing       scientific support for action taken by national health agencies tasked       with preventing exposure to potential carcinogens.
The long-awaited       monograph evaluating the carcinogenicity of mobile phone exposure was       delayed more than two years to ensure the inclusion of evidence from       Interphone [A].
Primary evidence from Interphone showed that overall, mobile phone users       had no increased risk of brain tumours (although in a single small       subgroup of those with the highest cumulative call time, a raised glioma       risk was seen).
No trend in increasing risk was observed for cumulative       call time or for increasing numbers of calls or years of mobile use.
The       World Health Organization (WHO) website [B] notes `Based largely         on these [Interphone] data, IARC has classified radiofrequency         electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)',       a low risk category which also includes coffee consumption.
It also cites       Interphone (the only individual study discussed) as `the largest         retrospective case-control study to date ... showing no increased risk         of glioma or meningioma with mobile phone use of more than 10 years'.
The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection       (ICNIRP) is an independent international body that publishes Exposure         Guidelines for Non-Ionising Radiation, endorsed by the WHO, and       which includes radiofrequency fields from mobile phones.
These guidelines       are on the radiation protection agenda of virtually every country       worldwide.
They have been formally adopted as national standards in over       50 countries including Australia, Canada, many countries in Europe, Latin       America and SE Asia, and form the basis of the US and Japanese guidelines.
In 2010/11, ICNIRP published specifically on Interphone [C],       commenting on its large size and noting that `Interphone added greatly         to the volume of evidence available' and that the outcomes include       an important contribution to the evidence base for the ongoing review of       international exposure guidelines.
The ICNIRP Standing Committee on Epidemiology states `the accumulating         evidence is increasingly against the hypothesis that mobile phones cause         brain tumours in adults'.
It adds, "importantly, Interphone has         provided valuable methodological insights aiding the interpretation of         epidemiological research into mobile phones and health" [D].
UK Government policy     The Health Protection Agency (HPA), now part of Public Health England,       has a statutory responsibility to advise the Department of Health on       health effects related to mobile phones and has adopted the ICNIRP       standards on radiation protection exposure for mobile phones.
In their       public health advice, the HPA quote their independent Advisory Group on       Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) which states: `T he INTERPHONE         study ... has contributed importantly to our understanding of possible         health risks from use of mobile phones' [E].
A dedicated web       section on Interphone on the HPA website has seen approximate 200 visitors       a month since April 2010 (E).
A major HPA report on radiofrequency       electromagnetic fields published in 2012 addresses Interphone in detail       and concludes there is no convincing evidence that mobile phone       technologies cause adverse effects on human health [F].
Public debate and awareness     A measure of the significance of the impact of both the UK and the       Interphone studies for the general public was the management of media       dissemination by the Science Media Centre, London [G], an       organisation that independently promotes the voices and views of the       scientific community to the news media.
McKinney gave press and TV (BBC,       ITV, Sky News) briefings (e.g.
Mobile phones 'unlikely' to cause         cancer, BBC News), and we are aware of over 75 news articles,       including articles in all the UK national broadsheets (e.g.
Mobile         phone study finds no solid link to brain tumours, The Guardian) and       across the international press (including the New York Times and Reuters)       that reported on Interphone.
Impact on commerce     Reassurance for industry     Interphone has enabled governments in over 50 countries worldwide to       adopt scientifically validated exposure guidelines that have allowed       continued expansion of the mobile phone industry, leading to major       economic benefits.
Without Interphone results, as one UK AGNIR committee       member points out: `There would have been pressures to restrict         exposures to the radiofrequency radiation from mobile phones on a         precautionary basis' [H].
He added that Interphone       results have `helped to allay public anxieties about mobile phone         technology' potentially increasing their commercial value.
The mobile phone industry is forecast to have a global market value of       $334.8 billion in 2015.
Mobile phone network operators and manufacturers       both in the UK and worldwide have committed over $13.4 billion since 2000       towards investigating health impacts of mobile phone usage.
Funding to the       University of Leeds and Interphone was `firewalled' to ensure the       independence of the academic researchers but the results were       unsurprisingly welcomed by the industry [I].
The UK Mobile       Operators Association, a consortium of all UK network operators, stated       that `Interphone is likely to be recognised as an important part of the         wider scientific evidence' underpinning the WHO policy advice on RF       Environmental Health Criteria [J].
