     The Joint Research Centre (JRC) is the scientific arm of the European       Commission and provides advice to the Commission to inform policy-making.
In collaboration with the JRC, the research conducted at Queen Mary has       had impact in a number of ways.
Firstly, through collaboration with JRC       our research has influenced European security policy.
Secondly, with JRC       and the Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union our research has       informed security performance standards in the container shipping       industry.
Thirdly, our collaboration with JRC and relationships with E.On       and the National Emergency Supply Agency of Finland (NESA) has informed       the security of electricity and gas networks.
And fourthly, through       collaboration with HM Treasury our research has informed the delivery of       the High Speed 2 rail network in the UK to identify opportunities for a       shared corridor.
The following section explains each of these impact       areas.
Influencing security policy     Our research and the associated modelling techniques [1, 2, 3, 4] have       been adopted by the JRC who, in turn, have impact on European legislation       for infrastructure projects.
A key mission of the JRC is to provide       research that supports EC policymakers in their efforts to ensure global       security and the protection of European citizens from accidents,       deliberate attacks, fraud and other illegal activity.
In 1996, Guti&#233;rrez       joined Arrowsmith's group as a PhD student and together they published       research on structural engineering.
Guti&#233;rrez joined the European       Commission as a researcher in the JRC where later, in collaboration with       Arrowsmith, he provided research expertise in the fields of gas and       electricity supply security, building upon the methods described above in       Section 2.
The data-mining exercise mentioned in Section 2 allowed us to identify       load- and fault-tolerant backbones of the trans-European gas pipeline       network by combining topological data with information on inter-country       flows [1].
This has made it possible to estimate the global load of the       European gas network and its tolerance to failures by applying two       complementary methods generalised from measures of betweenness centrality       and the maximum flow.
We found that the gas pipeline network has grown to       satisfy a dual purpose.
On one hand, the major pipelines are crossed by a       large number of direct connections thereby increasing the efficiency of       the network; on the other hand, a non-operational pipeline causes only a       minimal impact on network capacity, implying that the network is error       tolerant.
Our findings conclude that the trans-European gas pipeline       network is robust &#8212; it is tolerant to failures of high load links.
The       data for this activity has been made available by the Head of Unit, Energy       Security, EC Joint Research Centre at Petten, and Queen Mary conducted the       mining and analysis exercise.
The collaboration between JRC and our researchers has contributed to the       ongoing evaluation of technologies and the improvement of security       standards which have an impact on EU regulations as confirmed by       Guti&#233;rrez, now a researcher at the JRC [8]: "I would like to record         the significance of the collaboration between the European Laboratory         for Structural Assessment of the European Commission's Joint Research         Centre (JRC), Ispra, and the School of Mathematical Sciences of Queen         Mary, University of London, most notably with Prof. D.K.
Arrowsmith.
This collaboration has enabled the JRC to have an impact on the         development of a framework for standardisation, regulation and         legislation with regards to supply chain container management and         security.
The scientific input and the unique expertise of SMS/QMUL have         been a key ingredient for its collaboration with the JRC, whose role is         to provide scientific and technical support to European Commission         services by delivering guidelines with a view to promote standards and         legislation".
Addressing security performance standards in the container shipping           industry     Arrowsmith and Guti&#233;rrez have also collaborated on research into the       robustness of containerised transport networks and the ability of sensors       to provide appropriate indicators of secured goods.
There were over 400       million container movements in 2010 and containerised transport is       particularly at risk of being targeted for the smuggling of people or       goods, as indicated in the "EC Technical Report, An overview of         research programmes and prospective technology in the development of         more secure supply chains: The Case of Shipping Containers" [11].
The scope of this report, a joint activity of our researchers, JRC, and       The Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union covers "on the one         hand the two primary technological considerations (materials technology         and production, ad-hoc sensor networks deployment) and, on the other,         the economic and trade statistics backdrop of the container industry.
By         considering these aspects &#8212; in conjunction with the technological         developments and policies in container security of the EU's major         trading partners &#8212; it is intended to set the backdrop to the potential         innovative technologies in the area of tamper-proof intermodal         containers.
The aim is to provide support to European Commission         services in their policies of motivating the development, capability         testing and evaluation of technologies that could meet the security         performance standards in the container shipping industry, and in matters         relating to meeting the EU's international cooperation agreements on         supply chain security" [11].
Arrowsmith and Guti&#233;rrez's       collaborative research in MANMADE and RAVEN [5,6] led to an invitation to       address security performance standards in the container shipping industry       [12].
The project research has been applied in matters relating to meeting       the EU's international cooperation agreements on supply chain security.
Ranking and the impact on security of gas networks     In 2012 Arrowsmith, Carvalho and Guti&#233;rrez founded a research group named       Real World Networks (RWnets).
This group produced an energy network       analysis that ranked the security of gas networks in Europe.
This research       led to a novel method of ranking countries in terms of the vulnerability       of their infrastructure to degradation, natural disaster or deliberate       attack.
Furthermore, as a result of the development of expertise in the       analysis of real networks within MANMADE [6], which was further developed       by EPSRC funding in RAVEN [5], we now have a memorandum of understanding       with the EC Joint Research Centre, Petten, which has enabled the release       of key energy network data to develop novel ideas of fairness of flow       indicators [2] (January 2012, data via the Head of Unit for Energy       Security, EC Joint Research Centre, Petten).
Much of this research is to       address issues of the Grand Challenge energy scenarios that Research       Councils UK is now supporting, such as the supply of energy becoming       increasingly pan-European with the potential for political involvement in       the transport of energy across the continent.
The research group which was set up at Queen Mary as part of the MANMADE       project [6] collaborated with the energy supplier E.ON in Hungary [9] to       develop a dynamic power grid model with a view to understanding likely       cascade scenarios at a national level, and with the National Emergency       Supply Agency of Finland (NESA) [7] who attended all six management       meetings over the three years of the project to monitor the outcome of       MANMADE, for them to feedback on national energy security.
Evidence of impact on UK infrastructure development: High Speed 2     Our research resulted in an approach from HM Treasury [10] to offer       advice and expertise on one of the largest infrastructure projects in       Europe.
Specifically, the Treasury's approach was stimulated by interest       in our investigation of the European gas network [1], which led to our       involvement with HS2.
Our research outputs have been discussed by the HS2       team, as described by the Interdependencies Lead within the Enterprise and       Growth Group at HM Treasury [13]: "Your report mapping HS2 route         against electricity and gas network density has been read with interest         here and I have used the results with DfT and the HS2 delivery team to         explain how we can go about analysing potential opportunities for shared         corridor....
In particular, we are working with the HS2 team to make a         case for a fibre backbone down the HS2 route".
This indicates impact       in the decision making process on future high-profile infrastructure       projects.
