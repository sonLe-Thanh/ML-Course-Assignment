     The work carried out at Imperial between 1994 and 1999 was the basis of       the initial patent [3], applied for in 1995.
This patent, which was       assigned to Nanoco from Imperial, was the first in the Nanoco IP portfolio       as described in Nanoco's 2009 admission document to AIM, the London Stock       Exchange's international market for smaller growing companies: `Nanoco's         earliest patent family dates back to 1995 and contains granted patents         in the US, Germany, France and the UK relating to the use of metal         complexes to produce nanocrystalline material known as the Single Source         Precursor technology.
The Single Source Precursor technology was         developed by Professor Paul O'Brien while he was at Imperial College,         London and all IP was subsequently assigned to Nanoco' [A, p24].
This Imperial research provided the backbone for the spin-out of the       company which occurred in 2001 after Prof. O'Brien had moved to the       University of Manchester.
Further patents did not follow until 2004 after       Nanoco had been running for 3 years, and as such, the initial patent can       be viewed as the cornerstone of Nanoco's commercialisation strategy and       the emergence of Nanoco in general.
A letter from the Non-Executive       Chairman of the Nanoco Group confirms the role of the Imperial research in       the early life of the company [B].
Highlights of post 2008 impact     In 2008 Nanoco won the UK Trade &amp; Industry Business       Innovation Award in the category of Clean Technologies [C], signed a       distribution agreement with Japan-based Kisco, a major electronics       materials supplier, and signed a supply and licence agreement with a major       Japanese LED manufacturer [D].
In 2009, in addition to successfully floating on AIM (AIM:NANO)       [A], Nanoco signed a joint development agreement with Japan based Fine       Polymers (owned by Kisco) to service the LED markets outside Japan [D].
Revenues in the year to 31 July 2009 were &#163;1.99 million, comprising of       milestone payments from strategic partners and income from the sale of       products by distribution partners.
The company's cash, and cash       equivalents, at the financial year's end (7/2009) were &#163;6.59 million [D].
2010 saw a joint development agreement signed with a major       Japanese electronics company for LED backlighting of televisions and a       joint development agreement signed with Tokyo Electron for a photovoltaic       film, marking the first agreement in the solar power sector [E].
In terms       of manufacturing, significant progress was made with procurement of a new       production facility in Runcorn, Cheshire as the company's first commercial       production plant and the addition of a series of scale-up reactors,       critical for the progression of quantum dots from very small scale       laboratory manufacture to mass production, in the Manchester headquarters.
Turnover for the year (to 7/2010) was &#163;2.9 million [E].
In 2011 the Runcorn production facility was designed and built on       time and on budget.
1kg of red CFQDs were produced at Runcorn and shipped       to a Japanese LED customer triggering a $2 million payment [F].
Manufacturing quantum dots on this scale was a world-first technical       achievement and underlined the scalability of Nanoco's technology.
A       follow-on product development agreement, worth $800,000, was signed with a       major Japanese company whose products include LCD TVs [F, G].
This       agreement, which followed an 18 month JDA, focused on the final steps in       combining CFQD into an LCD TV for commercial launch [F].
A JDA was signed       with one of the world's largest lighting companies in August 2011 for use       of QDs in general lighting [G].
The company's cash, and cash equivalents,       at the financial year's end (7/2011) were &#163;17.1million, up from &#163;5.68M the       previous year, and its turnover &#163;2.6 million [F].
In January 2012 Nanoco received a $1 million payment from major       Japanese LED corporation for achieving the specified performance criteria       for green QDs and in May 2012 it received $2 million payment for the       delivery of 1kg of the green QDs, a major technical achievement.
These       payments follow similar payments achieved for the successful development       and delivery of red quantum dots in 2011.
This Japanese corporation is now       working to incorporate the Company's CFQD directly onto LEDs for small       size LCD displays [H].
Following significant technical progress achieved       during the year a further thin film solar development agreement was signed       with Tokyo Electron.
In October 2012, Nanoco signed a follow-on joint       development agreement with Osram, one of the world's largest lighting       companies [G].
Production scale-up plans were also on track in 2012 with       the production capacity design of an upgraded Runcorn lab increased to       400kg a year, reflecting a greater projected demand for quantum dots [I,       J].
Turnover for the year was &#163;2.95m and the company's cash, and cash       equivalents, at the financial year's end (7/2012) were &#163;15.5 million [H].
In January 2013 Nanoco announced a worldwide licensing agreement       with the Dow Electronic Materials division of the Dow Chemical Company       [G].
Under the terms of the agreement, Dow will have exclusive worldwide       rights for the sale, marketing and manufacture of Nanoco's CFQDs for use       in electronic displays such as TVs, computer screens, tablets and       smartphones.
Nanoco will receive royalty payments from Dow related to its       sales of CFQDs.
Dow's experience of manufacturing scale-up was a key       component of the licensing agreement and it is expected that full       commercial production will begin in 2014 [G].
Following the announcement       of the "transformational global licensing agreement" with Dow,       Nanoco shares rose more than 21 per cent [K].
As of January 2013 Nanoco employed 78 staff at its Manchester       headquarters and Runcorn plant [G].
By November 2013, the market       capitalization of Nanoco was approximately &#163;340 million [B].
Selected highlights of technological impact     Nanoco is "the only company in the world that has managed to         manufacture quantum dots without the use of cadmium, a toxic chemical         effectively banned from most consumer products" [L].
Nanoco's main       US rivals, Nanosys and QD Vision, use the heavy metal &#8212; "the presence         of which in the environment, even in small quantities, can potentially         be harmful to human health" [J] This gives the company a "dominant       position in a potentially huge global market for quantum dot technology"       [J].
In many regions of the world there is now, or soon to be, legislation       to restrict and in some cases ban heavy metals in many household       appliances such as IT &amp; telecommunication equipment, lighting       equipment, and electrical and electronic tools.
In Europe, the restricted       metals include cadmium.
There are similar regulations in place or soon to       be implemented worldwide including China, Korea, Japan and the US.
Nanoco       has developed and is currently extending the range of restricted metal       free quantum dots [M].
Quantum dots prepared by Nanoco have numerous optical and structural       advantages over traditional dyes, phosphors and fluorophores, and the       scale up of high quality materials afforded by the single source route       pioneered at Imperial allows the materials to realistically be used in       application.
The use of Nanoco's green and red emitting quantum dots, when       applied to a blue emitting LED are the basis of extremely efficient       sold-state lighting; whereas traditional light bulbs are up to 5%       efficient with a life time of 500 hours, quantum dot/LED lighting is       suggested to be over 60% efficient with a life time of 50,000 hours [N].
Similarly, Nanoco's QDs are to be incorporated into organic LEDs, which       have benefits including improved energy efficiency, lower cost and       improved display quality whilst removing the need for filters or       backlights.
Future impact     The Quantum Dot and Quantum Dot Display markets, worth $150.1 million in       2012, are anticipated to reach $6.4 billion by 2019 as technology matures       and is designed into products [O].
