     Dissemination     Nelson's 2011&#8212;12 residency included several presentations within and       outside the hospital.
A public symposium was held during the London       Creativity and Wellbeing week in 2012, at which around sixty project       collaborators, patients, members of the public, clinicians and scientists       shared ideas about the science and art of cancer.
A Huffington Post       video of the installation has received over 1,500 views since being posted       online in April 2012, further spreading awareness of the work, and the       installation has been booked for the Kings Place Festival (London) in       January 2014.
Reach     The work's siting, facing onto a busy street just off London's Tottenham       Court Road, made it accessible to hospital visitors and passersby.
An       independent market research survey carried out in May 2013 counted, during       a six-day (28&#189; hours) observation period, 5,295 passersby (average: 185       per hour).
An estimated 15% of them actively looked at the artwork, and       60% of the 88 people surveyed confirmed that they used the route regularly       and had viewed it before.
Although located at a single site, the artwork's       reach over the 14-month display period was therefore considerable.
Two       hundred patients, staff and others completed a questionnaire in the same       month.
As the installation faced outwards rather than into the cancer       centre, the percentage of this group who had previously seen the artwork       was lower, at 12%.
Significance and Impact     The Public     A month after its unveiling in 2012, a Huffington Post reporter       witnessed the work `confounding and delighting passersby', and noted that       `the reactions to the piece vary from none, to confusion and long,       drawn-out stares'.
The questionnaire gave depth to these responses: 80% of       members of the public surveyed said the artwork was good for the centre       (5% said not; the remainder were unsure).
The majority offered positive       impressions, saying, for example, that `the visual aspect of cancer is       good', `I like that it communicates cancer in a new way', and `All art is       good art in hospital.
.
.
This piece is very stimulating.'
Some would have       liked more explanation, or thought it `too abstract', but others rose to       its challenge, stating: `The abstract nature of the piece really appeals       to me.
This challenges my view of cancer', and `I like the way the artwork       deals with such a taboo subject in a straightforward way.'
Cancer Centre Patients, Carers, Staff and Visitors     The majority (44%) of the 167 patients, staff and others who were       interviewed in person were patients; a further 23 staff completed the       survey by email.
Again, most (73%) thought it was a good artwork for the       cancer centre; the 15% who disagreed found the reminder of cancer       `unwelcome' or `comfortable', preferring `something to distract rather       than highlight cancer'.
Even those hostile to the work engaged even more fully with it than the       public viewers.
Many offered thoughtful, outspoken or animated opinions:       one was `shocked by the piece', thought it `could attract controversy',       and `didn't wish to see cancer as a glamorisation', but conceded `[I] can       see how it helps non cancer patients understand cancer.'
Several talked of       its lifting a `taboo', one noting that `relatives used to talk about it in       hushed tones so anything that changes people's perception of cancer is       good'.
Another said: `Anything that highlights the reality of cancer and       explains cancer is a good thing, we've swept cancer under the rug over the       years.'
Yet another praised `the idea that cancer is an aberration', and       especially liked `the audio component relating to the composer's relatives       last breath being incorporated into the piece'.
Additionally, the patient-informants who had informed the work's creation       reported that the residency, and their contribution to it, gave them a       voice, counteracting feelings of disenfranchisment during their treatment.
Senior professionals at the centre were very positive.
Writing for the Anarchy         in the Organism (2013) publication, Simon Walker-Samuel said that,       as a research scientist, his conception of cancer had been enriched by       working on cancer at an abstract level of mathematics and aesthetics, and       by encountering the patient perspective.
This was echoed by survey       participants, with one calling it `a very challenging piece .
.
.
I think       that it is highly successful'.
Another reported that patient feedback       about the artwork `is that it is highly valued .
.
.
I think it could be       described as the bravest work'.
Understanding the patient perspective was       important for yet another: `It brought me close to working with patients       who were suffering with cancer and .
.
.
in terms of my emotional       understanding I think it definitely assisted with that'.
Artworld and Other Professionals     Six influential people involved in the commission were also interviewed:     [text removed for publication]     All spoke of the work's importance in terms of provoking dialogue, its       head-on engagement with uncomfortable subject matter, `opening up the       territory', and its `profound effect' on those involved in its       realisation.
One said that, in artistic terms, it was `a model of       intelligent collaboration'.
[text removed for publication] was       particularly supportive:     One of the things we find about people with cancer is that if in their       mind the cancer is some horrible, evil-smelling, pussy fault caused by       them .
.
.
then it is an awful feeling to live with .
.
.
If they       understand that it is something that is part of them and that it is a       fault that has happened in terms of accumulation of growth, then it is       still killing them and it is still painful and it is still a horrible       thing to do, but the feeling is different.
.
.
that is why I feel this art       does something for them.
