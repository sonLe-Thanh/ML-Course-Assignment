     Nature of the Impact: Munro's research led to an invitation from       the Secretary of State for Education to undertake a review of child       protection in England.
Her first report [A] analysed how different factors       had interacted to create a system that was risk averse, focusing on rules,       process and compliance rather than on its impact on children.
Her analysis       was corroborated by feedback from the sector and subsequent reports       developed solutions [B,C,D].
Munro's final report [B] made 15       recommendations [BRec1-15] that sought to introduce change at several       points in the system: the ultimate aim was to move from a compliance       culture involving performance indicators to a learning culture, with       evidence about the impact on children becoming the key driver of practice.
The recommendations, building on key themes identified in Munro's       research, have all been accepted [E, F] impacting on legislation, policy       and practice.
Organisational change: A recommendation for a new inspection       framework [BRec3: implemented 04/12[G]], shifts the emphasis from data       about process to evidence of the quality of work and its impact on       children.
It requires local authorities (LAs) to gather feedback from       users and provide evidence of impact as part of their monitoring.
Prescribed statutory timescales for some processes at the beginning of the       family's contact with the child protection system have been removed       (implemented 05/13[H]), the aim being to reduce the dominance they had       acquired in determining priorities.
LAs and other children's services are       now required to monitor the child's journey through the system.
Inspectors       will also observe practice and talk to workers and users so that judgments       are not based on written records alone.
Given the distorting effects of performance indicators, with agencies       merely seeking to score well, and not necessarily provide a high quality       of service, new performance information was recommended [BRec4]       (implemented 04/12[I]).
A mixture of national and local data is now       provided which must be interrogated before a judgment on quality of       performance is formed.
Interaction between many professions and agencies       is required for the child protection system to function.
A further       recommendation [BRec3] focused on conducting joint inspections; this is to       commence, in a modified form, in 2013-14 [J].
Revised statutory guidance       [H] also includes a requirement that Local Safeguarding Children's Boards       should include an assessment of the effectiveness of the help provided       [BRec6].
Creating a culture of shared acceptance of the inherent       uncertainty in making predictions about children's futures is also vital:       Ministerial statements reflect this uncertainty [K] as does the wording in       new statutory guidance [H].
With the changes in guidance, inspection and performance information,       children's social care departments are now required to give more attention       to the quality of help they are providing rather than focusing on       performance indicators.
At least 50 LAs have radically redesigned their       work to improve the focus on helping families [D].
Professional expertise: Munro's recommendations have sought to       increase flexibility so that professionals can respond to the varied needs       and circumstances of children and families, and adapt their practices       having learned about their impact.
The revised statutory guidance [BRec1]       (implemented 01/13[H]) includes a radical reduction in prescription,       limiting it to essential rules for professional co-operation, with       responsibility for professional guidance being left to the professions.
It       also replaces timescales with judgements of timeliness plus quality.
The       Government has also decommissioned the former electronic Common Assessment       Form, so that local areas can adapt assessment frameworks to meet their       own needs [L].
The aim is to make it easier for organisations to create       the working conditions for improving professional expertise when working       with families.
Munro was also asked to pay particular attention to improving social       work, building on the work of the Social Work Taskforce (2009).
Drawing on       her research on professional reasoning and the development of expertise in       basic training and later practice, a capabilities framework for child and       family social work has been developed by the College of Social Work       [BRec11] [M].
The Government has additionally published expectations for       HEI/employer partnerships regarding the quality of placements for trainee       social workers [BRec12] [N].
For social work, improving expertise requires a change in career options       with a route to seniority in which staff can remain involved in direct       work and be rewarded for becoming more skilled.
LAs are now required to       appoint a Principal Child and Family Social Worker at a senior level who       is still actively engaged with direct practice [BRec14].
This       recommendation has also been taken up in adult social care: the Care and       Support White Paper [O] proposes that all LAs should appoint a Principal       Social Worker for adult services.
The Government has additionally created       posts of Chief Social Worker [BRec15) for both children's and adult social       work to improve the skills and role of the profession.
Munro's work has had impact beyond England.
The Isle of Man is taking       forward her work to improve childcare services [P].
In Australia, she gave       evidence to reviews of child protection in state governments in Victoria       and New South Wales; and in Queensland, a charity is running a `Munro       campaign' to persuade the state government to learn from her work [Q].
Wider Implications: Protecting children from maltreatment is an       important task.
The English child protection system was in need of major       reform as it had become dominated by a `blame culture' in which compliance       with procedures outweighed a focus on children's needs.
The reforms that       have been introduced as a result of the work of the Unit are leading to       significant cultural changes and expertise in helping children, with       evidence about the impact of services on children now being prioritised       which should improve the quality of help provided and so assist with       improving the welfare of children.
