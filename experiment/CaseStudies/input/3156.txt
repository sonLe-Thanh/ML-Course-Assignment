     The activity described here builds on Alfrey's career-long interaction       with British artists and       photographers, the British landscape tradition, and national galleries and       museums.
The AHRC       network that he founded and in which he was Principal Investigator (5.1),       as described above,       allowed him to develop these links into a sustained collaboration between       participants in the       Network (Sleeman, Tufnell., Lamelas, Paterson, etc.)
This generated a         critical reconsideration         of the production, display and reception of Land Art in Britain.
The       network also created an       opportunity for contemporary engagement with the same material,       stimulating new artistic practice       and the re-staging of seminal work by David Lamelas from the late 1960s       (5.2).
Exhibitions curated by Alfrey at Djanogly Gallery, Nottingham (1993,       2009), Tate Britain (with       Daniels and Martin Postle, 2004) and Arts Council England (with Sleeman       and Tufnell, 2013)       increased the visibility of modern British art concerned with landscape         and the         environment.
This visibility can be measured most recently through       the press reception for       Uncommon Ground (5.3).
Richard Cork, writing in the Financial         Times (11 June 2013), said that       the exhibition 'proves that Land art can be made in an inexhaustible       variety of settings.
The sense       of freedom is exhilarating at every turn' (5.3).
This press attention       reflects a demonstrable       breakthrough for an area of art practice that has previously not always       been easily accessible to       many viewers, and forms part of a wider critical assessment of Land Art in       which Alfrey's work has       played a pivotal role.
This critical reassessment can be demonstrated by widespread engagement       from the press (both       broadsheet and art historical), focussing on the new and comprehensive         definition of Land Art         that has been brought to public attention: Charles Darwent, in a       review of Uncommon Ground       (Independent, 11 May 2013), admitted to having dismissed British       Land Art as long ago as 2003       but added that that the exhibition showed that he was wrong to have done       so (5.3).
The most       nuanced discussion of the issues involved was made by Andrew Wilson in The         Burlington         Magazine (August, 2013) who wrote that the exhibition raises 'the       problem of defining what Land       Art might mean in British art of the 1960s and 1970s' (5.3).
Mark Hudson       in the Daily Telegraph       (20 May 2013) found that 'The message of this survey of British land art &#8212;       the most comprehensive       to date &#8212; is that the British variant...was not only more domestically       scaled, but a lot quirkier than       its American counterpart' (5.3).
Alfrey's national profile and Network was a catalyst for the display or       re-staging of rarely or never         seen art from the 1960s.
In the case of some established artists,       his research has led a critical       reassessment of their contribution in the 1960s.
Impromptu exhibitions       were arranged by the       Network and in them the artists themselves led the discussion, among them       was John Hilliard who       presented his little-known landscape work of the 1960s (5.1).
This led to       its display for the first time       in Alfrey's exhibition Uncommon Ground (3.3).
Paul Carey-Kent       wrote in Art Monthly (June 2013)       that 'What struck me most...was the amount of relatively unfamiliar work       [in the exhibition]' (5.3).
Another key event was the 're-performance' of a seminal film made in 1969       by David Lamelas (one       of the pioneering figures in conceptual art) at the Camden Arts Centre and       at the National Film       Theatre in 2009 (5.2).
Alfrey's research and related exhibitions and network activities have       been instrumental in         inspiring and supporting new artistic practice.
This was stimulated       by the bringing together of       artists originally associated with Land Art with those working with       aspects of its legacy.
Emerging       artists who participated in the Land Art Network were thereby brought into       direct contact with       established practitioners.
These can be defined in three groups.
The first       contained key figures       from among the original protagonists, in particular John Hilliard, Bruce       McLean, and David       Lamelas.
The second included Garry Fabian Miler (b.
1957) and other       artists who emerged at the       end of the 1970s who showed their work in relation to that of the first       generation of Land artists in       Uncommon Ground (2013).
The third was represented by a much younger       artist, Katie Paterson       (b.
1981) who shared the Earth-Moon-Earth exhibition in Nottingham       (2009) with Lamelas (b.
1946) (3.2, 5.4).
Paterson participated in a discussion session at the       Slade which led to her       collaboration with Alfrey on the exhibition Earth-Moon-Earth, and,       in turn, to her re-creation of an       installation for it (3.2).
Her work was subsequently represented by the       Haunch of Venison Gallery,       whose former curator (Tufnell) has been a key figure in the Network (5.1):       'meeting Ben       Tufnell...led on to me being represented by Haunch of Venison the best       gallery that I have ever       worked with' (5.5).
Her current visibility can be measured in a piece by       Brian Dillon in The         Guardian (6 April 2012) which discusses Earth-Moon-Earth as       a key early work (5.6).This activity       would not have happened without the fertile environment created through       Alfrey's long association       with British landscape art, its practitioners and gallerists, and the AHRC       Network.
The ensuing       dialogue cut across assumptions about historical and contemporary       practice.
It also created space       for a new dialogue and sharing of knowledge between generations.
The network also led to ideas being shared across different         professional boundaries through       interaction between these artists, art historians, museum and gallery       curators, publishers and       writers.
These came from a range of organizations including universities,       museums, commercial       galleries and small presses (5.1, 5.7).
Amongst them were participants       from Tate Britain (Andrew       Wilson); the Henry Moore Institute and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park (Jon       Wood); galleries in the       private sector, notably the Haunch of Venison (Ben Tufnell) as well as       independent critics and       writers such as Patrick Eyres (Managing Editor and publisher, New Arcadian       Press).
Many of these       meetings involved presentations by participants or invited keynote       speakers (5.1, 5.7).
Crucially,       installations of work by new and emerging artists such as Susan Collins,       Simon Faithfull and       Rebecca Birch, who were not themselves part of the Network, were       arranged and discussed       through its activities (5.1).
Alfrey has made British Land Art accessible to a range of audiences         beyond a specialist art         historical community through public programme activity:            Amongst the activities generated by Earth-Moon-Earth in 2009         (attendance of 3,000) was a         'Space Week' involving local primary and secondary schools as well as         staff from the science         departments at the university of Nottingham (5.8).
The total number of         school children         attending was 288 with 35 adults (5.8).
The activities were seen as         crucial in the way the         university connects to the regional community.
The 're-performance' by the Network of a seminal film made in 1969 by         David Lamelas at the         Camden Arts Centre (not ticketed) and at the National Film Theatre         (ticketed), made this         material accessible to core members of these institutions' audiences         (5.2).
Feedback from the Re-visiting Land Art Symposium held at the         University of Southampton (11         May 2013), described how many participants had been stimulated to find         out more about Land         Art, and to think about issues to do with the environment (5.9).
After seeing the exhibition, feedback from an Adult Study Day at Uncommon           Ground on 20         July 2013 changed the way some participants thought about Land Art, and         helped them         recognise an identifiable British Land Art (5.9).
One respondent         wrote that the experience had         "provoked participation among participants.
It has also made me start         thinking about the use of         imagination in the changes to landscape and urban settings" (5.9).
Arts Council investment in Uncommon Ground, and its decision to       let the exhibition be staged first       in Southampton, is evidence that Alfrey has contributed to the decision by       a major national       institution to promote Land Art as part of its exhibition strategy       (5.10) Furthermore, the       exhibition is part of a revival of Southampton Art Gallery and recognition       of its outstanding       collection of Land Art.
The Education Pack created by the Arts Council for       the exhibition (5.11)       shows its commitment to the value of this material for a wide audience.
In       addition, the exhibition       complements the Arts Council's historic promotion of Land Art in its own       collection, as described in       the catalogue (3.3, pp.
108-109).
The decision of the John Hansard Gallery       at the University of       Southampton to present the exhibition Robert Smithson and Nancy Holt:         England and Wales 1969       (10 May-17 August 2013) alongside the exhibition at the City Art Gallery,       suggests the ripple effect       of Alfrey's and Sleeman's work (5.9).
