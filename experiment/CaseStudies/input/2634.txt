     The research on CHP and tri-generation with CO2 refrigeration       system over the last 12 years       has developed technologies, design and simulation models for sizing and       optimum integration of       the technologies for maximum performance and energy utilisation       efficiency.
The projects       involved more than 25 industrial partners, ensuring fast commercial       exploitation and       dissemination of the research results.
Major supermarkets in the UK such       as Marks and       Spencer, Sainsbury's and Tesco have quickly responded to the environmental       and economic       benefits of the technologies.
Subsequently, they have embedded the       installation of the CHP and       tri-generation with CO2 refrigeration system into their       business strategies.
The industrial partner, GEA Searle, has introduced and supplied the CO2       refrigeration system to       Marks and Spencer.
Marks and Spencer's Plan A (2010-2015) commits it to       addressing its       environmental impacts.
One of its key objectives is to reduce carbon       emissions from       refrigeration: it aims to reduce carbon emissions from store refrigeration       by 50% by 2015; to use       the CO2 refrigeration systems in all new store refrigeration       installations from 2010; and to       replace HCFCs by 2014 and HFCs by 2030 (Objective 10.15 Store       Refrigeration, Marks and       Spencer Plan A).
In its 2013 business review report, Marks and Spencer       states that compared       to a baseline of 129,000 tonnes in 2006/7, emissions were down by 20% in       2010/11, by 46% in       2011/12, and by 60% in 2013 (at 51,000 tonnes).
The total financial saving       in CO2 emissions       from 2010 to 2013 only is equivalent to over &#163;4 million.
Allowing for       increases in store footage,       emissions were down by 31% in 2010/11 and 54% at 4.3tCO2e/1000       sq ft in 2011/12 from       9.4tCO2e/1000 sq ft in 2006/7.
The number of stores using the       CO2 refrigeration systems was       increased from 28 in 2011 to 49 in 2012.
[A-1, A-2, A-3]     Similarly, the collaborative research projects with Bond Retail Services       Ltd and Hauser have led       to the installation of CO2 refrigerated cabinets in       Sainsbury's.
Sainsbury's aims to switch to the       CO2 refrigeration system in 250 stores by 2014.
160 stores (as       of 2013) have the new CO2       refrigeration system and all new stores are fitted with the CO2       refrigeration system as standard.
Sainsbury's expects that this could `save over 70,000 tonnes of CO2       compared to [its] current       refrigerated trailer fleet'.
[B-1] This is equivalent to over a &#163;3.6       million saving.
Reflecting this       commitment, in 2012 Sainsbury's provided `hands-on' training for around       200 refrigeration       service engineers so that they became familiar with the CO2       refrigeration system.
[B-2]     Tesco, in collaboration with the Carbon Trust Standard and Brunel,       developed the CHP and tri-       generation with CO2 refrigeration system with the aim of saving       over 10,000 tonnes of carbon       footprint.
[C] It installed the CHP and tri-generation with CO2       refrigeration system in its first       `environmental store' in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, which opened in Jan       2009.
Tesco states       that `the 52,000 sq ft store has a carbon footprint 70% smaller than       stores built in 2006'.
In       addition to the sustainable construction features of the store, Tesco       acknowledges that the CHP       plant alone has reduced the carbon footrpint of the store by a third and       the CO2 refrigeration       system by a fifth.
[D-1] This store was followed by the Ramsey store in       Cambridgeshire, the       world's first zero carbon supermarket, which also exploited the same CHP       and tri-generation       with CO2 refrigeration technologies.
