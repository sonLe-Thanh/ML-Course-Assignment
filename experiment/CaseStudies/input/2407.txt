     In the UK alone, three-quarters of men in the 35-65 age range are       overweight; a third of these are obese.
The UK government estimates that       weight problems already cost the UK &#163;1.6 billion per year, but that this       could rise to &#163;50 billion per year by 2050, with men classed as obese       rising from 25% to 60%.
Obese people who lose just 5-10% of their body       weight can significantly reduce their risk of ill health.
Football         Fans in Training (FFIT) was developed in response to the fact that       overweight and obese men are notoriously difficult to engage in weight       management programmes.
Between 2010 and 2013, the FFIT programme has       successfully helped around 2000 obese or overweight men, and has had       local, national and international impact.
Improved health and wellbeing       Men taking part in the feasibility study lost an average of 5.0kg (or       4.6%) of their body weight over the course of the programme.
Almost half       of participants (45.5%) achieved the weight loss target (5-10%) that has       been shown to reduce obesity-related health risks, and many (39.5%)       maintained this to 12 months.
One participant explained that his personal       risk of diabetes had been reduced by his participation in FFIT:     "I knew before the course that I was overweight and... going         `doonhill' [downhill] &#8212; so that was a huge win for me."
As well as reporting increases in physical activity levels and improved       eating habits, many men taking part in FFIT experienced great improvements       in physical and mental wellbeing.
For example, one man talked about       playing with his young children:     "It's just quality time that I didn't have, because I didn't have a         life, you know, [I was] just coming home from work, working all hours,         because I never had the energy....
So it's been lifechanging for me."
The project has generated media interest locally, nationally and UK-wide.
In autumn 2011, BBC Scotland followed the progress of the men who took       part in FFIT at three clubs: Celtic, Dunfermline Athletic and St Johnstone       FCs.
The resultant TV documentary was broadcast on BBC2 on 19th       February 2012 at 18.45, publicising the programme to a wide audience.
It       generated a waiting list of 226 men to take part in FFIT (in August 2012),       and led to additional interest from other organisations (see below).
Influenced practice leading to improved services       The research team has worked closely with the Scottish Premier League       (SPL) Trust (now Scottish Professional Football League [SPFL] Trust) to       keep the Scottish Government fully informed of the progress of the FFIT       project.
This collaboration has been successful in securing ongoing       funding for programme delivery, allowing the SPFL Trust to begin expanding       into other professional football clubs in Scotland.
Feedback from the       Scottish Government indicates that they particularly value the programme's       ability to engage `hard to reach' middle-aged males, as well as the       rigorous evaluation framework and firm research base provided by the       University of Glasgow expertise.
The Creating Health Team (Scottish       Government Office of the Chief Medical Officer/Public Health Directorate)       wrote:     The work is undoubtedly an area we will wish to examine as the obesity         route map is reviewed, particularly given the programme's ability to         attract equal participants across income groups.
It is also an area we         believe worthy of exploration in its use in tackling smoking and         excessive drinking where the subject group particularly amongst those at         the lower end of the socioeconomic scale continue to be difficult to         engage let alone positively affect.
A knowledge exchange seminar with NHS Adult Obesity leaders on 6th       December 2012 attracted interest from NHS Weight Management Services in       the Lothian and Grampian regions.
In a letter to the research team, the       Clinical Service Lead of Lothian Weight Management Service indicated his       intention to extend the programme:     We feel that FFIT could help engage some of our patients in weight         loss and lifestyle improvements in a way that has not been possible         through our standard weight management programmes... We are currently         working to secure funding for additional programmes... we hope that our         involvement with FFIT will further increase its impact by making it         available to different population groups.
Influenced policy and practice in secure institutions       Staff from Perth Prison and Carstairs State Hospital approached the       research team following the BBC broadcast to investigate adapting and       delivering FFIT to inmates, patients and shift-work employees at their       institutions.
The pilot delivery at Perth Prison began on 5 February 2013,       and Perth Prison has already reported its satisfaction with the progress       of prisoners taking part:     Many of them have started coming to the gym for the first time and are         succeeding in cutting down on some of the unhealthy snacks they can         purchase from the prison canteen.
They are also spreading word about the         benefits of FFIT to other prisoners, and we are confident that the         programme will be sustainable going forward.
(Physical Education       Instructor, Perth Prison)     Influencing wider practice nationally and internationally       FFIT has been adapted for delivery to rugby clubs in the English Premier       League and in New Zealand (RuFIT).
The new RuFIT programme began in       October 2013 in England, and the research team is collaborating with       researchers in New Zealand on a proposal for funding RuFIT programmes at       rugby clubs across New Zealand.
While the impact of RuFIT on participants       will fall outwith this assessment timeframe, the adoption of this       programme has clear impact on health policies in these clubs.
FFIT will also be adapted in a new programme to help men across Europe       improve their physical activity and reduce their sedentary time.
EuroFIT,       a &#163;5.1M research and development programme funded through FP7 funds, will       start in November and extend the FFIT model to top-flight football clubs       in the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and England.
