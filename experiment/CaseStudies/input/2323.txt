     Wilkinson's research impacts fall into two main categories: (a) targeted       interventions in       policymaking processes, which seek to influence and/or inform law and       policy; (b) public and       stakeholder engagement, which seeks to stimulate and improve the quality       of debate.
Influencing and Informing Policymaking     Since the mid-2000s, Wilkinson has sought to influence and improve       policymaking by providing       information and evidence to those involved in policy formation processes       (including but not limited       to law reform).
Some key examples are listed below.
(a) Sheldon and Wilkinson's work on `saviour siblings' influenced the Human         Fertilisation and         Embryology (HFE) Act 2008.
Research carried out between 2003 and       2009 generated novel       arguments not only for permitting what came to be known as the creation       and selection of `saviour       siblings' but also for the extension of this practice to cases in which       the recipient is not a sibling,       cases in which the tissue in question is a solid organ rather than merely       umbilical cord blood, and       cases involving non-life-threatening conditions.
As well as enabling a challenge to `conventional wisdom', this work       influenced the wording of the       HFE legislation.
One important issue debated in Parliament was whether or       not the use of `saviour       siblings' should be restricted to medical conditions which are       life-threatening or life-shortening.
Sheldon and Wilkinson submitted written evidence to the Joint Committee on       the Human Tissue       and Embryos (Draft) Bill and Lord Jenkin of Roding claimed in the House of       Lords that this was the       basis on which his committee came to its view on this matter.
He stated -       "We [the Joint       Committee] came to the conclusion that it really would be unduly       restrictive to refuse permission for       a saviour sibling to be used in those circumstances.
We based this on         the evidence of two         distinguished academics, Professor Sheldon and Professor Wilkinson.
If anyone wants to read it, it       is in their memorandum at pages 454 and 455 of the evidence" [source 1].
In addition, Sheldon       and Wilkinson's evidence is discussed alongside that of the Human       Fertilisation and Embryology       Authority [HFEA] in the written report of the Joint Committee on the Human       Tissue and Embryos       (Draft) Bill [source 2].
(b) Wilkinson submitted written evidence (based on his earlier research       on selective reproduction)       to the July 2013 Parliamentary Inquiry into Abortion on the Grounds of         Disability [source 3].
He is mentioned eight times in the report.
(c) Wilkinson is mentioned six times in the Nuffield Council on         Bioethics' high-profile 2011         report, Human Bodies donation for medicine and research       [source 4].
Wilkinson (2003) is       favourably cited, and the Nuffield Council testify that Wilkinson provided       thoughtful and challenging       critiques of the draft ethics chapters, leading to the Working Party       re-working and/or strengthening       the arguments made.
(d) Wilkinson's research on the ethics of organ donation and sale led to       membership of the Ethical         Advisory Sub-Group of the Organ Donation Task Force (established by       the Department of       Health).
The remit of this group was to advise the main Task Force on the       ethical bases of different       consent systems and the ethical acceptability of different systems.
The       work of the Sub-Group was       reported in the Organ Donation Task Force's report: The Potential         Impact of an Opt Out System for         Organ Donation in the UK (November 2008).
(e) In 2012, Wilkinson acted as the `ethics expert' at a public dialogue       event in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,       organised for the HFEA by Dialogue by Design, a consultancy that       specialises in running       public and stakeholder engagement processes.
The consultation in question       was entitled Medical         Frontiers: debating mitochondrial replacement, which the HFEA ran on       behalf of the UK       government.
His role included giving three short talks on the ethical       questions, and being on hand       to help members of the public understand particular issues.
These events       eventually fed into the       HFEA's 2013 policy recommendations on mitochondrial replacement, which       have been broadly       accepted by the UK government.
Stimulating and Improving Debate     Wilkinson's work on `social' sex selection stimulated debate amongst the       public and stakeholders       and has enabled improved public understanding via a series of appearances       in popular news       media.
The key findings of this work were widely reported in the media and       were made available       via short pieces on the BBC News and This is Staffordshire       websites.
In 2010, these pieces in turn       led to considerable media interest with interviews given to more than ten       UK local radio stations, as       well as to BBC Radio 5 Live, the World Service, LBC, BBC Radio Scotland,       the BBC TV News       Channel, and BBC 1 TV's The One Show which at that time had an       audience of around four million       viewers.
He also appeared on a 30-minute panel discussion on Voice of       Russia Radio in 2010 to       discuss Sex Selection.
In 2011-12, Wilkinson held a Wellcome Trust Dissemination Award       (&#163;34,000).
This grant funded       the following activities:     (a) Two stakeholder engagement seminars (2011).
Participants       included representatives or       members of the following groups: (a) Activist, Campaigning, or Educational       Organisations with       special interests in genetic and reproductive technologies (e.g.
Genewatch, Human Genetics Alert,       ProChoice Forum, Progress Educational Trust); (b) Health Care       Professionals (and allied       Researchers) especially those in Reproductive Medicine; (c) Policy and       Regulatory Bodies with       remits or interests in genetic and reproductive technologies (e.g.
HFEA,       Nuffield Council on       Bioethics); and (d) Stakeholder Organisations representing people with       disabilities, people with       particular genetic disorders, or actual/prospective recipients of       infertility treatment services.
(b) The creation of a set of accessible and freely available         dissemination essays (2013).
On       3rd July 2013, four dissemination essays by Wilkinson and Garrard were       published by Keele       University under the collective title Eugenics and the Ethics of         Selective Reproduction [source 5],       and released in hard and electronic copy.
Written for a public audience,       they have enabled       dissemination of Wilkinson's research to hundreds of people in the NHS and       organisations       interested in these ethical debates, such as Progress Educational Trust       who are using the essays       as a source of information in their work promoting ethically sound       research and practice in relation       to genetics.
The ideas articulated in the essays have also been disseminated to the       public through the media:     (a) The essays gained significant and detailed coverage in the international         media in July 2013       including in The Independent (2 page article and front page       banner) [source 6] (78 reader       comments in July 2013) to which The Guardian wrote a response       piece [source 7], and which led       to a debate on Mumsnet with 423 comments in July 2013 [source 8];       The Telegraph (20 reader       comments in July 2013); and Arab Emirates' Top News.
It was picked       up internationally on-line and       through syndication in Canada, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain, UAE, and       Vietnam (for       example an article was published on Vietnamese Health and Parenting       Website kien thu'c phu nu       on 11th July 2013 [source 9]).
There was also extensive       coverage in specialist medical publications       including: Medical Xpress; The British Medical Journal;       and by the PGH Foundation.
On 3rd July       2013 Wilkinson participated in radio interviews and debates about the       issues raised in the essays       on several BBC radio stations, including: Radio 4 Today, Radio       London, 5live, and the World       Service.
(b) Blog/Online Publications.
The publication of Eugenics and         the Ethics of Selective         Reproduction also led to requests for Wilkinson to write blog posts       and online articles.
Wilkinson       wrote pieces for ETHOX [source 10], the Wellcome Trust Blog,       and Bionews, which has 18,000       readers per week.
These outlets aim to improve ethical standards,       supporting health professionals       and general education of the public.
