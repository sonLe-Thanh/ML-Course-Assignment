     The research carried out at Portsmouth has impacted on the development       and validation of a new generation of nickel-based superalloys via a power       metallurgy route, including U720Li and RR1000, which have since been used       in Rolls-Royce engines including Trent 500, 900, 1000; BR 700, 710 and       725.
The new materials have allowed engines to operate at higher       temperatures compared with those using traditional wrought alloys, with       significant reduction of CO2 emission as well as much improved       structural integrity of fracture-critical turbine discs.
High-pressure turbine discs in gas turbines are one of the key components       that dictate the overall efficiency of an engine.
To achieve reduced CO2       emmission, a higher overall engine efficiency is required by operating the       engine with a hotter, more thermodynamically efficient cycle.
This       requires the use of new materials with better capabilities to resist       creep, fatigue and oxidation at higher operational temperatures.
New       material development requires fundamental research so that their       mechanical performance is fully evaluated under simulated service       conditions.
The MBM lab at Portsmouth is one of the RR-approved centres       for new material research and validation work, due to our unique       specialist testing facilities developed in-house, which allow       well-controlled testing conditions and much-reduced test durations and       increased data generation per test piece, which otherwise not possible       with conventional methods.
For research on fine grain RR1000 and U720Li,       work at Portsmouth has provided the first set of systematic       results on the effects of load ratio and loading waveform on crack growth       rates [1] and, identified, for the first time, the failure       mechanisms in time-independent/dependent regimes [1, 2].
These, together       with the concerted efforts of alloy development (Cambridge University) and       microstructure characterisation (University of Southampton), have given       confidence to RR in adopting the new materials in their disc         production.
For coarse grain RR1000 investigated in the DISPLACE       programme, we extended our detailed constitutive model [3] to cover the entire         range of operational and limit temperatures and developed a fatigue-creep-oxidation         model [6; Karabela1] which enabled the       prediction of crack growth rate considering the coupling effects of all       three factors for the first time.
Together with the University of       Birmingham on the optimisation of material variables to minimise crack       growth; Serco on testing under combined thermo-mechanical testing and       ZenCrack on developing commercial finite element software for life       prediction of crack growth under simulated flight cycles, we successfully       delivered the project, with a direct impact on the RR in-house lifing         and materials development programme towards the certification of the         material, which paved the way for its use in the latest RR engines.
RR has confirmed that the new material and lifing technology developed       will be used for Trent XWB-1000 engines; and also in new engine projects       and up-rated versions of the Trent 900 and 1000 for Airbus A380 and Boeing       787.
It has also a retrofit capability into the current high by-pass       turbofan engine fleet, thus increasing the potential impact further.
These       represent a &#163;1.2 billion per year market opportunity to the UK       aerospace industry.
A 1% specific fuel consumption (sfc) saving in these       products equates to 350kg less fuel used per engine per trans-Atlantic       flight.
This reduces the cost of ownership by approximately &#163;100,000         per engine per year.
The indirect benefits of this include reduced         travel costs due to reduced fuel consumption; increased economic         competitiveness of UK airlines in the world market and expansion of       employment opportunities in associated UK industries.
There are direct         economic benefits to end-users in reduced operating costs, which for       the above example are estimated to be &#163;200,000 per year.
The use       of the technology will also provide a sustainability benefit       through the extended use of components.
It is anticipated that the temperature capability of the engines will be       improved by approximately 30&#186;C as a result of the new material solution       from DISPLACE.
This equates to a reduction in sfc, which for the designs       considered is estimated at 0.3% improvement.
For a large twin-engined       aircraft flying from London to New York, a 0.3% sfc saving equates to a       700 kg reduction in fuel consumption, which translates into a reduction         of ~ 2.25 tonnes of CO2 emissions per flight.
RR engines introduced in 2012 onwards offer improved emissions and engine       efficiency over current designs as a result of this new material solution,       thus a significant step towards the ACARE industry goals for 2050 of a 50%       reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometre.
