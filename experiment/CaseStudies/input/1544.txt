     As noted above, much of the impact of the research comes from the       practical application of the Content Sophistication process in empirical       settings.
Its application allows general ontological patterns to be       developed that, in turn, improve the application of BORO in subsequent       empirical settings.
So, application provides model-based solutions to       specific areas from one perspective, but in the background develops more       general patterns that are applicable both within and across domains of       application.
Products, for example, might be a model applicable within a       given context (e.g., a Unisys banking system).
Naming or geo-political       regions (instances of which were developed through the research undertaken       at Brunel) are examples of patterns that are cross-domain.
Four interconnected areas of impact arising from the research are       detailed below, along with evidence/indicators of the significance and       reach of each impact area:            At Shell Oil (see corroborating source S1) the evolved BORO         approach resulting from the Brunel research was applied to conceptual         modelling of the downstream oil and gas production process between 2006         and 2008 (including follow-on work to assess and support the integration         of several local SAP instances into a global instance).
The significance         of the work was in the provision of a reference model for Shell covering         the Global downstream business (from oil tanker through refinery to         petrol pump).
Test application projects based on the reference model         showed a good level of reuse, providing time and cost savings on those         projects.
The reach of the work is evidenced in the standardisation of         asset data in the oil and gas industries &#8212; the 4-dimensional aspects of         the model are core to ISO15926 (see corroborating source S1).
It is         estimated that use of the downstream model allowed Shell to         reduce the cost of development by at least 50% ($1m).
The underpinning research had an impact on ISO 15926, a         standard for data integration, sharing, exchange and hand-over between         computer systems (see corroborating source S1).
The impact is primarily         through the standards adoption of 4D (perdurantist) data modelling,         stemming significantly from the practical application of the outcomes of         the Brunel research in the Oil and Gas industry (e.g., at Shell).
Work         in relation to ISO 15926 was carried out across the period 1994 to 2006;         the standard has been in place across the eligible period 1.1.2008 to         31.7.2013.
The underpinning research has had an impact on the work of the International           Defence Enterprise for Exchange Group (IDEAS) (see corroborating         source S2), which provides a data exchange format for military         Enterprise Architectures.
Again, the influence is through the adoption         of 4D data modelling, though the group is also explicit publicly in its         adoption of BORO as the means of ontology development.
Work in relation         to IDEAS started in 2006 and has been used as a semantic extension for         the Ministry of Defence and U.S. Department of Defense Architecture         Framework (MoDAF and DoDAF) (see corroborating source S3).
MODEM (MODAF Ontological Data Exchange Model) is the most         current foundational framework for enterprise architecture, providing a         common way to plan and organise information about structures, behaviour         and capability.
The ontological data exchange mechanism is based on         IDEAS so, again, the use of BORO is explicit in these frameworks,         representing a global impact in the defence area.
Development is being         led by the Swedish Armed Forces (with the MoD, DoD and Canadian Defense         force participating), who propose benefits in terms of improved         operational capability for collaborating forces, greatly reduced         maintenance costs and increased choice and quality of tooling         environments (see corroborating source S4).
