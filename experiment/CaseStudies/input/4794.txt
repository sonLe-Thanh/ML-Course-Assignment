     TB is a major health problem, with 9.4 million new cases and 1.7 million       deaths in 2009 [a].
WHO guidelines issued in 2003 [b]       recommended a regimen of daily ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and       pyrazinamide for 2 months, followed by ethambutol and isoniazid for 6       months (2EHRZ/6HE) as one of the category 1 regimens for the treatment of       drug sensitive M Tuberculosis.
However, that regimen had not been       evaluated in a randomised controlled trial.
Study A found that this       regimen was clearly inferior to a regimen with the same 2-month intensive       phase, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin.
The results of Study A were published in 2004.
It took several years for       the results of the research to change international guidelines, perhaps       partly because the results were disappointing to international agencies,       who would have preferred not to use rifampicin after the initial intensive       phase of treatment because of the risk of acquired resistance to this drug       in patients who failed treatment.
However, eventually the results did       begin to influence international policy, as they provided evidence that       filled an important gap in knowledge of how to treat TB.
In 2006 the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care cited the Study       A results [c], and recommended 2EHRZ/4HR as the preferred       treatment regimen, but that 2EHRZ/6HE could be used where adherence       through the continuation phase cannot be assessed.
It was considered to be       of particular relevance for the developing world, where the majority of       people with active TB live.
Study A was included in an influential 2009 meta analysis, which said "The         most important finding of this review is that all three treatment         outcomes were significantly worse with regimens that used rifampin for         the first 1-2 mo rather than throughout therapy.
This finding adds         considerable weight to similar findings by Jindani and colleagues, who         compared regimens containing 2 mo versus 6 mo of rifampin" [d].
Eventually, in 2010, the WHO guidelines were updated in a periodic review       [e].
This involved carrying out a systematic review of the       evidence, which included the results from Study A, which were graded as       the most convincing of the available evidence.
One of the principal       investigators of the trial (Professor Andrew Nunn) was a member of the       expert advisory group which helped to develop the new guidelines.
The new       WHO guidelines included the recommendation that "New patients with         pulmonary TB should receive a regimen containing 6 months of rifampicin:         2EHRZ/4HR".
Indeed, the foreword states the importance of this       change: "The World Health Organization's Stop TB Department has         prepared this fourth edition of Treatment of tuberculosis: guidelines,         adhering fully to the new WHO process for evidence-based guidelines.
Several important recommendations are being promoted in this new         edition.
First, the recommendation to discontinue the regimen based on just 2         months of rifampicin (2HRZE/6HE) and change to the regimen based on a         full 6 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/4HR) will reduce the number of         relapses and failures.
This will alleviate patient suffering resulting         from a second episode of tuberculosis (TB) and conserve patient and         programme resources."
WHO guidelines are very influential for national TB policy, particularly       in African countries, which face a high burden of TB.
A survey of national       tuberculosis policymakers found that WHO was an important and frequent       source of information to inform TB policymaking in Africa.
This means that       the WHO recommendation, based on Study A, has influenced which TB       treatment regimens are used in many countries.
National guidelines for TB       have been updated to refect the new treatment regimes including Ethiopia,       South Africa, and Zimbabwe [f].
Routine data collected by WHO       shows that in 2011, 196 out of 206 countries reported using the 6 month       regimen with rifampicin throughout for new TB patients.
The number of new       TB cases (excluding multi-drug resistant TB) in these 196 countries       totalled 7,883,245 in 2011, so the results of Study A have had a       wide-reaching impact (although it should be noted that not all of these       countries were previously using the 8 month regimen) [g].
From the perspective of these eight million patients, the 2EHRZ/4HR has       several benefits over the previous 8-month regimen.
As well as reducing       the number of people who have unfavourable outcomes and require       retreatment, it also reduces the inconvenience of attending for treatment       (whether fully supervised or not) and reduced the time in which they were       exposed to toxic drugs.
National Ministries of Health have benefited from the research, as the       2EHRZ/4HR patient kit is US$ 4-10 less expensive than the 2EHRZ/6HE       patient kit [d].
Reducing the number of people requiring       retreatment also reduces costs.
This allows more people to be treated with       the available (limited) resources.
It is difficult to determine the exact impact Study A's finding have had       in reducing unfavourable outcomes.
However if we assume that the reduction       of relapses and treatment failures is the same in real life as in the       trial, and that around 7.9 million people were treated with the 2EHRZ/4HR       regimen in 2011, then the impact of Study A in that year alone was to       prevent over 400,000 relapses and failures, compared to if those people       had been treated with the eight month regimen.
However, the actual number       of relapses prevented directly due to Study A is likely to be lower than       this, as not all countries were previously using the 8 month regimen, and       some of those countries that did change may have done so for other       reasons.
