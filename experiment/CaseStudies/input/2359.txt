     Research by Jackson and colleagues led to the development of novel       therapies and approaches to treatment for cancer and to the spin-out       company KuDOS Pharmaceuticals, acquired by AstraZeneca in 2010.
This has       subsequently had a large impact on health and commerce in several ways;     Impact on Health; novel therapeutics     1) PARP inhibitors; Olaparib, originally developed by KuDOS       Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Ku-0059436), since acquired by AstraZeneca (AZD2281)       has been used in over 30 Phase 1/2 clinical trials [ref 1] (either       on-going or completed since 2008, over 20 of which started after 2008).
These have targeted a range of cancers including; breast, ovarian,       colorectal, lung, pancreatic and gastric cancer.
Most recently (June 2013)       olaparib was approved for a Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT01844986) for the       management of BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer [ref 2].
2) m-TOR inhibitors; Jackson's work screening small libraries of       compounds targeting various related kinases; m-TOR, ATM and DNA-PK,       directly led to KuDOS Pharmaceuticals and AstraZeneca developing two m-TOR       inhibitors as cancer therapeutics; AZD8055 (now in Phase 1 clinical       trials; NCT00731263, NCT00999882, NCT00973076 sponsored by AZ and       NCT01316809 sponsored by NCI) [ref 3] and AZD2014 (which has reached Phase       1 (NCT01026402, NCT01597388) and Phase 2 (NCT01793636) trials) [ref 4].
3) AstraZeneca also have an ATR inhibitor; AZ20 in pre-clinical       development.
This has anti-tumour activity in vivo [ref 5] and is expected       to enter Phase 1 clinical trials in the near future.
Impact on Commerce; new business/ spin-out company established       KuDOS Pharmaceuticals was founded by Jackson in 1997 (seed-funded),       received its first venture capital funding in 1999 and was acquired by       AstraZeneca for $210 million in 2006.
It remained semi-autonomous until       2010 when its programmes were transferred entirely into AstraZeneca [Ref       6].
At the time of acquisition, KuDOS had expanded to 75 employees.
MISSION       Therapeutics Ltd (a private drug discovery company in Cambridge) was       founded by Jackson in 2011 in order to develop small molecule drugs that       target deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) involved in the DNA damage       response, with the aim of inducing synthetic lethality, to selectively       kill specific tumour cells.
In 2011 the company raised &#163;6 million in       Series A funding from a strong venture capital syndicate led by Sofinnova       Partners, and comprising Imperial Innovations, SR One and Roche Venture       Fund.
MISSION was recently (February 2013) granted a Biomedical       Catalyst Feasibility Award by the Technology Strategy Board (&#163;144,000) to       support the identification of DUBs required for the survival of       drug-resistant ovarian cancers.
MISSION currently has 19 employees       and funds over 30 FTE posts at various clinical research organisations in       the UK and beyond.
Impact on Commerce; new products commercialised       A number of compounds developed by KuDOS as a result of Jackson's work       have been sold by agreement (initial agreement with either KuDOS or       AstraZeneca) for research purposes and continue to be sold and /       distributed by Tocris Cookson (i.e.
; the m-Tor inhibitor Ku-0063794, the       ATM inhibitors Ku-55933 and Ku-60019 and the selective DNA-PK inhibitors       Nu-7441 and NU7026 developed at Newcastle University in collaboration with       KuDOS.)
[Ref 7].
Ku-0063794 is also widely distributed by several       providers of compounds for medical research including; Sigma- Aldrich,       Caymen Chemicals, Stemgent, Stratech, Selleckchem.
Impact on Commerce; a new approach has been adopted by the         pharmaceutical industry       Jackson's pioneering approach of "synthetic lethality", as a means of       specifically targeting tumour cells, was recognised by researchers in the       field as leading cancer therapy in a "new direction".
Alongside the       publication of the Phase 1 study (NCT00516373) of olaparib in patients       with BRCA mutations (Fong et al.
2009, NEJM; 3 KuDOS-based co-authors), an       accompanying article (Inglehart and Silver 2009, NEJM) highlighted the       importance of this early phase trial, based on its novel approach [Ref 8].
The approach of synthetic lethality and targeting DDR pathways in general,       has been widely adopted by pharmaceutical companies seeking to develop       their own PARP, DNA-PK, ATM and ATR inhibitors (for recent review with       examples of compounds in pre- clinical and clinical development see Ref       9), which now include a number of dual-specificity inhibitors that target       several aspects of the DNA repair pathway.
For example, Celgene       Corporation have developed a dual DNA-PK and TOR inhibitor; CC-115 that is       about to enter Phase 1 clinical trials (NCT01353625) [Ref 10].
Astra       Zeneca have invested in excess of &#163;50M in the area of DNA repair since the       acquisition of KuDOS [Ref 11].
Impact on public awareness       Steve Jackson has engaged with the charity Cancer Research UK to increase       public understanding of the process of DNA repair and its links with       cancer and the progress being made in his lab (for example see interview       in 2011; Ref 12).
