     The following impacts arose during the period January 2008 to July 2013:     Impact 1: Influencing the teaching and practice of short story writing     The impact of Cox's research in the short story is felt in the       writing and publishing community, both within and beyond academia.
The       central theme of Cox's critical and scholarly research on short       fiction is temporality: the modern and contemporary short story genre has       the particular quality of engaging with the passing moment, and       representing identity and experience in relation to the present moment.
Two key texts by Cox, Writing Short Stories (Routledge,       2005) and Teaching the Short Story (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011),       build on the discoveries of this research and help to transmit them       accessibly to lay readers, teachers of writing, and to other professional       writers.
The critical emphases of Cox's research therefore inform       the increasing practice of short fiction in the Anglophone world on a       number of levels.
Cox's book Writing Short Stories is       particularly well known amongst writers outside as well as inside higher       education.
For instance, it is required reading for the University of       Exeter's Continuing Education course, `The Art of the Short Story', and       also features on the BBC's `Get Writing' site (Other Source 1, Section       Five).
As one example, an author/ lecturer at another university confirms       recommendation of this work to Creative Writing students (Factual       Statement 2).
Paul March-Russell's book, The Short Story: An         Introduction, cites Cox's book Writing Short Stories       as `the best guide to writing short stories, due to its engagement with       both theory and practice' (Other Source 2).
Sales figures from Writing         Short Stories indicate considerable international currency and       influence for a book in this context: 6,150 to 30/04/13.
Impact 2: Making a significant and distinctive contribution to the         renewal of interest in, and vitality of, the short story as a genre     In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the short story as a       genre of fiction.
This has been marked by increased attention to and       appreciation of the short story amongst literary critics and readers.
This       renewal may be attributed to many different factors (including the       emergence of new publication channels and business/ distribution models       enabled by technology), and to the work and influence of many different       people and organisations.
Within this context, the work of Cox has       made a significant and distinctive contribution, as set out below.
Drawing on her longstanding interest, creative practice and critical       work, Cox founded the annual Edge Hill Short Story Prize in order       to champion the genre.
The Prize, which has been awarded annually since       2008, is sponsored by the University and is open to British and Irish       writers of short story collections first published in English.
Entry is       through submission by publishers.
The short story has traditionally been undervalued, sometimes regarded as       inferior creatively to the novel and unattractive commercially.
Prizes       play an important role in changing perceptions of the form, garnering       attention and enhancing appreciation of its challenges and possibilities.
They can increase demand from readers and demonstrate to publishers that       short stories, particularly when published as collections, merit       investment and more active promotion.
A number of authors, publishers and       editors were interviewed as part of the preparation of this case study.
Each noted the contribution that the Prize has made in helping to raise       the profile of the short story as a genre.
One publisher (Factual       Statement 3) noted that "The Prize validates the form/genre and         stimulates discussion and debate within the national press and amongst         the writers themselves."
Factual statements 1, 2, 4 and 5 support       this view.
The writer A.L.
Kennedy set out the distinctive challenges and rewards of       short story writing and reading and the marketing barriers affecting the       genre, as well as the benefits of the Edge Hill Prize in an article for The         Independent, stating "And now, after the terrifying and         counterproductive efforts to "save" the short story, we have the Edge         Hill Prize, an annual award of &#163;5,000 to the author of the year's best         collection of short fiction.
No gimmicks, no tricks, just respect for         the form, the authors who are trying to work with it and the readers who         still love it.
I'm proud to be one of the judges in this, its inaugural         year".
(Other Source 3)     In light of challenges facing the short story genre, the sustained       support for it given by the Prize (awarded every year since 2008) is       valued by authors and publishers, particularly smaller independents who       specialise in (or devote a relatively high proportion of output to) the       short story.
As one publisher notes, "To compete with the novel and         other forms of literature, the short story genre more than ever requires         continuity.
An annual prize provides that and provides the sense of         validation required".
This sustained presence has enabled the Prize       to increase its profile and publishers to incorporate it into promotional       strategies.
As one editor (Factual Statement 5) notes, "It takes time         for any award to become established and the Edge Hill Prize is now an         annual staple of the industry".
The increased profile of the Prize       and the wider growth in short story publication is reflected in growth in       the volume of entries for the Prize, the range of publishers submitting       entries and the profile of authors entered.
There was a total of 21       entries in 2008.
While only 10 were submitted in 2009, this increased to       18 in 2010 and 20 in 2011, rising to 31 in 2012 and 38 in 2013.
Winners       since 2008 have been Clare Keegan, Chris Beckett, Jeremy Dyson, Graham       Mort, Sarah Hall and Kevin Barry.
Mainstream publishers such as Random       House, Bloomsbury, Macmillan and Faber now regularly submit entries.
Cox's contribution to the renewal of interest in and vitality of       the short story genre through the Edge Hill Short Story Prize has been       distinctive in two ways.
Firstly, drawing directly on her research       insights into the dynamic potential of the short story form when stories       are published together in a single author collection, the Prize is the       only one for a single author collection.
Authors, publishers and editors       interviewed for this case study stated the distinct benefits of a prize       for short story collections rather than individual stories.
One (Factual       Statement 5) notes that the Edge Hill Prize is ..."the only short story         prize that focuses on a collection, I believe this possibly validates         the genre more than the other prizes".
Secondly, unlike other prizes       for work in the short story genre, the Edge Hill prize is for collections       by new British and Irish authors.
This contrasts with and complements the       Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award for short story collections       which is open to all writers (new and established) from across the world.
The focus of the Edge Hill Short Story Prize enables new writers from the       British Isles to gain the attention of readers, publishers and critics.
The publication of the longlist and the shortlist for the Prize, and its       award, each create opportunities for the validation, promotion, and       recognition of new British and Irish talent.
By focusing on short story collections from new British and Irish writers       the Prize has helped to generate benefits for authors and publishers,       including:             Increased profile often has an impact on the sales of shortlisted           books.
Sales of short story collections are relatively low but         within this context the Prize has had a noted impact.
One independent         publisher (Factual Statement 3) specialising in short stories reported         that being shortlisted always results in a modest rise in sales.
Another         independent, focused on short story anthologies by emerging writers,         reported that a winning collection they had entered had, to date,         exceeded sales volume expectations by a factor of eight (4,000 rather         500) and continues to sell strongly, attributing this to the Prize         (Factual Statement 4).
An author and editor (Factual Statement 1)         interviewed for this case study reports the positive impact that the         Edge Hill Prize has on the careers of individual British authors.
Publishers are more interested in short story collections: An         independent publisher (Factual Statement 4) comments that "authors           are not afraid to go to major publishers with short stories anymore,           practices and policies have changed".
A shortlisted author         (Factual Statement 2) adds that: "In the past, it was kind of a           golden rule that you couldn't go to a publisher with a collection of           short stories, it had to be a novel.
This has changed and this change           of perceptions is down to the work of people such as Ailsa".
Recognition through the Prize has a positive impact on the careers           of authors: One shortlisted author (Factual Statement 2) reports         that "the Edge Hill prize, however, focuses on new writers and this           provides a highly significant service for the genre and for those           individuals wishing to get established".
An independent publisher         reports the impact that winning the Prize had on the career of one of         his authors, noting "he now has a couple of book deals off the back of         the Prize" and that this can be attributed to his involvement with the         Edge Hill Prize (Factual Statement 4).
Increased profile within the publishing industry and related           creative fields can bring work to the attention of dramatists.
For         example, an author shortlisted for the Prize in 2013 confirms that this         put the work in the public eye and contributed to one of the stories in         the collection being dramatized for television (Factual Statement 2).
The prize also promotes the reading of short stories, particularly       through the Readers' Prize, initiated in 2008.
For the first two years,       this was judged by reading groups run by the Get Into Reading       project, which works with a range of local groups, including recovering       substance abusers, young homeless men and isolated single parents.
In       2010-11, the Readers' Choice was judged by sixth-form students; and in       2012, 2013, by undergraduate students.
Both the prize and the underpinning research increase public awareness of       the specificity of the short story writing, and the interconnections       between reading, writing and publishing.
Its role in promoting the careers       of short story authors has been recognized in media coverage (Other Source       4).
There were 1007 comments on Louise Doughty's Daily Telegraph       Short Story Club when she mentioned the unique status of the prize as an       award for a whole collection (Other Source 5).
Video footage from the 2011       award ceremony shows a range of authors and publishers testifying to the       significance of the prize, with one author making specific connections       with the underpinning research through the journal, Short Fiction in         Theory and Practice (Other Source 6).
