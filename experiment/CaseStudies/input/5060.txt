     The group's research has been instrumental in achieving a comprehensive       reform of UK vocational education and skills funding and organization,       both through its influence on policymakers and through direct invited       participation in policymaking.
During the period 2005-10, researchers in the group received an       increasing number of invitations to become involved in the policy-making       process.
For example, during 2007-9, Gospel became an Associate of the UK       Commission on Employment of Skills (the quango which formulates skills       policy), while Wolf was a member of the Parliamentary Skills Commission, a       cross-party group convened by MPs, and was an adviser to the Commons       Select Committee on education.
The group's research was of key importance       in establishing the need for reform of skills policy: a number of key       think tanks commissioned contributions and publications, including the       Social Market Foundation, Policy Exchange, Centre Forum and the IEA (see,       for example, Wolf, A (2009) An Adult Approach to Further Education       London: IEA 2009     http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/an-adult-approach-to-further-education       and Wolf, A (2004) `Vocational Education is not about Tackling Social       Exclusion' in Conor Ryan ed Bac or Basics: Challenges for the 14-19         Curriculum.
London: Social Market Foundation).
Members enjoyed frequent direct contact with policy makers.
For example,       at the launch of a commissioned monograph (Wolf, 2009) the discussant was       the Liberal Democrat spokesman for skills policy and participants included       the Labour chair of a parliamentary select committee and two former       Conservative ministers.
Gospel and Wolf both provided information on       relevant research findings to individual politicians and their staff in       the period before the 2010 General Election.
In September 2010, Wolf was       invited by the Secretary of State for Education to carry out a       comprehensive review of 14-19 Vocational Education because of her `extensive         research experience in education and the labour force'.
(Letter from       Michael Gove:       http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a0064330/written-ministerial-statement-on-the-wolf-review-of-vocational-education).
The Wolf Review reported in March 2011       (https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011)       and made 27 far-reaching recommendations for changes in education for       14-19 year olds.
The government announced in May 2011 that it was       accepting all the recommendations made, and invited Wolf to report to       ministers on progress on a regular basis.
This she has done, and remains       an adviser on implementation to the Department.
The following examples illustrate the very close link between the       Review's outcomes and underlying research.
Funding for 16-19 year olds to shift to a per-student basis, rather         than on the basis of each individual qualification taken; and         introduction of requirements for coherent 16-19 study programmes.
Research basis: work carried out by Wolf et al on the negative         impact on quality of per-qualification funding, including findings of a         5-year project examining publicly funded workplace-based training (eg         ESRC RES-139-25-0120: Principal Investigator, Wolf.
Rated Excellent).
Apprenticeship reforms to reduce complexity of administrative         structures.
Research basis, work on apprenticeship regulation and         inspection (Gospel and Lewis 2011).
All 16-19 year olds without C grade or above at GCSE to continue to         study Maths and English: this has also been explicitly endorsed by the         Opposition.
Research basis: analyses of lifetime returns to different         qualifications (see e.g.
Jenkins, Vignoles and Wolf (2004), and         Vignoles, De Coulon and Marcenaro-Gutierrez 2011).
Major changes to the accountability measures used for schools.
(These         had counted all `level 2' qualifications as `GCSE equivalents' for         accountability purposes and had created a strong incentive for schools         to shift students into classes leading to qualifications which had         little value in progression or labour market terms.
Research base         includes Wolf et al 2006).
In addition to the major impact of the Review, the group's research       continues to have an impact in and beyond the government departments       directly responsible for education and training (DfE and BIS).
Gospel is a       member of the BIS Growth and Innovation Fund Expert Advisory Panel.
He is       an Adviser (Sector Specialist Associate) to and Associate Fellow of the UK       Commission on Employment and Skills for whom he has recently published       commissioned work (Gospel 2012) and participates in seminar series       providing policy advice to the Ministers at the Department of Business,       Innovation and Skills.
Wolf has contributed research insights to the       government's Growth Review and strategy, through meetings at the Cabinet       Office with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of State, and BIS       Ministers, and with the Downing Street Policy Unit and H M Treasury       officials.
She regularly presents keynotes at the Association of Colleges       annual conference, the main professional gathering for the sector, (2010,       2011) and she is frequently invited to comment on education and employment       by the broadsheet press (e.g.
Guardian, Times) and BBC radio (e.g.
BBC       Radio 4 Today, PM, Any Questions).
She is a member of the BIS Academic       Panel on Skills Strategy.
