     [1] Enhancing public access to and understanding of antiquity in         silent cinema:     Wyke's research has resulted in better public access to and understanding       of silent films set in antiquity.
After close study of those that survive       in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and       Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,       with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally.
These included       screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed       on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from       Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience       c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin       Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);       Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of       Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3       (2013; audience c. 200).
Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,       introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,       which were followed by public discussion.
Audiences totalling about 1,200       people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,       students and academics from a wide variety of higher education       institutions [see 1.1 in section 5].
The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be       gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope       or Bible Films.
For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury       1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of       fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films       exhibited by a classical studies department.
The reviews also highlighted       the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these       films.
Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: "Of course, we hacks       turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250       or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,       and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery" [1.1 in section       5].
An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening       highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of       a quite diverse audience.
Sample comments included: `I found the       introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could       certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the       viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your       presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original       reception in different countries' (entertainment professional/part-time       student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's       not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the       wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'
(independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely       interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)       [see 1.2 in section 5].
[2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent         film as cultural heritage: 		This research facilitated the work of       film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and       exhibiting silent films set in antiquity.
As well as catalysing and       supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected       from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider       public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own       knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].
In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film       Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important       festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and       the general public.
Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported       by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the       confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e       progresso.
verso Quo Vadis?'.
Wyke introduced the films and the       project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival       catalogue.
This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with       Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna       in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il       fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'.
On this occasion (celebrating 100       years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?
),       Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the       discussion at three workshops held on the theme.
Wyke's research [a, b]       stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a       considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences       (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the       curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process       of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore         di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the       festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].
[3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and         sound cinema:     Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved       further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting       cultural debate on `antiquity on film'.
This was accomplished particularly       through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:         A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on       24/12/2011; 131,000 for 28/12/2011; 161,000 for 05/08/2012).
Wyke also       contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was       included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo         Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009.
The       documentary received a rating of 7.5/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie       Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide       than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the       information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section       5].
Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius       Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin       Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel       on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5].
She spoke on       Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d         Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and       provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics       in Film (2008; audience c. 190).
She also talked to a public audience       about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in       association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season       in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).
[4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in         higher education:     Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of       courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in       universities in the UK, the USA and Australia.
For example, in 2008 she       was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film       in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics       refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political       context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his       `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].
Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and       undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of       Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney.
Wyke       organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI       archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at       a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available       for research via interlibrary loan.
The Professor of Western Civilisation       &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in       a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states       that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has       created `new horizons' for both him and them.
He has also now instated a       course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's       research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5].
The Chair of       Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a       crucial part in our syllabus.
Her centrality in the field of reception       studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in       section 5].
At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in       January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American       Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek       in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new       research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their       curricula.
As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made       it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best       practice' [see 4.3 in section 5].
