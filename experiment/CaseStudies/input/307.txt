     The impact of our work covers the period 2000-post 2008, with work       completed prior to 2008 continuing to have a significant impact         afterwards in the manner explained by Doris Gisela Pack below.
Our       research helped provide those MEPS who wanted reform in the media       relations service of the Parliament with the information and analysis       necessary to propose a set of priorities for change that was both       essential and which would help change the attitudes of those many MEPS who       were indifferent to, or blocking reform.
That is an absolutely crucial       type of impact that is often missed by those unfamiliar with the mechanics       of politics &#8212; without the necessary information and analysis to       establish priorities that will help create viable reform proposals and       change attitudes, nothing can happen.
Our most significant impact       was in playing a key role in providing these crucial change-enablers.
The       evidence for that is provided by the one person with the long-term       detailed knowledge and overview of how the Parliament's media relations       work that is necessary to confirm our impact on the reform process.
She is       Doris Gisela Pack, the German chair of the Parliament's committee that       investigates and oversees its media relations.
In written evidence she has       said the following about our research, "The continuing impact of their         work can be seen down to the present day, in, for example, the high         priority that is now being given to the Parliament's audio visual         service.
Detailed interviews had been conducted throughout the then         DGIII for their 2004 article and had highlighted particularly the         failure to fund properly, staff adequately and use widely enough the         highly skilled audio visual unit within the press and information         service.
That situation has been radically transformed since the         publication of their study and its provision of MPs and officials with         analysis that was helpful in identifying priorities for improvement.
The         impact of their work can still be seen in the continuing acceptance of         the need to keep the audio visual service as a properly resourced and         appropriately used part of the Parliament's means of presenting itself         to the news media and the citizenry in general."
She has confirmed also         the continuing impact of our work on the Parliament's website and said         that, in general, the information provided by our research was         "important in helping identify the priorities for reform."
It is       from 2004-2005 onwards that significant reforms in the Parliament's press       and information services finally started to occur.
It is notable how many       of those reforms, which are continuing down to the present, correspond         directly with needs identified within the detailed findings presented in         our 2003 paper and our 2004 article (see section 2 above.
As key EU       players such as Doris Pack can confirm, the European Union is very much a       proverbial supertanker that takes some time to change direction after it       has been decided that change is required and that is one of the reasons       why the impact of our research continues to be felt significantly down to       the present.
To give just two from several examples, our findings on the       audio-visual unit's service, for example, have been followed by a       significant and still continuing upscaling of its resources and staffing       and a considerable raising of its profile, to the extent that it is now       advertised as one of the jewels in its crown by the press and information       service website.
Our criticism of the fact that too many people working       for the press and information service lacked media training also has been       addressed post-2008, as can be evidenced from the webpages of Pinnacle (www.pinnaclepr.net/), the       communications and public relations company that provided subsequent       training for the EU.
The `significance' of the impact of our work is that without it,       some of the key reforms that have modernized and made more effective the       Parliament's press and information offering would have struggled for both       priority and an adequate information base.
That is evidenced by       the Parliament's media committee chair in her confirmation above of the importance       of our work in this regard.
That in turn would seem to be the most         effective measure of our work's significance, given her unique role in         having a long-term, authoritative overview of the impact of our research         within the relevant reform process.
She has further confirmed the       work's importance by stating that, `The size and nature of the         European Parliament's electorate means that the reach'       of Anderson et al.
's work has been, by definition, on a European scale         as far as its impact on press and information policy is concerned.'
