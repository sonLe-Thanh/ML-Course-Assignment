     All projects were designed from the outset to achieve impact on policy       and practice through:            Steering committees of representatives from national and local         governments, teacher unions, Inspectorate, parents and distinguished         academics who were kept informed of emergent findings and became         advocates of the research.
Conferences (some attended by politicians and senior civil servants),         workshops, media appearances and articles in professional publications.
Munn gave interviews to BBC Scotland news and Scottish Television in         November 2009 on the results of the behaviour survey and articles         appeared in the Times Educational Supplement Scotland (eg 27/11/2009).
A strong and continuing relationship with the Government's Positive       Behaviour team has resulted from the restorative practices (RP)       evaluation.
McCluskey represents the Heads of the Schools of Education on       the Scottish Advisory Group on Behaviour in Schools.
She co-convenes, with       a senior civil servant, a new working group, representing all Scottish       HEIs, tasked with reviewing the teaching of issues of behaviour,       children's rights and health and wellbeing across initial teacher       education.
The restorative practices evaluation forged new ground in working       directly with policy-makers, key local authority personnel and schools.
An       iterative analytical process drew on quarterly meetings with stakeholders,       clarifying what they saw as valid evidence and serving to build, embed and       sustain a robust relationship between Government, local authorities and       schools.
This led to one of the local authorities stating that it       recognised the need `to develop restorative approaches across all schools       over a three-year period to improve relationships and behaviour' [5.4].
Identifying the variety of ways in which restorative practices and       associated conditions surrounded successful implementation enhanced the       credibility of research findings and this, in turn, encouraged take-up in       local authorities and schools beyond the pilot period.
Two years later,       the follow-up report [5.5] noted that four additional local authorities       were using restorative practices alongside a continuing commitment and       expansion from the three pilot authorities.
`Research into the impact         of restorative approaches has been widely used across Scottish Local         Authorities and schools' [5.6].
Informed by the findings, training was developed on the benefits of       inter-professional working, the time needed for change in schools and the       value of building a positive ethos based on strong relationships rather       than punishment.
All have become features of Scottish behaviour policy       [5.2].
Alternatives to Exclusion helped provide the foundation for       current national and local policy by building the case for encouraging       positive behaviour through interventions to promote a positive school       ethos, evident latterly in restorative approaches.
It also encouraged the       Scottish Government to start collecting national statistics on exclusion,       a continuing practice (see statistical bulletins) [5.1].
The Government       [5.2] reported its priority actions based on the research of project 2,       Behaviour in Scottish Schools:     `We will further develop learning environment checklists to support         the creation of peaceful learning environments and manage low level         negative behaviour.'
`We will promote further:          restorative practices and solution-oriented approaches ... to           address more serious negative behaviour between peers in schools     nurture groups ... in early years, primary and secondary schools     anti-bullying policies and practice to address serious negative           behaviour and contribute to social and emotional wellbeing     social and emotional wellbeing programmes for staff and parents ...           to support [their] implementation ... for children and young people.'
A statement of government policy on how behaviour management features in       Curriculum for Excellence [5.2] gives information about its behaviour       policy and makes explicit reference to the research from project 2.
On       page 1, for example, it says:     `The purpose of this leaflet is to inform you of the recent Behaviour         in Scottish Schools Research 2009 and how the Scottish Government and         the Scottish Advisory Group on Behaviour in Schools have identified the         next steps and priority actions to further improve relationships and         behaviour within Curriculum for Excellence in response to the findings         of the research.'
In a statement of government policy on exclusion [5.3] paragraph 8 refers       to statistics gathered in project 2 to represent a `picture of exclusion       in Scottish schools' and Annex C on `approaches to improving relationships       and promoting positive behaviour' refers to project 3 (p.76).
Key beneficiaries of Restorative Practices include schools and       their partner agencies throughout Britain.
The Scottish Government [5.3,       Annex C] now recommends the use of restorative practices as one of the       most effective approaches to building positive relationships in schools       and in managing exclusions.
The international ESRC-funded seminar series Restorative         Approaches to Conflict in Schools held in 2009-11 continues to       foster links between different jurisdictions and disciplines.
The       involvement of Dr Derrick Wilson (University of Ulster) has led to strong       links between the Scottish Government and initiatives in Northern Ireland       to introduce restorative practices into schools, prisons and communities       [5.7].
