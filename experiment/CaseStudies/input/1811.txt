Change in perception of risk by policymakers and the public     The Department of Health, having commissioned the work, promptly accepted       the Queen Mary team's conclusions on the risk and the size of the effect.
Legislation banning smoking in public places was advocated in 1998 by the       government's Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, of which       Professor Wald was a member [8].
The publication of the original       meta-analyses led to widespread media coverage.
Professor Law appeared on       BBC and ITV news, and was interviewed together with a tobacco industry       representative by John Humphrys on the Today Programme.

Change in policy and legislation in UK     A ban on smoking in public places was proposed by the Chief Medical       Officer Sir Liam Donaldson, in his annual public health report for 2002       [9].
A Public Health White Paper, Choosing Health, published in       2004, announced a total ban on smoking in public places [10].
Following       this, there was considerable discussion in parliament on whether the ban       on smoking in public places should be partial (eg with private clubs       exempt and taking account of a possible adverse effect on businesses and       the hospitality industry) or total, including a widely publicised threat       by Sir Liam to resign if a total ban was not upheld.
Legislation, which       had already come into force in Scotland in 2006 [11], was passed in       England and Wales in 2007 [12].

[Failed] attempts by the tobacco lobby to rebut the research         findings     The tobacco industry undertook a sophisticated lobbying campaign, much of       it indirectly by funding the hospitality industry, in an effort to       discredit the work of Queen Mary (and other) researchers [13].
These       efforts contributed to the delay in definitive legislation in UK until       2006-7.
But ultimately, clear messages from the Department of       Health-commissioned Queen Mary meta-analyses about the serious health risk       (Figure 1) outweighed speculative (and as it turned out, unfounded)       arguments about potential loss of revenue and collapse of hospitality       businesses [14,15].

Change in practice: smoking bans were effectively implemented     Contrary to predictions that this law would be widely flouted, it proved       highly effective from the outset, with (for example) an estimated 98%       compliance from businesses within six months of its introduction in       England and Wales [16].
As a direct result, levels of tobacco-related       toxic chemicals (`fine particulate matter') in ambient air of bars fell by       91%, and cotinine levels in the saliva of non-smoking bar and restaurant       workers by 76%, in the same period in England [16].
Similar findings were       documented in Scotland [17].
A Cochrane review synthesised 30 studies of       exposure to second hand smoke from across the world, 19 of which measured       this using biomarkers, and confirmed a consistent and significant       reduction following the introduction of smoking bans [18].
Importantly,       there was no evidence of compensatory increases in smoking in the home &#8212;       indeed some studies documented a decline in children's exposure to tobacco       smoke at home [19, 20].

Change in policy and the law beyond the UK     Smoke-free legislation is now widespread.
For example, all EU Member       States have some form of regulation aimed at limiting exposure to       second-hand smoke [21,22]; most US states have also introduced such bans,       as have some low-income countries such as Vietnam and Bhutan.

Reduction in smoking-related morbidity and mortality in UK and         worldwide     Smoking bans in public places have had widespread and dramatic impacts on       human health [15].
The following examples were selected from dozens of       potentially relevant ones:            Reduced hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome / myocardial         infarction.
We cite a BMJ study based on English data and an         international meta-analysis of 10 studies that estimates a 17% reduction         in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction as a result of smoking         bans [23,24];       Reduced hospital admissions for childhood asthma [25]; and       Reduced pregnancy complications (preterm delivery and small for         gestational age) [26].
4f.
Changes in public attitudes to smoking     Acknowledging a background trend of declining public support for smoking       in bars, workplaces and other public places, there is evidence that even       citizens initially opposed to the bans showed a shift in attitudes over       time, with a growing perception of the personal, health and environmental       benefits of smokefree policies [27-29].
Short-term quit rates reported by       the NHS Stop Smoking Service showed a 23% increase following the       introduction of the smoking ban, though rates of sustained quitting       attributable to the ban are harder to document [15].
