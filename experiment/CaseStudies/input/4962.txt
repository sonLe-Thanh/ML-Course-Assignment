     It has been suggested that thrombophilia screening may help to identify       women at risk of VTE and provide an opportunity to intervene with       thromboprophylaxis.
Nevertheless, as with any testing strategy, the       potential benefits must be weighed against the potential harm of       screening-related anxiety and the adverse effects of thromboprophylaxis       among women who are either genuinely at risk or who may be misdiagnosed as       being at risk.
Furthermore, substantial investment in healthcare, such as       large-scale screening, must demonstrate value for money to ensure that       limited resources are appropriately deployed.
The need to provide direct,       evidence-based guidance to clinicians about risk stratification and       screening is therefore paramount.
University of Glasgow research into VTE       risk among women has provided substantial insight into this issue - TREATS       data influenced the development of clinical guidelines and recommendations       both in the UK and internationally and shaped the VTE prevention strategy       of NHS Scotland.
TREATS informs recommendations on patient stratification for VTE           risk     Medical societies     The UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have       produced three clinical guidelines on VTE risk citing TREATS research:            Green-top guideline 37a on pregnancy (November 2009) cites Robertson et           al.4 as level 2++ evidence for the recommendation that         pregnant women with asymptomatic heritable thrombophilia (i.e.
those         showing no symptoms) should be stratified by degree of risk, taking         family history and other clinical risk factors, such as age and weight,         into account.a        Green-top guideline 40 on COCs (July 2010) cites Wu et al.
2005b6 as level 1- evidence against routine screening for         thrombophilia before starting COCs.b        Green-top guideline 19 on HRT (May 2011) cites Wu et al.
2005a5         as level 2+ evidence against universal screening for heritable         thrombophilias before starting HRT.c University of Glasgow         investigator Prof Isobel Walker was a member of this guideline         committee.
Walker was also a member of the writing group tasked by the British       Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) with developing a guideline       on testing for heritable thrombophilia (April 2010).d These       guidelines cite two TREATS papers:            Wu et al.
2005b6 is cited as evidence for the         recommendation against screening before prescribing HRT or COCs unless a         high-risk thrombophilia has been confirmed in a relative showing         symptoms.
Robertson et al.4 is cited in the section on         preventing VTE during pregnancy, with the recommendation for targeted         screening of asymptomatic women with a family history of VTE triggered         by pregnancy or use of COCs.
The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines on VTE during       pregnancy were published in February 2012.e Data from Robertson       et al.4 is cited as follows:            Tables 3 and S10 list factors the ACCP recommends clinicians use to         identify women at elevated risk of VTE after caesarean delivery         (Robertson et al.
was one of seven studies cited).
Recommendation 6.2.2 states that women with at least one major risk         factor or two minor risk factors qualify for thromboprophylaxis (Grade         2B).
Table 7 outlines the risk of VTE among pregnant women with heritable         thrombophilias (Robertson et al.
was one of 11 studies cited).
Recommendations 9.2.1-9.2.3 state that thromboprophylaxis should be         considered only for pregnant women with both copies of the gene affected         for factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210 regardless of their family         history and for women with other heritable thrombophilias and a family         history of VTE (Grade 2B and 2C).
Table 9 summarises the risk of pregnancy complications among women         with heritable and acquired thrombophilias (Robertson et al.
was         the only study cited).
For women with a history of recurrent early         miscarriage, screening for antiphospholipid syndrome is advised         (recommendation 10.2.1, Grade 1B) whereas screening for heritable         thrombophilias is not advised (recommendation 10.2.2, Grade 2C).
The ACCP recommendations are endorsed by several other US medical       societies, including the Amerian Society of Hematology and the American       College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Government bodies     The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has responsibility       for developing evidence-based clinical guidelines for NHS Scotland.
In       addition, SIGN takes a proactive approach to dissemination and       implementation of its guidelines, campaigning for inclusion in national       strategies and action plans.
Named individuals within each regional       Scottish health board are recruited to promote new and updated SIGN       guidelines and to draw up plans for their subsequent implementation.
SIGN       guideline 122 on prevention and management of VTE was published in       December 2010.f Walker was a member of the guideline       development group, with Lowe participating in the literature review.
This       guideline cites Wu et al.
20063 and Robertson et         al.4 as evidence for the evaluation of VTE risk       associated with pregnancy, HRT or COCs.
These papers are also cited in       recommendations advising against routine screening for thrombophilias       because it is neither cost-effective nor indicated.
In the 3 months       following publication, 77,263 copies of SIGN 122 were downloaded; in       addition, 1,803 copies of the junior doctor audit activity based on this       guideline were downloaded between April 2011 and April 2013.g     TREATS highlights the need for a Scotland-wide policy on VTE           prevention     In light of their expertise on VTE risk, the TREATS researchers were       commissioned by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (now Healthcare       Improvement Scotland) to assess the national VTE prevention strategy.
This       inspection (undertaken in 2007) identified unacceptable deficiencies and       substantial variation in guideline implementation, audit and clinical       practice.
The key findings of this audit were later summarised in the British         Journal of Haematology (2010); this paper also included an analysis       of audit activity in England.h     As a result of the 2007 TREATS audit, the Chief Medical Officer for       Scotland and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland contacted all 14 Scottish       health boards to request a report on their efforts to write up-to-date       standard operating procedures for VTE prevention that were based on SIGN       recommendations.
A summary report of this exercise, published in May 2008       and citing the TREATS audit, suggested that implementation of these       national guidelines was still a work in progress for many health boards.i       However, a follow-up report in December 2008 found that all health boards       "provided reasonable reassurance that the actions originally outlined         in the May 2008 report have continued to be implemented and, in some         Board areas, completed.
"i In March 2010, the thrombosis       charity Lifeblood presented a report to the Scottish Parliament on VTE       prevention in NHS Scotland that included an audit it had conducted as a       follow-up to the original TREATS inspection.j The Lifeblood       audit showed that 11 of the Scottish health boards had a written policy in       place for VTE; 13 had policies for mandatory risk assessment of all       inpatients, with 6 boards undertaking routine reassessments; and 5       conducting regular audit of their risk assessment policies.
These findings       confirmed that marked improvements had occurred in Scottish VTE prevention       policy since deficiencies were first highlighted by TREATS in 2007.
The TREATS audit also stressed the need for consistent and accessible       patient information on VTE as part of the Scotland-wide policy for       preventing this condition.h,i The Scottish Government therefore       provided Lifeblood with funds to develop a leaflet for dissemination via       general practitioners to promote awareness of VTE among their patients.k       The Lifeblood leaflet covered risk factors for VTE, including pregnancy,       use of oral oestrogens and family history of thrombophilia.
In March 2008,       50 copies of this leaflet were mailed to every GP practice in Scotland       (approximately 1,000 practices in total), a campaign that featured in the       Scottish press.l The leaflet was also made freely available to       download from the Lifeblood website.
