     Reciprocal influence between coaching body engagement and the research       undertaken by the       group has created a number of key impacts on coach education and coaching       practice.
These       particularly relate to uptake of psychosocial approaches that enhance both       learning and       development of coaching techniques and the effectiveness of the coaching       process.
A       consequence of the applied biomechanics engagement of Nicola Relph and       John Newton with the       GB Diving Squad prior to the 2012 Olympic Games was the impact it had on       the behavioural       responses by performers and evaluation of performance by coaches.
There has been direct influence on practitioner approaches to coach       education; for example, Dr       Houlston led the development and delivery of 5 levels of Psychology         for Football for the Football       Association between 2002 and 2013, which related to the approaches       identified in the research.
Hamish Telfer was engaged by SportsCoachUK and the Football         Association to lead on the       promotion of ethical practice in coaching.
Further uptake of these       approaches has been supported       through formal practitioner dissemination via national coaching manuals       and coach education       involvement with leading sport agencies in the UK.
For example, Houlston's       work in social-cognitive       psychology led to his substantial contribution (across three chapters) to       the Football       Association's Level 3 Coaching Handbook, now in its third edition, which       is utilised in the training of       all FA/UEFA Level 3 football coaches in England:            Houlston D.R (2008) Learning and Coaching Styles.

These chapters reflect Dr Houlston's expertise in transferring       social-psychological understanding       into the coach education domain.
A critical aspect of the development of       this body of work was the       adoption of a contextual approach to coach education that moved from       practice to theory and back       into practice (from football to psychology to football) through the       engagement undertaken with key       stakeholders and the research undertaken at Cumbria.
For example, the       utility of reflective       practice, particularly through recognition by coaches that the perceptions       of others are often       framed round social cognitions (e.g.
the attributions of a performer       following a performance       outcome).
For many coaches, this is a unique experience and moves beyond       the more traditional       cognitive-behavioural approaches to coach-performer interventions, and       includes an emphasis on       the development and analysis of communication skills and practice       behaviours.
The counter-cognitive       reasoning employed in this engagement is eminently recognisable in Miller       (2012) and       Miller and Cronin (2012), demonstrating the interplay between action       research engagement,       stakeholder publications and academic publication.
Through the coaching       handbook, this approach       has been applied directly in the training of UK and European football       coaches throughout the       assessment period.
As a consequence of these research informed insights for practice, Dr       Houlston is a Psychology       Consultant to the Football Association, disseminating insights from the       sport psychology realm in a       direct manner, via the training of high-level coaches, as well as via       publications.
In 2010, Dr       Houlston utilised the reflective practice studies by his colleague Telfer       in the design and delivery of       a new Coaching Psychology programme for FA/UEFA Advanced Licence football       coaches, most       recently delivered in three sessions Spring to Summer 2013.
Additionally,       Dr Houlston is also the       author of the FA's Level 2 Coaching Handbook (2009; 3rd       Edition) and wrote the `Coaching       Psychology' chapter for the new FA/UEFA Level 4 Coaching Handbook (2012).
These directly       influence coach education and implementation of coaching techniques in       practice, as core texts for       the FA/UEFA texts.
Within a wider coaching context, the research of Bampouras, Cronin and       Miller has introduced an       experiential dimension to the investigation of performance analysis in       sport via insights from Actor-Network       theory.
Published in mid-2012, and disseminated through key practitioner       orientated       publications, the research has already begun to stimulate online debate       among practitioners and       sport coaches, causing reflection on practice and changes to approach, as       exemplified by       practitioner blogs.
