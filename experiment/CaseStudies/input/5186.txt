Climate Innovation Centres (CICs) and collaborative R&amp;D have been       adopted as policy mechanisms under the UNFCCC's new Technology Mechanism &#8212;       the key policy vehicle for delivering technology transfer &#8212; as well as by       several other policy organisations.
The SEG's specific impacts include:            Lord Nicholas Stern asked Sussex to prepare a policy briefing note for         the critical 2009 UNFCCC negotiations in Copenhagen.
The brief,         promoting Climate Innovation Centres and collaborative R&amp;D based on         SEG research, informally became known as `The Sussex Proposal' and was         endorsed in the press by Stern as making `...a valuable contribution to         the debate ahead of the crucial discussions in Copenhagen' [see Section         5, C1, C8].
DECC negotiators at Copenhagen used the SEG's work to inform the UK         and EU negotiating position.
Their lead negotiator on technology states:         `This work impacted on me as a negotiation lead in this area, and I used         the insights provided to steer the EU position.
I can't understate the         helpfulness of this work...' [C2, C8].
DECC reoriented UK guidelines on international climate finance.
`[The         SEG's] research had a strong impact on DECC's policy thinking and has         fed into the Department's guidelines on how its international climate         finance be disbursed.
In particular, the research led to more of an         emphasis on funding low-carbon technological capacity-building,         including via collaborative research and development initiatives and the         establishment of Climate Innovation Centres' [C3].
The UNFCCC Secretariat commissioned Ockwell and colleagues from ECN         and IIT to report on policy applications of collaborative R&amp;D. The         report was adopted as an official UNFCCC policy document         (FCCC/SBSTA/2010/INF.11) and was `...influential in shaping the views of         [the UNFCCC's Expert Group on Technology Transfer] on critical driving         factors and policy options...' [C4, C5].
DFID, with the World Bank, is also implementing CICs.
`Work led by SEG         and others on the concept of Climate Innovation Centres has been         particularly influential on shaping and driving policy on this agenda.
Following SEG's earlier analysis on the concept in 2009, DFID invested         in piloting the approach in a number of our partner countries.
DFID has         since championed this approach internationally, frequently drawing on         findings from SEG's research.
This has led to successful adoption of the         concept under the UNFCCC, as well as financial support for the         development of developing-country CICs from Norway, Denmark and         Australia...
The programme is anticipated to have significant impacts on         poverty &#8212; supporting livelihoods, job creation, health, education and         the environment' [C6, C9].
DFID established a framework contract with the SEG to advise on         applications to the Climate Technology Fund (CTF) &#8212; a key funding         mechanism for technology transfer under the UNFCCC.
`Questions, advice         and recommendations provided by SEG were strongly valued by DFID who         used these in their preparations for CTF Trust Fund Committee meetings'         [C6].
`SEG's work has been instrumental in shaping DFID's thinking on         international, collaborative R&amp;D....
The work of SEG in this area         has been valuable in the design of a new DFID programme exploring the         use of innovation prizes to address climate... problems...' [C6].
The Asian Development Bank and UNEP are developing a CICs approach         `... drawing on SEG reports on collaborative R&amp;D and technology         transfer' [C5].
The Government of Chile asked the UK Foreign Office to fund Ockwell to         input into their Technology Needs Assessment &#8212; a key policy document         submitted to the UNFCCC.
The African Development Bank asked Ockwell to prepare a chapter on         technology transfer for their 2012 African Development Report, which         provides the empirical basis for mainstreaming Green Growth in their new         10-Year Strategy (2013-22), and to advise AfDB on their plans to launch         a CIC in North Africa:         http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/African%20Development%           20Report%202012.pdf.
`...work done by the University of Sussex on the transfer of low         carbon technologies has had a significant influence on OECD's work on         related issues' [C7].
The OECD Environment Directorate commissioned a         report by the SEG on technology transfer (published as an OECD Working         Paper) to inform the OECD Global Forum on Environment in 2009, a key         event used to evaluate global eco-innovation policies and inform the         OECD's Innovation Strategy.
The impact of the research has been recognised in various ways,         including:            being showcased by the ESRC as one of five high-impact research case         studies to support the technology component of its 2009-14 Strategic         Plan;       being awarded the 2009 Green Gown Award for Best University-Based         Environmental Research;       Ockwell being invited to brief high-level AfDB executives on         technology transfer for delivering green growth in Africa;       Lord Nicholas Stern endorsing the SEG's edited book (Ockwell and         Mallett 2012 &#8212; R3); and       the SEG being invited to give presentations at numerous international         policy fora, including, inter alia:                the European Parliament;         the UK Houses of Parliament;         the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties;         the UNFCCC Technology Executive meetings;         the World Sustainable Development Forum;         meetings with the governments of Chile, Peru, Colombia and India;         and         the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit.
