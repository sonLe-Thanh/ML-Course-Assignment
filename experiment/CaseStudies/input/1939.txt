     Goswami's theoretical work contextualising the role of grain sizes in       early phonics teaching has       had impact in several ways;     1.
Practitioners and services: Her work has influenced the way       that teachers approach reading       instruction.
For example, her 2008 papers critiquing synthetic phonics and       emphasising the       importance of a cross-language analysis including rhyme1 in       Literacy and the British Educational       Research Journal have been downloaded over 1500 times; and many teachers       now use analogies       in teaching reading.
Impact is on-going following the inclusion of the       work on rhyme analogy in the       UK National Literacy Strategy (1997; 2003), the research also formed the       basis for a Primary       Reading Scheme from the Oxford Reading Tree (Rhyme &amp; Analogy, OUP);       1996-2012.2     2.
Public policy and services: Additionally, the Teaching and       Learning Research Programme       (TLRP) was a major ESRC initiative focusing on educational research for       the improvement of       teaching and learning, which ran from 1999-2009.
Goswami's research was       directly responsible for       her being invited to sit on the Steering Group for the TLRP Seminar Series       in Neuroscience and       Education; the Group's 2007 report for teachers on `Neuroscience and       Education: Issues and       Opportunities',3 in which Goswami wrote the section on       neuroscience and developmental       disorders, continues to have impact and has been downloaded over 605,000       times since       publication4 (figures from James O'Toole Institute of Education       via Cambridge Digital Services,       continuing impact demonstrated by 169,000 hits in 2013 alone).
Professor Goswami's research on child learning led to her being consulted       by Sir Jim Rose for his       2009 Independent Review of the Primary Curriculum commissioned by the UK       Government.5       Goswami was also asked by Tania Byron (now Professor and Chancellor of       Edge Hill University,       Lancashire) to prepare one of three literature reviews (on child       development) to underpin the Byron       Review: Children and New Technology (DfES, 2008).6     Also, Goswami co-wrote (with Peter Bryant, Emeritus Professor at Oxford)       the child development       strand of the Cambridge Primary Review (funded by the Esme Fairburn       foundation, and published       as a research report in December 2007, with the main report published in       2009),7which       summarises the processes of learning, thinking and reasoning in pre-school       and primary school-       aged children, and suggests how educational frameworks can best support       these (Final Report       Part 2 Section 7; covered in The Guardian, The Independent, The TES, The       Telegraph, December       2007).
In addition, at the request of the then Chief Scientist, Professor Sir       David King, Goswami was       asked by the UK Government to lead the `Learning Difficulties' strand of       the Foresight project on       Mental Capital and Wellbeing.8 The report describes the       prevalence and impact of common       learning difficulties in children; defines a conceptual model of typical       and atypical learning       development; and considers the multiple factors that influence the       outcomes of learning difficulties       at an individual level.
It also suggests possible approaches to the       identification and treatment of       learning difficulties over the next 20 years.
The Report's recommendations       are of such significance       that they were drawn to the attention of policy makers and professionals       and researchers working       in the field of childhood development and learning difficulties, see One       Year Review.9 For example,       Goswami was asked personally to present the developmental messages from       the work to the       Senior Leadership Team (December 2008) and the Chief Scientist and the       Director of Child       Wellbeing (April 2009) at the (then) Department for Children, Schools and       Families.
The One-Year       Review of the Foresight project (2009) lists a range of impacts on       government, academia, third       sector and business, for example on the Learning Revolution White Paper       (DIUS, 2009).
With respect to Goswami's Foresight work on learning difficulties (2008),       the report was also drawn       to the attention of both the Children's Workforce Development Council and       the Training and       Development Agency.
The former were reported to be taking into account the       findings in their work       on early years practitioners, and the latter reported that `many providers       adapted their provision to       take into account recent research in neuroscience as an element of their       approach to the study of       the development of children and young people.'
Since approximately 7% of       children are affected by       developmental dyslexia, these recommendations for changes to treatments       that have a positive       effect have significant impact.
Goswami's report also had an impact in       China, leading to a Ministry       of Education-funded research initiative (c&#163;1.5 million, 2010-2013)       involving Chinese and UK       academics to explore `children's learning difficulties and social       withdrawal behaviour'.
The Chinese       Ministry of Education also organised a group to study how to apply the       Foresight findings to the       Chinese national education strategy for 2010-2020 (correspondence from Jon       Parke, UK       Government Office for Science, to UG).

Society, culture and creativity/public debate and understanding:       Goswami was       interviewed by both BBC Radio and TV for high-profile programmes (e.g.,       Melvyn Bragg for In Our       Time, March 2010; David Baddiel for Horizon, March 2009; Michael Morpurgo       for Radio 4, March       2012; Lauren Antrobus for Growing Children, August 2012; for example see10).
Her research on       music, rhythm and dyslexia is impacting public debate and understanding       (e.g.
talk at Cheltenham       Science Festival, 2008, on dyslexia; TES article on rhythmic interventions       for dyslexia, public       debate following R4 appearances11).
The innovative way in which Goswami's work on the neural basis of       developmental dyslexia       combines cognitive developmental psychology and mechanisms of neural       processing and       representation has led to invitations to open programmes and centres for       educational neuroscience       in other countries, for example the Educational Neuroscience Programme at       the University of       Granada (2009), and the Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition (2010).
The value that       practitioners place on her research and its implications is illustrated in       the many invitations to       speak at professional meetings in order to provide information that can       change approaches to       treatment.11 In recognition of her impact on practitioners,       Goswami was awarded the 2011 New       York Academy of Sciences Aspen Brain Forum Senior Investigator Prize for       her `ability to translate       discoveries from cognitive neuroscience into innovative curricula and       tools that enhance learning       inside or outside of the classroom'.12
