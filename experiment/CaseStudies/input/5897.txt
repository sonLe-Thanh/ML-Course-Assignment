     Conservation of biodiversity:     - Forest conservation (Marshall, 2008): Marshall assisted the WWF       Tanzania Programme Office in securing funds for ecological and       socio-economic surveys to support increased protected status of the       threatened Magombera forest.
Marshall's role in this funding was ecological           consultant, culminating in an ecological report emphasising       the high biodiversity importance of Magombera forest.
The report and its       recommendations for safeguarding the forest were then presented to       Flamingo Land Resort, who subsequently proposed the establishment           of a long-term trust fund for conservation work in the region.
As Executive Trustee of the trust fund, Marshall used this to establish       the Udzungwa Forest Project (UFP).
The fund now employs           eight staff, who are monitoring and managing the forest, and       working with local villages.
The biodiversity result has been an increase           in tree biomass in areas of UFP activity, compared to a decrease           outside of this area, and an increase in tree stem regeneration in           restoration plots.
- Awards: UFP was awarded "Best Field Conservation Project"       by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquaria (BIAZA) and       Flamingo Land was awarded the David Bellamy Conservation Gold Award       for its partnership with the University.
Awareness-raising and training:     - Forest conservation (Marshall, 2008): Ecological surveys of the       Magombera forest have directly led to the development of training for       local people under UFP.
Approximately 10,000 villagers living           adjacent to Magombera forest have been reached by training in       the construction of fuel-efficient stoves, and by educational films       powered by an innovative pedal-powered cinema.
A book has been           written to inform local villagers on conserving forests.
Thousands of primary school children have also been taught about forest       and biodiversity conservation.
School fees of around 140 secondary school       children have been paid.
Experiments are underway to trial the potential       for tree-planting and alternative energy sources to reduce forest damage,       including establishment of permanent tree nurseries and distribution of       over 6,000 trees to date.
Four villagers living adjacent to the Magombera       forest have been trained in ecological survey methods.
- Forest monitoring (Marshall et al., 2012a): Marshall's work on       assessing carbon distribution in Tanzanian forests has led to the       development of a capacity-building course in carbon measurement and           statistical modelling methods, that was attended by       representatives from eleven East African institutions in 2013, and will be       repeated in 2014.
- Biodiversity conservation (Marshall, 2008; Marshall &amp; Deere, 2011       [section 5]): As a direct result of the establishment of UFP in Tanzania       (following Flamingo Land's assessment of the ecological report), Marshall       is now Vice Chair of the BIAZA Field Programme Committee (FPC).
Since       2011, Marshall's responsibility on the committee has been to assess the       financial contribution of the zoos of Britain and Ireland to biodiversity       conservation.
The results are being used to advise zoos on increasing       their contribution to field conservation.
- Public education (Marshall, 2008): The link with Flamingo Land,       initially established through Marshall's ecological work (see UFP       creation), has led to creation of a unique research and education           centre (CIRCLE).
CIRCLE's mission is to use scientific       evidence to guide biodiversity conservation, animal welfare and public       understanding of the natural world.
Activities aim to disseminate       information to non-academic audiences, through classes/presentations           at Flamingo Land (FL), a weekly newspaper column, monthly bulletin,           and information signs.
FL is the UK's most visited zoo, with       1.3 million annual visitors.
- Awards: Marshall's CIRCLE initiative was awarded the 2013           PraxisUnico Collaborative Impact Award, which recognises "...       those teams, and individuals, that have produced outstanding impact       through successful knowledge transfer".
Encouraging stakeholder action:     - Stakeholder engagement (Marshall, 2008): Behaviour change through UFP's       village education work mentioned above has been seen through a rise           in the proportion of households using fuel-efficient stoves (15% in           2011, to 32% in 2013).
These activities have led four villages       to sign Memoranda of Understanding in support of forest           conservation activities by UFP, and one village has developed       a bye-law enforcing use of sustainable fuel technology by all           households.
Lobbying letters and meetings are       used each year to raise government and other stakeholder awareness of the       plight of Magombera forest, leading to legal support for           conservation of Magombera forest as a Nature Reserve and part       of the forest is now in the process of formal gazettement by the Tanzanian       government.
- Biodiversity action (Hambly &amp; Marshall in press): CIRCLE have also       now developed the world's first zoo-based Biodiversity Action Plan           (Zoo BAP) for FL managers to contribute to international       biodiversity targets.
This Zoo BAP has resulted in biodiversity       conservation measures at FL, including the planting of 6,000 trees       in partnership with the Woodland Trust.
The BIAZA Native Species Working       Group has agreed to incorporate the Zoo BAP into an information pack to be       sent to all 102 BIAZA member zoos.
Public debate (Marshall et al., 2012b): Following Marshall's development       of a list of the top ten species most dependent on zoos for survival, Lord           De Mauley used the report to reinforce a parliamentary debate on           government funding for zoos.
The report included the Polyalthia             verdcourtii tree, whose existence is dependent on           the work of UFP
