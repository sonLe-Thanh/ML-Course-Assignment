     As a major new resource for the English language, the impact of the HT       has been widespread in       preserving our linguistic heritage and presenting it to the general       public, contributing to the       economy via the publishing industry, and becoming an authoritative       resource for both international       academia and non-academic writers, especially historical novelists.
When published in late 2009, the print version of the HT received       widespread and enthusiastic       coverage in the general media as well as critical acclaim from such       prominent figures as Melvyn       Bragg, Philip Pullman, David Wooton, Alexander McCall Smith, Sir Roy       Strong and Barbara       Kingsolver.
In the press, reviews and editorials appeared in The Times       (6/7/09 and 23/10/09), The         New York Times (8/01/10), The Daily Telegraph (23/8/09), The         Guardian (19/12/09), The Sunday         Times (01/11/09), The Daily Record (11/8/09), The         Literary Review (5/11/09) and The Daily Mail       (13/7/09), reaching an estimated audience of 6.5 million people worldwide,       with discussions,       interviews and features on BBC News, Radio 4, Radio 3, and other stations       across the UK,       Australia (ABC Radio Perth 21/7/09 and 11/5/10, Melbourne 13/8/09) and the       USA (WNYC 3/9/09       and 5/10/09).
The Guardian praised the HT's `general and rich       application, as the reader can trace       the evolution of concepts and attitudes over centuries'.
The HT was named Book of the Year in The Guardian and The         Times Literary Supplement &#8212; publications       that reach a combined readership of c.345,000 &#8212; and it received the       Saltire Society       Research Book of the Year Award in 2009, recognising the contribution of       both the underpinning       research and the published work to the knowledge and understanding of       Scotland and the Scots.
The worldwide media impact led to unexpectedly rapid sales, with the       first print run of 4,000 selling       out within two months, necessitating an urgent reprint for Christmas 2009.
At the time of writing,       the print HT is currently in its fourth print run in three years, with       sales revenues amounting to       approximately &#163;1.6 million &#8212; an exceptional figure for a reference volume       of this type, confirming       the significant contribution it has made to the economic prosperity of the       publishing sector.
In 2010 the HT was integrated with the online Oxford English         Dictionary to create one accessible       resource for anyone looking for information on any word.
The integrated       OED site currently has       over 6 million visits per year, and HT data is tightly integrated into       each results page delivered by       the site.
Since this integration, the online OED acts as an authoritative       and accessible resource for       novelists and poets, particularly writers of historical fiction.
As a       consequence, the HT's popularity       has spread among this demographic by word of mouth, notably through       creative writing blogs and       forums.
A typical use of it is explained by the Hugo prize-winning       novelist Mary         Robinette Kowal.
Setting out to write a fantasy set in 1815, Kowal wanted to make       sure it was clean of any       anachronisms.
She therefore created her own dictionary, drawn entirely       from the works of Jane       Austen, and used this as the spell check application programme for her       novel.
Whenever the       programme flagged a word as not having been used by Austen, Kowal writes,       `I looked it up in the       OED to double-check the meaning and the earliest citation.
If the word       didn't work, then I used the       OED's historical thesaurus to find a period appropriate synonym'.
Similarly, the Pulitzer Prize-winning       novelist Geraldine Brooks is quoted in a 2010 newspaper         interview as saying that her `go-to       resource is the amazing Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English       Dictionary', described in the       interview as `a 4000-page book that is the stuff of dreams for a       historical writer'.
The celebrated       children's author Philip Pullman concurs: `I can hardly imagine any       reference book more valuable       for the historical novelist'.
