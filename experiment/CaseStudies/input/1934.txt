     'We are one community - the Travellers and our settled neighbours.
We've all got something         in common: we want our children to be healthy and educated."
Gloria       Buckley MBE, Romany       Gypsy and manager of three authorised sites.
EHRC         Report            Brown et al have been commissioned by local authorities to produce         circa one third of all         Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessments (GTAAs) across         England from         2006-2009 and GTAAs for around 20 local authorities from 2012-present.
These studies         offer estimations of the shortfall in culturally appropriate         accommodation units for Gypsies         and Travellers in particular localities.
Following GTAAs, many local         authorities have         developed specific targets, embedded with local planning strategies         (Local Plans), for the         provision of accommodation for members of these communities.
As a result of this profile and expertise Brown was commissioned by         the Equality and         Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to assess           the progress local authorities had made in         meeting these identified needs.
The findings were used to inform the         report on progress         on Gypsy and Traveller accommodation provision produced by central         government.
Following on from this particular study Brown was commissioned by the         EHRC to produce         a similar study in Scotland and an annual           update study covering both England and Wales.
In 2006 Brown had been part of a team (with the Universities of         Birmingham and Sheffield         Hallam) commissioned by CLG to provide research input into developing         good practice         guidance for regional planning bodies (RPBs) when preparing reviews of         Regional Spatial         Strategies (RSSs) in respect of Gypsy and Traveller accommodation needs.
Since 2008         the guide had influenced local authority policies providing the         framework for Gypsy and         Traveller provision.
In response, however, to the localism and         decentralisation agenda,         which moved away from regional spatial strategies, and calling on Brown         et al's update to         the EHRC on local authority progress, the Commons Select Committee - the       Communities and Local Government Committee recommended a simplified       and       centralised national approach to the provision of Gypsy and Traveller       accommodation:       "There is strong evidence that a localism and decentralisation agenda         is limited in its         capacity to identify and provide accommodation for the Gypsy and         Traveller communities.
A simplified and centralised national approach to the provision of Gypsy         and Traveller         accommodation is essential to overcoming the discrimination Gypsies and         Travellers         face.
The pursuit of a decentralisation and localism agenda - in         relation to Gypsy and         Traveller accommodation provision - will more than likely lead to an         increase in local         authorities' expenditure on evictions of Gypsy and Traveller         communities.
Strong         evidence from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and local         authorities         has shown that once proper Gypsy and Traveller sites are provided,         conflict and tension         between local settled communities and Gypsies and Travellers is         significantly reduced,         leading to greater community cohesion."
Commons Select Committee         Localism -         Communities and Local Government Committee         June 2011       The Homes and Communities Agency's central coordination of site         provision through the         delivery of the Gypsy and Traveller Sites Grant Programme has seen         &#163;16.3m invested in         26 schemes across the country providing 88 new or additional pitches and         179 improved         pitches: "Authorised travellers' sites can provide the basis for           local authorities to tackle           the inequalities experienced by travellers.
Increased authorised           provision will reduce the           number of unauthorised sites and the tensions they can create between           travellers and the           settled community and reduce the need for costly enforcement action."
HCA           website        Building on their work with UK Gypsies and Travellers (who are seen as         `Roma' within a         definition from the Council of Europe) Brown et al were invited to be         partners on the         Roma SOURCE project, which ran between 2011 and 2013.
Roma SOURCE         explored         the social exclusion and community relations of Roma and non Roma in six         EU Member         States.
In partnership with a number of public sector partners Roma         SOURCE has         combatted discrimination and exclusion of Roma, and improved         understanding between         Roma and mainstream communities.
Based on an evaluation of the Roma         SOURCE         project there is tangible progression in inclusion of Roma in a number         of local areas,         greater understanding and demonstrable policy change.
The effects of the         project went         beyond the partner organisations, leaving a legacy of integration.
Work         on Roma         inclusion will continue through Roma MATRIX (running from 2013-2015), a         new project         with 19 partners in 10 European Member States.
Brown et al are also leading pioneering work funded by the Joseph         Rowntree Charitable         Trust which aims to enumerate the migrant Roma population in the UK.
This work has         been cited in policy documents from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office         (FCO) as         follows "UK efforts to combat the marginalisation of the Roma           communities have both a           domestic and an international dimension.
We seek to share our           experience of integration           and at the same time to reduce the push factors that force communities           which are           discriminated against to come to the UK.
The Department for           Communities and Local           Government, which is a member of the network, reports to the European           Commission on           its activities and on the situation of the Roma community in the UK           more widely.
The           University of Salford is due to issue a report in 2013 which will           provide the most accurate           picture to date on the number and distribution of the Roma in the UK".
