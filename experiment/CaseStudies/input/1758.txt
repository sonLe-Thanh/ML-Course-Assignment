     This research project has had a number of impacts, not least because       knowledge exchange processes were built in from the outset.
It involved in       its planning and design a wide range of non-academic partners, including       teachers and parents, and representatives of community associations, local       education authorities, and mainstream schools attended by multilingual       pupils (Source 1).
A series of ESRC funded workshops and seminars were       organised where the researchers reported their work-in-progress to the       partners and stakeholders.
At the end of the project, a conference       reported on the findings to all stakeholders and complementary schools for       different ethnic communities in the country.
A further series of public       events to disseminate research findings, funded by three consecutive ESRC       Social Science Festival grants (2009-11) were run in collaboration with       Camden Council and Coram's Fields Children's Centre, for parents and       childcare professionals.
(Source 2)     The most significant impacts of the project fall into two overlapping       categories of public services and education and are evident in the       following developments:            Increased awareness and understanding among stakeholders of the         significance of community languages and complementary schools and         willingness to build partnerships.
For example, the Teacher Development         Agency has approved teaching practise in complementary schools as part         of their PGCE practicum.
Local Authorities in the cities researched have         given new grants and awards to complementary schools and best teachers         in these schools.
Pupils' achievements in complementary schools,         especially in community language examinations, are celebrated in         mainstream schools.
(Source 3 (testimonial) and 4)       Professor Li Wei's recommendations have been built into the training         programmes for teachers in complementary schools and the Community         report of the ESRC project in Chinese (2008) has been cited in the new         Chinese syllabus for teacher training by the Federation of Chinese         Schools.
Because the first Postgraduate Certificate in the Teaching of         Community Languages programme at Goldsmiths, University of London (2012)         was set up as a result of his research he was appointed its External         Examiner (Sources 3 (testimonial) and 5).
At the UK Association for the Promotion of Chinese Education         conference, on the Chinese Teachers Day 2011, Professor Li Wei's work         was cited in support of a multilingual approach by the Association in         the debate over the use of codeswitching by teachers in complementary         school classrooms.
There has been a major attitudinal change amongst the         teachers towards codeswitching by the children.
Rather than seeing it as         a linguistic deficit, codeswitching is now regarded as evidence of         linguistic creativity and criticality as Professor Li Wei has argued.
(Source 5)          The international reach of this research and its impact on the Chinese       schools across the globe is evidenced in:            Numerous invitations to Professor Li Wei to give presentations to         Chinese heritage schools associations in the USA (Los Angeles, 2009; New         York, 2010), Australia (Sydney, 2010), Switzerland (Basil, 2010), Japan         (Yokohama, 2011), and Kazakhstan (Astana, 2012).

In a letter of thanks, the Director acknowledges the         importance of Professor Li Wei's work to Chinese language education:         `Your research into multilingualism in the Chinese immigrant community         in Britain, especially your analysis of the multilingual practices of         the Chinese children in UK schools, has had a fundamental impact on our         thinking of language policy including education policy regarding migrant         and ethnic minority communities in China.'

The textbooks will, for the first time,         use examples from Chinese complementary schools in the UK.
The         dictionary will incorporate items from Professor Li Wei's fieldwork         research within the Chinese community in Britain.
