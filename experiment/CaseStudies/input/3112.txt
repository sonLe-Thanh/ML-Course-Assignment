     Haines-Young and Potschin's cascade model (Fig.
1) was used by Defra in       the 2010 revision of its Action Plan for Embedding the Ecosystems         Approach.
Alongside a version of the model, the report stated that:       "We are beginning to understand better in a number of areas how           these services also relate to the structure and function of our           ecosystems" (a, p. 4).
The same report also states that the       cascade model allows "different groups of experts to communicate           with each other &#8212; ecologists and earth scientists looking at the first           two steps need to put their work through the "translation" of           ecosystem services, to help them explain issues of concern to them           [and] to the economists and social scientists who might be studying           the last steps of the process" (a, p. 6).
The revised Action         Plan has underpinned Defra's application of the ecosystem approach       since 2010 and the cascade model has been used to disseminate these ideas       more widely.
Natural England, for example, has used the model to explain "understanding           of the flow of ecosystem services from the environment" and to       specify an Ecosystem Service Transfer Tool for the organisation (f).
The influence of the cascade model in national policy debates is       evidenced by documents from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee       (JNCC), the agency that advises the UK Government and devolved       administrations on UK-wide and international nature conservation.
In 2009,       the cascade model was presented as part of a Committee Briefing paper to       stimulate discussion of how to define the relationship between       biodiversity, ecosystem function and human well-being (b).
This document       notes the simplicity of the model, adding that: "it provides a           template that can be used to identify the different elements that have           to be taken into account when making some kind of assessment or           analysis of ecosystem services.
The model can be used to identify the           different categories or types of things that are useful for the           researcher or decision maker to consider" (b, para 3.3).
The       cascade model has been especially useful as a means of demonstrating key       issues concerning the relationship between ecosystem services/functions       and products developed by JNCC (g).
Fig 1: The cascade model (after Potschin and Haines-Young, 2011)      The influence of the model is also highlighted by its use in a document       prepared for Members of Parliament by the Parliamentary Office for Science       and Technology (POST), Living Within Environmental Limits, and in       subsequent POST briefing notes (c).
CICES and the cascade model were used       to explain both the need for natural capital accounting and how it could       be undertaken.
In the international arena, the model has also been used to       communicate the essential elements of the ecosystem service paradigm,       especially within the EU (h, i).
In addition to its influence at a conceptual level, the cascade model has       had impact in terms of application through the development of a framework       for the classification of ecosystem services and the assistance it       provides for mapping ecosystem services (j).
Since 2009, Haines-Young and       Potschin have led two rounds of consultation on the design for a CICES.
These proposals influenced the input of the EEA into the 2012 revision of       the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) led       by the United Nations Statistical Division (i).
According to the Head of       Integrated Environmental Assessment Programme at the EEA, "the           cascade model was used to inform our proposals for a revised version           of CICES (Version 4.3) and to explain the logic for the revisions           during the recent consultation process" (h).
CICES forms part of the recommendations submitted by the UN Committee of       Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA) to the 44th session       of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2013 (d, section 3.3).
Elsewhere, the influence of CICES on thinking and practice is evidenced by       its use by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment as a framework for       welfare-related environmental reporting (e, pp.
7-8) and the       classification of ecosystem services in Belgium, as well as proposals for       future initiatives in Germany and Finland.
Most significantly, CICES has       been proposed as the basis for mapping ecosystem services by the EU in       support of its Biodiversity Strategy 2020 (e, p. 10).
The model's impact       here is in enabling the standardisation of approaches and reporting       outcomes.
In the context of CICES, a Eurostat officer notes the importance       of standardisation, adding that "The classification also divides up           the subject matter in a way that influences how data are collected,           integrated, organised and presented" (i).
