     In terms of reach, the findings from this body of research have been       presented at over 30 academic and practitioner conferences and workshops,       and a small number of policy dialogue events in the UK.
Professor Hockings       was also invited to disseminate this work in a series of public and       keynote lectures and seminars in South Australia directed by the Centre       for Student Equity in Higher Education.
In terms of impact, the focus is       on three key areas:     a. Inclusive Learning and Teaching Principles: Developing an inclusive         culture       Since 2009 Professor Hockings has been working with the Higher Education       Academy (HEA) Inclusion Team disseminating and promoting inclusive       practice in HE.
The Synthesis of Research in Inclusive Learning and       Teaching (Hockings, 2010) was developed specifically to support the work       of this team and over 30 HEIs in England, Scotland and Wales engaged in       programmes of change.
They formulated action plans and initiated changes       in their policies and procedures, and revised their CPD programmes to take       account of the principles in the synthesis (See section 2b).
These cases       were subsequently published in a collection edited by the HEA (Thomas       &amp; May 2010, Inclusive learning and teaching in higher education).
The synthesis is essential reading in several academic development       programmes.
While systematic evidence is not yet available on its impact       on students' success, there is evidence of impact on the development of an       inclusive culture in a number of institutions.
For example, the Director       of Learning and Teaching at Sheffield Hallam University wrote:     `I did my session on Inclusive Practice last week and we discussed         your HEA EvidenceNet paper (Hockings 2010).
You are my key resource re         inclusive practice for Professional Standards unwrapped, for everyone         doing FHEA, SFHEAs and in my writing retreats as a physical resource for         staff writing their HEA applications.
I also use your synthesis in my         teaching session on inclusive practice.
Your principles on inclusive         practice fed into the Action Research conference [...] and were         reinforced by the PVC Learning and Teaching who concluded `I think as an         institution we have moved forward this week.'
(emails from Director       of Learning &amp; Teaching, Sheffield Hallam University)     Since then Professor Hockings has run workshops and seminars on inclusive       practice in several universities.
She is an advisory group member of the       HEFCE, Paul Hamlyn Foundation and the HEA programme `What Works &#8212; Students       Retention and Success', in which groups of institutions work towards       institutional change for the engagement, success and retention of all       students.

Open Educational Resources: Changes in academic development         programmes       This OER package, `Learning to Teach Inclusively' was released in August       2011 (see section 2c above and www.wlv.ac.uk/LTImodule).
Since then there has been a high level of user engagement in UK and abroad       with the resource and the research on which it is based (section 2a and       b).
Data indicates that the resources were accessed in 54 countries and in       210 UK towns and cities between August 2011 and October 2013 (http://www.wlv.ac.uk/default.aspx?page=27792).
The video resources had been viewed 3599 times by September 2013 (http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk).
Qualitative feedback from institutions in UK and Australia suggests that       this resource and associated research are being embedded in institutional       programmes and contributing to the thinking and development of academic       teachers.
Feedback from Australia includes Department of Further Education       Adelaide, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst New South Wales, and       University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland.
In the UK, feedback from the       Universities of Bath, Roehampton, Salford, Sheffield Hallam and Sussex has       indicated various uses made of the resources.
For example, Salford       University uses them:     `... as self-study resources on the Postgraduate Certificate in         Academic Practice and specifically on the Learning and Teaching in         Higher Education module.
We have also used specific units for specific         themes.
The modules and the videos have been a fantastic resource to         trigger conversations about classroom practice and teaching         observations.
The Inclusivity OER has been invaluable there and specific         units have been integrated fully into the Teaching Essentials programme         [... and] in classroom discussions and debates about issues linked to         inclusive learning and teaching (email, Academic Developer, Salford       University)     c. Impact on National Policy: shaping inclusive learning and teaching       In May 2013 Professor Hockings was invited to take part in a series of       roundtable discussions with experts and stakeholders led by HEFCE and OFFA       with a view to shaping national policy on national strategy for access and       student success.
Her contribution on inclusive learning and teaching       and academic development has been included in page 3 and 4 of the       final report       (http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/whatwedo/wideningparticipation/currentworktowidenparticipation/nationalstrategy/roundtable_synthesis_report_final.pdf).
