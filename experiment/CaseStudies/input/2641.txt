     The research of the Humphreys' group has had impact on three companies: Forge         Europa Ltd, AIXTRON Ltd and Plessey Semiconductors Ltd.
The impact on Forge Europa has been from the Humphreys' group       research on LED reliability, &amp; it was highlighted in the EPSRC Annual       Report 2010-2011 [1] under the heading "Economic Success for Gallium       Nitride LEDs": "Professor Sir Colin Humphreys and his team at Cambridge       University... have delivered positive outcomes for businesses in the       lighting industry... For example, Forge Europa, an SME in Cumbria...       received the Queens Award for Innovation in 2009.
Its Managing Director       Peter Barton writes, `The excellent work of the Cambridge group has         proved to be of great benefit to Forge Europa and assisted our business         to grow by over 100% in a 3-year period... A great deal of our knowledge         is directly attributed to our links with Cambridge.'..."
Of the       impact on AIXTRON, its Managing Director, Tony Pearce (in October       2013), writes "Our collaboration with Professor Humphreys' group in         Cambridge has been hugely valuable to AIXTRON.
The research carried out         by the Cambridge group not only advances understanding of the material         technology, but helps us build deposition systems to meet these demands.
AIXTRON remains in a dominant position, with significant revenues         generated by this technology of [text removed for publication].
Furthermore,         AIXTRON continues to develop next-generation products that will serve         the future semiconductor material challenges, and our collaboration with         the team at the University of Cambridge will continue to help us steer         this technology."
Humphreys &amp; two colleagues (Dandan Zhu &amp; Lewis Liu) set up       spin-offs to exploit their research, CamGaN in 2010 &amp; Intellec       in 2011, to which UCAM transferred the patent noted in Sections 2 &amp; 3,       that provides a framework for a considerable amount of know-how that was       deliberately not patented.
The patent &amp; know-how provide a method for       growing low-cost high-efficiency GaN LEDs on 6-inch Si.
Plessey       acquired CamGaN &amp; Intellec in February 2012 for [text       removed for publication] &amp; hired Zhu &amp; Liu (Fig.
1), &amp; another       Humphreys group member, David Wallis.
Plessey raised funds to permit this       acquisition of patent &amp; know-how, to purchase a commercial-scale GaN       growth reactor from AIXTRON &amp; other equipment, &amp; to revive       a mothballed 6-inch Si processing line in its factory in Plymouth.
Zhu       &amp; Wallis successfully transferred the UCAM recipe for growing GaN LED       structures to the new reactor at Plessey in December 2012.
This       has enabled Plessey to sustain ~12 manufacturing jobs, &amp; it is       currently in the process of hiring additional staff to support the       production of GaN LEDs on 6-inch Si.
Plessey is addressing a       global market: this is a clear indication of the cost savings the UCAM       technology brings.
The LEDs are already on the market (Fig.

Until now, all the LEDs in the UK       are manufactured in China or Taiwan.
Plessey has recently raised       additional funding to purchase nine more commercial-size GaN growth       reactors.

Plessey's Magic LED PLW111010 LEDs shown on vendor       site Saelig Co Inc. [http://www.saelig.com/pr/plw111010.html]      The impact of Humphreys' group research on Plessey has been       highlighted in: Inside: Technology [2]; The Economist [3];       &amp; Ingenia [4].
The Economist [3] states: "Plessey's       other big venture is light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for lighting homes and       offices... Plessey is up against mighty competitors like GE, Philips,       Samsung and Siemens.
Mr LeGoff (Managing Director, Plessey) says Plessey       has an edge.
It can make LED lights at a fraction of the cost of rivals,       thanks to a unique process developed at Cambridge University."
David Willetts, the Universities &amp; Science Minister, writes in Eight         Great Technologies [5]: "The team led by Professor Sir Colin       Humphreys at Cambridge has developed a new cost-effective way of growing       gallium nitride on silicon, which in turn increases the cost effectiveness       and energy efficiency of LED lighting.
Since lighting accounts for today       20% of all electricity generated in the UK, widespread adoption of LED       lighting would reduce electricity consumption by 10-15%.
And moreover,       these are being manufactured in the UK (using the technology) by Plessey.
Plessey acquired this technology in 2012 and plan to produce 500 million       LEDs a year in Plymouth &#8212; the first manufacturer of LEDs in the UK".
Electronics Weekly [6] states: "Plessey got into white LEDs by       buying University of Cambridge GaN-on-Si spin-out CamGaN... this       is the first production of GaN-on-Si LEDs from any company, and Plessey       has gone from never having made an LED to manufacturing with this advanced       technology in 15 months."
The research of the Humphreys' group has revolutionized the         manufacturing of low-cost high-efficiency LEDs and we expect that the         impact of this work will continue to grow.
Main types of impact     Economic &#8212; Performance of existing business improved       through new products &amp; processes (Plessey, establishing the       UK's first manufacture of LEDs); Spin-out business created (CamGaN       &amp; Intellec, now bought by Plessey with financial benefit for       UCAM &amp; the inventors); Business sector adopted new or         significantly changed technology or process (AIXTRON, market       leader through innovation in GaN-growth technologies); Performance         improved through highly skilled people taking up specialist roles that         draw on their research (members of Humphreys' group joining AIXTRON,       Forge Europa and Plessey).
Society &#8212; Research has contributed to community regeneration       (Forge Europa investment, creating jobs in Cumbria; Plessey       investment, sustaining &amp; creating jobs in Devon).
Environment &#8212; Improved through introduction of new products or         processes (much broader use of LED lighting will significantly       reduce electricity consumption &amp; CO2 emissions).
