     Harmful algal blooms (HABs) generate natural biotoxins that are harmful       to humans who ingest shellfish that have concentrated the toxins in their       flesh.
Examples include paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) of which there       are ~2000 recorded cases annually worldwide, with 15% mortality.
HAB       events can have a catastrophic effect on the sustainable development of       the aquaculture industry worldwide due to economic loss resulting from       regulatory closures of shellfish farms and farmed fish mortalities.
HAB research by Prof. Davidson's team underpins monitoring programmes and       advice to the Crown Estate, Food Standards Agency (FSA), aquaculture       businesses and industry bodies such as Seafood Shetland to ensure UK       shellfish safety, human health and economically sustainable aquaculture1.
Research by Prof. Davidson's team to track and study the 2006 Kareina       bloom led to the development and implementation in 2008 of a monitoring       programme to protect finfish aquaculture on the Scottish west coast.
As       blooms of this organism move around the coast, monitoring provides early       warning to allow the industry to plan finfish husbandry operations and the       routing of fish transport by well boat.
Operating since 2008, the       programme has been successful in providing early warning of elevated Karenia       densities and hence preventing significant losses/costs to industry.
This       monitoring programme is on-going, commissioned by the Crown Estate and       Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.
Prof. Davidson's team also       developed, on behalf of the Crown Estate, a report which provides a series       of recommendations on predicting the progression of Karenia along       the Scottish coastline and the potential impact for fish farming2.
Published in 2009, the report provides finfish aquaculture businesses with       advice on how to reduce the impact of Karenia blooms through       operational changes such as cessation of feeding and reduction in fishfarm       husbandry during bloom events.
The FSA, the regulatory body responsible for monitoring food safety,       monitor biotoxin producing phytoplankton for aquaculture safety.
Prof.       Davidson's research on understanding the ecology and environmental       interaction of key shellfish poisoning causative genera (Pseudo-nitzchia       and Alexandrium) has been used to inform FSA shellfish monitoring       policy, and since 2005 Prof. Davidson has led the operation of the FSA       Official Control Biotoxin Producing Phytoplankton Monitoring Programme3,4,8.
This programme is on-going and in compliance with the EU shellfish hygiene       directive that requires all shellfish harvesting countries to monitor the       abundance of potential biotoxin producing phytoplankton to ensure       shellfish safety and safeguard human health.
Knowledge of the temporal and       spatial trends of important harmful algal species gained from Prof.       Davidson's research was used to developed a network of inshore       representative monitoring points (RMPs) that are currently monitored on a       weekly basis to give optimal country-wide spatial and temporal coverage of       HAB events in shellfish harvesting areas.
Weekly water samples from 36       monitoring sites are tested for a number of biotoxic phytoplankton.
This       data is reported against regulatory thresholds and used by the FSA to       determine whether shellfish are safe to be marketed in the UK or abroad3,4,8.
Additional Impacts:             Provision of advice to the aquaculture industry: Since 2006         Prof. Davidson's team has worked closely with European aquaculture         businesses, most notably Seafood Shetland5, to develop and         evaluate methods of HAB early warning and of detecting shellfish         toxicity.
This included the evaluation of commercially available,         Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits for the determination of         Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP).
This evaluation, as part of an EU         consortium, recommended commercial use of DSP-ELISA to be replaced by a         protein phosphatase based method due to erroneously high toxin readings         in the former method.
Recommendations were presented at a project         meeting in Shetland (2011) to aquaculture regulators and operators from         Scotland, Norway, Ireland and Faroe Islands5.
Informing standards: Commissioned by the UK National Reference         Laboratory (UKNRL) for Biotoxins, UHI in collaboration with the         Agri-Food Biosciences Institute (AFBI) reviewed monitoring of the algae         thought to produce azisporacid shellfish toxins.
This review paper was         presented to the UKNRL for Biotoxins and was used as a template for the         regulatory monitoring of these organisms6.
Prof. Davidson's         team was subsequently commissioned by the FSA to develop a molecularly         based method of identification and numeration of Azadinium.
This         method was completed in April 2013 and its implementation is currently         being reviewed.
Advice to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea           (ICES): ICES, an intergovernmental organisation, provides         scientific advice to governments on the use and management of the marine         environment.
Since 2007 Prof. Davidson has been a member of the ICES         Working Group on Harmful Algal Bloom Dynamics7.
UHI hosted         the 2012 annual ICES Working Group Meeting which reported fish-killing         algal events in ICES regions7.
This report is used by ICES to         advise member states on HAB issues and management.
