     Rooted in over 20 years of research at the Slade, Phyllida Barlow's       approach to sculpture       represents a new and appropriate response to an age of austerity.
Her       choice of materials -       recycled and taken from familiar, non-art, urban contexts, and her use of       paint &#8212; is one of the ways       that her work promotes new forms of engagement with sculpture, including       debate about its value.
She creates a dialogue/tension between the experience of the sculpture in       the gallery and the       everyday, familiar experience and visual vocabulary of non-art objects and       materials in the urban       space outside.
The scale, impermanence, site specificity and       precariousness of her work expand       on this tension.
Since her retirement in October 2009, Barlow has continued to develop and       meditate on the same       research questions and themes she formulated during her time at UCL.
As an       Evening Standard       review of her 2011 show at Hauser and Wirth notes: "There is... an energy       about Barlow's       exhibitions that evokes an art that has been honed over several decades       and suddenly unleashed"       [1].
The outputs of her underpinning research delivered a range of       benefits including Barlow's       development of original art and support for innovative forms of         artistic expression.
The       impacts of her work extend to public discussion and debate about the value       of sculpture, prompted       in part by her creation of dialogue and tension between experiencing       sculpture in the gallery, and       the everyday, familiar experience and visual vocabulary of non-art objects       and materials in the       urban space.
The development and exhibition of her work and its capacity       to engage public       audiences in new ways has contributed both to the general cultural         life in the UK and abroad,         and to the success of the cultural and artistic organisations at which         her work is shown.
Her receipt in 2007 of the prestigious Paul Hamlyn Foundation's Award for       Artists enabled Barlow's       further development of the practices for which she is now well known.
These resulted, during the       period leading up to and following her retirement, in a significant series       of exhibitions and       commissions emerging directly from her Slade research.
Those exhibitions enhanced         the offering         provided by the cultural and artistic organisations in which they       have been shown, where they       have reached and contributed to the visitor experiences of very       wide public audiences.
Notable       examples include STINT, [f, above]; STACK, Southbank       Centre, London, 2008 (Southbank Centre       average daily footfall 50k) [2]; BRAKE, One in the Other Gallery,       London, 2009; SWAMP, V22,       London 2010; BLUFF, Studio Voltaire, London 2010; STREET,       Bawag Contemporary, Vienna,       Austria 2010; Nairy Baghramian and Phyllida Barlow, Serpentine       Gallery, London 2010; and       CAST, Kunstverein N&#252;rnberg, Germany 2011.
Since 2010, Barlow has been represented by major international commercial       gallery Hauser and       Wirth, at whose London space she presented the critically acclaimed solo       show RIG in 2011.
This       drew upon the research methods she developed earlier in its use of       everyday materials, in its       approach to scale and in engaging with each nook and cranny of the wide       range of spaces in the       Piccadilly building, from basement safe to attic.
RIG appeared       soon after her 2010 Serpentine       Gallery show, in which Barlow and her co-exhibitor, Nairy Baghramian,       presented a dialogue       between two different, yet related, positions on contemporary sculpture.
The exhibition, which       attracted 43,893 visitors (averaging over 1,100 per day), drew significant       public attention to key       questions explored in her research [3], and both RIG and the       Serpentine show were important       channels for the communication of Barlow's research insights to a wider       audience, and for       engaging that audience in contemporary conversations about the nature of       sculpture.
In addition, it       engaged an already art-interested audience.
Moreover, the Serpentine       exhibition was       accompanied by activities for traditionally harder-to-reach audiences,       including a series of 16       workshops with a total of 492 participants; of these, two were for the New       River College Pupil       Referral Unit (for children excluded from education) and four for Open       Age, a charity for older       people in Westminster.
The impact of Barlow's work on public engagement with issues raised in       her research has been       extended through coverage in media discourse about contemporary art.
BRAKE,       for example, was       reviewed in the Guardian, and RIG received widespread       media coverage, including an interview in       the Financial Times and reviews on many blogs and in the Evening         Standard [1].
Naming it his       exhibition of the week, Ben Luke wrote in the latter: "You'd never       describe the sculptures of this       remarkable artist as figurative, they are resolutely abstract, and yet by       throwing together base and       artless materials into dramatic gestures in the gallery space, she manages       to evoke so eloquently       what it is to inhabit a human body making its way through the world" [1].
The Serpentine exhibition       itself, and the socio-cultural and artistic issues it raised, also       received widespread popular and       critical attention, with national and international media coverage       including in the Independent,       Guardian, Sunday Times, Sculpture and Art         Review [4].
Siege, Barlow's first solo show in New       York (May-June 2012) [5], was shown at the New Museum, Manhattan's only       dedicated       contemporary art museum, and was extremely well received both in the New         York Times and       elsewhere.
Hyperallergenic, a top New York arts `blog-zine' with       250,000 unique visitors per       month, welcomed this `Lesson from an Unknown Master' and called her art       "amongst the best we       have" [5].
Massimiliano Gioni, Associate Director and Director of       Exhibitions at the New Museum       went on to include Barlow's work in The Encyclopedic Palace, the       centrepiece exhibition of the       55th Venice Biennale (1 June-24 November 2013) for which he was Artistic       Director.
Despite her emphasis on impermanence, ephemeral materials and recycling,       Barlow's work is now       much in demand among collectors internationally and has thus provided a significant contribution         to global cultural heritage.
A number of works were acquired by       important national       and international public collections.
The Contemporary Art Society, who       gifted 3 works (with       support from the Art Fund) to Nottingham Castle Museum &amp; Art Gallery       in 2012, described her       practice as reflecting "a distinct new direction in contemporary       sculpture" [6].
Eleven works on       paper (made between 1990-2006) were purchased by Tate in 2012 and 2       sculptural works from       SWAMP were purchased by the Migros Museum f&#252;r Gegenwartskunst,       Zurich in 2010; [6].
Other       collections which have acquired Barlow's work include The Government Art       Collection (2011);       Ludwig Forum f&#252;r Internationale Kunst, Aachen (2012) and the Henry Moore       Institute (2012).
Barlow has made influential contributions to professional and         artistic practice in terms of the       contemporary practice and curation of sculpture.
Her 2007 project What         do artists do?
[e, above],       which drew together 16 artists (including three Slade colleagues),       generated discussion and       debate about the nature of artistic `making' among artists as well as more       widely.
The increasing       acceptance by and influence among art professionals of her       reconceptualisation of the nature and       role of sculpture is demonstrated by the curation and promotion of her       work by three of the world's       most influential museum directors, who share an interest in questions       around sculpture: Hans       Ulrich Obrist (Serpentine Gallery); Kaspar K&#246;nig included her in his last       exhibition at the Museum       Ludwig, Cologne; and Massimiliano Gioni (New Museum), who included her in       the 55th Venice       Biennale as described earlier [7].
It is also demonstrated by her election       to the Royal Academy in       2011 and awards including in 2012 the Award for the Most Significant       Contribution to the       Development of Contemporary Art at the First Kyiv International Biennale       of Contemporary Art,       Ukraine (135k visitors) [8] as well as the award to her in May 2012 of the       Aachen Art Prize, given       bi-annually to an artist `whose works have continually given new impetus       to the international art       scene'.
In making the award, note was made specifically of the `forceful       connection to place' in       Barlow's work [9].
Explaining the jury's decision to make the award, the       Director of the Ludwig       Forum described Barlow as "....somebody who was developing in such an       interesting way a new       term of what sculpture could be, in the very differentiated realm of the       contemporary world.
She's       somebody who is relating in her thinking to sculpture as well as art       theory as well as to notions of       what might public-ness be today: what is a city, how is society       developing?"
[9].
In early summer       2013 it was announced that Phyllida Barlow had been selected for both the       prestigious 2013       Carnegie International and the Tate Britain Duveen Galleries Commission       2014 [7].
