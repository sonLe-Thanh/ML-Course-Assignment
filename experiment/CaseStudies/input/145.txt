     The work undertaken by the School on an evidence-based model for       conservation has profoundly influenced the policy, practice, public       accountability and cost-effectiveness of UK statutory agencies and       international NGOs in recent years.
Since 2004, evidence-based strategic       delivery has been adopted as core policy by Defra, the Joint Nature       Conservation Committee and Natural England, as indicated by strategic       statements between 2007 and 2011; for example the Defra 2011 strategic       policy for biodiversity [7] states:     "A good evidence base is an essential element of delivering the         strategy effectively.
It will help us make sure we are doing the right         thing in the right place, and using our resources effectively, focusing         on action that will have the most impact."
And Natural England [8] states:     "All Natural England's work, from strategy to delivery, is underpinned         and supported by sound evidence".
The School's underpinning research contributed to the UK Government       Parliamentary Office of Science &amp; Technology (POST) briefing [9] and       has galvanised international conservation organisations to adopt an       evidence-based approach to global conservation interventions and policy       (e.g.
[10]).
The Biodiversity Audit Approach, developed in 2010-11, had immediate       impact, assisted by knowledge transfer and engagement with Natural       England, Defra, Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management, Local       Authorities and stakeholders including CLA (Country Land and Business       Assocation), National Farmers Union and Wildlife Trusts.
It was cited as a       case study in POST 379 [9; see Box 2]; provided the evidence-base for the       Forestry Commission to create an open-habitat ecological network in       Breckland, totalling 278 km2, and led to subsequent       Biodiversity Audits that were commissioned to underpin strategic       biodiversity policy across The Broads (850 km2, 2011), the Fens       (3,800 km2, 2012) and the Brecks (2012) [11].
The School's research on biodiversity conservation in Less Developed       Countries has changed national forest policy in Brazil (the world's       largest tropical country) and, to a lesser extent, in Cambodia.
Through       engagement, local community outreach and participation in governmental and       inter-governmental working groups, and adoption of research findings by       environmental advocates Peres' research has had demonstrable       impacts on global, neotropical and national (Brazilian) forestry and       carbon policy, including:            Key evidence for legislative proposals of the Brazilian Forestry Code         in 2012 to retain wider forest buffers along rivers and perennial         streams (riparian ecosystems) within Brazil's 5.3M private landholdings,         in the face of intense counter-lobbying from the agro- business sector         who sought to remove all protection [12].
This resulted in the Law         Project 3460/2008 of 27 May 2008 [13].
On the basis of [14], a consultation process with Secretaria do Meio         Ambiente do Estado do Amazonas (CEUC-SDS) resulted in the geographic         selection and design of Amazonian forest reserves, and the creation of         12 new protected areas in Amazonia (from 2000-2010) accounting for an         additional ~12 million hectares of forest reserves [15]; this comprises         one third of the global expansion of all terrestrial protected areas in         the last two decades.
state government implementation of minimum management standards of         nontimber forest resources, such as Brazil nut trees, in some 21 million         hectares of Amazonian Extractive Reserves [16].
Through advisory work with the Brazilian Ministry of Environment (MMA), Peres       has attended numerous conservation planning workshops, the impacts of       these include defining: (a) a protocol for long-term biodiversity       monitoring in Amazonian forest reserves within Programa ARPA [15]), which       manages 52Mha of forest within 95 Amazonian protected areas; and (b)       biodiversity assessment protocols for Reduced-Impact Logging (RIL; [16])       concessions, upon which large- scale environmental licensing and       certification have become conditional.
Impacts of Dolman's recent work on livelihood-dependent tropical       biodiversity [6] include the establishment in Cambodia protected areas by       Ministerial Decree (2010) covering 173 km2 of floodplain       grassland, and 138 km2 of non-breeding forest habitat to       prevent extinction of the critically endangered Bengal Florican [17, 18].
