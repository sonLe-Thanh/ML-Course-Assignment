     CSG research has been central to how UK government and the NHS have       targeted investment in cancer services and devised strategies to improve       cancer survival and reduce inequalities.
In the period since 2008, CSG members have frequently and on an ongoing       basis been called upon to advise the DH on cancer policy.
This included       working closely with Professor Sir Mike Richards, the government's first       National Cancer Director, mainly through policy-influencing initiatives       such as the National Cancer Action Team (2008-2013), the National Cancer       Policy Team, the Cancer Reform Strategy Advisory Board (April 2010) and       the National Cancer Intelligence Network (Scientific Advisory Panel       2010-2013).5.1     The CSG has also been responsible for producing the UK's annual official       national statistics on cancer survival since 1999, both nationally,       for various NHS geographies,5.2 and for the UK.5.3       Since 2008, this has included close collaboration with the Office for       National Statistics (ONS) analysing and publishing trends and       sociodemographic patterns in cancer survival for major cancers by age, sex       and socioeconomic status in England.
These statistics and research are       used by policy-makers and key stakeholders at national and local levels to       evaluate and update cancer policy.
CSG research estimating the number of avoidable premature deaths arising       from the UK cancer survival deficit relative to Europe featured heavily in       the evidence underpinning the DH's National Awareness and Early         Diagnosis Initiative (NAEDI), launched in November 2008.
Established       as part of the government's strategy to improve cancer outcomes, NAEDI       draws on CSG findings to support its key hypothesis that delays in cancer       diagnosis are linked to poor survival and avoidable deaths in the UK.
As a       result, the government has focused its entire cancer strategy around       `halving the gap' in avoidable premature cancer deaths identified in LSHTM       research.5.4 In its 2011 assessment of NAEDI's impact on NHS       costs and public benefits, the DH found that `earlier diagnosis is       generally cost-effective, but not cost-saving.
If people are diagnosed       earlier ... the benefit is a substantial improvement in health outcomes'.
Building on NAEDI, in 2010, the DH commissioned the CSG to design and       execute survival comparisons for the International Cancer Benchmarking         Partnership, a global partnership aimed at improving cancer survival       outcomes by optimising cancer polices and services, intended to feed       directly into England's national cancer strategy for 2011.
The results of       CSG research were considered so important by the DH that publication of       the government's plans to reform health and care services, Improving           Outcomes: a Strategy for Cancer5.5 was delayed       until the LSHTM-authored article in The Lancet3.4 was       accepted for publication and could be cited in the new strategy.
This       article is the first one listed under `New evidence supporting the       development of this strategy', where it is described thus: `We now have       internationally comparable data which is more robust and up-to-date than       has been possible before'.
The 2010 Beral/Peto criticism of the international survival comparisons,       upon which the government's cancer strategy is based, threatened to       undermine both official and public confidence.
The CSG's independently       initiated research, published in rebuttal in 2011, provided policy-makers       with evidence of the robustness of comparisons derived from the national       cancer registration data for England.3.3 The DH initiated its       own review of the cancer registration scheme, but considered the CSG's       peer-reviewed research as the strongest plank of evidence for the       strategic utility of cancer registration in cancer control policy.5.1     In January 2013, the CSG was commissioned by the DH to develop interim       metrics to evaluate progress toward the central target in national cancer       control policy (i.e.
to `save 5,000 lives' a year by 2014-2015.)
CSG       researchers developed several such metrics, and wrote Annex C of the       second annual report of the DH's 2012 report, Improving Outcomes: A           Strategy for Cancer.5.6 The DH then commissioned       the CSG to update these estimates with the results of the EUROCARE-5 study       in 2013, to assess progress in reducing the survival deficit.
Additional commissions from the DH during the REF's impact period include       the production of the indicators of cancer survival specified for the NHS       Outcomes Framework5.7 and the indicators of cancer survival for       the Clinical Commissioning Groups Outcome Indicator Set;5.8       both in January 2013.
Such has been the relevance of CSG's cancer survival research that during       the REF's impact period, Coleman has delivered invited presentations or       keynote lectures at more than 50 major national and international       conferences and meetings for policy-makers and stakeholders at the highest       levels.5.9 He has also been regularly called upon by national       and international media to provide expert information based on the CSG's       research.5.10
