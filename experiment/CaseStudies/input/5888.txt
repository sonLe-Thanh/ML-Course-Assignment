     (a) Screening for depression in primary care     Prior to the conduct and dissemination of our work, guidance issued by       NICE (source 1) and international bodies such as the US Agency for       Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (source 2) had been       supportive of screening for depression.
In the UK, since 2005 General       Practitioners were paid to screen for depression in certain populations       under the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) (the `DEP 1 indicator').
Our research showed that this strategy was ineffective and inefficient.
Our outputs generated debate both nationally and internationally,       prompting editorials in the BMJ (source 3) and the Canadian Medical       Association Journal (source 4).
National impact     (i) The National Screening Committee (NSC), which oversees screening       programmes in the NHS, reversed its policy recommendations on the       effectiveness of screening for depression in primary care using our work       as the primary source of evidence (source 5).
The 2010 NSC       evidence-based policy cites and updates our work: "This paper uses         evidence published up to June 2009 to update the review by Gilbody et al         of the performance of screening for depression....Routine screening of         the population or subsets of the population for depression is now not         recommended by the UK NSC."
(source 5);     (ii) NICE's 2009 guidelines for depression (CG90) now recommend against       routine screening and cite our Cochrane reviews as the main source of       evidence (source 6), reversing previous policy;     (iii) In 2011 the body which oversees the Quality and Outcomes Framework       (QOF) ceased to incentivise screening for depression, and `retired' and       `revised' the QOF DEP indicators, citing York-led research to conclude `case-finding         for depression as a routine strategy has not been shown to improve         outcomes, or process measures, based on high quality evidence' (source         7).
The annual costs of supporting the QOF DEP indicators were &#163;8.4M       (source 8).The revision of QOF indicators has improved the use of       NHS resources.
International impact       Our reviews are also cited in evidence summaries in other healthcare       systems, demonstrating the international reach of our work.
The Agency for       Healthcare Research and Quality and the US Preventative Services Task       Force (two of the most influential and respected federally-funded       organisations in the USA) refer to our research in their 2009 revision of       depression guidelines, where a reversal of policy is made on the basis of       our reviews (source 9).
(b) Effective and efficient strategies to manage depression in primary         care     National impact       The first iteration of guidance from the National Institute of Health and       Care Excellence (NICE) in 2004 did not mention collaborative care.
Our       research helped produce a wholesale shift in emphasis towards primary care       led strategies with improved access to more effective care and improved       outcomes for the substantial section of the population who suffer from       depression.
(i) NICE revised its guidelines on the management of depression in 2009       and 2011 and our research is cited (47 times in the most recent guidance)       as evidence of the effectiveness of collaborative care as an       organisational model (sources 6 &amp; 10).
(ii) Our research also formed the evidential basis for an influential       handbook for NHS commissioners on the configuration/specification of       primary care for depression which helped to change practice over the REF       period (source 11) `This handbook seeks to provide guidance on         a model of care for depression in line with the current evidence       (cites Gilbody's reviews).'
(iii) There has been NHS-wide improved access to psychological therapies       (IAPT) for depression as a result of a major UK policy shift and       investment initiated in 2006.
York's research was directly cited as the       evidence underpinning the first `demonstration sites' in Doncaster (source         12).
Due to the success of field trials this programme was scaled up       and one million NHS patients received new episodes of care under the IAPT       by 2013 (source 13).
(iv) York developed a secure and responsive computer support system to       record treatments and track patient progress over time (Primary Care       Management Information System &#8212; PC-MIS&#169;).
This formed the       central I support for our collaborative care trials (www.pc-mis.co.uk/).
PC-MIS&#169;has been widely adopted; it is being used in 69 NHS       trusts and has recorded the outcome of over one million patient episodes       (over six million individual patient contacts) since roll out in 2006 (source         14).
(v) We pioneered the analysis of PC-MIS IAPT clinical outcome data to       'benchmark' local clinical performance against national standards.
This       system of service-level evaluations was adopted nationally and forms a       national template to allow mental health services to engage in `Payment by       Results' based on reliable and statistically significant measures of       clinical change (source 15).
The metrics of treatment success which       York researchers developed though PC-MIS&#169; are now the `gold       standard outcome' for IAP `Payment by Results' (source 16), which       is being rolled out across the NHS, having initially been piloted in 23       sites in the UK.
International impact       Our research is cited in international guidelines in the US, Canada,       Europe and Australia.
York's evidence synthesis, for example, formed an       organising principle in the US Veterans Affairs services for depression (source         17) and influenced (and was cited in) the 2009 revision of       depression guidelines by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality       &amp; US Preventative Services Task Force (source 9).
York's 2006       review is cited as the evidential basis for a US-wide training programme       led from the University of Washington (the IMPACT evidence based         depression care programme www.impact-uw.org).
(`A meta-analysis of the evidence for collaborative depression care was         published by Gilbody, et al ...concluded that sufficient randomized         evidence had emerged by 2000 to demonstrate the effectiveness of         collaborative care beyond conventional levels of statistical         significance.
...and it is unlikely that further randomized evidence         will overturn this result.'
(Source 18).
This programme of       training and organisational enhancement for depression has now been       implemented in 31 states in the USA, and has been adopted by a number of       US healthcare providers, including Kaiser Permanente (serving over 3       million people) and the Institute for Urban Family Health) (source 18).
