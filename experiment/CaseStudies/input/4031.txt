     Impact is integrally linked to the research process because involvement       of clinicians and service users was written into all grants.
GRiST's       evolution in collaboration with end users, both prior to and post       implementation of the CDSS, provided a direct and immediate route for       research into practice.
GRiST helps mental health practitioners, service users, and carers detect       and explain risks associated with mental-health problems to reduce       suicides, self-harming, neglect, and violence.
It has changed practice by       replacing paper risk tools and word-processed electronic documents that do       not structure information or analyse the results.
It formalises data       collection, provides visual cues for where risks originate, analyses and       displays graphs of risks over time, enables customised risk reports       generated automatically from the data, and compares individual risk       judgements with expert consensus to improve accuracy and alert assessors       to potential errors.
Economic impact has come from GRiST licences and       training.
Clinical education impact comes from GRiST's risk explanations       during use and through workshops attended by healthcare professionals.
Health impact             Use by healthcare providers in the period from 1/1/2011 to           31/7/2013: 2,152 mental-health practitioners have used GRiST on         52,334 patients and completed 285,426 individual risk assessments [5.1,         sponsors].
GRiST is used in secondary care (mental-health         hospitals) in the NHS (Humber NHS Foundation Trust, Cumbria Partnership         Trust, Birmingham Children's Hospital) and private sector (Raphael         Healthcare, Craegmoor Hospital group, Barchester Healthcare).
In primary           care and the community, GRiST is being used in the NHS Improving         Access for Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in Cumbria         Partnership Trust, Lincoln Partnership Foundation Trust, Coventry and         Warwickshire Partnership Trust, East Riding Psychological Wellbeing         Service, and the Hull IAPT service.
Mental-health charities (Mental         Health Matters, mcch, Imagine Mental Health, Welmede Housing         Association) have over 200 practitioners using GRiST for mental-health         provision.
Use by service users for self-assessments (1/1/2012 to 31/7/2013):         The self-assessment version of GRiST, myGRiST, has been trialled by mcch         and Imagine charities, Lincoln IAPT, and two GP practices (190 service         users in the time period).
Positive feedback has been received from GPs         ("it gave me a very detailed picture of how he is feeling and helped me         empathise with him.
It led to a useful consultation", 2012, [5.3]) and         service users ("I found myGRiST a helpful way to explore my own         vulnerability ...
I would have benefitted from using this tool when I         first started to suffer from suicidal ideation", 2012, [5.1,         testimonials; 5.3]).
Continuous improvement of clinical practice (1/1/2011 to           31/7/2013): GRiST is being delivered to mental-health         organisations as a cloud-computing service from Aston University.
The         database enables analysis of how mental-health clinicians make risk         judgements.
Results feed directly back into practice through the GRiST         CDSS and have generated international interest for collaboration [5.4,         5.5].
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention [5.6] said the         research "has potential for exceptional impact from the perspective of         clinical care, patient outcomes, and public health" (2012).
Practitioners and organisations have confirmed how much GRiST helps         their clinical practice [5.1, testimonials; 5.3, 5.7].
Raising awareness and understanding among healthcare professionals           (1/1/2008 to 31/7/2013): GRiST has been presented at international         workshops attended by mental-health practitioners and service users in         Boston, USA [5.4], the US Department of Veterans Affairs [invited         speaker, 5.4], Orange, Bathhurst (Kenote speaker, "Rural and Remote"         mental-health conference [5.5]), Moree, Newcastle, and Dubbo in         Australia [5.5], and more than 30 venues around Europe [5.1, timeline],         including a conference (May, 2013) hosted by GRiST at Aston for         mental-health service providers and commissioners [5.1, timeline].
International outcomes include GRiST being used in America by the North         Carolina, Department of Health and Human Services in a mental-health         clinical decision making study (2009, [5.8]) and plans are underway for         piloting myGRiST for self-assessments in New South Wales, Australia         [5.5].
GRiST is an example of a tool following best practice given in         guidance by the Department of Health (2007, but updated in 2009 and         still followed by UK Trusts [5.2]) and the Irish Health Service         Executive [2009, 5.2].
Economic impact             Improving market potential for patient-record companies: Mayden         [5.9] is a company providing patient record software, IAPTus, for two         thirds of the English NHS IAPT services, which offer psychological         support as part of primary care.
IAPTus had no validated risk tool until         GRiST was linked to it in 2012, which has improved IAPTus functionality.
Three IAPT services already use GRiST via IAPTus (July 2012 to July         2013) and negotiations are underway for 5 more, with the licence fee         shared between GRiST and Mayden.
Improving market potential for private health companies: GRiST         is being used by 7 private hospitals and care homes (one in Ireland),         increasing potential for patient referrals because they can point to a         validated risk tool, which they did not previously possess [5.1, GRiST         sponsors].
Training: All the charities using GRiST and Cumbria NHS Trust         have paid for external GRiST training (1/1/2010-31/7/2013, [5.10]).
