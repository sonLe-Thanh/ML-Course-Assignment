     During the period 2008-12 the group has placed particular emphasis on       achieving societal impact employing an experienced homicide detective to       assist.
The beneficial impact of our gang violence reduction work on local       communities has received widespread media coverage.
M1, M2       Police and Local authority leadership are clear about the importance of       our contribution.
Since the start of our 2008 evaluation and the       publication of our 2011 results we have changed Police and Social Work,       attitudes, policy and tactics.
We have substantially altered what these       professional groups think is possible in dealing with violent young men.
For example an, Assistant Chief Constable at the Scottish Police Service       explains how we have helped the police see that violence is not inevitable       but can be prevented S1     "Working with police colleagues, Professor Donnelly and his team           have revolutionised expectations as to what is possible.
The team have           recast violence not just as a Public Health issue but one that           actually can in many instances be prevented.
The results of the CIRV           Programme were praised by the Prime Minister in Parliament and the           subject of a visit by the Home Secretary in the wake of the London           riots.
Police Forces elsewhere have been encouraged to learn from           Glasgow's experiences with its record fall in offending."
Our work has changed the way social workers practice and how they are       managed such that they now focus on what these young men can contribute to       society rather than what trouble they may have caused in the past as the       Head of Social Work Services in North East Glasgow explains.S2     "I have used Professor Donnelly's research to inform the practice           of Social Workers and managers across the service I manage.......(His)           work helps to demonstrate what can be achieved in terms of true           collaborative working in this area, when individuals, communities and           professionals focus on positive reinforcement as opposed to deficit           models of working with young people involved in gang violence.
The           value of the work undertaken by Professor Donnelly and his team cannot           be overstated."
The fundamental impact of this work since late 2008/ early 2009 has been       that lives are saved and injury caused by violent crime is reduced.
The       head of community safety for the Scottish Government is very clear that we       are beneficially impacting on violent crime rates S3     "I have had very direct experience of the work done by Professor           Peter Donnelly and his group at the University of St Andrews on           violence reduction over the past few years.
As policy lead for           violence reduction for the Scottish Government, I am happy to confirm           that this important work has had a direct impact on our policy and           practice in the area of violence reduction, which has helped           contribute to a 38 year low in recorded violent crime."
The impact has been developed internationally.
This is particularly true       in the Western Cape Province of South Africa who following visits from us       2009-11 now have a cross Government violence reduction strategy for the       very first time.
A violence reduction expert at the University of Cape       Town writes S4     ".......with regard to the impact of Prof. Donnelly's work in the           field of violence reduction.
There is no question that he and his           research group at the University of St Andrews are having impact           internationally.
It is a measure of the impact of his work and that of           his team, and the respect they have earned internationally, that he is           often asked to take senior leadership roles in meetings of the           Violence Prevention Alliance."
In addition Donnelly was one of two subject experts invited to address a       closed-door meeting of senior Republican and Democratic politicians on the       issue of firearms and injury in San Diego in August 2013.
He has been       selected to design and lead a special Board highlighted 90-minute session       on the Sandy Hook School shootings at the 2013 American Public Health       Association meeting (typical attendance 13,000) involving key individuals       present on the day of the shootings and relevant gun control experts.
These are both highly unusual honours for a non-US citizen.
Much more       importantly they seek to use research to reduce violent deaths.
Working       closely with the World Health Organisation (2008-13) we are helping other       nations realise that violence reduction is possible and are helping them       develop strategies and interventions.
A WHO official speaks to this impact       S5     "Through his regular and important contribution to the VPA steering           committee, to VPA Project Groups (such as the project group on           preventing violence in weak institutional settings), and to the annual           VPA meetings and Milestones in a Global Campaign for Violence           Prevention meetings (many of which he has chaired), Professor Donnelly           has had a very significant influence over the shaping of international           violence prevention policy."
Our leadership in this area of work resulted in a commission from Oxford       University Press to edit a book of international violence research       contributions and this nears completion.
The most important impact is the effect on young men most at risk of       drifting into a life of violence.
We dramatically change their life       trajectories and consequently the impact they have on others and on       society.
The quotation below from a young man involved in the project       illustrates this (Edited version taken from the CIRV final report,       reference 2 in section 3 of this document).
"When I got to 14, I started carrying knives and it became a bit           more serious because I wasn't stood at the back watching any more.
I           was at the front, looking to do damage and not caring.
By the age of           15, I was involved in selling drugs and was taking cocaine, Valium and           Ecstasy.
My parents had serious addiction problems and they found it           difficult to provide for me and my young brother.
Your gang becomes           your family.
At 15 I was expelled from school for violence against a           teacher.
It was at that point I got involved with guns."
"By 17 I was in prison for a firearms charge.
I did three and a           half years.
When I got out I got involved with their football coaching           programme.
From there, I heard about the CIRV East End Football League           and got together a group of local boys to enter a team.
Through being           involved with the football, I found out more about CIRV, got involved           with them and started giving workshops to help others break away from           gangs.
I'm now a Peer Advocate, working with gangs on a daily basis."
"It takes a lot of courage to change.
You're throwing away           everything you've ever stood for, and it's hard to leave your pals and           say I don't want a part of that.
But I'm glad I did.
The future's           looking pretty bright now.
I'm training an amateur football side, I've           got a baby and I don't touch drugs.
If I hadn't changed, I'd probably           be dead, or serving a long prison sentence.
I know I wouldn't be           anywhere I would want to be.
If I can do it so can these guys.
Working           with them is a better buzz than any drug."
