     Long-term contribution to UN and aid agency activity in Sudan and with         Sudanese refugees     James' research has had considerable impact for many years, beginning       with her frequent consultancy roles and fact-finding visits from the late       1980s onward.
Already known to the UNHCR and Ethiopian authorities, having       played a role in their 1993 decision to move the Uduk refugees from their       transit camp to a formal refugee scheme at Bonga further inside Ethiopia,       she then prepared an official Progress Report for this scheme in 1994.
This was followed by a Community Development consultancy for a Dutch       organization in 2000.
James' work by this time had drawn public attention       to the fact that the civil war was affecting a large area and population       within the BN region, not just a few ethnic groups as had previously been       perceived.
In 2003, she was appointed by the UK government to act as a       Resource Person for the BN in the Sudan peace negotiations in Kenya.
In 2010, with a small number of other scholars, James was invited to       present aspects of recent research [R2,R3] to a meeting in Juba,       southern Sudan, with officials of the UN Mission in Sudan; here she spoke       specifically on security issues still facing the BN in the aftermath of       the 2005 peace settlement.
This followed a week as tutor on a Rift Valley       Institute (RVI) field training course, during which she gave seminars on       the effects of war and displacement for the people of `transitional' areas       like the BN.
The two dozen attendees included senior and junior members of       development agencies, both Sudanese and international, and several       diplomats.
The Director of the RVI confirms: "James' original published       research established a place for the peoples of Blue Nile in the world of       learning; her documentation of their subsequent fate in Sudan's continuing       civil wars is an exemplary case of an ethnographer keeping company through       changing circumstances with the subjects of their research.
"[Section 5:         C1]     Building on this long-term impact and the wide reach and reputation of       her academic work, James' research has had impact in two further key ways       since 2011:     Assisting emergency aid and human rights agencies by improving public         understanding of the fresh BN crisis     On South Sudan's secession in July 2011, the UN presence in BN was       terminated, although demobilization of former fighters was incomplete.
Within two months, returnees faced aerial and ground attacks.
The majority       crossed the new border to South Sudan; by mid-2013, five new camps had       been set up there.
Within this context, James was contacted by M&#233;decins           Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) in March 2012, and following       considerable email correspondence, the Humanitarian Advisor of the Analysis           &amp; Advocacy Unit in Brussels wrote that she was "in the       middle of reading War and Survival with much interest and       pleasure.
We have ordered two copies also for the field teams, as there is       much interest to understand more about the region and the populations with       whom we work.
This book, and your extensive comments, are a perfect point       of departure for myself and the teams.
"[C2] As a result of this       correspondence, James was then invited to speak at a meeting in London for       MSF staff, including the former MSF Head of Mission for Darfur, and CNN       journalists (circa 30 attendees).
James' research [R3] was       welcomed and provoked discussion regarding problems encountered in South       Sudan's brand-new camps for BN refugees.
MSF staff asked (among other       questions) why there were differences in behaviour between the camps.
James was able to explain that those in the more southerly camps, like the       Uduk, had already spent a generation as refugees in Ethiopia, and were       familiar with all the bureaucratic procedures of the aid world; further       north, the majority were Ingessana, and had not had the same experience of       mass exile, nor previous neighbourly contacts with the Maban.
A summary of       James' contributions was included in the MSF newsletter of 21 March 2012.
[C3]     In January 2013, the Danish Demining Group of the Danish       Refugee Council reported on the new camps in Maban county.
In emphasizing       the cultural history of various BN refugee groups, they drew on an earlier       report by James on the Uduk for the Minority Rights Group (1995) (www.minorityrights.org/download.php?id=881c)       illustrating the relevance of the war years for the new crisis.
[C4]     As the counter-insurgency in BN escalated further in early 2013, several       high-profile human rights organizations (already well known for work in       Darfur) undertook investigations on the ground and produced reports: of       these the most consequential was by Amnesty International.
The       key field investigators came to Oxford to consult James for their       forthcoming report `"We had no time to bury them": War Crimes in Sudan's       Blue Nile State' [C5], which included local interviews alongside       satellite photos of bombed villages.
They use James' War &amp;         Survival [R3] as a key source illustrating the roots of the       new BN conflicts [C5, pp.12, 64].
The lead author of the       report writes that James' book "was crucial in establishing a base of         knowledge ... on the sociopolitical makeup and the history of that         region....
Her command of local languages provided unmatched insight...
Her description of past conflict patterns ... provided our team with         important intuitions ...
It also sensitized us to local perceptions and         cultural sensitivities, enabling us to interact with inhabitants of Blue         Nile in a considerate manner.
Upon our return ... we used James' works         as important reference tools.
We were able to check specific testimonies         against broader historical patterns as described in her works, and to         locate particular locations mentioned to us by witnesses.
"[C6]     The Amnesty report has had wide publicity, their office recently       mentioning coverage in 41 media sources.
The report prompted Lord Alton in       the House of Lords to ask what assessment the Government had made of the       situation in the BN, and to demand that the government do more to respond       to the suffering of the BN people and other victims of Sudanese government       bombardment.
[C7] A further 60-page report by the International           Crisis Group, `Sudan's spreading conflict (II): War in Blue       Nile' (2013) also refers to James' 2009 book.
[R3; C8, pp.
3,       33]     Promoting cultural continuity among Blue Nile refugee communities     James' research has helped sustain cultural continuity among BN refugees       in the diaspora.
Her multimedia archive project `Voices from the Blue       Nile' [Section 3] opens up rich research-based materials,       including video, audio, photographic and cartographic material, to BN       refugee communities, and to institutions concerned with their welfare.
The       website materials already online, mainly documenting life in the Bonga       refugee camp, have been effective in promoting cultural continuity and       historical awareness.
For example, Uduk communities in North America       invited James in 2012 to a Salt Lake City (SLC) Fourth of July reunion of       Uduk families from across the continent, primarily to talk to the rising       generation about their history and culture.
James' contribution to the       event included three presentations drawing on her audio-visual archive,       using materials not yet available on the website.
A mentor for the       expatriate Uduk and Maban community associated with a prominent SLC church       writes: "Your Power-Point presentations of the history of the Uduk         peoples and their village culture were the first view of that era that         any here had ever seen.
We digitally preserved copies of that         presentation so that their children and their children's schildren shall         never be deprived of that knowledge...
When you... sent me one of the         two known original Uduk/Twampa dictionaries, original language primers         from 1956, and .WAV files of recordings of language and music from the         1960's... those are priceless!...
All of this is being written to DVD's         so that each refugee family may have copies of this history... Wendy, I         had never appreciated what could be done with anthropology!..."
[C9]     It is planned to deposit the original audio and visual materials from       James' research in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, as a contribution to       their growing Sudan collections.
These will be shared, facilitating       engagement, with the source community.
In a recent illustrated article,       collaborators Judith Aston and Paul Matthews (UWE) describe their approach       to further expanding access and participation in curating and using these       resources, for example by enabling informants to respond to James'       commentary, and "to contribute their own recordings to the presentation,       as a means of extending the narrative.
"[C10] A spontaneous tribute       from a former refugee to the value of James' work appeared online in 2010:       "As a native from southern Blue Nile (Uduk land) I greatly wondered       whether I will once have information such as Wendy's about my homeland       stories and events.
I am very grateful to those wonderful people scholars       who have given us a hope to feel and aspire.
"[C11]
