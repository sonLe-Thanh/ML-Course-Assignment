     Advanced thermal barrier coating systems (TBCs) made at Cranfield have       improved the thermal efficiency of large civil aero-gas turbines [P1-3,       C1].
Specific fuel consumption (SFC) has been reduced by over 1% [P2, P3]       with consequent CO2 reduction, by introducing doped TBCs,       involving the incorporation of Lanthanide-based oxides.
TBC technology has allowed Rolls-Royce to not only maintain, but increase       its market share for large civil aircraft engines [C2].
To support the       introduction and application of advanced thermal barrier coatings in the       Trent family of engines, Rolls-Royce plc entered a joint venture with       Chromalloy (UK) Ltd, to build a new coating facility in Nottinghamshire,       UK.
The facility, Turbine Surface Technologies Ltd., will undertake all       coating manufacture with these advanced compositions, ensuring the I.P.
is       protected for the UK [C3].
The adoption of `power by the hour'       (availability based) services further protects this technology by ensuring       only Rolls-Royce plc approved contractors undertake any engine       maintenance.
Through the adoption of Cranfield's `low K' thermal barrier coating       technologies, the thermal conductivity of such EB-PVD TBCs is reduced from       1.8-2.0W/mK to 1.0-1.2W/mK, permitting a 170oC temperature drop       across the 200&#181;m thick EB-PVD TBC.
Commercial variants of these new low-K       thermal barrier coatings are now specified and implemented on the       Rolls-Royce Trent engine series, the most powerful of the Rolls-Royce       engines [C3, C4].
Further, a net result of adopting this new technology       will be the growth in Rolls-Royce market share of the large civil engine       market.
This is accepted by Rolls-Royce [C4] but its value is commercially       sensitive.
A series of new multi-layered coatings for engine test have been produced       by Cranfield and have been run in Rolls-Royce development engines [G5,       C3], proving the technology for incorporation in future high performance       Trent family (Trent 1000 and Trent XWB) engines.
The `Carbon Brainprint' case study [C1, 5], quantified the long-term       impact of Cranfield's thermal barrier coating research for two Rolls-Royce       engines used in large civil aircraft:     - Trent 700, introduced 1995, used on about half the Airbus A330 aircraft       currently in service;     - Trent 500, introduced 2002, used on all Airbus A340-500 and A360-600       aircraft.
In fuel costs alone, the whole-life saving amounts to &#163;3.4 billion to the       aircraft operators, in addition to saving 14MtCO2e in       greenhouse gas emissions over the 20 year life of these engines.
Using the       data from the `Carbon Brainprint' case study [C1,5] an estimate of the       commercial benefits over the time frame of REF'14 has been made.
First,       the level of greenhouse gas emissions has been considered, in order of       magnitude: carbon dioxide from combustion of the fuel, emissions during       extraction and refining of the fuel, and emissions of the other greenhouse       gases during combustion.
The best estimates of the current emissions [P6]       for individual aircraft were as follows:                                                     A330           A340-500           A340-600           Total fleet                             tCO2e/year           1016           1574 		  1646           568,000                          Thus over the period Jan 2008 to July 2013, for these two engines on       three aircraft platforms, the savings is already 3.12MtCO2e (in       fuel cost terms, a &#163;750 million saving to the fuel bill).
Looking to the future, including all the aircraft on order, the       prospective emissions reduction is 833ktCO2e/year.
Assuming a       service life of 20 years, then the total saving is approximately 17MtCO2e       or saving &#163;1.15 billion in fuel cost terms.
Two adjustments are made:     - a reduction in effectiveness of 18%, assuming that older       engines do not and will not benefit from the improvement to thermal       resistance as a result of this technology;     - but the effect of emissions at high altitude would increase the       calculated benefits to 26.6MtCO2e, over the period considered       in REF'14, a total saving &#163;1.8 billion in fuel cost.
The phosphorescent `self diagnostic' TBCs are marketed by Southside       Thermal Science (STS) Ltd, a spin-out company based at Imperial College       [C6].
With the TBS technology it is possible to measure remote, real-time,       non-contact on-line temperatures in harsh conditions such as through       flames, without disrupting gas flow, which could not be done with       traditional methods.
The accuracy is better than 5&#176;C. The method allows       industrial users of high temperature processes new ways of monitoring,       controlling and tuning their burners and flow paths.
In a further       cooperative development with RWE npower, LAND Instruments and Cranfield       University, temperature measurements were carried out at Cranfield in a       Viper engine on nozzle guide vanes, in a combustion chamber and on rotor       blades rotating up to 13,500 rotations per minute, [C6-8].
STS in       collaboration with Cranfield was granted a worldwide patent for the method       [C9].
