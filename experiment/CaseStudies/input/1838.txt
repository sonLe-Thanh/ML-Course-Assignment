     The impact of the research is through evidence-led policy making in       several organisations.
Primary and secondary data collected and subsequent       analyses have fed into development of policies by local and central       government, the OECD and other key stakeholders such as the Federation of       Small Businesses, and the Oxford Science Park.
Examples of engagement and       dissemination with key users and beneficiaries are given below.
The reach       is international and diverse in the range of organisations which have used       the research in informing policy development.
Local/regional            OEO Research has been cited in policy work at regional and local         levels starting with inputs into the South East England Development         Agency policy documents such as the Regional Economic Strategy Plan         (1999).
This led to OEO research being cited and used locally, for         example by Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford City Council of the OEO         Quarterly Economic updates.
OEO's work has continuously had an impact on         policy formation, until recently being the major source of data on         economic activity in the county (5.4, 5.5, 5.7).
Lawton Smith has worked closely with the locally, very influential,         charitable trust, The Oxford Trust (now Science Oxford) since the         mid-1980s, contributing to their policy documents and subsequent         actions, a relationship formalised with the establishment of OEO in 2001         (5.5).
The Federation of Small Businesses Oxfordshire Branch commissioned OEO         to undertake a study of The Economic Ecology of Small Businesses in           Oxfordshire.
This formed part of the FSB's on-going local strategy         to sustaining high growth local economic development (5.6).
Lawton Smith was a member of the Manchester Development Panel &amp;         contributor to the Report of the Panel on Strengthening Greater         Manchester's Economic Base Through Science, and Research and Development         (August 2011).
OEO was cited in report as a model intelligence gathering         and analysis organisation.
Lawton Smith was subsequently invited to be         an Expert Witness at the Northern Economic Futures Commission Meeting,         Port of Tyne, 13th December 2011.
This led to the agreement         to collect more and better data to support their changes in policy (5.1).
National            By way of illustrating context to the impact period, relevant         background is the contribution of Lawton Smith and Waters to the DTI's         2003 Skills Strategy.
The contribution is based on Seminar 6: Regional           capacity and strategy to deliver skills change (Waters &amp;         Lawton Smith), Skills and Competitiveness in Oxfordshire and           Cambridgeshire: Scientific Labour Markets.
The implementation of         the DTI skills strategy (2003-2010) includes, in part, the impact period         during which a set of new approaches to the problems of regional skill         imbalances was pursued throughout England and Wales.
NESTA became interested in where and how innovation takes place in         order to fulfil its mission of promoting innovation in the UK.
They         invited Lawton Smith and Glasson (OEO) to contribute to a report Local           knowledge: case studies of four innovative places was made         available to all regions nationally and internationally (5.6).
Examples of contribution international policy-making            Lawton Smith gave an invited keynote, `The impact of tertiary           education on urban development' OECD International Conference on         City Competitiveness, Tenerife, March 3 and 4 2005, and the invited         paper, `The Oxfordshire Cluster' on Clusters and Entrepreneurship:         Lessons of Seven International Case Studies in 51st session         OECD Cooperative Action programme on Local Economic Development and         Employment Development (LEED) Paris November 22 2007.
Although prior to         the impact period, these led to reframing OECD member countries'         approaches to universities' roles in regional development and this is an         on-going process (5.3, 5.7).
Lawton Smith was invited as an international expert to present on Science           Vale (Oxfordshire) at an OECD workshop on Innovation Systems and         Entrepreneurship in the city of Kristiansand, Agder (Norway), 20         February 2009.
This led to revised policy recommendations for the Agder         region (5.2).
Lawton Smith was a member of an expert panel for an OECD assessment of         "SME and Entrepreneurship issues and policies at national and local           levels in Mexico" (October 2011).
OECD reports that this led to         the Ministry of the Economy establishing the New National Institute of         Entrepreneurship (INE) in 2012/13 including the creation of a National         Entrepreneurship Observatory (5.3).
