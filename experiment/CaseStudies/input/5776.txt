     The results of the research were submitted to the Scottish Cabinet in       early November 2004 and the main finding &#8212; a net economic benefit to       Scotland from banning smoking in public places &#8212; was cited in the First       Minister's speech to the Scottish Parliament on 10th November       2004 announcing the proposal to introduce the legislation [a].
The research underpinned the Regulatory Impact Assessment produced by       civil servants for the Committee stages of the Bill and the researchers       were able to defend their findings against evidence submissions made by       opponents of the proposed legislation [b].
The importance of the research in supporting the passage of the Smokefree       legislation has also been demonstrated by independent stakeholder evidence       from an independent review of the performance of the Health Economics       Research Unit for the Chief Scientist Office [c].
The research       was described as "enormously influential" and `the most         important piece of work of all' in relation to the Bill."
The       legislation was passed by the Scottish Parliament and implemented in March       2006.
The legislation has resulted in significant health improvements for the       Scottish population, which would not have been achieved otherwise.
Specific improvements in public health have started to accrue from 2008       onwards, including:            reductions in admissions for acute coronary syndrome were reported in         2008 [d];       reductions in admissions for childhood asthma were reported in 2010 [e];       reductions in complications of pregnancy were reported in 2012 [f];         and       health improvements for occupational groups previously exposed to high         levels of environmental tobacco smoke (bar workers) have also been         noted, with a first report in 2009 [g].
These health benefits have been evidenced in post implementation studies       conducted by other research teams and are the result of the legislation       having been passed.
Admissions for acute coronary syndrome fell by 17%,       compared with a previous mean annual decrease of 3%.
The scale of       reduction in admissions for childhood asthma was similar at 18.2%.
Reduced       use of health services, as a consequence of better health, also provides       an economic benefit.
The evidence review and the modelling methodology were also used by the       Welsh Assembly Government in deciding to introduce Smokefree legislation       in Wales.
The claimed impact, as defined by REF guidance, therefore includes: public         health and well-being has improved; disease prevention has       been enhanced by research; public behaviour has changed and awareness         of a health risk has been raised; costs of treatment and healthcare       have improved and policy debate has been stimulated by research.
