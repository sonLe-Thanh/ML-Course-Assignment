     "[Our] development of medical devices for glucose detection, inward         investment in our company and successful clinical trialling of these         devices ... has relied heavily on the underpinning developments from         [Bath] Chemistry research, and on our ongoing interactions in         translating [this] into forms appropriate for commercialisation and         clinical implementation."
[A]     Impacts from this work: company, investment, people, new technology,         clinical testing            A spin-out or new business has generated revenue or profits (GlySure           Ltd; &#163;13.5M new investment in REF period directly attributed to         the Bath research [A])       Highly skilled people having taken up specialist roles that draw on         their research (GlySure staff expansion to 30, largely in technical           scientific roles; including a Senior Chemist at Glysure recruited         from Bath)       A new diagnostic or medical technology has been developed and trialled         with patients (glucose sensor developed; full, successful, clinical           trials carried out)          Clinical Need, GlySure Ltd, and Economic Impact     The development of an invasive fibre optic continuous glucose       sensor/monitoring system is in direct response to the clinical need       demonstrated by a seminal clinical study in 2001 [B], which showed that       continuous intensive administration of insulin (allowing tight glycaemic       control) reduced patient mortality by 40% and morbidity by 37-46%, the       latter reducing patient length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)       thus providing economic benefits.
GlySure Ltd was founded in 2006 to       exploit the Bath-developed research [C], with a 20% equity stake held by       the University of Bath.
Based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, it is a venture       capital funded company with 30 employees, focused on the development and       launch of a continuous real time invasive optical glucose sensor utilizing       fluorescent intensity measurements that allows the development of       continuous glucose monitoring systems in hospital ICUs.
GlySure Ltd was       the lead organization in partnership with Bath and Gilden Photonics on a       DTI grant, resulting in new IP filings covering long lifetime dendrimer       fluorophores and synthesis of an alternative diboronic acid receptor       structure from the Bath research [D].
The automated and continuous dosing       and response nature of the GlySure device greatly reduces the nursing       workload required to implement tight glycaemic control, and helps to       improve compliance.
The GlySure target market includes the medical and surgical ICU units of       acute care hospitals.
Global admissions in these units alone are       approximately 8.6 million per year, representing a market opportunity of       approximately $1.5 billion for sensors.
Initial investments resulted for       GlySure, to develop and build the Bath chemistry into the glucose sensors,       which has since been followed, in January and November 2012, by       further tranches of investment on completion of the initial successful       clinical trials [E], &#163;13.5M of which directly results from the devices         developed from the Bath chemistry [A].
GlySure Ltd has thus       established itself as a secure and expanding UK-based company offering       highly skilled employment opportunities.
GlySure continue to invest in       Chemistry developments at Bath and have appointed Professor James as       Scientific Advisor: "Based at the University of Bath, Dr. James is         generally accepted as the world's expert in boronic acid fluorophore         chemistry.
He has played a pivotal role in optimising glucose selective         indicator chemistry for continuous measurement in whole blood" [F].
IP Acquisition and Technology Development     The technology development work has been led from Bath, following the       development of the initial chemistry by James; GlySure acquired relevant       IP [C] from the more instrument-focused Beckman Coulter and invested       direct funding in the James group in Bath to develop the chemistry further       towards the function and performance of the appropriate sensor molecules       in the required sensing environment [D] Since 2008, through a series of       funded industry academic transfer projects [5, above], the chemistry has       been incorporated into devices ready for implementation in the clinical       environment.
To meet the clinical and commercial need, the technology       developed by GlySure for ICU applications has required the translation by       James of the fluorescent/receptor glucose indicator chemistry developed in       Bath into an optimised form for in situ sensor operation,       immobilised into an optical cell that is micro machined into the fibre.
These sensors have advantage over other existing glucose sensor in terms       of cost, stability and the ease of the fluorescence measurements, as       corroborated by advantages highlighted by Senseonics, a US company in this       domain: "The fluorescent glucose chemistry is ... not subject to the       instabilities intrinsic to current protein based glucose sensors...       Consequently, this technology is expected to be inherently more stable and       accurate."

Clinical Testing     Since 2008, GlySure have used the Bath-developed chemistry as a       fundamental underpinning feature of their sensor device, which is intended       to act as the active glucose sensor in clinical settings.
The sensors were       tested in vivo (in pigs) in 2008-2009, and the sensors entered       clinical trials in India in 2010.
Successful clinical testing has been       carried out in the ICU environment and presented at the International       Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, attracting more than       2000 physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals, and the World       Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine [H].
Over       two years of human use trials, the GlySure continuous glucose monitoring       system has been tested in over 200 intensive care patients to date, in the       challenging environment of the ICU.
The impressive results from these       clinical trials [H-J] show that the GlySure system is capable of       monitoring throughout the length of a patient's stay in the ICU.
Scope for Growth     In addition to the ICU device described, the fluorescent lifetime glucose       sensor has been incorporated into a development programme to create a       small, easy to use continuous glucose sensor for the home diabetic market.
This lifetime sensor device would allow expansion of the devices into the       home market which is estimated at &#163;1.5 to &#163;2 billion annually.
