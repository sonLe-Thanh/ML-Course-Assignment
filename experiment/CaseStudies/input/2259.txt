     Ivan Bunin (1870-1953) was the first Russian writer to win the Nobel       Prize for literature (1933), but he is not particularly well known to       readers in the West.
His works were banned in the former Soviet Union for       many years, due to his anti-Communist views.
Even after immigrating to       France, Bunin's writing style &#8212; not heavily based on narrative as       better-known Russian writers were &#8212; made it difficult for translations to       satisfactorily recreate his works, and so they remained relatively       unknown.
According to Rogatchevski's research the challenge in reading       Bunin's works has always been his focus on the `minute psychological       movement of the human soul' and the difficulties this presents to       translators.
As language evolves and changes over time, so does the       translation of a unique writing style focusing on characters' inner worlds       rather than their actions.
Rogatchevski is one of only a handful of experts on Bunin in UK higher       education.
In 2007 he was commissioned by the London-based independent       publishing company Alma Books       (established in 2005) to contribute to its Alma Classics        catalogue.
Named Independent Publisher of the Year in 2013       at the Bookseller Industry Awards, at least 40% of Alma's published titles       are translations from languages including French, Spanish, Italian, German       and Japanese.
Alma wanted to be the first publisher to reintroduce Bunin       to contemporary audiences.
Editors were introduced to Rogatchevski's       research (1999-2004) into the Bunin archives and correspondence, including       the writer's interwar publishers Hogarth Press, by the Curator of the       Leeds Russian Archive (LRA), Richard Davies MBE (the LRA has significant       Bunin-related holdings in its possession, and Davies and Rogatchevski are       currently preparing for publication Bunin's correspondence with the       Russian &#233;migr&#233; author Aleksandr Amfiteatrov; Rogatchevski gave a talk on       some aspects of this correspondence in November 2009 at the 41st National       Convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic       Studies in Boston).
Alma Classics commissioned Rogatchevski to contribute a substantial       section of over 20 pages on Bunin's life and works, along with a       discussion of film adaptations to be included as an afterword in Dark         Avenues, translated by Hugh Aplin and published by Alma Classics in       2008 as part of their OneWorld Classics series.
The `extra material'       section is a feature of the Oneworld Classics books and constitutes one of       their unique selling points.
For less widely known authors such as Bunin,       the added information and insight can make a significant contribution to       readers' knowledge.
Bunin's reintroduction to UK readers (the last British       translation in book form before Oneworld Classics was in 1984) required a       reassessment of his art, and Rogatchevski's research expertise in Bunin's       life and works served as a specialist foundation.
These Alma Classics publications are the only English-language versions       of Bunin's work available.
To date (July 2013), 2,266 copies of Dark         Avenues have been sold, and it was named as one of the New         Statesman's `Books of the Year' in 2008, with a special commentary       by John Gray.
The East-West Review (the journal of the Great       Britain-Russia Society) identified Rogatchevski's contribution to the       volume `extensive' (issue 19, 2008, p. 35).
The book was also launched at       a public talk at the Glasgow University Literary Society focusing on       Bunin's life and work, delivered by Rogatchevski on 27 October 2008, with       some 30 people attending.
The dedicated section on Bunin was reproduced in The Village,       translated by Hugh and Galya Aplin and published by Alma Classics in 2009,       also as part of their OneWorld Classics series.
The afterword was       particularly praised by the Times Literary Supplement reviewer,       Donald Rayfield, in a review published on 4 September 2009: `The valuable       part of this book is the 20-page sketch by Andrei Rogatchevski of Bunin's       life and works; rarely is so much information and appreciation neatly       packed into an afterword.'
As of July 2013, this book has sold 1,167       copies.
The Managing Director of Alma Classics wrote:                            Our editions of Bunin's above-mentioned works are the only ones available       to English-speaking readers, and they are an invaluable resource to       students of Russian literature the world over, especially thanks to the       critical material compiled by Dr Rogatchevski, which forms an important       part of our volumes and is one of our unique selling points.
Dark         Avenues and The Village have been distributed throughout the       world and sales have been superior to our expectations and those of the       Bunin Estate, prompting us to commission the translation of another title       by Bunin, The Life of Arsenyev, which will also include Dr       Rogatchevski's critical apparatus.
