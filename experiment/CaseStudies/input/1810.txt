     4a: Rapid and widespread incorporation into national policy in UK     The findings from this research were rapidly adopted in official       guidelines, for example:             The National Screening Committee Model of Best Practice (MOBP) for         England 2003 (still current) was based largely on the results of the         SURUSS study [7];        UK National Screening Committee in 2007 summarised the above and         recommended a flexible strategy with patient choice based on SURUSS [8];         update in 2012 endorsed the 2003 MOBP recommendations with some changes         in cutoff levels [9]        Genetics White Paper 2003 `Our inheritance, our future' incorporated         the recommendations from the SURUSS study (this policy is still current)         [10];        NICE Guidance 2008 (updated from 2003): recommendations were based on         SURUSS and subsequent work undertaken by Queen Mary researchers and         others, and recommended Combined test for women presenting before 15         weeks and Triple or Quadruple test for those presenting at 15-20 weeks,         and also that patients should be given accurate information about         detection and false positive rates based on SURUSS results [11].
4b: Change in practice     The SURUSS study prompted most UK antenatal centres to introduce one of       the recommended combination of tests for Down's routinely [12].
The       Genetics White Paper Review 2008 found almost all NHS maternity units in       the UK offer at least one of the screening tests shown in the SURUSS study       to have acceptable detection and false positive rates for detection of       Down's syndrome [10].
4c: Improved information for parents     Information for patients provided by the NHS, other public bodies and       third-sector organisations is based predominantly on results of the SURUSS       study [13].
4d: Staff training     Training and professional development for midwives has been provided by       the Wolfson Institute at Queen Mary in the form of study days A total of       34 study days have been held from 2008 to 2013, with over 500 midwives       attending [14].
4e: Improved outcomes: antenatal diagnoses and terminations     The proportion of Down's cases diagnosed antenatally in UK rose from       30.6% in 1989-90 to 60.3% in 2008-9 and has remained at over 60% in       2008-13 [15].
While the proportion of antenatally diagnosed cases which       were terminated remained constant at 91.5% throughout this period, the       number of Down's fetuses terminated annually rose from 307 in 1989-90 to       1,032 in 2008-9 [15].
4f: Cost savings to the NHS and beyond     The advances in screening practice have been shown to be cost effective       and led to overall economic savings.
A cost analysis in the SURUSS report       [1] showed, for example, that to screen 100,000 women, the second       trimester double test was estimated to cost &#163;5.8 million at a 90%       detection rate, compared with &#163;4.6 million for the Combined test and &#163;3.0       million for the Integrated test; the cost of measuring extra markers in       the latter two tests being more than offset by the reduction in the number       and associated cost of performing diagnostic procedures.
These relatively       modest costs clearly outweigh the economic costs of long-term care and       support for the Down's syndrome individuals that would otherwise have been       born (not to mention the human cost).
4g: Influence on professional knowledge and further research by others     The research is highly cited by fellow academics, with the main outputs       being cited hundreds of times.
They have taken this work forward in a       number of policy-relevant directions.
Uptake outside UK, and particularly       in north America, was accelerated by the confirmatory results of the       FASTER study on which we collaborated with US colleagues (reference 2       above).
The SURUSS dataset was used by research teams in several countries       to develop statistical and economic models intended to inform national       policy decisions.
For example researchers in:             the USA used SURUSS data to show the superiority of Quadruple         over Triple test in a Californian population and introduce the         Integrated test in statewide programmes [16,17];        Canada used SURUSS data to justify using the Integrated test         [18];        Saudi Arabia used SURUSS data to model a national screening         programme and recommended the Quadruple test [19]; and        China used SURUSS data to produce ROC curves and economic         models to inform national screening policy and recommended the Triple         test as most cost-effective [20].
4h: Change in screening policy beyond UK     SURUSS data, either directly or via further modelling work in the       countries concerned (see previous point) influenced advice from       professional bodies and/or national screening policy in numerous other       countries.
For example:             The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and US         National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and US         Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine proposed first-trimester screening         for Down's syndrome (flexibly depending on circumstances and patient         choice) based on SURUSS data [21];        The European Union EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital         Abnormalities) programme report 2010 suggests that SURUSS findings have         influenced current antenatal screening policy in Croatia, Denmark,         Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland [22].
Most         other European countries have no systematic screening programme and/or         have significant legal or religious bars to termination of pregnancy.
