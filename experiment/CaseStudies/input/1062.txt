     The specific impacts of Lister's research can be characterised as       informing the public policy debate with evidenced-based research in an       area of government policy that is highly politically charged.
Within a       comparatively short period he has been able to achieve a substantial reach       and significance to the role of informing the policy process.
At the same       time as drafting the key research outputs listed above, Lister (with       co-author Jarvis) undertook a range of impact activities, including       writing briefing papers for wider audiences and giving presentations on       the research.
The diversity of audiences with whom Lister has undertaken impact-related       activities attests to this, which include: government agencies, lobby       groups, think-tanks and civil society organisations.
The nature and extent of his impact is divided into two broad categories:       contribution to the policy process, and influence on public policy debate.
Contribution to the policy process:             A co-authored, with Dr Lee Jarvis, a submission to the Home Office         Rapid Review of Counter Terrorism Powers (announced by the Home         Secretary on 13 July 2010).
The submission was acknowledged in the         review findings, published on 26/01/11.
Specific policy recommendations         within the submission included:       I.
For counter terrorism policies to be more widely accepted and viewed         with greater legitimacy, their security-enhancing aspects should be more         clearly demonstrated to citizens;       II.
A need to address the perceived targeting of ethnic minority         communities (and not, exclusively, Muslim communities) by         counter-terrorism measures;       III.
A need to render stop and search powers more acceptable to certain         sections of the population by making permanent the revisions announced         by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons on 08/07/10.
This latter recommendation, in line with a European Court of Human         Rights ruling, was adopted in the Protections of Freedom Act 2012.
This         has meant the ending of a power which saw, at its height in 2008/09,         over 200,000 people stopped and searched.
Hosting a workshop with relevant stakeholders in the         counter-terrorism and community cohesion arenas in London (14/01/11).
Attendees included representatives of the following organisations: the         Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), Metropolitan Police         Authority, the Muslim Contact Unit, the Muslim Council of Britain, the         Institute for Race Relations, and Facilitators for a Better Jamaica.
A Swansea University National Assembly Briefing, National Assembly         for Wales, Cardiff.
(07/12/10): Feeling Secure?
The Public and UK         Counter-terrorism Powers.
Influence on public policy debate:     As well as having direct influence on policy, Lister's research has       shaped and informed public and political debate in this complex and       controversial area, in the main by illuminating the experiences of a range       of ethnic minority citizens.
Drawing on the primary qualitative evidence       gathered in the ESRC project, the research has highlighted the negative       impact of many anti-terrorism measures on Black and Asian citizens.
Whilst       the impact on many Muslim/Asian citizens may be frequently discussed in       the public debate, the recognition that the negative effects of       anti-terrorism measures go wider and reach other ethnic minority groups       represents a distinctive contribution to the public debate.
Articles for       the Muslim Council of Britain (2011a, published online 15/06/11) and       openDemocracy.net (2011b, 05/02/11) have helped to contribute to the       public debate on these issues, as witnessed by their citation in other       public discussions on these issues (see Awan, 2012, and White &amp; McEvoy       2012)
