     The work to reduce delays in access to care for patients with RA has had       impacts in the fields of public policy and services as well as health         and welfare.
Public policy and services &#8212; policy debate has been stimulated and         moved forward by research evidence:     The work, highlighting that patient delay in accessing GPs is a major       contributor to overall delays in the assessment of patients with a new       onset of RA, informed the 2009 report by the National Audit Office on       "Services for people with RA", which has highlighted the need to reduce       delays in help seeking behaviour on the part of patients and the       subsequent impact on the economy through patients being able to remain in       the UK workforce.
The report highlights the following: "Too many people         with rheumatoid arthritis are not presenting, or being diagnosed and         treated quickly enough.
Better value for money could be achieved through         increasing the number of people diagnosed within three months of onset         of disease.
Our modelling work suggests that increasing from 10 to 20         per cent the number of people treated within three months would         initially increase overall NHS costs by &#163;11 million over the first five         years; but would improve people's quality of life and for the proportion         that are of working age, earlier treatment would improve their chances         of remaining in work, generating productivity gains for the economy of         around &#163;31 million.
After around nine years, earlier treatment could         become cost neutral to the NHS, with ongoing benefits of: improved         quality of life; and reduced demands on the NHS (for example for         surgery)" (1).
This report was highly influential in informing national policy.
Following its publication and prior to meeting with the Committee of       Public accounts, the then Chief Medical Office (David Nicholson) met with       Prof Karim Raza in Birmingham (18th November 2009) to discuss       issues related to patient delay.
In answer to the following question from       the Chairman of the Committee of Public accounts "Presumably you have         no trouble, Mr Nicholson, with recommendation (a), paragraph 18 on page         nine: "The Department of Health should explore the cost-effectiveness of         options for raising public awareness of the symptoms of inflammatory         arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, to encourage people to         present to the NHS promptly after symptom onset.""
David Nicholson       replied "I think it is absolutely the right thing to do ...We are         considering, I think quite actively at the moment, a bid from         Birmingham, as it happens, for research into the area of public         awareness so we can absolutely focus our attention on things that will         work" (2).
The bid referred to by David Nicholson was funded by the NIHR under the       Research for Patient Benefit Scheme (Chief Investigator Prof Karim Raza;       Reference number PB-PG-1208-18114) and was supported by Arthritis Research       UK, the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) and the Arthritis and       Musculoskeletal Alliance (ARMA).
Health and welfare &#8212; public awareness of a health risk or benefit has         been raised:     The work on understanding the reasons why patients delay in seeking early       help with their disease has informed the development of a public health       campaign launched in 2011 by the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society to       reduce delays on the part of patients (3).
This campaign highlighted that       the typical symptoms of early RA (stiffness, swelling and tenderness)       might be an indication of a disease for which urgent treatment was       necessary.
In part, the NIHR funded study, referred to above, will be a       assessing the impact of this campaign and will look at ways of enhancing       the effectiveness of future public health messages.
One of the key issues that this work has identified is that patients of       South Asian origin are more likely to delay in seeking help compared with       the general population.
Recognising this, the Rheumatology Research group       has worked with the Birmingham Arthritis Resource Centre (BARC) to develop       strategies to raise awareness amongst members of ethnic minority groups       (4).
BARC is a voluntary organisation based in Birmingham Central Library       and supported by the University of Birmingham and Birmingham City Council.
Strategies developed with BARC have included audio information on a range       of topics including "understanding arthritis", available as a bilingual CD       and as an audio file (5), running outreach sessions in local community       venues (e.g.
temples), appearing on local South Asian radio stations to       talk about RA and writing articles about RA for South Asian language       magazines.
The effectiveness of the BARC audio CD has been demonstrated in       a study published in Musculoskeletal Care in 2011 (6).
All patients who       participated in the study confirmed that the CD had been a useful source       of information and had addressed some of the language barriers which they       had previously experienced.
In 2011 the University's work with BARC in the       community was awarded the 2011 Nursing Standard award for Innovations in       Rheumatology (7).
Furthermore the work has attracted considerable media       attention, which has helped to raise awareness of the disease and the need       for early diagnosis.
