     Professor Lewis's work has enriched and informed public policy and       political debate in UK legislatures, an influential commission, and the       campaign for the legalisation of assisted suicide in the UK.
Her findings       have contributed to legal change on assisted dying in Canada and Australia       and to a judicial challenge to the current legal position in England and       Wales.
Enriching and informing debate     Professor Lewis's work identifying the features of legal regimes that       regulate assisted dying, evaluating the effectiveness of individual       safeguards, and examining the evidence for and against the slippery slope       argument has informed policy debate in the Scottish Parliament, through       her oral evidence and written briefings for the End of Life Assistance       (Scotland) Bill Committee [12].
The resulting report referred to Professor       Lewis's evidence on capacity and length of the physician/patient       relationship [13].
Professor Lewis's work was also heavily cited and       quoted in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) Briefing       paper [14] provided to all members of the Scottish Parliament prior to the       final vote on the Bill in 2010, to which she also contributed in an       editorial capacity.
In particular, her analysis of the slippery slope       argument in the Dutch context [6] was accepted in the SPICe briefing [14]       (at 18-19).
Outside the legislative context, but still influential in the public       policy debate, Professor Lewis's work informed her oral evidence to and       written briefings for CoAD in 2011 [2],[3],[8].
It was heavily cited in an       earlier 2010 Demos briefing paper prepared for CoAD [9] and in the 2012       CoAD Report [7].
Based directly on Professor Lewis's findings on       the effectiveness of legal safeguards [2], CoAD reached the key conclusion       that assisted suicide for the terminally ill could safely be legalised       with safeguards to protect the vulnerable [7] (citing [2] 34 times).
Professor Lewis's critique of the informal legal change produced by the       Director of Public Prosecutions' new guidance for prosecutors [4], [15]       has directly informed and shaped public and political debate, influencing       Parliamentarians, the campaign to legalise assisted suicide in the UK and       a judicial challenge to the current legal position.
To trace the impact of       one key conclusion: Professor Lewis contends that factors in the Policy       `ensure that assistance in suicide remains an amateur activity       carried out by inexperienced individuals without the assistance of       professionals or amateur organisations (as in Switzerland)' and identifies       the risks associated with this approach ([4] at 129-130).
The following       year, Patricia Hewitt MP stated in a Parliamentary debate [16]:     In the words of Professor Penney Lewis of the centre of medical law and       ethics at King's College, London, the guidelines `are designed to ensure       that assistance in suicide remains an amateur activity carried out       by inexperienced individuals without the assistance of professionals.
The amateur/professional discussion recurred in Parliament in 2012       (Hansard HL HL Deb, 13/2/2012, c625, c629, c632 (Lord Joffe, Baroness       Young, Baroness Finlay)).The critique has also been used extensively by       Dignity in Dying (DiD) in its campaign for legal change and was cited in       its briefing       on the Final Policy (`assistance in suicide will remain an amateur         activity carried out by inexperienced individuals, with potentially       dangerous consequences for the person being assisted to attempt suicide,       and placing a terrible burden on those who assist them from compassionate       motives') and subsequent briefings, in its evidence         to CoAD (at 3) and in a recent paper         on a draft assisted dying bill (at 9).
The discussion was reiterated       by Raymond Tallis, the Chair of Healthcare Professionals for Assisted       Dying, in media         interviews, a public         lecture and a press         release, and by Professor Lewis in interviews with BBC Newsnight,       the International Herald Tribune, the New           York Times, the Washington           Post and RIA           Novosti (Russia) [17].
Demos quoted extensively from the       critique in its briefing for CoAD [9] (at 6, 14, 15, 17,       and in its blog).
The 2012 CoAD Report concluded that `There is significant concern       that assisting suicide remains an amateur activity' [7] (at 23),       and included a lengthy quotation from Professor Lewis's evidence [7] (at       51).
The CoAD conclusion was widely reported in national and international       press (see eg Independent;       New Law J 2012;162(7495); Cdn Med Assoc J 2012;184(2):E109-E112)       and challenged in the Church         of England's official response to CoAD's Report.
Paul Bowen QC,       representing Tony Nicklinson (who was seeking to use the defence of       necessity to permit euthanasia), used Professor Lewis's argument in the       High Court, explaining why the status quo is unsatisfactory by relying on       `an assertion that the current policy of the [Director of Public       Prosecutions], by excluding professionals from assisting suicide,       encourages covert and amateur assisted suicides' (Nicklinson v Ministry         of Justice [2012] EWHC 304, [47]).
Bowen also repeated this point to       the media in a widely         reported interview during the full hearing in June 2012.
Professor       Lewis's comments to the Associated Press and the Press Association on       Nicklinson's death and the prospects for legal change following his       unsuccessful challenge were picked up in over 800 media outlets       internationally, and she was interviewed on Al Jazeera, ITN and BBC TV and       radio.
Legal change     Professor Lewis's work has contributed directly to legal change on       assisted dying.
Her affidavit as an expert witness [10] (containing       [1],[2],[4] as exhibits) was influential in the 2012 decision of the       British Columbia Supreme Court (BCSC) to strike down the criminal       prohibition on assisted suicide as unconstitutional (suspended for one       year to allow the federal Parliament time to amend the Criminal Code) and       craft a `constitutional exemption' for Gloria Taylor, a seriously ill       plaintiff, allowing her to obtain lawful assistance in suicide.
The       government was subsequently refused a stay of this constitutional       exemption by the BC Court of Appeal (Carter [2012] BCCA 336, [31],       [42]).
Professor Lewis's evidence is cited 11 times in the BCSC judgment,       in particular, her research explaining the Dutch data on non-voluntary       euthanasia which rebut the slippery slope arguments central to the       Attorney General for Canada's unsuccessful case.
A bill to legalise a model of assisted dying is currently under       consideration in the Tasmanian Parliament.
In an unsolicited email in       January 2013, Jessica Radford, the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Tasmanian       Premier wrote: `Research that you have undertaken and published has been       very important and informative in preparing the proposed model .
.
.'
Indeed [2] is cited over 50 times in the Consultation Paper [11], more       than any other single piece of research or body of research.
The proposed       model reflects recommendations made in [2] on a number       of safeguards including a prospective voluntariness check (pp31, 47-48), a       palliative filter (p38), the presence of a health care professional at the       end of life (pp44-45) and consultation (p51).
