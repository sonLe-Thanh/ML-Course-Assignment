     Since 1993 the FDRG has developed collaborative research programs with       the international petroleum industry and the `Structural Analogues for       Reservoirs' consortia (2007-2014) has involved thirteen petroleum       companies.
Key long-standing research collaborations (e.g., BP, Shell,       ConocoPhillips, Nexen, BG Group, Apache) led to new approaches to       petroleum exploration and an understanding of the 4D spatial and time       evolution of petroleum structures.
The FDRG models provide a level of       detail for hydrocarbon-bearing structures that was hitherto unavailable.
Overall FDRG models directly impact on "the cost and viability of new         oil and gas prospects from exploration through to commercial         development" (bp &#8212; R. Humphries 2012).
FDRG industry-funded research has had widespread impact.
"Professor         McClay's research spans many aspects of Structural Geology of interest         to industry, and has a truly global focus.
... No other current         industry project.....has as comprehensive a suite of deliverables.
Materials include: comprehensive atlases of numerical and physical model         experiments; toolboxes summarizing specific structural styles (e.g., the         lnversion Toolbox that comprises a comprehensive review of styles and         mechanisms behind inverted basins with interpreted seismic examples from         around the world, including an in-depth seismic review of the classic         `Sunda Folds' from the Natuna Sea); field-work reports (e.g., Gulf of         Suez, lran, lraq); case histories (e.g., Australia, Niger Delta).
All         materials are delivered to sponsors in a timely manner via a secure         web-site...FDRG (has) great impact and (is) used often and widely           throughout industry.
Professor McClay also provides...short         courses, field trips.....and review meetings that all augment the         research deliverables".
(Hooper, Marathon Oil Company, 2012)     2008-2013 specific impact     a) Bight Basin Australia: Geoscience Australia "relied heavily         on [Royal Holloway] models on gravity tectonics in deltaic         systems.
The structural interpretation of the gravity slide system         underpinned our improved understanding of the geology and structural         history of the basin, including fault reactivation and the likely risks         to petroleum systems....
The acreage was awarded to BP Exploration         (Alpha) Ltd in 2011, with a ...work program of $600 million" (Totterdell         &amp; Foster, Geoscience Australia 2012)     b) Arafura Basin Australia: FDRG "work on extensional and         inversion fault architectures allowed [Geoscience Australia] to         understand the extremely complex geology of the Goulburn Graben.
This         structural framework allowed [Geoscience Australia1         to] develop a robust sequence/seismic stratigraphic interpretation for         the Goulburn Graben and Northern Platform.
...This step change in         understanding underpinned the 2006 Acreage Release of exploration areas         in the Arafura.
... Part of the region released in 2006 was subsequently         taken up by Samson (with ConocoPhillips), with a guaranteed work program         of $7 million."
(Chief Scientist, Geoscience Australia 2012)     c) Carnarvon Basin Australia: FDRG predictive models provided       templates for seismic interpretation and cross-section       balancing/restorations (Francowitz &amp; McClay 2010).
FDRG       established new concepts of tectonic evolution of this extended passive       margin which underpinned new approaches to hydrocarbon exploration.
Overall FDRG has "changed the way seismic data is interpreted on         rifted margins" (Chief Scientist, Geoscience Australia 2012)     d) Niger Delta: "Work in the toe thrust zone of the Niger         Delta allowed ... understanding.. of faulting, which is key to         understanding petroleum accumulations in the region" (VP global New       Ventures &amp; Geoscience, CGGVeritas 2012).
e) Collaborative industrial partnerships: These focus on       modelling of salt (Conoco Norway), salt diapirs (Shell UK),       rift systems (Shell UK) and deepwater folds belts (Shell international)       (De Vera et al 2010).
1Geoscience Australia is Australia's national         geological survey and in that role is involved in the discovery and         development of energy resources and provides geoscientific information         to industry.
All research results are delivered to consortia partners via the internet       thus maximising potential economic benefits.
Earth Sciences FDRG staff       have immediate use of models and field case studies as analogues of       reservoir structures.
Publications by the research group are widely used       by the international petroleum industry (e.g.
Apache, BP for the Gulf         of Suez rift system).
Animations and 3D visualizations of physical       models combined with field case studies greatly aid interpreters in       identifying structures as well as an understanding of how they form and       change through time (Hardy et al 2009, Wu et al 2009) (e.g.
modelling         of fold-thrust systems used in the analysis of deepwater fold belts by         Shell Nigeria and Shell NW Borneo).
The compendium of structural       styles developed by FDRG is widely used by the petroleum industry (e.g.
BP, BG Group, ConocoPhillips, Talisman, Nexen) in exploration as       well as in their training of geologists and geophysicists.
Company       geologists attend the regular training courses (both lab and field based)       given by FDRG (e.g.
BHP Billiton, Shell, Nexen, ConocoPhillips).
