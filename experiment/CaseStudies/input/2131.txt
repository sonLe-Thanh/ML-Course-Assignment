     The research impacts on the behaviours and skills of radiologists and       reporting radiographers, with       influence on their practice and training, with resultant likely benefits       for patients through improved       speed and accuracy of diagnosis.
The research undertaken by the medical       image perception       research group has always been intrinsically applied in practice, and       focussed on expertise-related       differences in observer performance and eye movement behaviour as a way of       gaining insight into       differences in visual and cognitive processing and understanding the       development of radiological       expertise.
The aim of the research has not been to demonstrate the       effectiveness or otherwise of       any particular professional group but to understand human expertise and in       particular visual       expertise in radiology by undertaking high quality research with direct       implications for practice.
The       impact of the research has been on raising an awareness of observer       performance studies in a       real-world visual search and problem solving task, such as looking for       cancer.
Rather than being       focussed on theory building, the research findings directly impinge on       practice, stimulating       individuals to consider their own practice, particularly through training       activities.
The work has been disseminated and supported for uptake into practice       through a wide range of       invited presentations and support activities, such as meetings, study days       and MSc programmes at       other universities and both research and practitioner conferences.
These       include:            British Institute for Radiology study day on perception in 2008,         designed to update clinicians         and reporting radiographers on the latest research in medical image         perception to inform         practice.
Guest speaker engagement with MSc programmes at Salford, University of         Central England         Birmingham and St George's Medical School.
These programmes are for         clinical practitioners         who are taking post graduate qualifications which will allow them to         report medical images in a         variety of domains, such as axial and appendicular skeleton reporting,         mammography, CT         head, and gastro-intestinal imaging.
Each course typically has 20         participants, and is run         annually.

Manchester Medical Society symposium March 2010, a meeting for         clinical radiologists and         radiographers in the North West.
The keynote for The Medical Image Perception Society 2011, a society         based in North America         which brings together academics and clinical radiologists with an         interest in medical imaging.
A seminar for the Medical Physics research groups of Universities of         Lund and Malmo         (Sweden), September 2011.
Experimental Psychology Society workshop on expertise as revealed by         oculomotor behaviour,         University of Portsmouth, 2011.
Invited speaker to a chest reporting study day held at the Royal         Marsden annually, organised         by the Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust.
Such training shows direct         amalgamation of the         research findings into the continuing professional development programme         of an NHS Trust.
Each year there are 120 participants, all clinical practitioners.
