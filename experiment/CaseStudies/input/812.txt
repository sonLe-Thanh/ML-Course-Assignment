     During the REF period, the research of Knipe and Fisher       has continued to have a major impact on       predicting the flow behaviour of faults within the petroleum industry, in       part through their       association with RDR.
This impact is evidenced by the growth of RDR       business, and through       growth of fault research, consultancy, and training within the School of       Earth and Environment.
Between 2008 and 2010, RDR had an average annual turnover over of &#163;1.9       million, and the       estimated annual turnover today is &#163;4.0 million [A].
Since 2008,       RDR has conducted consultancy       for 90 oil companies on a total of 200 petroleum reservoirs throughout the       world [A, B].
In 2008,       the company released a database of fault rock properties that has been       purchased by 9 companies       (BG Group, Wintershall, Bayergas, BHPbilliton, ConocoPhilips, DetNorsk,       Maersk, Nexen and       Statoil).
Most importantly, in 2008, RDR entered into an exclusive       agreement with Schlumberger       Ltd, in which RDR have created a plug-in software module for the most       popular geological       modelling software (PetrelTM) used by the petroleum industry       (see www.rdr.leeds.ac.uk/petrel-         software.html) [C,D,E].
This module has sold over 500       licenses and allows geoscientists to model       all of the major uncertainties associated with fault-related fluid flow in       petroleum reservoirs so as to       reduce the risks associated with drilling new exploration and production       wells [B].
This work       incorporated results from both laboratory studies of fault rock       petrophysics as well as structural       interpretations conducted during the numerous JIPs in Leeds.
In       recognition of the high quality of       this plug-in, RDR were presented with the 2010 SIS Global Forum Innovation       Award at the 2010       Global Schlumberger Information Solutions forum [F].
In addition       to software production and       consultancy, RDR have conducted around 30 short courses on fault-related       fluid flow for the       petroleum industry that have been attended by up to 700 people [B].
Research, consultancy and training on fault-related fluid flow have also       continued in the University       of Leeds separately from RDR.
Fisher has established two JIPs to       continue research in this area.
The first (sponsored by ADMA, BHP, ConocoPhilips, Shell, Statoil and       Wintershall) is a &#163;450,000       project developing a database on the relative permeability of fault rocks.
The second (sponsored       by Chevron, ConocoPhillips, DECC and Shell) is a &#163;590,000 project which       has investigated the       impact of faults and fractures on gas production from tight gas sandstone       reservoirs.
Fisher has       also given over 40 presentations and 4 short courses to industry, and       continued to conduct       consultancy work on fault- and fracture- related fluid flow on 9 petroleum       reservoirs, a CO2 storage       site (Middle East) and a project on shale-hosted radioactive waste       repositories (NAGRA -       Switzerland).
The non-uniqueness in the interpretation of subsurface data and the       extreme confidentiality of       many projects means that it is difficult to assign an accurate monetary       value to the impact of this       research, consultancy and training.
Although software sales, training       courses and consultancy       projects offers one indication of impact, other examples such as:-             Failure to predict fault-related reservoir compartmentalisation often         leads to dramatic         downgrades in reserves (e.g.
100 million barrels - from a single Gulf of         Mexico reservoir).
Failure to predict the sealing capacity of wells often leads to dry         wells being drilled at costs         in excess of &#163;50 million per well.
Demonstration that sandstones are not connected across faults allows         companies to claim         small fields tax allowances in excess of &#163;75 million.
