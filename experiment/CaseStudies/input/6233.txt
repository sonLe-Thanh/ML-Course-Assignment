     Loughborough University's research, as cited in s2 and s3, has helped in       the establishment of a new business, involving ~80 employees, in producing       products out of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene in an       environmentally friendly, solvent-free new process.
The engineering       polymer &#8212; with potential uses including body armour, prosthetic limbs and       hip and knee joints &#8212; can be used to make tapes and films of unprecedented       tensile modulus and strength.
Weight for weight, it is 11 times stronger       than steel.
The technological process researched at Loughborough is under       commercialisation by the research sponsor, Teijin Aramid B.V. located at       Arnhem, Netherlands.
The activity began in 2007 with the first contract       between Loughborough University and Teijin Aramid.
Since then, the       contract has been renewed without any break.
The total amount raised from       Teijin is ~&#163;1.37M and the company considers the lab located in the       Materials Department at Loughborough as one of its satellite laboratories       and hence provides its running costs.
This research activity has been       further complemented by more than another ~&#163;1.79M in funding from the       Dutch Polymer Institute.
In total, Teijin Aramid has invested more than       &#8364;20M in bringing the product from the lab scale to the market.
The official announcement of the start-up of production lines located at       Emmen in the Netherlands was made in 2011 [5.1] and Oct 2011 saw       the product launch under the commercial name Endumax&#174; [5.2].
The second step to make more advanced products having higher tensile       strength and tensile modulus is being realised during 2013.
Endumax&#174;       is currently commercialised in the form of tapes that have high strength       and stiffness.
The two main applications are for ballistic and       robotics/force transmission [5.3].
For the production of ballistic       articles, the tapes offer a significant advantage over yarns in terms of       weight and the amount of chemicals needed.
Moreover, plates made from       Endumax&#174; retain the original form and performance levels, even       when exposed to high temperatures and moisture [5.4].
For       robotics, the Endumax&#174; tape proved to be ideal for use in the       Darwing&#174;, a dynamic arm support for people with severely limited arm       function.
The Darwing was developed by Focal Meditech, in close       cooperation with the Teijin Endumax&#174; team, and was presented at       RehaCare International 2011 [5.5].
Beside the technological advantages that the polymer offers, the process       has opened new frontiers in polymer science, such as the presence of a       unique metastable melt state where well-established rheological theories       cannot be applied.
Loughborough's research has ushered in a new product       sector of engineering polymers.
Competitors including Du Pont (Tensylon&#174;)       [5.6] and DSM (Dyneema BT10&#174;) [5.7] have also initiated       development of products using the new process route.
DuPont estimates the       total industry opportunity at more than $1 billion [5.5].
The research has resulted in more than twelve patents plus many external       collaborations as a result of interest generated within the scientific       community.
Collaborators include Julia Kornfield (Professor, Caltech),       Gerrit Peters (Professor, Eindhoven University), Yao Yefeng (Professor,       East China Normal University), Ashish Lele (Senior Scientist, National       Chemical Lab), Hans W. Spiess (Director, Max Planck Institute), Michel       DuPont (General Manager, Polyethylene Business, Teijin Aramid), Akihiko       Toda (Professor, Hiroshima University).
