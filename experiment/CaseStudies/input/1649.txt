     Since 2008, Dr Mason has given over 15 public lectures at teachers'       conferences (Institute of Physics, IoP, Association of Science Educators,       ASE), schools and astronomy societies, in which she discussed solar space       observations (SoHO, Hinode, SDO) and her research results, including those       on the Sun's magnetic field, solar wind, active regions, flares and CMEs,       and how CHIANTI has been used to analyse the UV observations.
It is clear from the positive feedback that Dr Mason's engagement       activity has informed and inspired teachers, students and the general       public.
Sample feedback includes: 'Thanks again for a brilliant talk.
I've       had some great feedback and you could tell by the questions how engaged       the audience was!'
(teacher, Kesgrave High School, Ipswich, 2013, 50+)[7].
In July 2013, IoP Director of Science and Education wrote of Dr Mason,       "Her talks have helped improve student and teacher understanding of solar       physics; and in particular the solar space projects, SoHO and Hinode.
Teachers were also given supporting materials and ideas to help them teach       this topic in the classroom.
He also adds "We believe that the future of       physics is very much in the hands of physics teachers and so are committed       to providing all the support we can.
It is particularly pleasing when we       can do this in partnership with colleagues such as Dr Mason who has such a       wealth of experience in the field of solar space projects."
[6]     Since 2008, Dr Mason has also given several high profile public lectures,       including a Friday Evening Discourse on `Our Dynamic Sun' at the Royal       Institution.
This detailed her solar research with Hinode/EIS, SDO and       CHIANTI (82% enjoyed the lecture, 73% learnt something new, 64% wanted to       find out more about her research, 2013, 250+)[1].
She also gave a       Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Talking Science lecture (65%       Strongly agreed that the talk was enjoyable and interesting 2013, 80+)       [2].
She has lectured twice at the INTECH Science Centre (2009, 120+;       2011, 170+; 'Dr Mason's talks are ideal for our Space Lecture series...       bringing in up-to-the-minute research and developments', INTECH Manager)       [3].
Dr Helen Mason launched Sun|trek, an educational website about the Sun       and its effect on the Earth's environment, in 2007.
The site is directly       underpinned by the research carried out by Dr Mason and her group       described above.
It features sections on solar space observatories (SoHO,       Hinode, SDO) and CHIANTI.
Key research results which feature on Sun|trek       include: the heating of solar active regions and flares studied with SDO       and Hinode (e.g.
iSun|trek `The Sun gets active with X-class Flares' and       the Sun|trek Hinode section).
New Sun|trek Classroom projects released in       2012 use real solar space data (e.g.
`Spectra: Solar fingerprints'       contains spectra from Hinode/EIS, with CHIANTI spectral identifications).
The impact of the Sun|trek project has by 2012 been far reaching &#8212; around       300,000 individuals per annum.
Below are sample stats from Google       Analytics for the Sun|trek website in 3 month groups from October 2010       until March 2012 (i.e.
10-12 2011 is Oct-Dec 2011 etc.).
Visits denotes       all visits, unique visits are separate individuals.
The 2012 enhancement, iSun|trek (www.suntrek.org/blog) links to       modern social communication networks (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter etc.).
The Sun|trek Facebook site, has topical information highlighting research       achievements (e.g.
with SoHO, Hinode, SDO), reaching 2,500 individuals per       week by mid-2013.
Since 2008, Sun|trek has been linked to many other       educational websites (e.g.
STEM, RAS, STFC, ASE, IoP, International Year       of Astronomy (2009/10), SunEarthPlan, Schoolscience, ESERO, BBC Science).
Dr Mason has presented her research themes through her work with the       media (BBC TV and radio).
She featured in the BBC4 programme Seven         Ages of Starlight (with recent observations from SDO), which was       nominated for a BANFF Rockie award.
This was broadcast in 2012 (reaching       795,000) and again in June 2013.
The Audience Appreciation Index was 87,       significantly higher than the average score for a factual programme [4].
The Times wrote: 'Everyone who isn't an astronomer or a theoretical       physicist should watch Gaby Hornsby's incredible film...
It is one of the       richest and most informative science programmes I have ever seen'.
Dr       Mason also worked on Science Britannica (BBC2, 2013).
In 2010, Dr Mason was named as one of the UKRC's Women of Outstanding       Achievement for `her inspirational work in communication within SET and       her contribution to discovery in her field' [5].
The prize, a photo       portrait of Dr Mason, hangs at the IoP headquarters as an inspiration to       young females.
She was awarded an STFC Science in Society Fellowship (Oct.       2011 &#8212; March 2012) in recognition of the high profile and impact of her       outreach work.
