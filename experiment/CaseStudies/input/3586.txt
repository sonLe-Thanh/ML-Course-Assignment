     The impact of research produced by this research group can be evidenced       as follows:     Use of research findings by professional bodies to define best         practice and formulate policies     a) RCSEP work has been adopted by national and international bodies for       revising clinical practise regarding: i) the use of physical activity as       medicine, and ii) specific cardiovascular disease parameters, namely       hypertension.
Two publications (Metsios et al., 2008, Panoulas et al.,       2008) have been used by the European League Against Rheumatism and the       Evidence NHS, respectively, to develop best practice and formulate       policies.
The former research output, suggesting lifestyle changes for the       management of chronic inflammatory disease, has also been adopted by the       Scottish Intercollegiate Network, a branch of the NHS quality improvement.
These events have triggered keynote presentations to practitioners (e.g.,       Excellence in Rheumatology, Istanbul, 2011) and invitations to increase       awareness in patient groups (e.g., Cancer/Chronic Inflammation Patient       Focus Groups: 800+ attendees).
b) Work on the effects of exercise on cardiovascular outcomes (Metsios et       al., 2008, 2009, 2010) and the cost-effectiveness of physical activity       interventions (Metsios et al., 2011) in patients with chronic       inflammation, has led to the: i) adoption of exercise training in clinical       practice, and ii) development of a referral scheme for this specific       population.
These findings have also led to economic/commercial impact       that benefited established organisations (e.g.
Action         Heart) in improving their practises.
c) Part of our work (Gould et al., 2013) has contributed to the       development of an exercise referral scheme for patients with breast       cancer, in collaboration with Aston University, the Dudley Group of       Hospitals &#8212; NHS Foundation Trust, and Action Heart.
Development of new indicators of health and well-being     d) RCSEP research focuses on the acute effects of passive smoking on lung       function and the duration of system disruption.
Results demonstrating, for       the first time in humans through standardised protocol, that acute       exposure to second-hand smoke causes marked increases in inflammatory       cytokines which remain elevated for at least 3 hours after exposure       (Flouris et al., 2009), have been adopted by health and policy-making       organisations.
These include Action on Smoking and Health for a 2011       report on second-hand smoke, and the European Agency for Safety and Health       at Work in advice for non-smokers (2012).
e) Additional information on the duration of acute &#8212; as opposed to       prolonged &#8212; health effects of passive smoking (Flouris et al., 2010) has       been included in on-line resource packages of international organisations       including the WHO Collaborating Centre for Housing and Health (2010),       Cancer Council Victoria, Australia (2011) and Learn Through Evidence       Action and Reflexion Networks, Canada (2011).
Further outputs on this       research area have been reviewed by ProCor, a global network promoting       cardiovascular health (Flouris et al., 2010), and included in a 2012       British Heart Foundation policy statement (Metsios et al., 2011).
Use of research findings in the conduct of professional work or         practice     f) Based on the dissemination of our research through conferences and       peer-reviewed publications (Allen et al., 2013, Wyon et al., 2013), elite       dance companies (e,g., Royal Ballet) and vocational dance schools (e.g.,       Elmhurst Dance School, TheaterSchool, Amsterdam, Holland) have       incorporated supplemental training into their timetables and invested in       fitness facilities; they also screen their dancers for vitamin D       deficiency.
Our research reputation has created opportunities for       co-authorship of the IADMS Safe and Effective Dance Practice qualification       and for the development of dance practitioner focused review articles.
g) RCSEP research (Allen et al., 2012, 2013) has contributed to the       establishment of the National Institute of Dance Medicine and Science with       the University of Birmingham, the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital,       Dance UK and Laban Conservatoire.
Wolverhampton is the leading research       institute in the partnership.
The Institute has informed NHS service       provision with a specialist         dance medicine clinic at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.
A       similar service is currently planned at Queen Elizabeth Hospital,       Birmingham.
h) Professor Wyon has introduced whole body vibration training to English       National Ballet (ENB) as part of their preparation.
This has led to a       promotional deal between ENB and PowerPlate with Professor Wyon developing       a "dancer         programme" for all health and fitness clubs that use PowerPlate for       vibration training (e.g.
Virgin Active).
i) Industrial impact can also be evidenced by the collaboration between       Harlequin Floors Plc, Birmingham Royal Ballet and RCSEP that has led to       the development of new flooring infrastructure, with the aim to reduce       injury in elite dancers (Hopper et al., 2013).
This has also led to Harlequin         Floors Plc to sponsor the National Institute of Dance Medicine and       Science.
