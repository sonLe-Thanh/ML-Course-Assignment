     Impact on Commerce     Asterion Ltd, a University of Sheffield spin-out, generated licensing       revenue from two overseas pharmaceutical companies for access to our IP       during the census period [S1, S2, S3].
The two companies who paid       licenses for our technology were:            [text removed for publication], a global specialty-driven         pharmaceutical company with total sales exceeding &#8364;1.2 billion in 2012,         licensed the development of long-acting growth hormones patented by         Asterion Ltd for clinical development in 2009.
[text removed for publication], paid license fees to evaluate         Asterion's designs in the field of an undisclosed hormone in 2009.
Since 2009 Asterion Ltd has received income from licensing agreements of       &#163;532,959.
During the period 01 Jan 2008-31 July 2013, Asterion Ltd spent &#163;1,295,934       on research and development [S1] and funded contract development       work during the period at the University of Sheffield, thereby securing       employment for two postdoctoral researchers, as well as supporting       Asterion's staff.
During the current REF census period, this has amounted       to 14.5 person years of jobs in the UK.
In the same period, Asterion Ltd attracted equity/loan funding to the       value of &#163;1,055,000 [S1].
Asterion Ltd was featured in a cover story in the BBSRC Business       magazine in July 2008 ("Sheffield spin-out wins additional investment for       novel therapeutic proteins"), and one of four new companies highlighted in       the BBSRC Annual Report in 2009 [S4, S5].
What led to the impact?
The University of Sheffield and the Asterion cofounders filed a patent       application on engineered growth hormones and other cytokines commencing       in 2000 (inventors: Ross, Artymiuk and Sayers).
In total, over 200       applications have been filed since 2000, with a total of 27 granted       patents (including 7 US patents [S6]), and 23 applications still       pending [S2].
Artymiuk, Ross and Sayers co-founded the spin-out Asterion Ltd, in 2000       using an initial investment of &#163;125,000 from the White Rose Technology       Seedcorn Fund (which had been created in 1999 through the DTI's University       Challenge competition).
The cofounders sought to raise venture capital or collaborative research       and development (R&amp;D) funding by presenting their proposal to       potential investors including private enterprise, corporate VCs (e.g.
Novartis Ventures, 3M, J&amp;J Development Corporation) and to       international pharmaceutical companies e.g.
GSK, Sanofi, Merck, Pfizer,       and Ipsen.
These presentations contributed to Asterion signing an R&amp;D       deal with [text removed for publication] in 2003, and attracting a second       investor (see below).
From incorporation to 31 December 2007, Asterion       attracted investments of &#163;820,000 plus research and licensing income of       &#163;858,110.
Biofusion Ltd (later to become Fusion IP plc) invested &#163;250,000 in       Asterion in 2006 [S1].
Asterion Ltd and [text removed for publication] entered into a joint       R&amp;D deal in the area of growth hormone (2003) [S3], which       ultimately led to licensing milestone payments in 2009.
In early 2008       Asterion entered into a similar deal with [text removed for publication],       which also led to licencing income during the period [S1].
These       developments led to Asterion Ltd receiving a total of &#163;532,959 during the       REF census period.
Summary for the REF Census period 01-01-2008 to 31-05-2013 for         Asterion Ltd            Total research income: &#163;960,118 (including &#163;532,959           licensing income)       Total R&amp;D spend: &#163;930,286        Total investment in IP protection during period: &#163;339,512        Total equity/loan funding attracted into Asterion Ltd: &#163;1,055,000
