     Recent years have seen a very significant revival of the Irish language       in Belfast, including the development of a thriving Gaeltacht Quarter with       major cultural, commercial and tourism benefits to the community.
De       Br&#250;n's exploration of the hidden history of an urban Gaeltacht in the 19th       century has been adopted by the present-day community as confirmation of       the continuity of the Irish language in industrialised Belfast and an       important validation of and justification for the modern revival.
Cult&#250;rlann McAdam &#211; Fiaich, who are at the heart of the revival, have made       a conscious decision to derive inspiration for a number of their projects       from research carried out by de Br&#250;n: "The Fadgies are representative of       precedence to what we are working to achieve in An Cheathr&#250; Gaeltachta: an       urbanised Gaeltacht area, where accessibility and exposure to the Irish       language is commonplace.
Dr de Br&#250;n's pioneering research and steadfast       assistance from the outset of this project has been more than invaluable;       indeed, the project as it is would not exist without either" (letter from       Cult&#250;rlann MacAdam &#211; Fiaich).
The research of de Br&#250;n and Hughes has, furthermore, played a significant       role in promoting awareness throughout Northern Irish society of its Irish       language heritage and the importance played therein by protestants such as       the industrialist Robert MacAdam.
Belfast City Council's Good Relations       Unit has taken the 19th century community revealed and explored       by de Br&#250;n as a central theme in its cross-community partnership embracing       Cult&#250;rlann MacAdam &#211; Fiaich, Windsor Women's Centre and the 174 Trust; and       our exhibition on the history of the Irish language in Belfast was       launched by the DUP Deputy Lord Mayor Ruth Patterson.
This increased       awareness is reflected in highly significant cross-community advances such       as the appointment by the East Belfast Mission of an Irish Language       Development Officer (Linda Ervine, wife of former Progressive Unionist       party leader Brian Ervine) and the establishment in East Belfast of       flourishing classes in the language.
These developments are featured in a       BBC documentary for which de Br&#250;n was interviewed which will be broadcast       in November 2013 (see http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01klc2f).
Our research into the Irish language in an industrialised setting has led       to the commissioning by publically-funded and semi-state bodies of other       outputs in formats which facilitate wider public dissemination, in       particular through television and temporary and permanent exhibitions.
A       detailed television documentary (Sc&#233;al na Fadgies by de Br&#250;n) was       commissioned by TG4 and Northern Ireland Screen's Irish Language Broadcast       Fund.
A permanent exhibition (by de Br&#250;n &amp; Hughes, 2011) was       commissioned by Cult&#250;rlann MacAdam-&#211; Fiaich and was funded by the Northern       Ireland Tourist Board.
A temporary exhibition (de Br&#250;n &amp; Phoenix) was       commissioned by the cross-border Irish-language body, Foras na Gaeilge       for Belfast City Hall's centenary celebrations (see evidence base).
The most immediate indicator of the reach and significance of the       underpinning research has been alluded to above &#8212; the commissioning by       publically-funded or semi-state bodies of other outputs in formats which       facilitate wider public dissemination.
In each case, this has come about       because the funding bodies have identified the potential of our research       to inform public discourse in the broad area of cultural heritage and in       some cases to deliver specific economic and social benefits, particularly       in the area of cultural tourism.
The viewing figures for the TV documentary (de Br&#250;n, 2010) demonstrate       that 100,000 viewers tuned in to the programme's initial broadcast in May       2010 (see Sources to corroborate).
Since the initial broadcast, the       documentary has been rebroadcast by TG4 on several occasions and was made       accessible to a global audience on the TG4 website.
The broadcast has led       to invitations by local councils and historical/cultural organisation to       give public talks in Belfast, Newry and Omeath (see evidence base).
The print and digital interactive, permanent exhibition space for the       newly extended and refurbished Cult&#250;rlann MacAdam-&#211; Fiaich was officially       opened by Irish President Mary McAleese at a ceremony in September 2011.
This event received considerable media coverage and helped to launch the       exhibition as one of the key tourist, heritage and educational resources       in an area of significant economic and social disadvantage (Falls Road,       Belfast).
The public use of visitor attractions is monitored by the NI       Tourist Bureau and the recent Northern Ireland Statistics and Research       Agency report demonstrates (p. 19) that 89,000 members of the public       visited the Cult&#250;rlann in 2011 and 101,000 in 2013 (see         http://www.detini.gov.uk/deti-stats-         index/tourism-statistics/visitor_attraction_survey-2.htm).
The temporary exhibition on the history of the Irish language in Belfast       was used as part of the centenary celebrations of Belfast City Hall and       went on display in the City Hall after its initial launch at a gala dinner       by the DUP Deputy Lord Mayor.
Subsequently, the exhibition was displayed       in venues in the U.S. as part of an investment tour by the West Belfast       Economic Forum and also by Newry and Mourne Council as part of Irish       language week in March 2008.
The exhibition has also been used by local       schools and cultural groups at a wide variety of events (evidence base).
The model of progression from traditional academic output (scholarly       books/articles) to impact through popular dissemination (broadcast/       exhibitions) can be equally identified in a number of publically-funded       cultural heritage initiatives which have drawn directly on our       underpinning research.
These have included an audio tour by Fionnt&#225;n de       Br&#250;n of Belfast's Irish language heritage for the Culture Northern         Ireland website, the creation of tourist signage giving the history       of the Irish-speaking community in Bank St, and a historical booklet       produced as part of Belfast City Council's Cultural Tourism Strategy,       entitled `The Giant's Tale' (see Sources to corroborate).
Most recently,       as noted above, Belfast City Council's Good Relations Unit has taken the       Omeath Irish Language Community in Belfast as a central theme in its       cross-community partnership project.
A key aim of this project is to       enhance mutual understanding across Belfast's sectarian divide.
The underpinning research by Hughes and de Br&#250;n has also led to the       establishment of the ICSRI's highly successful annual `Robert Shipboy       MacAdam Memorial Lecture' and annual conference (&#201;igse Loch Lao)       which are designed to disseminate the work of the Irish and Celtic Studies       Research Institute to the public.
The initial proposal to commemorate the       life and work of Robert Shipboy MacAdam (1808-1895) was made by the late       Prof Breand&#225;n &#211; Buachalla at the launch of Belfast and the Irish         Language (de Br&#250;n, 2006a).
&#201;igse Loch Lao is the product of       a dynamic partnership with the influential Irish Language society, Cumann         Cult&#250;rtha Mhic Reachtain (The McCracken Cultural Society), who       jointly organise the conference along with the Irish and Celtic Studies       Research Institute.
The 2011 conference was officially opened by the Lord       Mayor of Belfast, Niall &#211; Donghaile, and was funded by Foras na         Gaeilge and Belfast City Council, while the 2013 conference was       attended by the current Lord Mayor M&#225;irt&#237;n &#211; Muilleoir.
The themes of       these conferences, The Irish Language in Schools, North and South       (2011) and Visual Media in the Irish Language (2013) are       indicative of our engagement with the public in these key areas.
In       addition, members of the ICSRI play a leading role in the McCracken       Cultural Society and showcase our research on the Irish language in       Belfast at the Society's summer school which attracts between 400 and 500       students annually.
Finally, our research into the history of the Irish language in an urban       environment has led to numerous radio, television and newspaper features,       some of which are internet accessible (see sources to corroborate).
