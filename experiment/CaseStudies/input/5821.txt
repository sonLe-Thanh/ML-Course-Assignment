     This programme of underpinning research at Aberdeen has elevated the role       of Smarter       travel choice interventions on the agenda of local authorities, the UK       &amp; Scottish Governments and       within the European Union.
The key to the impact generated from this       programme of research has       been the delivery of multiple, scientifically robust studies which have       identified a significant       potential to reduce car use in towns and regions under certain conditions.
The results have been       disseminated through a multitude of non-academic routes including       engagement in policy debates,       responses to requests by policy makers to comment on draft policy       guidance, provision of       evidence to government inquiries on climate change and transport, and       publication of reports by       sponsors on websites.
These reports have been picked up by numerous       non-academic user       groups such as local authority planners, companies and transport campaign       groups.
The impact has been achieved not only through the findings of individual       research projects,       but is elevated in reach and significance by the cumulative learning       resulting from the series of       inter-linked research projects considering different aspects related to       influencing behaviour and       providing sustainable transport services.
Consequently, Smarter Choices       and calculations of       potential impact resulting from the work of CTR is now quoted or used in       UK sustainable transport       policy documents at national and the local level, together with many       climate change strategy       documents.
In summary, the impacts can be summarised in the following       categories:     Impact on climate change policy.
The Effects of Smarter Choice Programmes in the Sustainable Travel           Towns directly informed         the Fourth Budget of the UK Committee on Climate Change's         recommendations that Smarter         Choices should contribute to carbon reduction targets from the transport         sector.
Citing our         research (1), the CCC's 2010 report to Parliament (a) said: "Based on         evidence from the         Sustainable Travel Towns, we propose that the rolling out of Smarter         choices initiatives across         all urban areas in the UK would result in cost effective emissions         reductions and wider         economic benefits (e.g.
reduced congestion)...could reduce emissions in         2020 by almost         3MtCO2."
(p120).
Similarly, Mitigating Transport's Climate Change Impact in           Scotland (MTCCI) (3) directly         informed Scottish Government climate change policy.
Their report Low           Carbon Scotland:           Meeting the Emissions Reduction Targets 2010-2022 (b) said: "The         Scottish Government's         proposals for significant further reduction of transport emissions are         based largely on the         findings of commissioned research on potential devolved policy options,         published in 2009         [citing (3)]" (p88).
As a result, their policy review set out specific         targets relating to smarter         Choices across Scotland including "all workplaces with more than 30         employees to have an         effective travel plan by 2022" and "personalised travel planning advice         provided to all         households in Scotland by 2022" (p91).
Impact on national sustainable transport policy and associated           government funding            The 2010 Spending Review announced &#163;560 million (later increased to         &#163;600m) for a Local         Sustainable Transport Fund which is now supporting 96 projects in 77         Local Authorities across         England.
In the associated guidance by the DfT (c), research by CTR was         directly cited: "This         recommendation draws heavily on the secondary data sources analysed         during the evaluation         of the Sustainable Travel Towns [citing (1)]" (p25).
This impact is         further corroborated by Dr         Lynn Sloman who says "As a member of the DfT Expert Panel for assessment         of local authority         bids to the Local Sustainable Travel Fund, I reviewed more than 60 of         the 155 local authority         proposals for funding for Smarter Choice programmes.
A large proportion         showed evidence         that the local authority developing the bid had drawn upon the         Sustainable Travel Towns         evaluation in designing their intervention programme."
(e)          Impact on transport policy and investment at Local Authority level           in the UK and Europe            At a local authority level, impact on practitioners is evident.
Research involving the STT         evaluation (1) and the SCSP evaluation (2) is included in Local         Authority Transport Plans, too         numerous to mention.
Owen Wilson, leader of the STT demonstrator project         for Darlington         Borough Council has stated that the STT evaluation "provided an         academically rigorous         independent evaluation including comparison with changes in travel         behaviour over the same         time period in other towns.
Since publication, Darlington is leading on         delivering smarter travel         measures in the Tees Valley and the southern part of Durham County."
(f)          Impact on campaigns and guidance produced by NGOs and public           transport operators            NGOs have taken on the evidence from the research and used it to build         the case for certain         packages of interventions to improve health and quality of life and         reduce carbon.
As clarified         by Stephen Joseph of the Campaign for Better Transport (to which Prof         Anable was invited to         become a Policy Advisor in 2010) "through the work by Prof Anable and         colleagues it can be         said that this area of transport policy now has a better evidence based         underpinning it than         many much larger transport investment programmes.
Prof Anable's work on         behaviour change         has also been used more widely, including in specific projects funded by         the LSTF and other         sources, to segment local populations and target interventions at groups         and areas where         change in travel behaviour is most likely."
(g)          Impact on the policy debate            Prof Anable gets invited to advise local and national government on         Smarter Choices policy,         segmentation and evaluation.
For example, in May 2011, The DfT wrote to         Prof Anable saying:         "I know you have made extremely valuable contributions to this area of         work [Smarter Choices].
The department is also extremely grateful for the advice you have         provided on Smarter         Choices in the past.
Given your expertise, the DfT is keen to receive         your thoughts on a         proposed approach to quantifying the impact of Smarter Choices over the         next 15-20 years."
The project manager for the STT evaluation at the DfT has also provided         a corroborating         statement.
(h)       Based on her research findings, Prof Anable was further invited in         January 2011 to provide the         opening presentation to the House of Lords Science and Technology         Committee inquiry on         behaviour change and a further invitation to provide oral evidence to         the committee (d).
In summary, our work in Aberdeen provided evidence that went on to inform       a national roll       out of Smarter Choices initiatives with associated funding and policy       guidance.
Impact continues to       expand in terms of reach and significance, as can be testified by Lynn       Sloman (e) who has built up       a consultancy specialising in Smarter Choices advice and evaluation.
The       findings and       segmentation tool from the EU SEGMENT project are about to be implemented       by the city of       Utrecht who said "The participation in SEGMENT, and especially the       segmentation developed by       Jillian Anable, has had a bit influence on the mobility management policy       of the City of Utrecht" (i),       with further uptake by other European cities over the coming 12-24 months.
Interest is also being       expressed by local authorities further afield including Australia and New       Zealand.
