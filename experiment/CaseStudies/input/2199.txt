     Alcohol misuse presents a considerable problem in England, with over 10       million adults drinking more than Government-set lower-risk limits, and       2.6 million drinking more than higher-risk limits (EV b).
Alcohol-linked       hospital admissions were 1.2 million during 2010-11 (EV c).
In financial       terms, alcohol-related harm costs the UK economy up to &#163;25.1 billion       annually (EV b, d), and costs the health service &#163;2.7 billion (EV b, d).
Newcastle research on reducing alcohol-related risk has influenced       national policy, practice and patients themselves, specifically by       introducing and promoting methods of screening and brief intervention       (SBI).
The first step involves screening, via a short questionnaire, to       identify which individuals would benefit from brief intervention, in the       form of specific advice or counselling to help a patient reduce their       drinking behaviour.
Impact of Newcastle research on policy       This has been demonstrated through specific citation of Newcastle-led work       in a wide range of national policy documents and reports.
A 2008 National Audit Office report (EV d) cites the Cochrane       Collaboration systematic review (R6), stating that: "a meta-analysis of         22 randomised control trials concluded that, overall, brief         interventions lowered alcohol consumption."
This Cochrane review was       also included in the March 2009 House of Commons Select Committee on       Alcohol (EV b), in which Kaner represented an expert source of evidence.
This report states: "Since excessive drinking is responsive to even         brief intervention in community-based settings [the reference given       is R5], it is imperative that the public health community acts to         prevent alcohol-related risk and harm across the population."
Impact of Newcastle research on practice       Since 2008, the Newcastle-developed SBI programme `How Much is Too         Much' has been included in six annual Directed Enhanced Service       documents (EV e).
These are commissioned by the Department of Health and       delivered to patients via their Primary Care Trust.
Each refers to R7,       stating: "The recommended brief advice is the basic five minutes of         advice used in the [World Health Organization] clinical trial ...         using a programme modified for the UK context by the University of         Newcastle: `How Much is Too Much?'."
(R6).
The Department of Health's Alcohol Policy Team states: "I can confirm         that your reports and the advice you provided for consideration by the         Quality Outcomes Framework Expert Group certainly made its way into the         thinking that informed the development of the Directed Enhanced Service.
In addition, the advice you produced in the reports and the material you         developed from the `How Much is Too Much?'
programme went on to be the         basis of the Primary Care Service Framework that we use to support the         Directed Enhanced Service and local variations in the form of Local         Enhanced Services."
(EV f)     Professor Kaner brought the results of Newcastle-led research on SBI to       the NICE Programme Development Group, which she chaired in 2009-10.
In       June 2010, this group published an extensive set of evidence-based       recommendations (NICE guidance 24, EV g, page 34) to guide policy and       practice in this area.
These guidelines specifically cite `How Much is         Too Much?
', along with the Drink-Less pack, as "coordinated         collections of evidence-based materials for use when screening and         carrying out a brief intervention".
The Government's 2012 Alcohol       Strategy (EV c, page 24) is informed by these NICE guidelines: "[NICE]         recommends that NHS health professionals routinely carry out alcohol         screening as an integral part of their practice".
In terms of reducing costs, the Department of Health estimates that       screening and brief advice can save a primary care trust &#163;650,000       annually.
At the time of the document's publication in December 2009, this       figure applied to over 150 primary care trusts, representing annual saving       of nearly &#163;100 million across the UK (EV h).
Impact of Newcastle research on patients       Screening and brief intervention have already started to improve patient       health: a 2010 report commissioned by the Centre for Public Health       Excellence on behalf of NICE (EV i, page 17) included R5 as part of "a         considerable body of evidence supportive of the effectiveness of brief         interventions for alcohol misuse in reducing alcohol consumption,         mortality, morbidity, alcohol-related injuries, alcohol-related social         consequences, healthcare resource use and laboratory indicators of         alcohol misuse".
Using GP Read code data as a measure of delivery, recent Newcastle work       showed an increase in the use of formal screening tools, from 0.8% in 2008       to 7.5% in 2011 (EV j).
Since screening and feedback may be sufficient to       reduce drinking, by alerting patients to their drinking levels, this       increase in screening indicates that a growing number of patients are       receiving targeted help to reduce alcohol consumption.
In summary, Newcastle work that developed a UK-specific screening       and brief intervention programme has influenced national policy, been       widely recommended and has seen increased use in general practice.
