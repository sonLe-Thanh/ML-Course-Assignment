Approximately       30,000 copies of the book were distributed worldwide in the REF period.
In Europe, Aesop's Fables received favourable reviews in the UK       in the Summer 2011 edition of Armadillo magazine, in Carousel       and in the Winter 2011 edition of The School Librarian.
Grobler       was invited, in the REF period, to exhibit illustrations from Aespop's         Fables and subsequent work for picture books with African themes in       a public exhibition to be held at the Kinderbuchhaus im Schneiderh&#228;usl,       Oberndorf in August 2013.
Alongside, he was invited to lead a workshop for       12 professional illustrators to explore the re-presentation of `African'       content for a Western readership' (although he was ultimately unable to do       so as a result of unanticipated personal circumstances).
In Spain, three illustrations from Aesop's Fables together with       other examples of Grobler's work were included in a public exhibition, IllustraMundos,       held at Colegio de Fonseca, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela (1st       March-20th May 2012).
The exhibition brought together the work       of eleven illustrators (Grobler and: Joanna Domanska, Poland; Carme Sol&#233;       Vendrell, Catalonia; Antonio Seijas and David Pintor, Galicia; Monica       Weiss, Argentina; Machiel Braaksma, The Netheralnds; Fernando Vilela,       Brazil; Elena Odriozola, Basque Country; Kristina Sabaita, Lithunania;       Marc Taeger, Switzerland) and, as well as a daily throughput of visitors,       attracted 95 organised group visits from primary schools, high schools,       associations working with children with disabilities, and professionals       associated with the book- and illustration industries.
The exhibition web       site attracted nearly 14,000 visitors; interviews with each participating       illustrator were featured on the Campus Culturae Youtube channel (the       University's TV channel accessible to the entire university community and       its visitors), with a recorded 2,256 people watching Grobler's interview.
The Facebook site for the exhibition received nearly 7,000 visits.
The       exhibition was funded by The Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive       Agency of the EU (EUROPA &#8212; EACEA).
In January 2014, the University of       Santiago de Compostela will open the Museo Internacional de la       Illustracion - a virtual museum of picture book illustration, including       three of Grobler's Aesop illustrations on long-term loan.
