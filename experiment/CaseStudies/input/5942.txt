     This study was commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)       to feed directly into policy, training and practice.
On the basis of our       research, we have brought about changes within DWP and Jobcentre Plus.
The       following impacts can be highlighted:     4.1 Through regular presentations, Working Papers, and our final report,       our research substantially increased policymakers' understanding of a         key area &#8212; advisory interviews - over which they have policy control       (see 5.1, below).
As a civil servant based in the Jobcentre Plus Strategic       Planning Division commented in June 2009 (see 5.2, below): "Your papers         have proved very useful... as we develop our strategy story.
I think         much of what your papers tell us is about how we approach and deal with         our future learning routeway.
Our Learning and Development colleagues         will probably be adamant that they encourage open questioning as part of         their training techniques etc., but your research offers so much more         and I think we need to take that on board".
This same civil servant (now a DWP manager for the Fraud National Account       Team) more recently commented that the study's impact has travelled beyond       its initial remit: "The skills and experiences I picked up from [this]         work and the video evidence she [Toerien] shared from the joint         workshops we held, have helped me, four years later, to consider how I         can better equip my current team, who focus on interviews where benefit         fraud is the primary driver, to be more effective and successful in         asking the right questions and then responding to the customer in often         tense and demanding interview situations" (April 2013).
The study's reach has also extended beyond its immediate users (in       Jobcentre Plus and DWP) to the Citizens' Advice Bureau (who cite our       research in their 2010 report, "Fair welfare: supporting claimants into       work") and to the senior committee advising Government on social security       policy - the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC).
In March 2010, we       were invited to present our findings to SSAC, allowing them to see for the       first time how advisory interviews are actually conducted.
Thanked by the       Chair for "an open discussion with Members", we showed clips from our       recordings which led the committee to reflect on how the interviews might       be improved.
The meeting minutes can be provided for audit purposes (see       5.3, below).
The relevance of our research has continued to be recognised following       the 2010 change in Government and subsequent changes to the benefits       system.
In March 2013, we were invited to present our findings at the Behaviour         Change and Adviser Effectiveness Workshop, organised by the DWP (see       5.1).
There were over 200 attendees, including senior policymakers and       advisers.
As a result, we have subsequently met with the Principal       Psychologist at the DWP, to consult on how our work might contribute to a       `behavioural framework' (still under development) for DWP at both policy       and delivery levels (see 5.2).
4.2 DWP's approach to evaluating advisory practices in Jobcentre Plus         has changed as a result of our study.
This is evident in two       subsequent pieces of research.
First, on the basis of our interim results,       DWP commissioned us to assess &#8212; using the same methodology &#8212; whether there       was evidence of age-based discrimination in advisory interviews (DWP       report no.634, HMSO; see 5.4).
Second, citing our final report, an       evaluation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills used our       criteria for assessing the effectiveness of adviser techniques and styles.
The evaluation was commissioned specifically to shape Government reforms       of the welfare-to-work programme (see 5.5).
4.3 The evidence base generated by our study has contributed directly         to policy changes concerning the content and conduct of advisory         interviews.
This is evidenced by two announcements made in the       official DWP Press Releases (June 2010) for the main study report and the       related report on age-based discrimination (see 4.2, above).
The former       states that: "Since the research was conducted in 2007 and 2008,         Jobcentre Plus has introduced a range of materials for Advisers and         their Managers which draws on findings from the study"       (see 5.6, below).
The latter states that: "As a result of this           research more training is being introduced to help         advisers understand the detailed issues faced by some people over the         age of 50" (see 5.7, below).
A senior civil servant based in the DWP       (Labour Market Strategy Unit) also noted that: "The findings from this         research have already helped inform decision-making around the         moving/removal of a claimant segmentation tool which was shown to be         impeding the Work Focused Interviews between advisers and some         claimants.
Their research results have deepened our understanding of         what makes an effective adviser" (April 2013, see 5.2).
Since DWP       policy determines what advisers are expected to cover with claimants on       the frontline, such changes impact advisers' day- to-day practice and,       hence, the quality of support received by claimants.
4.4 Our findings have been translated directly into an evidence-based         training package for advisers.
At the invitation of the DWP &#8212; and       part-funded by them &#8212; we held a two-day workshop at York in June 2013 (see       5.1).
The workshop offered intensive, tailored, interactive training for       fifteen advisers with the goal of enabling them to implement our findings       effectively when talking with claimants.
Feedback showed the value of       using recordings of real interviews in training: "Brought home how much         we need to simplify communications instead of overloading claimant &#8212;         particularly at first interview" (anonymous feedback from       participant).
Run as a pilot for a forthcoming DWP-led randomised       controlled trial of different approaches to adviser training, this       workshop may be rolled out across Jobcentre Plus nationally (depending on       the results of the trial).
A senior civil servant based in the DWP (Labour       Market Strategy Unit) noted: "This research has had both impacts in the         immediate and potentially long term performance gains.
We are now using         the results of this research to develop and test a CA informed adviser         training programme.
The results of this research have the potential to         change the whole adviser training approach" (April 2013, see 5.2).
In sum, our research has had a significant impact beyond academia, with       beneficiaries including those on the frontline (advisers), those expected       to obtain personalised support from advisers (claimants), those who manage       Jobcentre Plus and DWP, and those with responsibility for UK social       security policy.
The evidence presented in this case study shows not only       impact to date, but the strong potential for ongoing impact, as our       findings continue to be used to improve the conduct of adviser-claimant       interviews in Jobcentre Plus.
