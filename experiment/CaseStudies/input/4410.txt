     As a result of the research she had undertaken in workplace and business       discourse, Koester was one of two academics invited by Cambridge       University Press to join a team of authors collaborating on a coursebook       project for teaching Business English, entitled Business Advantage.
The team began work on the course project in January 2009, leading to the       publication of the three levels of Business Advantage in 2012:       Level 1: Intermediate, Level 2: Upper -intermediate (both       January 2012) and Level 3: Advanced (September 2012).
Koester was co-author of the first two levels.
Koester's research outlined in Section 2 was used to inform the following       aspects of Levels 1 and 2 of the course: business skills and strategies       taught, the structure of and linguistic characteristics of different types       of business interaction (e.g.
job interviews, negotiations, meetings),       grammar, vocabulary and phraseology, intercultural aspects of       communication.
Her work on idioms and metaphors was used in all three       levels.
Specific examples of how underpinning research (outlined in Section           2) fed into the course material:            The integral role played by relational talk, which is the most         significant finding of Koester's research, is highlighted throughout the         course, and various aspects of relational talk are dealt with at all         levels, e.g.
Level 1 - BA Intermediate, 1.3 `Beginning a         business relationship' and 12.3 on polite requests, Level 2 - BA           Upper-intermediate 13.3, `Supporting the speaker'.
The topics for the Skills units in Levels 1 and 2 are based on         Koester's description and classification of `spoken professional         genres', e.g.
units on making arrangements, briefing, meetings,         problem-solving and decision-making and negotiations.
A number of Skills units deal specifically with         characteristics of decision-making and instruction- giving or explaining         procedures as investigated by Koester: Level 1 - BA Intermediate         5.3, on `briefing', BA Intermediate 13.3 on problem-solving,         Level 2 - BA Upper-intermediate 4.3 on decision-making.
In         addition a number of Language Focus sections present the         linguistic characteristics of these genres, such the use of modal verbs,         as identified by Koester (e.g.
Level 1 - BA Intermediate 11.2,         p.104: `modal verbs for obligation and advice').
The role of idioms and metaphor in spoken workplace interactions,         identified by Koester, is dealt with in a number of units, e.g.
Level 1         &#8212; BA Intermediate 13.3, Level 2 - BA Upper-intermediate         6.3, Level 3 - BA Advanced 5.3 on `conflictual idioms and         metaphors'.
These are all innovative, research-informed features of the course that         have not previously been included in Business English textbooks, or       if the topics have been dealt with (e.g.
meetings and negotiations) they       have not included the language features identified by Koester's research.
As a result of the input by Koester and Handford, Business Advantage       draws extensively on a corpus of recorded and transcribed professional       interactions and on research carried out on such interactions, and is         the first business textbook to do so.
To date, research on workplace       and professional discourse has had very little impact on teaching       materials for Business English, and by addressing this gap, Business         Advantage is well-placed to be a vehicle for significant research       impact on the teaching of Business English.
Informing and influencing the form and content of Business English           teaching       Business Advantage is a course for the international market       produced by one of the world's main English Language Teaching publishers,       Cambridge University Press, which markets its products round the world.
It       is aimed at a wide target audience: teachers, programme directors and       learners of English at tertiary level (for example enrolled in MBA       programmes) as well as those already in work.
Key markets, in addition to       the UK, include Germany, Russia and Eastern Europe.
By July 2013, the       course had been adopted by at least 7 institutions in 6 European       countries, totalling over 600 students or more, and at least two       further institutions, including one in Brazil, were considering adoption       for 2013/14.
Between the launch of the course in 2012 (Levels 1 and 2 published       January 2012 and Level 3, September 2012) and July 2013, the Student's       Books alone had sold over 17,500 copies.
Total sales including all       components (Teacher's book, Personal Study book, Audio CD, DVD and       Classware) were at 30,484 (source 1).
Cambridge University Press's Professional         English Online Website (http://peo.cambridge.org/),       the key vehicle for promoting the course, had 67,394 visits and 54,084       unique visitors in 2012, indicating the demand for information about the       course.
Data for the Business Advantage pages are as follows       (source 2):            Business Advantage Intermediate resources page: 14,161 hits       Business Advantage Upper-intermediate resources page: 9,256 hits       Business Advantage Upper-intermediate resources page: 8,275 hits          The course has been very well received both within the teaching community       and by students.
Business Advantage has been reviewed in at least       one print (English Language Gazette) and two online resources for       English teachers and by one Economics university.
All reviews have been       positive throughout and highlighted the research input of the course, for       example referring to the material as `ground-breaking' and the         approach as `inventively authentic' (sources 3-5).
In order to       assess the impact of the language research input of the course amongst       those already using it, a questionnaire for teachers and learners was sent       via Cambridge University Press's Marketing Department to customers in the       following countries who adopted or piloted the course in 2012: Lithuania,       Poland, The Ukraine, Switzerland and Brazil.
Both students and teachers       rated the course as `excellent', `very good' or `good' overall and the         research-informed components of the course (spoken skills, writing and         language focus) were rated very positively.
`Strategy training based       on real-world examples' was highlighted as a unique component of the         course, and `the amount and quality of listening practice' (which is       also research-based) was highlighted as particularly useful (source 6).
Koester delivered workshops and presentations focusing on the research       impact on course material from Business Advantage at 3       teacher/educator conferences and 5 teacher training events in 5 countries       between 2011 and 2012.
As the researcher on this project, Koester has a       key role to play in demonstrating how research has informed the teaching       materials and showing teachers how such findings can be incorporated into       their teaching.
Feedback on the research impact of the talk was gathered       via a questionnaire at the teacher training events for example, with 94 in       total completing the questionnaire.
The vast majority responded       positively, 98% agreeing that it is important for Business English courses       to be based on research into real business communication and 85% that the       material presented from Business Advantage draws on research in a       pedagogically effective way.
More than 97% of respondents indicated         that they would consider teaching with this material (source 7).
