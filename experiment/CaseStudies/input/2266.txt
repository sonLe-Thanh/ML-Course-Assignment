     Context       Dental decay is an almost entirely preventable condition, yet it       represents the most common cause of disease among children in the UK and       is the most frequent reason for children to require admission to hospital       for a procedure under general anaesthesia.
Historically, child oral health       in Scotland has been among the worst in Europe.
In the mid-2000s a       staggering 30% of 3-year-old children in Glasgow showed evidence of dental       disease with social deprivation, poor diet (frequent sugar consumption),       lack of tooth brushing and difficulty in accessing regular dental       check-ups contributing to the problem.
This unacceptably early age of       onset of child dental disease prompted the Scottish Government to       highlight child oral health as a priority health concern.
Childsmile: a preventive oral health programme for every child in           Scotland       University of Glasgow researchers were central to the establishment of Childsmile       &#8212; a robust programme of evidence-based preventive care and practical       dental health support and advice delivered to all Scottish children and/or       their families.
Childsmile employs an overarching population-based       programme of nursery and school-based tooth brushing, oral health       improvement initiatives and clinical prevention, with more intensive       support provided for those children at high risk of dental decay.
This       innovative approach (developed from 2001-2009) was later called       `proportionate universalism' by The Marmot Review in 2010.
In Childsmile,       children at high risk are identified at birth - before dental decay even       occurs - and referred to a more intensive programme of oral health support       from health visitors and community-based dental health support workers.a     Childsmile has delivered major improvements in child oral health       The National Dental Inspection Programme (NDIP) is an oral health       surveillance programme undertaken annually for the Health Boards and       Scottish Government to monitor levels of dental decay in school children       (ages 5 and 11 years).
These data are used to inform government of the       prevalence of dental decay and to monitor the effects of oral health       improvement programmes.
Before introduction of the oral health initiatives       led by the University of Glasgow team, dental decay was present in 54% of       Scottish 5-year-olds (2000), rising to 79% among those from the most       severely deprived backgrounds.
Since the introduction of the national       tooth brushing initiative (2001), and later the start of the Childsmile       programme (2006), levels of dental decay decreased dramatically in       5-year-olds to 42% in 2008, 36% in 2010 and 33% in 2012.b       Crucially, dental decay in the most severely deprived children reduced       from 79% (2000) to 55% (2010).c Between 2002 and 2011 this       translated to 5749 fewer children per annum undergoing general anaesthesia       for extraction of teeth (from 15,877 to 10,128 respectively), highlighting       the positive impact of Childsmile on cases of severe decay.
Childsmile incorporated into national dental service contract and           child health surveillance       In October 2011, in direct response to the demonstrated benefits above, Childsmile       was formally incorporated into the Scottish NHS primary care dental       contract (Statement of Dental Remuneration).d This ensured       delivery of Childsmile at all levels of the NHS general dental       service for all children from birth to 12 years of age in Scotland,       providing robust oral health care to over 730,000 children per annum.
This       change was described by Scotland's Chief Dental Officer as     "the most significant change to the NHS primary care dental contract       since its inception [and] the first attempt to shift dentistry from a       treatment to prevention anticipatory care model."
The National Child Health Surveillance assessment is the cornerstone of       the Scottish Government's Child Health Programme.
This mandatory       assessment, consisting of core health screening, is carried out by health       visitors on every child at 6&#8212;8 weeks of age with a review at 27&#8212;30 months       of age.
In 2012 a Childsmile referral option was formally embedded       into the Child Health Surveillance assessment performed at 6-8 weeks; this       was extended to inclusion in the 27-30 months review in 2013.e       This clear governmental support for inclusion of Childsmile in       this process reflects the value of investing in universal oral health       monitoring from birth.
University of Glasgow continued evaluation and improvement of           Childsmile       Professor Macpherson continues to have a pivotal role in Childsmile.
As Co-Director and Evaluation Lead, she is responsible for its continuous       development and on-going delivery of the programme.
This is achieved       through her Community Oral Health research group, which provides       fundamental expertise in delivering 6-monthly quantitative and qualitative       formative evaluation reports with feedback to each of the Health Boards,       Programme Boards and the Scottish Government for the on-going improvement       and development of the programme, ensuring that Childsmile is       constantly responsive to the needs of the target population.
The group       carried out a cost analysis of the national nursery tooth-brushing       programme for the Health Management Committee of the Scottish Government       in June 2013, and showed an expected cost saving to the health service of       &#163;3.9 million per annum, a decade after its introduction.f     Childsmile provides training and resources to support dental health           professionals       Public awareness and acceptance of the Childsmile programme has       been achieved using bright, attractive colours and an easily recognisable       Childsmile logo.
The Childsmile websitea       provides information to parents as well as a comprehensive section for       dental professionals with links to the programme outline, NHS Education       for Scotland (NES) training courses and the underpinning evidence from       University of Glasgow and the wider research community.
In the 16 months       since the Childsmile website was upgraded in March 2012, it has       had more than 68,000 visitors browsing an average of 4 pages per visit.
Visitor demographics show that users are located in the UK, US, Australia,       Asia and the Middle East.g The website also links to the Childsmile       manual which provides information to support dental professionals in the       implementation and delivery of the programme.
Over the same period, the       manual has been the most popular download from the Childsmile site (2013       times) and the tooth-brushing video has been the most viewed (1167 views)       further demonstrating usage of the resources embedded within the Childsmile       site.g Drawing directly on the community development model       developed and evaluated by the Community Oral Health Group (ref 2 section       3) the delivery of Childsmile within dental practices is       complemented by specially trained, dedicated Childsmile community       and practice-based dental health staff.
Since 2008, 1149 such staff have       been trained by NES to deliver Childsmile.h                Childsmile's success has been recognised internationally       Childsmile is Scotland's flagship oral health improvement programme       and its success has been recognised internationally.
Professor Macpherson       and her team have given over 40 presentations on the Childsmile       programme, both nationally and internationally.i A Europe-wide       initiative launched in response to a European Parliament call cited Childsmile       as best practice in oral health promotion in its 2012 report, "The State       of Oral Health in Europe".j In Wales, a similar programme       called "Designed to Smile" is currently being implemented in       response to the clear benefits of Childsmile in Scotland, and Childsmile       was cited in the National Assembly for Wales's inquiry into child oral       health.k Furthermore, based on her experience with Childsmile       in Scotland&#184; Professor Macpherson has been appointed (July 2013) as an       Advisor to a Public Health England working group as they develop national       guidance for Local Authorities on child oral health improvement       programmes.l In light of New Zealand's potential withdrawal of       mass water fluoridation, Professor Macpherson was the keynote speaker at       The New Zealand Community Dental Services Society forum (May 2012) and       also gave presentations around New Zealand on the Childsmile       strategy.
By providing a personalised, practical dental care programme for every       child in Scotland from birth, Childsmile has established the       foundations of sustainable oral health for the future.
