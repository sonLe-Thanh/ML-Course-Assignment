     New Cartographies: Algeria-France-UK was a free exhibition of       contemporary visual art, co-curated       by Welch and the project PI, and staged at Cornerhouse Gallery from 8       April to 5 June       2011.
It featured film, video and photography-based work by ten visual       artists from Algeria, Britain       and France, including the established figures Kader Attia and Zineb       Sedira, and emerging Algerian       artists showing their work in the UK for the first time (Amina Menia and       Zineddine Bessa&#239;).
The       curators selected work which echoed the concerns of the research project,       such as Bessa&#239;'s maps       of clandestine migration, and Sedira's video portrait of Safia Kouaci,       widow of Algerian       photographer Mohamed Kouaci and guardian of his archive.
They also       commissioned new work       from UK-based photographer John Perivolaris, who undertook a journey from       Manchester to       Algeria, taking images at key locations of memory in France and Algeria       which formed the basis of       an installation in the gallery.
They organised work in three themed floors        &#8212;  Journeys, Resources       and Memories  &#8212;  which they presented as keys to understanding the       Franco-Algerian relationship in       the accompanying exhibition guide.
The exhibition attracted a large audience of 14,649 visitors.
New media       were used extensively to       aid interpretation.
As curators, Welch and the PI provided contextual       material about each artist       through QR barcodes in the gallery, for scanning by smartphones, and       subsequently available on       the exhibition web page.
The web page has been maintained since the       exhibition closed, and has       attracted 5,935 views.
Podcasts featuring the exhibition have been played       729 times, and there       have been an average of 4,000 hits for each of four blogs written by the       curators before and during       the exhibition [source 1; all figures accurate as of 31 July 2013].
426       people attended the public       engagement activities accompanying the exhibition, including four gallery       tours led by curators and       artists; a workshop on contemporary art in Algeria organised by the       curators, with contributions       from academics, artists and gallery professionals; a film season on       contemporary Arab and       Maghrebi cinema; and a six-week course on art and politics led by the       curators [source 2].
The       course was informed by questions central to the research project,       including how contemporary       visual art responds to international socio-political debates; how artists       address politics in their work;       and how contemporary visual art circulates inside and outside the       established art world.
According       to Cornerhouse's economic impact report, gallery visits generated an       estimated &#163;636,000 gross       (&#163;359,000 net) for the Greater Manchester and North West regional       economies through spending       on accommodation, catering, transport, shopping and other activities       [source 3].
The exhibition helped Cornerhouse to meet its objective of promoting the       work of artists who       interrogate international socio-political concerns.
Its Programme and       Engagement Director stated       that `it is very unusual for an exhibition to be curated by academics and       funded by a research       council but we were delighted with the standard and outcomes of New         Cartographies.
Visitor       numbers were excellent, there was strong interaction and the feedback       suggested it was a       powerful, thought-provoking exhibition that had a profound effect on       attitudes and understanding       across different cultures' [source 4].
An Artistic Assessment commissioned       by Arts Council       England noted that `the exhibition as a whole has strong impact       communicating the overall aims of       the exhibition intelligently and thoughtfully', and that it was `very       timely in relation to the on-going       political events across many parts of North Africa' [source 5].
The       Cultural Counsellor at the French       Embassy in London described it as an `incredible exhibition which [....]       definitely contributed to a       better understanding between cultures by shedding light through the means       of contemporary art       upon less media-documented parts of decades of socio-political relations       between France, Algeria       and the UK' [source 6].
Other visitors at the preview evening commented:             `The conceptualisation of it is brilliant and the diversity of the         work is extremely impressive.'
`It's the first time I've come up to the galleries at the         Cornerhouse.
I thought it was very         interesting and I learnt new things about Algeria.'
`I really like the idea of transition and movement of people, it's a         really interesting thing to try to         map.
The way they've done it conveys the human side of it.'
[source 7]          According to the specialist magazine Art Monthly, `New         Cartographies maps out changes in the       cultural perception of boundaries inside and outside Algeria [...]       Indicative of a raised level of       consciousness across North Africa, ideas have been conceived with       political acumen in new media       formats yet the subject matter is expressed and espoused with considerable       feeling' [source 8].
The exhibition provided professional development opportunities for two       artists based in Algeria       (Amina Menia, Zineddine Bessa&#239;), who had little or no previous experience       of exhibiting outside       their own countries.
Menia was interviewed on the BBC World Service       programme The Strand (first       broadcast 6 April 2011, estimated audience 40 million people worldwide),       along with Zineb Sedira,       whose installation was receiving its UK premiere at Cornerhouse.
Two       artists sold work exhibited in       the show, and the work commissioned from Perivolaris led directly to       collaboration with the       American novelist Benjamin Buchholz on a photo-essay and related projects.
Perivolaris       commented that, `the commission provided me with an opportunity to broaden       my horizons as a       photographer by using my camera to seek insights into the people, politics       and culture of a country       which has experienced colonialism, repression and civil war' [source 9].
At 31 July 2013, the blog       produced by Perivolaris as part of his commission has attracted 19,058       views.
An unexpected political impact occurred when one of the Algerian artists       was refused a visa by the       UK Border Agency to attend the opening of the exhibition.
His case became       part of a campaign to       ease visa restrictions on foreign artists visiting Britain, supported by       leading figures in the arts       world, including Antony Gormley.
The issue was raised in the House of       Lords by the Earl of       Clancarty, and was the subject of a letter published in The Daily         Telegraph, supported by 100       signatories including the Cornerhouse team [source 10].
The immigration       minister Damien Green       announced in January 2012 that he would legislate in this area to allow       talented artists to enter the       UK more easily, although the matter was yet to be resolved.
