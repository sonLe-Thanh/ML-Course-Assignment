     The Information Systems and Management Group have been collaborating       internationally since 1998.
Under the EU's Tempus programme, projects       valued at &#8364;1.8million have been awarded to a consortium led by the Group.
Since 2008, the Group has worked with 9 international institutions on       Tempus and other knowledge exchange projects.
In 2010, the Group was asked       by the consortium to lead a new Tempus project entitled `Innovation and       Knowledge Management towards e-Student Information System' (iKnow), funded       under a 2-year Tempus IV award (&#8364;560,000) which started in October 2010       [1].
The iKnow project drew substantially on the research carried out by Patel       and colleagues on the GRBOM.
It resulted in and implemented the first       electronic student record and management system for 8 out of 10 (public       and private) HEIs in the Republic of Macedonia, covering a student cohort       of 80,000 out of a total population of 100,000.
Key deliverables from the project were (i) the production of a       student/electronic HEI system software platform, (ii) its testing and       circulation, (iii) dissemination via web promotion (social networks),       brochures, workshops, 100+ meetings, including steering, management,       project management and development meetings, (iv) demonstrations through       more than 100 activities (identified in the final Tempus report) [2].
The       Evaluation Report from TEMPUS congratulated the consortium "on the high         standards reached in the activities", and on "the sustainability         of the system" and that "despite the initial resistance to change         at the beginning, staff at the universities have accepted the system and         even asked for new functionalities" [3].
Given the collaborative nature of the Tempus IV project and the various       stakeholders and beneficiaries involved, LSBU commissioned an Independent       Consultancy to visit Macedonia to ascertain the scope and reach of iKnow       impact over the period 2011 to 31 July 2013.
The consultant interviewed a       representative from the Ministry of Education, the Rector, the       Vice-Rector, the Head of Computing, the Tempus lead from the University of       Skopje, and the Dean of Faculty at the South East European University [4].
The consultant confirmed that the iKnow project had successfully       delivered a comprehensive range of outputs and outcomes.
This included the       introduction of new Government legislation to enable electronic record       keeping of personal details, and specifically, in the case of iKnow, to be       enacted and deployed across Macedonia's education system.
By 31 July 2013, eight of the Macedonian universities had completed a       full year using the iKnow system with the largest HEI (University of       Skopje) having used the system for two years.
Prior to the introduction of       the iKnow system, students needed to collect and provide paper based       records and physically visit the University for an average of two days, to       enrol and register for courses in their first year of study (average       undergraduate course in Macedonia lasts 3.5 years).
Returning students go       through the same procedure twice a year, taking approximately 1 day/annum       in total.
To accommodate the registration and enrolment processes a       further 1058 days (558 administration days and 500 academic days) of       University time is required.
iKnow-Related Time and Associated Cost Savings:                                           Student transactions           Total days           Cost per day (Euros)*           Total Direct Cost (Euros)                             New Student enrolments           30,014           60,028           25           1.5million                             Semester enrolments           176,986           176,986           4           707,944                             University administration                      558           20           11,160                             University Academic                      500           65           32,500                          *costs provided by University of Skopje     The consultant's impact statement concluded that the savings identified       within the REF impact period were 237,014 student days with associated       cost savings of 2.2 million Euros.
With additional time savings and costs       to the universities of 1,058 days and 43,660 Euros respectively [5].
In terms of significance, the iKnow system has been adopted extensively       within the 8 universities, delivering the following key benefits:            For the first time, iKnow allows students with a greater choice of         degrees and degree modules;       Provides a more efficient and flexible real time resource for planning         and scheduling of staff and resources, providing significant efficiency         gains;       Provides a real time fully integrated financial recording and payment         system to support the management and deployment of resources;       Provides dynamic student attendance records, registration fees,         transcripts with European Credit Transfer (ECT) based on the Bologna         process and assessment registration;       Manages debt for fees and has resulted in the decrease in bad debt         from over 20% to less than 1%;       Provides IT and the communication architecture and processes, for the         first time, allowing direct electronic communication with students,         parents and other stakeholders (e.g.
via email, Facebook and Twitter);       Provides and delivers critical HEI management information, on staff         performance allowing for more effective reward and promotion.
The Rector of the University of Skopje commented "all 23 faculties are         now using the system with the vast majority intending to further develop         the system to provide additional benefits" [4].
Further, the Dean of Computing commented "Professors have embraced         email and social media facilitated by the iKnow system to provide         efficient communication with individual students and classes" [4].
The Macedonian Ministry of Education representative confirmed to the       consultant, that the iKnow system represents, and has made, a significant       breakthrough for education in Macedonia.
He confirmed that it is the very       first comprehensive and sophisticated electronic student management and       enrolment system ever adopted in Macedonia that has led to changes in       legislation to recognise electronic records as official documents.
Furthermore, the Macedonian government is well aware of the impact derived       from: (i) delivering sound data sets and real time information, and (ii)       informing the Government's understanding of higher education and planning.
The Ministry of Education, now promptly receives information on the       student population and its performance and this is used to support       government understanding and inform policy [6].
The Government       representative also confirmed that the Government is considering adopting       iKnow for use throughout the school system [4].
