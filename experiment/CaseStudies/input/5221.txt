Economic: early intervention saves money     The LSE research was used by officers and paralegals in the Law Centre       Federation, and by other       actors in the broader field of legal-aid-funded advice, in a campaign to       secure public funds for       advice services.
The research provided them with evidence in support of       their claim that early       intervention in problem cases would save money in the longer term (by       preventing complex knock-on 	  effects, and by forestalling the emergence of `problem clusters').
In       other words, the research       supported their claim that in the long run it would cost more to cut funds       and to force paralegals in       Law Centres to adopt the new `fixed fee' regime as this would force them       to waste time on       calculating their exact fee rather than delivering value for money through       the benefits of face-to-face advice.
Two further reports used the paper (among other data) in support of       similar claims about the `value       for money' offered by advisers (citing it as James 2010, `At the legal       interface'):     "For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on housing advice, the state       potentially saves &#163;2.34."
"For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on debt advice, the state       potentially saves &#163;2.98."
"For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on benefits advice, the state       potentially saves &#163;8.80."
"For every &#163;1 of legal aid expenditure on employment advice, the state       potentially saves &#163;7.13."

This report attempted to give a monetary value to case-worker/client       interactions in order to prove       their indispensability [A].
A second report, authored by the Council for Social Action set up in 2007       by then Prime Minister       Gordon Brown, cited a different draft of the same paper &#8212; James and       Killick (in preparation), `Afraid       of the Form' &#8212; in support of its claim that empathy and quality       interaction are of key importance:     `the quality of the human relationship between the person delivering       public services and the person       using public services is an important factor' [C].
From the case workers'       point of view, the role of a       good relationship in gathering `good information' from clients and in       taking the case forward is key.
Establishing such a relationship, which requires both time and skill,       contributes to the clients'       `empowerment', increasing their confidence and ability to deal with       problems without the need of       external help.
"One important claim in the second report was that benefits are felt       `even if the legal outcome is       not what the client wanted.'

The pilot study cited in the report,       conducted in Solihull with a       control in Leeds, measured `faster recognition and integration of       refugees'.
It produced a higher       grant rate of 58% (Leeds 34%), meaning cases did not proceed through to       expensive appeal.
Correspondingly, Allowed Appeal rates in the pilot were 10% (Leeds 20%).
On the measure       `effective conclusion of negative decisions', there was improvement in the       pilot area from 10% to       16% (Leeds 5% to 6%) and the report notes `a strong impression that       negative decisions were       better received by asylum claimants.'

Testimony by Matthew Smerdon,       of the Baring       Foundation, reiterates the importance of the research in demonstrating the       importance of one-to-one 	  relationships [C].
A similar line of argument was echoed by other       reports, such as the Citizens       Advice Bureau [D],Trude and Gibbs [E], and NEF [F].
In sum, the LSE research was used to lobby the then Labour Government's       Ministry of Justice, so       as to reduce the negative impact of the proposed new `fixed fee'       arrangements on the quality of the       relationship between advisors and their clients.
When the Law Centre was       threatened with closure,       the Ministry of Justice, under (later) Lord Bach, was prompted by these       reports to provide       emergency interim funding: various private law firms, non-profit       organizations, charitable trusts and       other funding bodies were likewise influenced to club together to shore up       the Centre, in       recognition of the `deep value' of the work done by its advisers and       paralegals, as noted in the       testimony by Michael Ashe, then CEO of South West London Law Centre [G].

Policy     When the Coalition Government came into power, its new Legal Aid,       Sentencing and Punishment       of Offenders Bill threatened to cut legal aid funds even further.
James       and Forbess wrote a briefing       (Section 3, 4) for the House of Lords, ahead of the second reading of the       Bill on 21st November       2011, which was reported on in the media [H].
It was read by members of       the House and informed       the debate on a proposed amendment to the Bill to keep social welfare       benefit appeals within the       scope of legal aid.
Although the amendment was turned back by the House of       Commons, welfare       benefit appeals on points of law were discussed during the second reading       (e.g., by Peers Lord       Philips of Sudbury and Lord Newton of Braintree and by Baroness Doocey,       who proposed the       amendment) and were retained within the scope of legal aid funding.
The       retention of at least this       one area of funding was of key importance, given how frequently low-level       bureaucrats make       mistakes in allocating or deciding on benefits cases, and how crucial it       is (for the individuals       concerned, and for broader questions of legal precedent and access to       justice) to challenge such       misallocations when they occur.
Forbess in consultation with James also contributed to the debate through       various interventions on       social media (e.g.
Section 3: 6 and others; see also Source I).
