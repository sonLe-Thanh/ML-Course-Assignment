     The key output of the research, a configurable software system for       automatic voice recognition,       was made widely available through the launch in 2009 of webASR (www.webASR.org), the world's       first free web platform for offline speech recognition.
It takes any       speech file and returns a       transcription, providing a service to its approximately 300 registered       users that was not previously       available.
Of these users, about 20% are from industry, 30% from academia       and the rest       individuals.
Up to the end of 2012 users had uploaded 4000 audio files,       amounting to 240 hours of       speech.
In addition to the online platform, the system can also be       accessed through an Application       Programming Interface (API) allowing companies and organisations such as       dev-audio, Sonocent       and the BBC to integrate the software into their own systems.
Commercial Impact       In order to maximise their commercial impact, the AMI and AMIDA projects       incorporated a range of       `mini projects' with industrial partners which served as pilot studies for       possible applications of the       systems and technology developed during the research project.
The success       of these pilots, as       well as the free availability of the ASR software through webASR's API,       have led to the technology       being adopted by a range of commercial partners worldwide.
Creation of start-ups         Koemei [S1] was founded in 2010 in Martigny, Switzerland with close       involvement from Hain for       the sole purpose of commercialising the AMI speech recognition system,       which served as a       starting point for what has now evolved into the Koemei recognition       engine.
The company provides       a cloud service (approx.. 3000 registered users), which leverages its       automatic speech recognition       technology, with features including fully automatic and crowd sourced       transcription and captioning,       media indexing and search as well as a suite of tools focused on online       education for universities,       lecturers and students.
In addition to its online service, Koemei provides       professional services in       the form of customisation of its technology and integration with third       party services (e.g.
media       hosting providers, online video players, learning management systems).
Its       clients include IMD       business school, the University of Geneva, UC Berkley, Columbia       University, City University New       York, Kaltura, UDemy, and Al Jazeera.
The company currently has 6 full       time employees and has       received 500k CHF investment from a mix of private and institutional       investors as well as 1m CHF       in subsidies from Swiss and EU project funding agencies.
Its revenue to       date totals around 600k       CHF and it was ranked 63rd (2011) and then 29th (2012) of Top 100 Swiss       Start-ups.
It has been       recognised with numerous accolades including: a presentation at the DEMO       Conference Santa       Clara 2012; one of 15 contestants selected for the TechCrunch Disrupt New       York 2012 start-up       battlefield; a place in the top 5 favourite companies at 500 Start-ups       Demo Day 2013 [S2]; and was       one of 36 companies selected by the World Economic Forum as Technology       Pioneers 2014, a title       that aims to recognise "companies, normally in a start-up phase, from         around the world that are         involved in the design, development and deployment of new technologies,         and are set to have a         significant impact on business and society.
Technology Pioneers must         demonstrate visionary         leadership and show signs of being long-standing market leaders - their         technology must be         proven.
Each year the World Economic Forum chooses a select number of         Technology Pioneers         from hundreds of applicants" [S3].
Hain's research was also largely instrumental in the creation of Quorate         Technology, a spin-out       founded in October 2012 and based in Edinburgh with 5 full- and one       part-time employees.
Quorate works with meeting capture and recognition technology and uses the       knowledge of these       areas developed in the AMI and AMIDA projects by Edinburgh, Sheffield and       IDIAP directly in its       core product.
The company is targeting the police, justice, defence,       broadcasting and enterprise       sectors and has ongoing relationships with a number of large systems       integrators who are       evaluating the use of their technology with their customer data analysis       systems.
They have       contracts with a major European Defence Contractor to supply demonstration       systems in a number       of their business areas.
Quorate is supported by a Scottish Enterprise       SMART grant, and Scottish       Enterprise Edge Award.
According to Quorate's CEO, "The research         outcomes of the AMI and         AMIDA projects in the field of speech recognition were essential steps         on the path to Quorate         being formed and commercially available products being developed...The         research conducted by         UoS in this area had significant impact on the efficiency of delivery of         services by Quorate" [S4].
Impact on existing businesses         dev-audio was founded in 2008 and is now a profitable export       business with clients around the       world.
Its product, microphone array recording hardware (the Microcone) is       produced in volume       and distributed by the Apple Store Online in Europe and Amazon in the USA.
The company fully       integrated their Microcone Recorder App with webASR in an AMIDA       mini-project, creating a       commercial prototype system for end-to-end meeting capture and recognition       that was used in       demonstrations and proved key in convincing clients and investors.
They       also used webASR to       test and iterate their technology affordably and easily on state of the       art systems.
"The integration         with webASR throughout various phases of our business growth has allowed         us to stay ahead of         the game and differentiate our solution in the marketplace.
This proved         critical in garnering early         financial and client support during the start-up phase.
More recently,         webASR has enabled us to         objectively quantify the performance of Microcone's voice separation         technology - a key step in         developing the industry partnerships that'll accelerate our market         growth".

Klewel is a company that commercialises a comprehensive webcasting       solution, complete with an       audio-visual recording station linked to a web platform, allowing       customers (including major       companies and organisations such as Nestl&#233; and UNICEF) to automatically       reference, edit and       publish content in total simplicity.
Klewel used the AMI ADR platform as       part of a mini-project with       AMIDA in 2009 to explore speech-to-text features on Klewel lecture       recordings.
"We recognised         the technology as extremely promising as a new and innovative feature to         develop our business"         says Klewel's Managing Director.
"It would offer our company and         our end customers ...more         visibility and more efficient knowledge management.
For this reason, our         company decided to         launch a joint development project in 2013, one of whose key aims is to         integrate ASR into Klewel         search.
We expect in the near future to include the technology in all of         our products."
Inferret Japan, a company employing 5 staff and commercialising       speech recognition, natural       language processing and information retrieval systems, including       voice-driven smartphone search       applications, English language learning for Japanese children, and a cloud       service helping non-       experts to integrate speech recognition into their own technology.
It also       directly develops and       customizes speech recognition technology for several large clients       including Hitachi Systems and       the Eiken Foundation.
Their work has benefited significantly from Hain's       research, especially the       Juicer package.
Inferret's CEO explains: "The availability of Juicer,         its associated tools and         research publications gave us an important competitive technology         advantage, reduced our overall       development costs and accelerated our time to market" [S7].
Cisco, market-leading provider of telepresence systems, used the       Sheffield research within the       Media Experience and Analytics Business Unit (MXBU) of its Emerging       Technology Group to help       sharpen the use cases during product development, as part of the       statistical model infrastructure       [S6].
[text removed for publication]     Impact on Practitioners       Practitioners in several fields have benefited from the free availability       of the software via webASR.
Researchers within the speech community have benefitted in two ways: by       integrating advanced       components to improve their own existing speech recognition systems; and       (for the many research       groups worldwide who do not have the capability to run complex speech       recognition systems of       their own) by using webASR to obtain transcripts of high volumes of speech       that would otherwise       have taken too long or been too costly to be available.
Professionals and       individuals outside the       speech research community have also benefitted, such as psychologists and       lawyers transcribing       their interviews, or lecturers wishing to make their lectures more widely       available.
Societal impact       Organisations like the Liberated Learning Consortium (www.liberatedlearning.com)       are working       to increase access to higher education for those with reading and writing       difficulties through the       development of transcription platforms.
LLC's International Manager       welcomes webASR as "a key         milestone in this research area" and explains its importance: "The         lack of captioning/transcription         stems from a combination of exorbitant costs associated with traditional         outsourcing, a lack of         accessibility awareness, and dearth of available tools/techniques.
Hosted transcription systems         such as webASR introduce a promising and increasingly robust solution         that can help address         accessibility challenges.
I applaud the development of webASR,         especially its open availability to         anyone who wishes to transcribe audio or video content".
The technology also has important applications in the field of language       learning, and has been       adopted by ITSlanguage, a company bringing new technology into       schools in the Netherlands.
Its       Founder explains the benefits: "Exercises will be more communicative         and interactive by using         speech technology, challenging students to practice more and learning         more by adaptive learning         and comprehensible feedback.
In addition, we aim to save valuable         teachers' time by automatic         assessment".
The first implementation of the technology is underway,       with software and       technology being made production ready, and pilots being prepared for       November 2013.
It will be       integrated into the online test- and assessment system QUAYN, part of the       most widely used       system in education in Belgium and the Netherlands (&gt;200 schools and       &gt;5 publishers).
The       Founder adds: "The availability of ... Juicer allows us to integrate         recognition capabilities at a much         earlier stage than originally planned.
Schools have limited budgets and         we were looking for best         quality speech technology that most schools can afford.
Purchasing         costly technology licences         would make it impossible to produce an affordable solution, bringing         this kind of innovation in         education to a halt".
The technology also plays an important cultural role in increasing       understanding through its       incorporation into the UK-English engine of the platform that supports an       iPhone app for speech-to-       speech translation ("voicetra 4u").
To end July 2013, the app had been       downloaded 42,263 times       and used to translate 169,204 utterances.
The app was rolled out during       the Olympics 2012 in       London and over a third of these utterances were translated during the       course of the games [S8].
