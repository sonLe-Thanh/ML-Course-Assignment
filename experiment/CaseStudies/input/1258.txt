     This body of work, in particular the monograph, has reached large public       audiences, and it has had identifiable impacts on public discourse, the       creative sector, education, and the economy.
The book and its central       arguments have been widely disseminated.
It sold 17,700 copies during the       census period [S1] and was widely reviewed in the national press: Financial         Times (23/2/08), The Observer, The Guardian       (8/3/08), The Times (14/3/08), The Telegraph (5/4/08), THE       (28/2/08), The TLS (15/5/08), The Spectator (1/3/08), The         Literary Review (02/08), History Today (02/08), The         Herald, The Oxford Times (12/06/08) and The Tablet       (20/3/08).
It appeared in annual round-ups in the The Observer       (21/12/08), The Guardian (28/11/08, 29/11/09), The Times       (4/12/08), The Telegraph (28/11/08) and The Times Literary         Supplement (27/11/09), as well as paperback reviews in The         Guardian (7/2/09), The Observer (8/2/09) and The         Telegraph (1/4/09).
Two articles by Braddick popularising central       aspects of the interpretation, on John Lilburne and Samuel Hartlib, were       published in BBC History (circulation 69,000), and the research       informed the lead review (2000 words) he wrote for The Times Literary         Supplement (circulation 35,000) on Gerrard Winstanley published on       30/06/10.
God's Fury is widely cited as a core text for those       outside higher education interested in the civil wars (for example in       Parliament's `living heritage' reading list) [S6] or in       seventeenth-century English society, and is a point of reference in media       reviews of other books (e.g.
The Guardian, 20/08/08).
Impact on public discourse: The book's central arguments have       impacted on public debate.
The analysis of civic engagement, the       relationship between religion and politics, and the collapse of shared       meaning in political debate have become points of reference in political       blogs: see, for example, the discussion by Anthony Painter, MP, on       laborlist.org (7/7/10) about how the problems of contemporary democracy       cannot be addressed simply by institutional reform: `One of the         remarkable things about Michael Braddick's "God's Fury, England's Fire"         ... is the deep sense you get about English society in the early-to-mid         seventeenth century.
Of particular interest is the way in which he         describes English civic life of the time.
The most surprising aspect is         the degree of civic activism in Stuart England'.
Another post       reflected on the importance of shared meaning and social order in the       context of a discussion about religion, politics, violence and civil       discourse in contemporary American politics (Chicago Boyz, 3/08/11): `I         was reading Michael Braddick's history of the English Civil War, "God's         Fury, England's Fire."
It's a huge, complicated work.
The footnotes         alone almost constitute a book of their own.
There's a lot of things         that could be said, but if I were to put into nutshell one possible         lesson to draw from Braddick's history, it would be this: the descent         into societal chaos is accompanied by a breakdown in the meaning of the         terms of mutual political discourse' [S7].
A post by Desert Beacon       (10/05/12) cited Braddick's writing on social and religious reform in       post-reformation England in a comment on the relationship between       religious and secular reform in the debate about gay marriage: `suffice         it to say that one school of thought held that a "nation's salvation"         was defined by how closely the body politic mirrored the Visible Church'       [S8]; while Martin Kelly blogged (31/12/12) about fears of the effects on       trade of constitutional upheaval in Scotland, and Alex Salmond's response       to those fears: `At the moment, I'm reading 'God's Fury, England's         Fire', Michael Braddick's fascinating account of the English Civil Wars.
Professor Braddick goes into great detail about just how badly trade         decayed during the constitutional upheavals of the 1640s, and how         frequently those who were concerned by it expressed their fears'       [S9].
The book was cited by Paul Blomfield, MP, in the course of a public       debate about the impact of government policy on research in the Arts and       Humanities, as an example of the kind of work that was being jeopardised       (Hansard, 3/11/10).
This range and diversity of impacts demonstrates the       public resonance of a book which adopts the approach of a `civic history',       in contrast to an apocalyptic history arguing for a single significance of       the events narrated.
In this context God's Fury has also prompted public discussion       about forms of historical writing and the relevance of the past to the       present.
Keith Thomas, writing in the Guardian, was critical of       its `disconcertingly postmodernist' conclusion.
This was picked up in the       blog @Number 71.
In five posts Dan Hartland discussed a number of other       reviews and posts relating to God's Fury and other works of       seventeenth-century history (https://thestoryandthetruth.wordpress.com/tag/michael-braddick/).
While claiming that it was not `postmodern', he argued that although the       book refused to draw any contemporary parallels it was possible to do so,       giving the example of its relevance to issues at stake in a Newsnight       disagreement between Michael Portillo and Ian Hislop about whether       critical comment on the holders of power was damaging to the political       process, demystifying legitimate authority, or an essential feature of an       engaged political society.
The originality of Braddick's approach was       noted positively in a number of prominent media reviews: Claire Tomalin       wrote "Michael Braddick's God's Fury, England's Fire (Allen         Lane) ... is altogether an original and remarkable piece of historical         writing, and should become a classic" (Guardian Christmas       book round-up, 28/11/09); Dan Jones wrote "You could call it a         brilliant postmodern history if it wasn't so, well, readable" (Daily         Telegraph, paperback review, 1/04/09); and Colin Gardiner wrote "Braddick         tells the story with the freedom of the poet and the creative power of         the historian" (Oxford Times, 12/06/08).
Impact on the creative sector: Alongside this debate, God's         Fury had demonstrable impact among programme makers and authors.
Broadcast TV programmes which draw on its arguments include an episode of       'History Cold Case', BBC2, in which Braddick advised on the depiction of       the political engagement of ordinary people and common soldiers in the       Civil War; and a series on the English monarchy presented by Lucy Worsley       on BBC4, in which he was interviewed on how to interpret quiescence to       Charles's rule during the 1630s, and the development of resistance to his       rule following the Scottish rebellion in 1637.
The arguments about       political engagement with Charles's rule during the 1630s lie behind his       role as historical consultant which shaped the content of a major       documentary filmed about the Pilgrim Fathers, to be broadcast during 2014       (Steeplechase films for PBS and BBC, with funding from the National       Endowment for the Humanities) [S2].
The Oxford Times (12/06/08)       noted that God's Fury `may be read as an excellent companion' to       accounts of the pilgrims' migration, since it explains the roots of such a       radical rejection of English religious and political life and the later       remigration of key figures from the Americas during the civil war.
A       phrase from the book was used as the title of a poem (`The extravagant       promise of Macaria') read by Tony Walton at the Hay Festival on 30 May       2008 and published on the New Statesman blog.
The poem uses       Braddick's description of a utopian tract in order to prompt optimism       about the potential of political mobilisation to improve the conditions of       social and political life:     A hundred years before the Enlightenment's dawning,       This was the first new morning of the thirst of mankind       For a new kind of life, a better way of living: [S10]     Impact on education: Together with publications R2-R5, God's         Fury has had a significant impact on the teaching of early Stuart       history and the English revolution, a subject commonly taught throughout       the English-speaking world.
Braddick has undertaken substantial speaking       engagements and other promotional work, including talks to A-level       audiences and the Historical Association.
The book has become a standard teaching work in higher education.
It is       on the reading list for courses at over 24 universities in the UK, US, and       Canada, and is included as a core text at (a selection): the University of       Wales (Newport), University College London (UCL), University of Chester,       Cardiff University, University of Chicago, University of Arkansas, and       Wilfrid Laurier University (Ontario).
A senior lecturer at UCL reports       that "God's Fury has transformed students' ability to get to grips         with a complex and contentious topic.
It is valued not just as a highly         readable introduction for the uninitiated, but also as a book which         offers an historiographically rich analysis, and sparkling new ideas,         without resorting to crude simplifications or obsolete grand narratives."
[S5]     God's Fury has also had an impact on the teaching of Civil War       history at secondary level, through talks by Braddick and the inclusion of       the book as an A Level text at schools including South Craven (North       Yorkshire) and Sir Roger Manwood's (Kent).
Feedback gathered from St       Mary's Catholic High School, Chesterfield, where Braddick gave five       lectures during the census period to local sixth formers studying the       seventeenth century, demonstrates that his ideas affected the views of the       audience about the subject and contributed to their understanding of the       value of the study of history.
According to the organiser, "We are keen         to enrich the learning of our students and add extra rigour where we         can.
Professor Braddick's lecture [on mobilisation and the choosing of         sides in 1642] fits perfectly with their study ... and gives them an         invaluable insight into how History can be delivered at a higher level.
He entertains them with his dry sense of humour, and is very         approachable after the lecture.
Several of our students have actually         gone on to read History at Sheffield, partly due to the inspirational         speaking of Professor Braddick.
The visit is always valued by our         students; some have even referenced it in an exam and in a University         interview" [S3].
Students from Brookfield School, in Chesterfield,       also attend these lectures.
Their teacher commented "They all found         [Braddick's] lecture informative and entertaining.
They felt it was a         valuable experience in the light of making their decisions about Higher         Education".
Braddick gave this lecture to 12 patients at Rampton Hospital (a       high-security hospital in Nottinghamshire), and the co-ordinator wrote       that "Patients' commented on Mike's congenial manner, his passion for         history and how his exciting delivery of the seminar fostered genuine         curiosity and enthusiasm for learning.
Through his aptitude for         promoting learning in a stimulating manner Mike contributed to         developing social proficiency and personal development of patients.
For         a long time after the seminar series ended patients reflected with pride         and appreciation on their unique learning experiences."
[S4]     Economic impact: The book has had an economic impact, both through       the TV programmes to which it contributed and more directly through the       books sold.
The direct commercial value of book sales is difficult to       calculate since details of wholesale pricing are in some respects       commercially sensitive.
However, Braddick's editor confirms that these       sales have probably generated turnover of around &#163;250,000 for the       publisher, and significant further turnover for retailers [S1].
