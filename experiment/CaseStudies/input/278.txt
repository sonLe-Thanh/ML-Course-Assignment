     During the REF period 2008-2013, our research has stimulated and informed       policy and public debates, influenced international agencies and       organisations and made a significant contribution to202fresearch-informed       policy at the global level.
In 2008, Pogge made a submission to the WHO's Expert Working Group on       Research and Development Financing (EWG, WHA61.21), which summarised       research on the HIF, especially evidence of problems with the current       patent system and ways of overcoming them.
In December 2009 the EWG       delivered its report, recommending that "efforts should be made to examine       other promising proposals in their local contexts, such as open source       products; patent pools; Health Impact Fund; priority review voucher       scheme; and orphan drug legislation."
Given that all other named       mechanisms were already being tried, it is most encouraging that the HIF       was included in this policy advice to the WHO Director General.
[A]     A later WHO working group "considered that the ideas underpinning the HIF       were of interest and that, if successfully implemented, it would address       many of our criteria."
However, currently "a sufficiently reliable       measurement of health impact" is not available in developing countries and       pilot studies are needed (2012 Report, and see below for planning).
[B]     The HIF reform plan directly addresses intellectual property management       issues by seeking to incentivize R&amp;D relevant to the disease burden in       developing countries, while also facilitating access by de-linking the       price of relevant products from the cost of R&amp;D. As a result, the HIF       would have a favourable distributive effect and202fboost the availability       and affordability of important medicines in developing countries while       also202fincentivizing firms to promote wide and optimal use.
The proposal       was considered a useful complement to the existing set of intellectual       property incentives in that firms can choose whether to register their       product with the HIF or use the patent system as they do now.
Following the publication of Nathan, Carl (2007) `Aligning pharmaceutical       innovation with medical need', Nature Medicine, 13:301-308, which       compared IPR reform plans and selected the HIF as the only one without       detrimental medium- or long-term consequences, Prof. Harvey Rubin       contacted Pogge.
After briefing him on the details of the HIF, an OECD       project report written by Rubin endorsed the reform plan.
[C]     From 2007, Pogge gave various prominent lectures for the German Social       Democrats (SPD), in the Willy Brandt Haus, at the Hannah Arendt Days and       three times with Heidemarie Wieczorek Zeul [former German Minister for       Economic Cooperation and Development] as partner.
As a result, Karin Roth,       a member of the German Parliament, invited him to a conversation.
After       deliberations with a range of German SPD politicians, the HIF was included       - in 2011 - in the platform of the German Social Democratic Party's (SPD)       parliamentary delegation (the SPD is one of two main parties in Germany,       comparable to the British Labour Party).
Pogge and his global team have been working with leading health care       assessment organizations such as the George Institute for International       Health, PolicyCures, NICE International, PATH and the Institute for Health       Metrics and Evaluation, to conduct a pilot, evaluating the health impact       of products in various countries.
A UCLan-based proposal (&#8364;1,924,989) has       been submitted to the European Research Council (ERC) to provide further       funding for the research preceding the pilot.
(At the time of writing,       Pogge has been invited to grant negotiations for the full amount with the       new project to commence in 2014).
Influence on Public Debates     Our high-level programme of knowledge exchange has enabled our new       theoretical insights to enter the public domain and to shape public       opinion.
Significant media coverage of the HIF has been achieved on all       continents.
The following are selections from almost 100 items between       2005 and 2013, all attesting to contributions to and influence on public       debates.
