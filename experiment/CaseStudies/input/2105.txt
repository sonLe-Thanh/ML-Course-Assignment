     McKay's research is always concerned at its starting point with (often       musical) culture; whether the cultural politics of protest in the garden       or the riot, or popular music (from jazz to punk to techno) and       post-subculture, or transatlantic and diasporean cultural exchanges, or       community arts, media and festival as history and as practice.
The impact       described here highlights some of the ways in which McKay's research       supports community participation and agency through offering an       understanding of its history and leading to the development of new forms:     2012-onwards: In September 2012, McKay was appointed as a       three-year AHRC Connected Communities Leadership Fellow to provide       intellectual leadership to the Connected Communities Programme, with       Professor Keri Facer, University of Bristol.
The fellowship has two       equally funded facets: work on the programme and with AHRC, and a personal       research project.
The two Fellows play a pivotal national role in       connecting research by identifying cross-cutting issues and supporting the       development of collaborations and partnerships.
McKay's focus is       'Understanding changing community cultures and histories and patterns of       connectivity within and between communities', and his specific brief is       around the contribution of arts and humanities research:             The vision for the Programme is `to mobilise the potential for           increasingly inter-connected, culturally diverse communities to           enhance participation, prosperity, sustainability, health and           well-being by better connecting research, stakeholders and communities.'
Effectively, Connected Communities is entirely about funding impactful         research, co-designed and co-produced between academics and community         partners, and the AHRC Fellowship (one of only six covering all AHRC         priority themes across the UK) places McKay at the forefront of such         initiatives.
Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said: `Connected           Communities projects will lead to the development of new ways to           engage communities in creating, interpreting and using arts and           humanities research data.
This will leave a sustainable resource and           legacy for future research and for communities.'
Around 280 awards         have been made to date, working with over 400 community partners.
At the core of McKay's personal research project in the programme are         community arts practice and the temporary creative community of         festival.
Each strand involves collaborating with community partners,         and is linked with much of McKay's other work:        One indicative activity took place in March 2013, `An Evening With         George McKay' in a marquee at Spitalfields City Farm, with a communal         meal, a lecture and discussion of the politics of community and of         gardening with local people.
This is a powerful continuity with McKay's earlier impactful work.
For instance, with Community Music: A Handbook&#8212;collections of         chapters by rather than simply about members of the         communities under discussion&#8212;McKay sought to enable the production of         texts of community voices, each of which became a valued&#8212;occasionally         contested, but necessarily referenced&#8212;resource for those communities.
2010-2013: As the largest research project funded to date in       Europe for jazz, Rhythm Changes.
drew on McKay's work and the team       have published on the value of jazz in national settings and developed       this research for festivals, venues and arts promoters, including       practice-based engagement with professional development schemes.
The       project includes the Grow Your Own Festival resource, at which       McKay spoke, to provide arts organisations with practical tools to design       festivals.
McKay's activities include future curatorial collaborations       with major events, including London (2013) and Cheltenham Jazz Festivals       (2014).
2011: The impact of Radical Gardening, (a Book of       the Year (Independent on Sunday), a gardening book of the year (Guardian))       is evident from discussions about it in both the gardener and activist       blogospheres.
Bloggers articulate the book's achievement precisely in       terms of its impact on their thinking, their activism, and how these are       transformed:             Chicago Now / Chicago Garden website: `Can a garden-related book           change your life?
This one has changed mine and how I see the         garden and how I relate to it'.
Mr Brown Thumb blog: `[The book] has opened my eyes and given me           new insight into what a garden is and what it can mean ... and how         it can be approached.'
Civil Eats website: `it will surely be the definitive text ... for         years to come....
This transformed my sense of what gardens can be           and, in fact, are.'
Treehugger blog: `changed everything I thought I knew and           understood about the role of gardening in society.
Radical           Gardening will fire you up, and you'll be marching out the door         ready to occupy your garden'.
John Steppling's website: `I suspect new kinds of schools may         gradually develop.

2013: McKay's work in recent years with two of the UK's leading       community music organisations, More Music and Community Music East, has       led to considerable impact:             Pete Moser, More Music: "Working with George McKay since 2005, on Community           Music: A Handbook, which we edited together, and for the new book         Community Music Now that we are currently working on, has enabled         me to think through my own pedagogic practice and my organisation More           Music's place and achievements in the community arts movement.
Co-producing research with George has really helped me become a more         reflexive community artist and also to understand the academic world and         context.
It has also contributed both to More Music's status as a         leading community music organisation, as well as to the creative health         of community music nationally.
We toured nationwide with Community Music: A Handbook, and         people coming to workshops loved that book&#8212;I have since used the book as         a key text when running training workshops in Lisbon, Hong Kong,         Shanghai and in Belem (Brazil) and have found that the concepts that we         originated translate easily in an international context.
It has been         refreshing to work with an academic like George outside         academia".
Ben Higham, Community Music East: "Over the past three or         four years I have been working with Professor McKay on engaging academic         expertise in the context of community music and media practice, to bring         a different, more historical, and objective perspective to our         understanding of the way we work as community artists.
It began with         McKay's inspiring keynote to the Community Music East 2010 Conference,         Art 4 All, which provoked some fascinating and frank discussions around         practice and purpose.
Working with McKay on our AHRC scoping study on         community music in 2011, which involved writing different versions of         its findings for three different audiences (AHRC, an academic journal,         the magazine of community musicians), has in turn led to a further AHRC         project on which I am co-investigator, the Community Music Research         Network.
Each of these interactions has challenged me to re-evaluate         what we do and what we can do as practitioners, and I really think that         McKay's observation and analysis of the nature and culture of community         music has helped to change the way community music thinks about itself.
For me it has been a very stimulating collaboration".
McKay was engaged as a consultant academic for the MSN         British festival-goers survey, and quoted in the extensive national       and international media coverage of the survey's findings.
