     Research has been used by several local authorities/councils to inform       planning and community engagement.
It has also been used by a UK       Government Department and a Political Party to inform national strategies.
Finally, it has provided significant benefits to residents of several       local communities.
Local Authority Planning       North Northamptonshire Joint Planning Unit (NNJPU) is responsible for       preparing the North Northamptonshire Core Strategy &#8212; the planning       framework covering Corby, Kettering, East Northamptonshire and       Wellingborough Councils.
From 2012 onwards, Dr Kraftl worked       collaboratively with NNJPU (drawing on ESRC `NUNC' research) to help them       better understand aspirations of residents and shape planning policy.
A       Senior Planner at NNJPUa said the NUNC research5 had       been particularly significant in:            identifying young people's issues and aspirations within North         Northamptonshire and establishing relationships with young residents;       providing a robust evidence-base for the entire Core Strategy and the         development of policies therein;       discussing policy development with NNJPU and other Local Authority         colleagues, and sharing best practicea.
Leicester City Council &#8212; Schools       The findings of Dr Kraftl's research on pupil participation in school       design (AHRC-EPSRC research2), were incorporated into a       pupil-participation best-practice guide.
The guide reached every English       Local Education Authority (433 in total).
During 2009-10, it was used by       Leicester City Council (LCC) in fostering pupil participation for the Building         Schools for the Future programme &#8212; a &#163;235 million programme of       investment in secondary school buildings in the cityb.
For an       LCC youth engagement officer, the guide provided clear, accessible       information about pupil participation that enabled participatory methods       to be tailored for LCC's use; it was also used in initial meetings with       headteachers to justify pupil participation activities - leading to       engagement with 450 pupils at 16 schoolsb.
Leicester City Council &#8212; Survey of Leicester       Based on research expertise in the UoA, and a workshop organised by Dr       Kraftl in 2011 (part- funded by the Department's Human Geography Research       Fund), Leicester City Council commissioned a collaborative research       project (costing &#163;65k) to undertake a pilot survey of the city's       population.
Led by Leicester GIS staff and Human Geographers, the project       involved the analysis/compilation of existing datasets (Dr Comber) and the       use of datasets to create `storyboards' about local communities (Dr       Jarvis), later used as the basis for participatory community workshops (Dr       Kraftl).
The pilot study had several significant impacts on LCC practice, which       reaches across all of the city's communities.
LCC's Research and       Intelligence Manager listed three benefitsc:            "It has informed the approach of the City Council's Research and         Intelligence Service to help co- ordinate and quality-assure the         organisation's consultation practice".
In particular, it has provided         methods and evidence to enable staff "to tailor individual consultation         exercises [...] and, where necessary, explore new ways of reaching out         to engage those likely to be affected by proposed interventions.''
"It has informed the approach to evaluation taken by the council's         transforming neighbourhood services initiative.
This project, which is         pioneering new ways to improve the quality of front-line services while         also cutting costs, is adapting the methods developed in the Survey of         Leicester pilot study [...] to underpin public consultation''       "The pilot work has prompted the council to further invest in         developing capacity for local research through the creation of a new,         fixed-term post of Project Co-ordinator [which will] further increase         the council's understanding of community needs and the impact of         policies on local people''          National Government Departments/Political Parties       In July 2012, Dr Kraftl and NUNC colleagues were invited to consult with       the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) as the latter       developed the UK's large-scale housing strategy.
The invitation was       extended after the findings of the NUNC research were sent to the       Department by Dr Kraftl.
Thereafter, the academics delivered briefing       papers on the NUNC findings, in November 2012 and July 2013.d     The findings of the NUNC project are cited as key evidence in the Labour       Party's (2013) Policy Review on Community Engagement in Planning.
Specifically, the benefits of consulting with young people &#8212; rarely       directly acknowledged in recent national-level planning documents - are       directly addressed, with the project providing the key (and only) example       of relevant researche.
Impacts on residents       Just as significant as policy impacts, participatory research has led to       important benefits for residents/users.
It has enabled residents to       participate in shaping their own environments &#8212; visible repeatedly through       feedback from participants in the NUNC project.
For example:            evidence from the NUNC project supported two successful community         applications for funding for play equipment (total &#163;49,000).f        a local councillor involved in community workshops, facilitated by Dr         Kraftl/NUNC, spoke of their benefits in bringing younger and older         residents into dialogue: "[i]t gives you more confidence to talk to         children...the longer-term benefits of this work, [will be] that it         facilitates meaningful dialogue and action."f.
Dr Kraftl has         facilitated similarly successful workshops in several other communities,         each comprising ca.
2,000 residents.
one of several similar testimonials from a young participant in the         NUNC research: "[w]e learned how we could make a change to our community         ourselves and met lots of people to help us.
''f        many young people cited positive educational and emotional benefits of         being involved in the NUNC research, collated in a published survey of         participantsg.
The overwhelming majority indicated that the         project had improved their knowledge about sustainability and how their         communities were changing.
