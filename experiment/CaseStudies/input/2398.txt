     Impact on Commerce     A spin-out company has been created and established its viability           by generating revenue or         profits:       On the basis of research carried out in the Blundell and Abell labs on       structures of molecules that       bind protein targets at high resolution by X-ray crystallography, a       spinout company, Astex       Technology Ltd, was created in 1999 (Company No.
03751674, incorporated       14/4/1999).
The       university-based research provided the basis of all subsequent work in       Astex, including       approximately thirty "campaigns" against many targets, mainly of interest       in fighting cancer.
In       2001 the University of Cambridge invested &#163;250k and was given equity in       the company.
The       company has signed deals worth in excess of $1.8bn (approximately &#163;1bn)       between 1999 and       2011.
Investors in Astex have included Abingworth, Apax, Oxford (Boston),       Advent, Alta and others       with &#163;80 million equity in multiple financing rounds.
Astex also has had       major collaborations with       investments of up to &#163;25 million from each of GSK, Johnson and Johnson,       Novartis and       AstraZeneca (Ref.
1, Section 5); of these the GSK investment occurred       after 1/1/2008, while the       Johnson and Johnson, Novartis and AstraZeneca investments have continued       after 2008 (Ref.
2,       Section 5).
In 2011 Astex Therapeutics was purchased by NASDAQ-listed       oncology company       SuperGen, Inc. for $150 million (ca &#163;100 million).
The new company was       named Astex       Pharmaceuticals, to reflect the strong brand name of Astex.
Subsequent to       the impact period (ie in       Sept 2013) Astex was acquired by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd for $886       Million (ca &#163;565       Million).
Jobs have been created/protected:       Over the past decade, the company has secured constant employment for       between 70 and 120       workers in Cambridge (Ref.
1, Section 5), the current number of employees       in the UK and US is       ~120.
Highly skilled people have taken up specialist roles:       Prof Blundell has been a member of the main Astex Board from 1999 to 2011;       he has chaired the       Astex Science Advisory Board from 1999 to the present, and he attends       research discussions and       visits Astex regularly (Ref.
1, Section 5).
A business or sector has adopted a new technology or process:       Astex changed the way that drug discovery is carried out not only within       its own labs but also in       other small companies and large pharmaceuticals.
The former Head of       Worldwide Discovery for       Pfizer states: "As a consequence of Astex success, fragment-based       approaches are common       place throughout Pharma and Biotech, and the power of the technology is       also recognised by       academia and drug discovery institutes through the UK 3D Fragment       consortium, for example.
While many companies have in-house capabilities, it is perhaps telling       that GSK established a       major fragment collaboration with Astex as their internal expertise was       apparently not competitive.
Importantly, fragments may open the door to blocking protein-protein       interactions which would lead       to totally new classes of therapeutic agents designed to meet the medical       needs of the 21st       Century."
(Ref.
3, Section 5)     Most pharmaceutical companies now use fragment-based methods in early       discovery.
They       include J&amp;J, GSK and Astra Zeneca, all of whom have first collaborated       with Astex; and GSK,       UCB, Heptares and Evotec, where Astex employees and/or former members of       the Blundell lab       have moved to take posts (Ref.
4, Section 5).
Impact on health:     New clinical interventions have been developed:       Astex has developed a strong pipeline (Ref.
5, Section 5), and three drugs       that were developed       using the fragment-based approach (AT13387, a HSP90 inhibitor, AT7519M, a       CDK inhibitor, and       AT9283, a JAK/Aurora Inhibitor) are now in Phase II clinical trials       for the conditions Gastrointestinal       Stromal Tumour (NCT01294202), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (NCT01652144), Chronic       Lymphocytic       Leukemia (NCT01652144) and Multiple Myeloma (NCT01145989) ;Refs 6-9,       Section 5).
The same       drugs have completed Phase I and are about to enter Phase II for other       related clinical conditions       (Multiple Myeloma (NCT01183949), Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCT01712217),       and Prostate       Cancer (NCT01685268)), and in combination with other drugs (Refs 10-12,       Section 5).
Early discovery candidates from Astex structure-guided fragment-based drug       discovery are now       being taken forward in Phase I trials through collaborating companies,       include: FGFR Inhibitor JNJ       42756493 (NCT01703481, against Solid Tumours or Lymphoma, taken forward by       Janssen       Research &amp; Development, LLC), CDK4 Inhibitor LEE011 (e.g.
NCT01747876,       against MRT and       Neuroblastoma, taken forward by Novartis), PKB/Akt Inhibitor AZD 5363       (e.g.
NCT01692262,       against Prostate Cancer, taken forward by Astra Zeneca) and BACE Inhibitor       AZD 3293 (e.g.
NCT01795339, against Alzheimers, taken forward by Astra Zeneca).
