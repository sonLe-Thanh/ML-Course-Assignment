     Process/events from research to impact.
The Department of Architecture at the University of Strathclyde has close       links with Government, and with local and nationally recognised       architecture firms &#8212; working relationships that have been built up over       the past 10 years.
Examples include the following:            From 2008, Romice has been a member of the Glasgow Urban Design Panel,         tasked by the Glasgow City Council (GCC) with making recommendations on         development proposals in the city at a preliminary or planning         application stage; her research directly informs the advice to the         panel.
The housing manager for the Glasgow Housing Association (GHA), the         largest social housing provider in Scotland, is an active promoter of         the use of the Communities in Action Handbook since 2003.
Work on urban centralities is ongoing through a KTA with a private         firm, Adam Architecture and Urbanism, and is used in commercial         master-planning.
A new modelling platform will be launched in 2013 as a         joint venture between Adam Urbanism, the Architecture department and         Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne.
Romice organised the 22nd International Association         People-Environment (IAPS) Conference on the relation between research,         practice and policy-making in the built environment (June 2012).
With         over 450 delegates, the event contributed to the dissemination of         Strathclyde's research and its re-alignment with practice.
Over 50 staff         from local authorities and professional practice attended as part of         their Continued Professional Development (CPD).
Types of Impact     Impact on policy and planning: Research on spatial analysis and       modelling has influenced sections of Glasgow City Council's (GCC) City       Plans and housing policies (Sources A and B) between 2009-10.
A strategic       partnership with Glasgow City Council was established to develop       strategies for key areas in Glasgow.
Modelling of the centrality of public       open spaces monitors and predicts public usage and behaviour in space, and       was used to target investment in urban renewal.
In reference to the       Strathclyde research, The Head of Planning and Building Control, Glasgow       City Council, has commented, "Glasgow City Council values the         opportunity of applying the latest and most valuable research in the         development of its policies".
(Source C)     Scottish Government has used the research in urban morphology for       sustainable development and assessment of the vitality of small Scottish       towns.
Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and private       practice have used the Urban Design Studies Unit's user engagement       approach to assess the potential for development of sites of strategic       importance to the city and its surroundings.
Recent large scale       developments such as Tornagrain (around 4,000 new homes), Knockroon       (around 750 new homes) and Chapelton (around 8,000 new homes) have used       Strathclyde's master-planning techniques.
Furthermore, the Plot-Based       Urbanism approach to master-planning has been used as a development model       by architectural practice and policy-makers and supported by many small       consultancy commissions, for example:            Research on street centrality along the Glasgow Riverfront, through         simulation of redistribution of public infrastructure and retail was         used in the Govan Local Development Strategy (part of City Plan         2 Source B).
Research on the East End of Glasgow sponsored by GCC, a local         developer and a local trust, disseminated through public exhibitions,         public debates and local newspapers was instrumental for the Barras           and Calton Local Development Framework, part of City Plan 2         (Source B), which has been granted funding by GCC for the regeneration         of the area and was used as guidance in the Calton Town Centre           Strategy (2010-11).
Research on the future of the M8 motorway in Glasgow and its impact on         accessibility of surrounding areas (e.g.
Sighthill), commissioned by GCC         and GHA, and is now used in the Sighthill Access Design Statement         and Sighthill Transformation Area (Source D).
Research on Cumnock growth scenarios is used by East Ayrshire Council         in the Main Issues Report and informs the forthcoming East           Ayrshire Local Plan (2013).
The Development Planning and         Regeneration Manager, East Ayrshire Council confirms that "The           Planning and Economic Development service has been able to utilise the           research work at Strathclyde, specifically the study of street           centrality and the use of innovative approaches to master planning, in           the preparation of its Main Issues Report and replacement Local Plan           in relation to Cumnock" (Source E).
Involvement of community groups and housing organisations in planning         decisions: The Strathclyde research was used to develop methods of       supporting community engagement and user participation in design, with the       intention of removing traditional barriers in communication between lay       people and `experts'.
Commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council, a       step-by-step Handbook was produced to help local neighbourhood groups       develop scenarios, prioritise intervention, draft design requirements and       select professionals.
This Handbook has been used since 2008 by Glasgow       Housing Association to generate consensus around design commissions, is       available online, and was updated in early 2013 with GHA.
The Development       Manager, GHA has stated: The UDSU research [...] "has provided an         essential resource of emerging techniques and academic rigour in the         activities of community engagement, master planning and urban analysis         to both the staff of GHA operating in the regeneration directorate, and         to the external consultants employed by it" (Source F).
Development of resources to enhance professional practice:       Research by the Urban Design Studies Unit on the urban form of Scottish       small towns, in relation to economic and social factors, has been used to       develop policies in place-making, design and place assessment guidance,       and public consultation approaches.
In 2010, Architecture + Design       Scotland (A+DS) set up a team with UDSU to formalise Plot Based Urbanism       into an adoptable planning approach for Scottish sustainable development       (2012-13).
Since 2009, A+DS have commissioned studies from the UDSU       researchers on small Scottish towns, and recently commissioned an       assessment tool for housing developments, for forthcoming housing policy:       The Head of Urbanism, Architecture + Design Scotland confirms that "The         University of Strathclyde material has been invaluable in shaping a         narrative to engage a series of stakeholders in making tangible a set of         propositions around change.
In this context, the key impacts are policy         focused, which will direct investment and implementation".
(Source       G).
UDSU has developed a KTA collaborative project with one of the largest       urban design and architecture practices in the UK (Adam AU), which has a       large national and international portfolio of projects.
AAU has been       critical in developing a commercially applicable `Multi Centrality       Assessment Platform' for planning which simulates and compares the       potential success of urban areas.
This tool can influence planning and       optimise investment, attracting designers (to whom it adds financial       evidence to services), and clients (who reduce risk in committing       resources).
The Director at AAU has commented: "Adam Urbanism has         engaged with the University of Strathclyde Urban Design Unit with         research projects at different levels, from assisting with thesis         [projects] that are directly relevant to our work to joint working on         significant research projects".
And in reference to community       consultation and MCA: "...
It is impossible to give quantitative         figures ... Suffice to say that the considerable investment we have         given to the project is a reflection of the values of the expansion of         our knowledge base" (Source H).
Provision of Training for Local authorities and the Scottish         Government: The close partnership with Glasgow City Council has also       involved training of council employees, so they can apply the research       methodology in practice.
The educational model is strongly related to       research, and GCC staff have applied innovative approaches to space       assessment, modelling and urbanism since 2008 in Nitshill, Sighthill,       Calton and the Barras areas of Glasgow, the Forth and Clyde Canal, and       more recently Govan, where it is being applied to argue for the strategic       upgrade of Govan town-centre.
