     Bueltmann's research has had an impact on both sides of the globe.
Her       research has provided       New Zealanders of Scottish descent with new evidence of how Scots have       influenced aspects of       New Zealand culture and has also enhanced the understanding,       interpretation and presentation of       the Scottish diaspora by museum curators, heritage stakeholders and       policymakers in Scotland.
Bueltmann has engaged directly with the most immediate user group, namely       Scots in New       Zealand and their descendants.
Engagement activities took place in New       Zealand in early 2012:             New Zealand Society of Genealogists Scottish Interest Group         meeting, 25 January 2012:         This meeting, held on Burns Night 2012, served to inform participants of         the relevance of Burns         clubs in New Zealand.
Evidence gathered via questionnaires (Source 4)         reveals that the event         strongly influenced the participants' views of the role of Scottish         cultural traditions.
Participants         had previously not been aware of the inclusiveness of Burns celebrations         and the event also         changed genealogical research practice, introducing, to quote a         participant, society         membership as a new resource' for doing genealogy.
Talk and engagement activities, Turakina Highland Games, 28         January 2012: The Turakina         Highland Games are New Zealand's longest-running Scottish games.
As         reported in the local         press, `60 people enjoyed Tanja Bueltmann's' lunchtime talk (Fielding         Herald, 2 February         2012).
As one attendee said, the talk `drew my attention to the impact         of Scots on NZ holiday         culture', an aspect he had not `previously been aware of.'
Other         participants agreed, noting that         they had not thought about the Games' significance to their heritage and         culture before         (Sources 4 &amp; 5)          Bueltmann has continued to engage these research users online through her       Scottish Diaspora       Blog and Twitter @scotsdiaspora.
The Blog features tailored stories about       the Scots in New       Zealand and the wider diaspora based on her research, as well as offering       educational resources,       such as a timeline on Burns in New Zealand.
To the end of June 2013, the       Blog has had over       13,000 visits.
The second impact, enhancing Scottish understanding of its diaspora, has       been achieved by       collaborating with museum curators, heritage stakeholders and policymakers       in Scotland.
National Museum of Scotland: Curators of an exhibition on the         Scottish military diaspora,         planned as part of Homecoming 2014, want to reframe military culture as         an aspect of         associational culture, and, aware of Bueltmann's strong publication         record in the field asked         her in 2012 to act as an expert advisor.
She attended a number of         meetings on the exhibition in         2012 and early 2013 with Museum staff to help them understand the         importance of interpreting         diaspora and altering their practice accordingly (Source 1).
As the         Senior Curator notes,         Bueltmann `has helped to place military associational culture in its           correct context namely as a           key element of the wider matrix of Scottish associational culture.'
In so doing, her research `has           been critical in changing attitudes to military history and           collections, making it more relevant in           the wider appraisal of Scottish diasporic identity.'
More broadly,         Bueltmann's `innovative work           on Scottish associational culture ... has greatly changed the way in           which we consider the           Diaspora here at the National Museum'.
Her monograph Scottish           Ethnicity and the Making of           New Zealand Society has led him to reassess `the importance of           Scottish associational culture',         and the `work has fed directly into the way in which we present and           interpret the material           culture of Scottish associational culture' at the Museum.
The Scottish Diaspora Tapestry Project: This project is         designed to engage with Scottish         diaspora communities overseas, getting them to tell their stories in a         set of tapestry panels that         will be assembled and displayed in Scotland for Homecoming 2014.
Through         MSP Kenny         McCaskill's knowledge of Bueltmann's research, she connected with the         Diaspora Policy         Advisor, Scottish Government and the Ancestral Marketing Manager, Visit         Scotland, in early         2013, who asked if she would use her research to support the project.
Dr         Bueltmann has since         become an advisor to the project and has been key in developing the idea         of a thematic panel         on Scottish associations.
Specifically, Bueltmann's research has changed         the tapestry makers'         practice by demonstrating the importance of associations in the Scottish         Diaspora (Source 2).
As the Diaspora Tapestry Project Co-ordinator notes, Dr Bueltmann         advises `on the project as           a result of [her] work on the Scots in New Zealand.'
In particular,           her `explanation of their           [associations] role and importance has led to the introduction of a           themed panel on           associations on the tapestry.'
Dr Bueltmann has also used her         Scottish community connections         in New Zealand to help the Tapestry team engage with these groups.
Scottish Government &#8212; International Division (Migration and           International Connections):         Understanding Diaspora communities is of growing significance to         Scottish policy makers.
Drawing on her research on the Scots in New Zealand, Bueltmann has been         working with the         Scottish Government's Diaspora Policy Adviser, to discuss how to develop         the links between         her work and the Scottish Government's policy objectives, `helping           to engage and inform' as         Steed points out, `the Diaspora through use of social networks and           websites such as KILTR, a           Scottish Diaspora social network.'
(Source 3).
Moreover, the         Advisor notes, Bueltmann's work         has enabled his team `learn more about different aspects of           Scotland's Diaspora,' and her work         aids policy fulfilment by helping `to deliver the Scottish           Government Diaspora engagement           objectives,' particularly in relation to the plans for Homecoming         2014.
