Since the present Scottish government made dementia       a priority, this has increased to 2-3 times per year.
In 2007, the then       Scottish Minister for Public Health set up an advisory group, the Dementia       Forum, to inform and advise her of issues that needed to be addressed and       to guide the development of dementia as a national priority [5.1].
Two       members of the Scottish Dementia Working Group were invited to join this       influential group and continue to make a contribution to this forum (Dementia         in Scotland, Issue 60, December 2007, p. 1).
During a visit by the       First Minister in 2009 they discussed the importance of challenging public       stigma and misconceptions of dementia (http://local.stv.tv/edinburgh/81230-salmond-to-visit-alzheimer-charity/).
In 2009, SDWG partnered Scottish Parliament's Cross-Party Group on       Alzheimers at the launch of the Charter of Rights for people with dementia       and their carers in Scotland (http://www.palliativecarescotland.org.uk/content/publications/charter-of-rights-launch-         8thOct20091.pdf).
This charter was to be central to the development of the first Scottish         Dementia Strategy, which was launched in 2010.
During the       development of the Strategy, 10 members of the SDWG were involved in       workgroups and as partners running consultation events (see Foreword of       Strategy pages 6-7 by the chairman of SDWG, also page 28-29 acknowledging       the impossibility of producing such a document without SDWG input [5.2]).
"The work that we have undertaken to produce this strategy would have         been impossible without the direct contribution of the Scottish Dementia         Working Group, whose members all have a diagnosis of dementia" (page         28/29) (Edward McLaughlin)     "securing the government's recognition of dementia as a national         priority and the development of the Scottish Dementia Strategy &#8212; would         have been impossible without the active contribution of people with         dementia through the Scottish Dementia Working Group" (Henry Simmons CEO         Alzheimer Scotland at the inaugural meeting of the EWGPWD)     Furthermore, there are three members of the SDWG who sit on the programme       board to oversee the implementation of the strategy       http://www.nes.scot.nhs.uk/media/584864/membership_list.pdf)     "Development of the Dementia Strategy included the close involvement of       Alzheimer Scotland and the Scottish Dementia Working Group, both of whom       endorsed our approach.
It has been vital to me that, in implementing the       strategy, they have both been at the heart of the large programme of work,       providing expert advice and input on the services to which people are       entitled, and influencing the implementation of the various strands of the       strategy."
(MSP Nicola Sturgeon, Depute First Minister, Dementia in         Scotland, Issue 75, p. 3, March 2012 ) [5.1]     In recognition of the contribution to policy, the Scottish Government       hosted a celebration reception at the Scottish National Gallery in 2012.
Nicola Sturgeon spoke in acknowledgement and praise of the work and       highlighted just how far the group had influenced the shift in attitudes       in Scotland.
[5.1]     The Joseph Rowntree funded Dementia Engagement &amp; Empowerment         Project (DEEP) explored ways of empowering and engaging with people       with dementia and found that the SDWG were the only activist group of       people with dementia in the United Kingdom.
The work recommended that the       SDGW serve as a model which could be adopted and adapted throughout the       rest of the UK.
http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/stronger-collective-voice       [5.4]     Dementia policy is now directly influenced and informed by people with       dementia themselves, through the representatives of the SDWG.
Influencing practice       The SDWG has been involved in many presentations and lectures to reach       different professional groups.
Group members have contributed to three       training DVDs (United We Stand, Listening to the Experts and         Through Our Eyes) and have worked in partnership with Health       Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland to produce a DVD entitled Living Well         with Dementia.
Group members also helped launch the NHS Education for Scotland (NES) DVD       Promoting Excellence and worked in partnership with NES and       Alzheimer Scotland.
Two members of the group were on the National       Integrated Care Pathways steering group (part of Quality Improvement       Scotland QIS) which mapped out service needs.
They also work closely with       the Care Commission.
Through active, strategic involvement, people with dementia are directly       influencing and informing practice directives, guidance and frameworks at       national level.
International influence       In April 2012, a European Dementia Working Group was formed at a meeting       of SDWG, Alzheimer Scotland and their European counterparts from Austria,       Bulgaria, England, Norway, Slovenia and Spain in Glasgow.
The European       group is replicating the Scottish model to ensure representation of people       with dementia in policy and practice across Europe.
The first European       group meeting was held in Vienna in October 2012, when the chair of the       SDWG was elected vice-chair.
The SDWG were invited to address the meeting       and were cited as being a "particularly successful example" of a       campaigning group run for and by people with dementia (Jean Georges, CEO       Alzheimer Europe [5.3]).
SDWG members have spoken at major international conferences and have had       a presence at Alzheimer's Disease International and Alzheimer's Europe       every year (see, e.g.,       http://www.alz.co.uk/ADI-conference-2012).
Engagement with the media and public       SDWG members have given interviews to the press and interviews on radio       and television to raise awareness about living with dementia and challenge       stigma about dementia (e.g.
The Guardian 2008, The Sun 2010, BBC).

SDWG members have been utilising different ways of engaging with the       public and have uploaded some of their training DVDs to youtube       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcM6g_B-mcs
