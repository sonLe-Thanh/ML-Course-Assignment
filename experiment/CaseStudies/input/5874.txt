     Commercial products     Following the award of his PhD in 2001, Nicklin's student Pasco Avery       continued to build on the       work done with Nicklin at Birkbeck on whitefly control using Isaria         fumosorosea.
In particular, this       has led to the licensing in the US of the biopesticide PFR-97TM       (a commercial product formulation       containing Isaria fumosorosea) for use on food crops.
This product       had for many years been       licensed in Europe and Asia on a range of crops against whiteflies, thrips       and other pests.
Avery       continued his work firstly at the United States Department of Agriculture       Soil and Nutrition labs       where other strains of this fungus were screened for their efficacy       against pestiferous insects.
As a       post-doctoral researcher at Indian River Research and Education Centre,       working closely with       citrus growers, Avery continued his work on control methods against insect       pests [a].
This led to       the development of a tolerance residue limit exemption registration of       PFR-97&#8482; in 2011 [b], as       Avery's research was used to justify a request to waive tests against non       target insect species.
Certis USA began selling PFR-97 for use on food crops in July 2012 and the       product is now       increasingly used to protect the vine crop in California against mite       infestations that have become       resistant to many foliar chemical sprays [c].
This product is also       being used there commercially       against other pestiferous arthropod pests of economically important crops.
Sales in the USA have       been growing faster than anticipated and Certis has now sold over       10,000lbs of the biopesticide for       use on food and non-food crops.
They are now planning to register PR-97       for use on food crops in       Mexico.
Heritage consultation     Nicklin has worked with a number of heritage organisations, including       English Heritage and the       National Trust, monitoring and advising on the presence and hazard of       fungal species in air and on       collections.
In the first instance, the primary concern of this       consultancy work is health and safety,       so that when mould is discovered, Nicklin advises on what type of       protective equipment must be       worn by conservators.
The National Trust's National Specialists       Consultancy Manager reports that       "[Nicklin's] work in identifying mould spores and preventing their         growth is not just important, but         utterly essential to the National Trust's continuing practical physical         care of its historic collections &#8212;         as well as to the Health &amp; Safety of its staff, volunteers and         visitors" [d].
Nicklin has worked on       properties including Windsor Castle, Coughton Court, Knole House,       Christchurch College, Oxford       and Dover Castle.
This work has recently led to English Heritage and the       National Trust jointly       funding a PhD student.
Nicklin also runs training sessions for both English Heritage and the       National Trust.
For the last       four years, she has also taught on a course in Preventative Conservation       run by West Dean       college in Brighton.
This is a continuous professional development course,       which has been       attended by professional conservators from a wide variety of institutions,       including: English       Heritage, the National Trust, Brighton Royal Pavilion, the Museum of       Islamic Art in Qatar, the       Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, and many other local museums and galleries [e].
The course aims       to equip participants with an understanding of the `agents of       deterioration' which affect the integrity       of materials in collections, how to assess and prioritise those risks, and       how to develop methods of       mitigation which are appropriate in the context of each collection and its       resources.
Nicklin       provided lectures and practical training sessions for the participants,       enabling them to identify, risk       assess and remediate mould infestations in their collections and       libraries.
One participant in 2013       said: "In a nutshell, the course got us thinking about several issues         surrounding conservation;         sustainability in conservation, relative humidity and temperature,         mould, pests, gaseous pollution,         dust, light and lighting, emergency planning, objective setting,         communicating conservation and the         economics of preventive conservation (to name a few)" [f].
Media/public engagement work.
As a result of her expertise in mould and fungi, Nicklin was invited to       become the consultant       microbiologist for the fifth series of Channel 4's How Clean is your         House?
This programme was       viewed by an average of 1.7m viewers per episode when it was first shown       in August 2009, and       has been repeated many times since then [g].
Nicklin analysed       swabs taken from the houses and       then worked on location to ensure that the scientific content of the       programme was accurate.
In an       interview with the Birkbeck College newsletter, Nicklin described her role       as follows: "I also made         sure that they were getting the overall message right to the         householder.
We didn't want to terrify         people.
It's not car crash television.
It's a sensible risk evaluation         of the way some people live their         lives.
We were telling the householder, `this is a very hazardous way of         living your life.
Here are         some simple ways to clean up.'
When Aggie revealed the lab results on         set I'd make sure the         householder didn't get panicked, and to answer questions, so it's fairly         responsible" [h].
In December 2012, Nicklin appeared twice on BBC Radio Four's Broadcasting         House to discuss       microbes in the old BBC studios [i].
Nicklin sampled throughout       the old studios, including that of       the Radio Four Today programme, and returned to discuss her       finding that only the fridge was a       source of potentially lethal microbes.
