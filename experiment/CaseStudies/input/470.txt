     Before 2010, the chance of a foal being born with FIS in the Fell pony       breed was very high (up to 15-20%) as the carrier rate in breeding animals       was so high (40-44%), but carriers were not identifiable.
Whilst the Dales       ponies had a lower carrier rate (20%), there was still real uncertainty       for breeders and owners and the very significant chance that a foal with       no chance of survival could be produced.
The principal impact of the research is the provision and deployment of a       carrier test for Foal Immunodeficiency Syndrome to eradicate this fatal       equine disease following the UoL's identification of the genetic defect in       2010 and deployment of the carrier test by two commercial laboratories (http://animaldnadiagnostics.co.uk;       www.aht.org.uk/genetics_tests.html#equine).
This new diagnostic veterinary tool for risk-free breeding was immediately       offered to owners of the two most at-risk breeds (Fell and Dales ponies)       leading to rapid reductions in FIS rates.
In addition, the screening programme unexpectedly identified the spread       of the disease in two further breeds; Coloured ponies and Cob ponies.
Their breed societies have been informed about the presence of carriers in       their populations through dissemination of documentation prepared by       Carter and encouragement to use the test to ensure safe breeding.
The test was introduced in 2010.
Peer reviewed analysis of the diagnostic       data in subsequent years, by Carter [1], clearly indicates a major       reduction in the numbers of FIS foals born since 2010, with only one FIS       foal born in 2012 in the UK.
Owner education via concerted knowledge       exchange programmes has been a large part of the success of this work.
There is clear evidence from the Fell pony society of FIS-positive       stallions being gelded to prevent disease spread [7].
Feedback       (verifiable) from the two main breed societies shows that the carrier test       was readily welcomed and in some breeders' cases it may have saved their       financial viability [7,8].
The need for an effective carrier test can be       evidenced by the fact that more than half of all the UK breeding stock of       at risk ponies was tested in the first few months of the test being       available.
This number has reduced in subsequent years as the owners are       taking our advice about safe breeding practice [7,8,9].
The beneficiaries of this UoL research, all implemented since 2010, are:            Vets - who can confidently use the new diagnostic tool to advise         owners on risk-free breeding combinations.
Horse breeders, owners and their families - who can now find out the         carrier status of mares and stallions and ensure safe breeding         combinations are employed to stop FIS foals being born.
Equine populations - through reduction in incidence and spread of this         fatal disease.
The UoL research has identified four breeds that are         affected or who are carriers of the mutation and FIS has been reported         in Ireland, mainland Europe and the USA as well as in the UK.
Meat retailers - without this test, this disease would still be         spreading silently through equine populations and would be a threat to         those who export UK ponies for further breeding and supply to the horse         meat trade; only healthy horses can be used for meat.
A leading equine geneticist at the University of Kentucky wrote in an       editorial in the Veterinary Record "This test is clearly a boon for         breeders of these pony breeds and the veterinarians who care for them.
The story is a model for approaching other hereditary diseases in         animals."
[10].
The work has also already been adopted in standard       textbooks such as Tizard's "Veterinary Immunology" [11].
These impacts have been achieved through placing a high priority on       dissemination with information on the benefits and availability of the       carrier test being communicated through a number of media avenues       including peer reviewed academic publications and popular publications       such as Horse and Hound.
Carter has made many presentations to breeders'       societies in meetings across the country and hosted an open day at the UoL       Veterinary Campus (2010) to ensure the test availability became general       knowledge and that owners understood how to use the results to ensure no       ill foals were produced.
Carter was interviewed on television and radio       and produced articles for the equine owner press.
Many equine websites       (20+) championed the research throughout the 15 years and now broadcast       the availability of the carrier test (e.g.
[12]).
This has been       instrumental to the virtual eradication of the disease in the UK.
