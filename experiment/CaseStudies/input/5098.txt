     Until recently, Domesday scholarship was confined to small circle of       scholars, but that situation has now been transformed.
By harnessing a       wide range of media including television, radio, mass-circulation press,       the internet and public lectures, it has proved possible to share the       importance and interest of DB with millions of people in Britain and       worldwide, and to create new opportunities for them to engage meaningfully       with the matter it contains.
A wide public audience now has been given       access to a richer, more sophisticated understanding of DB &#8212; how and why       it was made, what it contains, and why it is so important for       understanding the effects of the Norman Conquest.
That audience has also       been empowered, by PASE Domesday, to establish who held land in       particular villages and towns in England at the time of the Norman       Conquest, to determine whether or not these landholders possessed property       and lordships elsewhere in the kingdom, and to explore the imprint these       people left on the wider historical record.
All this has enriched the       lives of millions of people for whom the historical interest of particular       places is of profound importance to the way they construct personal and       collective identities.
The extent of the impact       The research has been disseminated using the following media:            Television.
A one-hour documentary called Domesday, written         and presented by Stephen Baxter.
This was first broadcast on BBC 2 at         8pm on 10 August 2010 to an audience of 2.22 million viewers, and has         since been broadcast on several occasions (on BBC1, BBC 2, BBC 4, BBC         IPlayer, and the 9 times on the Yesterday Channel) and is available on         DVD, taking the total audience to 4.21 million people in the UK and         internationally.
Radio.
The launch of PASE Domesday was timed to coincide with         the first transmission of BBC Domesday, and on the morning of 10         August 2010 Baxter gave a series of radio interviews about their         interest and importance.
These included a 5-minute interview with James         Naughtie on The Today Programme; this is Britain's most popular         radio programme, regularly attracting audiences in excess of 6 million         weekly.
He also gave 5-minute interviews to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire,         Black Country, Berkshire and Gloucestershire; and subsequently gave two         further radio interviews which drew significantly on Domesday evidence         in the discussion: BBC Radio 4, Things We Forgot to Remember,         `King Harold II', presented by Michael Portillo, 29 October, 2010; and         BBC Radio 4, In Our Time, `The Battle of Stamford Bridge',         presented by Melvyn Bragg, Thursday 2 June 2011.
National press articles.
These included (i) The BBC History           Magazine (circulation 69,000 in 2010).
Stephen Baxter contributed         a question-and-answer interview which was published as the cover-page         story, `William the Conqueror's Domesday Book: A Brutal Exercise in         Power Politics' in Volume 11 no.

`New Domesday Database Launched Online'.
The internet.
PASE Domesday was published online on 10 August         2010.
Owing to the publicity this resource secured in television, radio         and in the press, there was a dramatic increase in the number of people         who used the PASE website on that date.
For example, between 9 and 10         August 2010, there was a 10-fold increase in the number of pages         consulted on the PASE website (from 7,053 to 73,631 pages) and a 23-fold         increase in the number of hits (from 22,611 to 526,745 hits).
Public appearances and lectures.
Baxter and other member of the PDE         research team have between them given 24 talks, seminars and lectures to         public audiences (at historical associations, schools, cathedrals,         conferences, and other universities) totalling approximately 1,350         people in total.
The nature of the impact       It is demonstrable that many people found this this material rewarding,       and that many of them were moved to pursue the subject further.
The       principal evidence for this is as follows:            Strong audience feedback research for Domesday.
The viewing         figures for `Domesday' were maintained throughout the programme, proving         that the audience remained interested and engaged for its duration.
A         sample of 125 viewers were invited to evaluate their enjoyment of the         programme on a scale of one to ten, and the mean average `satisfaction         rating' for the programme measured in this way was 8.5 or 85%.
The same         viewers were invited to contribute qualitative feedback, and this too         was positive: for example, `An authoritative and knowledgeable         presentation by an acknowledged and passionate expert, this is the sort         of programme that the BBC does best and well worth my licence fee.'
`An         excellent and comprehensive insight into something many of us know only         a little about but which is an extremely significant part of our         history.'
`A really interesting programme on a subject we are all aware         of but understand very little about.
That position has been partially         resolved.
I now wish to know more.'
`Excellent, even on the second         viewing.
Most interesting and informative.'
Some viewers published         comments online in blogs, e.g.
`Last couple of years best history         programme: Domesday Book, Dr Stephen Baxter.
New theses, clearly told by         a man who wants to communicate and not forge a career.
Utterly         brilliant.'
The fact that the programme was repeated 6 times on BBC channels and 9         times on the Yesterday Channel demonstrates strong on-going interest and         demand.
Positive press coverage and reviews of Domesday.
The programme         was singled out as recommended viewing by several independent television         guides and was positively reviewed in the national press.
Previews         included: (i) The Guardian Guide, Saturday 7 August &#8212; Friday 13         August 2010, p. 67, pick of the day; (ii) The Radio Times, 7-13         August 2010, pp.
76, 78 `pick of the day'; (iii) Total TV Guide,         7-13 August 2010, one-page article in `This week's TV highlights' (p.         12) and `pick of the day' (p. 56); (iv) The Observer, Sunday 8         August 2010, The New Review, p. 47 `pick of the day'.
Reviews included The           Guardian, 11 August 2010: `It's rare for TV to open such a         radically different perspective on a national treasure and rarer still         to make it come alive, so Baxter is clearly a TV star in the making.'
Exeter Cathedral Library's decision to have Exon Domesday (a         manuscript written during the survey of 1086) unbound for preservation,         and to facilitate research.
Baxter used a sequence in Domesday         to show how crucial this manuscript for understanding how DB was made.
As a direct result of this, and the interest it generated, members of         the cathedral community (not professional historians) decided to have         the manuscript unbound in 2010.
Baxter has since given a lecture (`Exon         Domesday: A National Treasure') attended by the Dean and about 80         members of the Friends of Exeter Cathedral; and he is actively involved         with the cathedral and a group of scholars to attract funding for a         major research project relating to the manuscript.
Increased public attendance at Old Sarum, an English Heritage site         which featured prominently on Domesday.
Naomi Matthews, Site         Manager of Old Sarum Castle: `Following its airing on the 10th August we         saw a spike in visitor numbers of roughly 100 extra people a day         throughout the week.
Many of these people were locals who had seen the         footage, especially the aerial shots and decided there was more to see         than they thought at Old Sarum.
Others were those who lived further         afield and had been interested by the historical part Sarum had to play         in the Domesday book.'
Increased use of PASE and PASE Domesday.
There were         spikes in the numbers to the PASE website on each occasion that the Domesday         documentary was shown and repeated.
There were approximately 19,000         unique visitors to the PASE website between October 2010 and July 2013,         with on average of between 1,500 and 2,500 unique visitors per month.
Approximately 8,500 people visited the site in August 2010 alone, when         media publicity for PASE Domesday was at its height.
Since the         number of established scholars who use the site cannot be greater than         1,000 worldwide, the great majority of these users can safely be assumed         to be students and members of the public.
Users of PASE Domesday         were able to search for villages and towns of interest to them; to         establish the names of people who held property in those places in 1066         and 1086; and to generate interactive tabular lists and distribution         maps of the property these people held elsewhere in England.
Members of         the public with little or no experience in the field could thus see and         explore meaningful patterns in the DB evidence, achieving in a few         seconds research of a kind that only experienced scholars with several         days to spare could have undertaken prior to the publication of PASE           Domesday.
Demand for public lectures given by Baxter and his research team in         historical societies, universities and schools throughout the UK and         internationally (24 given, as above).
A teacher at Comberton Village College, Cambridgeshire, wrote to say         that she had been `inspired' by Baxter's work on DB, which had `greatly         contributed to a series of lessons' she prepared for year 7, and to         propose teaching collaboration in the future (invitation received and         accepted before 31 July 2013, teaching collaboration to take place in         2013-14).
Private expressions of interest, and requests for help.
I have         received and responded to more than 100 hand-written letters and emails         from people outside academia in the UK and internationally (including         Norway, Belgium, New Zealand and Canada).
Many of these expressed their         enjoyment of Domesday (`this is probably the best documentary I         have ever seen' (Arnt Hvinden, Norway); others raise specific questions         about points made in the programme; and some seek guidance on ways to         research aspects of local history using PASE Domesday (e.g.
I         have corresponded with and spent a morning with a retired Yorkshireman,         assisting him with a local research project).
How the research underpinned the impact       Stephen Baxter's knowledge of DB made it possible for him to reach large       audiences in an informed and engaging way.
He was initially contacted by       the BBC to provide research ideas for a series on the Normans, but his       enthusiasm for the subject made it possible for him to sell the interest,       excitement and importance of Domesday to the channel controller of BBC 2,       and the commissioning editor of BBC, who decided to commission a one-off       documentary dedicated to DB.
Baxter's research enabled him to write the       first draft of the script for Domesday and to retain authorial       control of the script throughout the production process.
It also enabled       him to recommend visually arresting and illuminating places of interest to       film, and to write authoritative introduction to the programme in       high-circulation media.
PASE Domesday was designed from the inception to       be accessible and meaningful to wide audiences as well as students and       scholars.
Its existence was a further selling-point for Domesday       since it showed how new resources were transforming scholarship, and was       featured in two sequences in the programme.
