     The biologically inspired computer algorithms, developed by Smith and       colleagues at the University of York, have led to the creation of four       products for the medical devices market.
PDMD &#8212; Objective Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease     (Protected by patent application PCT/GB12/050093)     This novel non-invasive device, currently installed in hospitals in the       UK [7], USA [8,9], UAE [10] and Australia [11], confirms diagnosis of       Parkinson's Disease by digitally measuring patients performing a simple       finger tapping test used in conventional clinical evaluation.
This allows       microscopic movements, invisible to the human eye, to be identified that       characterise the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in a way that has not       previously been possible.
NDMD &#8212; A Unified Test for Neurodegenerative Disorders     (Protected by patent application PCT/GB12/050093)     This technology provides the means by which Parkinson's disease can be       differentiated from other neurodegenerative conditions, such as       Alzheimer's disease and Lewy Body Dementia, at a stage when symptoms are       often confused and a conventional diagnosis is difficult to obtain.
The       test, which is currently in use in hospitals in the UK [7], USA [8,9] and       UAE [10], can be undertaken quickly and safely, providing instantaneous       feedback to health staff.
LIDMD &#8212; Recognition and Monitoring of Levodopa-induced Dyskinesia     (Protected by patent application PCT/GB13/051888)     This system is being used by Leeds General Infirmary [7] to monitor       Parkinson's disease patients in their own homes and inform administration       of their medication.
The most effective form of treatment for Parkinson's       Disease symptoms is a drug called levodopa, but approximately 90% of       patients who take it for ten years or more develop severe side effects       including involuntary movements called dyskinesia, a major source of       disability severely affecting the patient's quality of life.
In       conventional practice, physicians rely on patients' own descriptions or,       in severe cases, patients are admitted to hospital for several days, to       monitor symptoms and adjust their medication accordingly.
This system       provides an objective measure of dyskinesia over extended time periods       permitting a better informed course of medication, thereby reducing       unplanned hospital admissions, consultations and greatly improving the       patient's quality of life.
CFMD &#8212; Computer-Assisted Marking of the Benson Figure Test     (Protected by patent application PCT/GB13/051889)     The Benson Figure Test is used throughout the United States to asses       decline in visuo-spatial ability, an important symptom of Alzheimer's       disease.
However, conventional scoring of patients' responses is       subjective and therefore lacks sensitivity.
Biologically inspired       algorithms have been used at the UCSF [8] and VA Medical Centers [9] to       analyze the dynamic characteristics of patients' pen movements during the       drawing process.
This provides additional objective measures that are       better able to detect mild impairment than the conventional scoring       systems, permitting an earlier and more secure diagnosis.
These products have had significant impacts in the following areas:     i) Routine clinical assessment of neurodegenerative (brain) disorders     Clinical studies at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospitals in 2007,       Leeds General Infirmary in 2010 (NHRES 08/H0903/36) and 2012 (NHRES       10/H1308/5) demonstrated PDMD improves diagnostic accuracy for Parkinson's       Disease from 75% to over 90% [7].
Further studies at the University of       California, San Francisco, Memory and Aging Center (UCSF MAC) in 2012       (NIH/NIA K23 AG037566-01A1) [8] and the Veteran's Affairs Medical Center       in San Francisco (SFVA) in 2012 (Michael J.
Fox Foundation) [9]       demonstrated that NDMD can be used to monitor other neurological       conditions such as Huntington's disease and Progressive Supranuclear       Palsy, "The methods of assessment enabled by this technology are unique       and provide an unrivaled means to investigate these conditions" said Dr       Schuff, Professor of Radiology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San       Francisco [9].
In 2013 the technology was licensed for use in additional hospitals       worldwide including the Rashid Hospital, Dubai [10], Monash Medical       Centre, Melbourne, Australia [11], the University of Washington School of       Medicine and the National Neuroscience Institute in Singapore.
ii) Monitoring the effectiveness and side effects of prescribed       medication     Following a successful clinical study at Leeds General Infirmary in 2011       and 2012 (NRES 11/NW/0541), the technology is now being used to monitor       Parkinson's disease patients in their own homes [7].
Parkinson's UK has       estimated savings of &#163;270,000 per year for each specialist nurse employed       to oversee home care for patients [12] and introduction of this technology       enables these nurses to undertake objective measurements which can be       instantly relayed to consultants, freeing up their time whilst maintaining       close monitoring of their patients' condition.
"For the first time, this       technology provides objective, reliable measurements that can be easily       assessed by health professionals to inform management of patients with       Parkinson's disease.
Real benefits, such as reducing specialist       consultations, hospital admissions and time spent in hospital can now be       realised" says Dr Jamieson, consultant neurologist at Leeds General       Infirmary [7].
iii) Commercialization through a spinout company     ClearSky Medical Diagnostics Ltd. [13] is a new (2013) University of York       spinout company set up to exploit this technology through four products       described above, providing quick, safe and reliable means of diagnosis and       monitoring of patients in the hospital clinic and their own homes.
Currently employing one full time and five part-time staff, the company is       in the process of fully commercialising the products ready for worldwide       sale.
