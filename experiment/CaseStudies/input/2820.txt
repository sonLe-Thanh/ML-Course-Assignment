     4.1 Research carried out at SUNCETT 2008-2013, has had an       important impact on the LSIS/ETF       approach to policy and practice.
We have produced five major reports and       22 conference papers       as well as published peer-reviewed academic practitioner-oriented articles       aimed primarily at       improving teaching and learning across the sector, in important areas of       practice, reflected in LSIS       and policy initiatives and in relation to enduring educational issues and       priorities.
These works are       used in teacher training and professional development and have been       circulated across       government departments.
4.2 The impact of our work included changes to public service         practices/guidelines and/or       improved educational attainment in FAVE.

4.3 We have extended the reach and ensured impact of our JPD         research as follows:            Our work has played an important role in contributing to the LSIS         approach to improving         teaching and learning across the sector (Source 11, JPD Guide).
Our JPD Guide, Research Development Fellowship research, posters and         papers are valued         as core readings/resources (Source 3, BERA 2013; Source 12, LSIS         Excellence Gateway).
Practitioners were involved in projects at all stages to ensure impact         on practice, through JPD         research projects, advisory groups of stakeholders, online user         consultations, trialling of         materials in training and dissemination events (Source 10 Impact Grids,         Source 12 LSIS).
SUNCETT's Guide to JPD is providing a framework, guidance and exemplar         case studies to         support and encourage practitioners to use JPD to improve their         practice.
(Source 3, BERA,         2013; Source 11, JPD Guide).
We work with groups of practitioners to develop understandings of         educational research;         identify implications of research studies for teaching and learning;         organise workshops and         events to refine, develop and contextualise research ideas and help to         connect this to relevant         literature in order to explore how the JPD approach to improving         teaching and learning might         be extended, adapted and developed to work in different ways and in         different contexts         (Source 10 Impact Grids; Source 12, LSIS Excellence Gateway).
SUNCETT's first draft JPD Guide was produced and piloted in         consultation with practitioners at         the LSIS Annual Research Conference in 2011 and through further         consultations with LSIS         RDF practitioners.
Meetings at further LSIS regional and national events         conferences ensured         the accessibility and relevance of the JPD Guide and practitioners were         involved as critical         readers in early drafts of the document (Source 11, JPD Guide).
We have organised local, regional and national events on specific         policies including Equality         and Diversity, Creative Teaching and Classroom Management, (Source 12, E         &amp; D Poster).
SUNCETT contributed to national evaluations of CETTs and approaches to         the development of         `hard' and `soft' measures of educational and public policy.
(Source 7,         Gregson and Nixon,         2009)       We also have also been invited to present the findings of our work at         the House of Commons         and to the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, the Institute         for Learning, the         Learning and Skills Research Network (LSRN) and the national Commission         for Adult and         Vocational Teaching and Learning (CAVTL).
Our work with the LSIS Research Development Fellowships has         contributed to the         development of the LSIS/ETF research strategy and policy (see referee         Sheila Kearney).
Internationally we have presented our work at research conferences in         Scotland, Finland,         Belgium, Austria, the United States of America, Canada and Australia.
Professor Gregson was invited to present the Keynote Address to the         LSIS (2011) Annual         Research Conference in which she challenged some aspects of taken for         granted approaches         to educational improvement through events and programmes of continuing         professional         development for teachers.
