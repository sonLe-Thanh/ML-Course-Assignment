     Between 2008 and 2013 EAR ON ARM and ARTICULATED HEAD       have led to the introduction of new approaches to the integration of       biotechnologies and cognitive science in the arts community, the promotion       of a broader acknowledgement of, and engagement with, interdisciplinary       work in the field of science and art by the general public (non-specialist       audiences), and a medical case study in state-of-the-art biotechnologies       offering a point of departure for new developments in Human Computer       Interaction (HCI).
The impact of the projects in these areas is reflected in the following       ways:     (1) EAR ON ARM was awarded the Golden Nica award in the category       Hybrid Art at the Ars Electronica Festival 2010, one of the most important       prizes for innovation in art and technology.
(2) ARTICULATED HEAD was featured in the Powerhouse Museum in       Sydney, the leading science museum in Australia.
The work was selected       from the finalists of the Australian Engineering Award, to be exhibited       for one year, but the duration of the exhibition was extended for another       year due to the work's overwhelming popularity.
(3) In 2009, the French-German culture television channel ARTE produced       and broadcast a documentary about Stelarc's work, discussing the EAR         ON ARM and ARTICULATED HEAD and their innovative       significance in bio-art and engineering.
Discovery Channel US has awarded       an &#163;180k production grant to produce a television documentary about EAR         ON ARM.
(4) The works' relevance within the arts community is further       corroborated by the fact that curators have selected it for some of the       most important exhibitions in the field of art and technology during the       period 2008-2013: sk-interfaces (FACT Liverpool, 2008, and Casino       Luxemburg, 2010); Stelarc: Les m&#233;caniques du corps (Centre des       Arts Enghien-les-Bains, 2009), EVOLUTION HAUTE COUTURE: ART &amp;         SCIENCE IN THE POST-BIOLOGICAL AGE, National Centre for Contemporary       Arts Moscow (2008); MEDICINE AND ART at the Mori Art Museum,       Tokyo, Japan (2010), ARTISTS BODY at Coreana Art Museum, Seoul,       Korea, and TELL ME TELL ME: AUSTRALIAN AND KOREAN ART 1976-2011 at       the Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney and the National Museum of       Contemporary Art, Seoul, Korea (2011).
(5) Articles about EAR ON ARM and Articulated Head in       prominent art magazines such as Art Monthly Australia (2012) and Circa       (2010).
The work was brought to the attention of a worldwide general public       through newspaper articles and radio and television features including ABC       National Radio (Australia), WIRED Magazine, The Sun, Guardian,         Daily Telegraph, CNN, Sky News, New York Times, Der Standard       (Austria), and VG (Norway).
This wide dissemination has facilitated a       broad discussion about the relationship between art and bio-technology,       contributing to a broader understanding of the concept of art in the       context of technological development.
There are numerous examples of       lay-people's responses to the work on internet platforms and web searches       on EAR ON ARM show that the research has been discussed on 24,700       websites (data collected from Google on 7 October 2013).
EAR ON ARM is also considered a pioneering experiment in state of       the art medical procedures.
In 2012, the methods used to construct       Stelarc's EXTRA EAR were implemented in largely the same form when       surgeons at Johns Hopkins University Hospital constructed a new ear for       cancer patient Sherrie Walter on her arm.
EAR ON ARM was       recognized as a relevant precedent for this medical procedure.
Similarly ARTICULATED HEAD's innovative significance in Human       Computer Interaction was recognised in the Australian Engineering       Excellence Awards 2010 and the work is seen as a model for further       development of interactive technologies in different contexts (e.g.
education, sports, healthcare and communication, etc.
).
