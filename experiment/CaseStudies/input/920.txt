     Allwood's research has shaped debates, campaigns and decision-making       around women in politics and, in particular, the question of women's       presence in elected institutions.
The impact has been to influence policy       debates on the relation between gender and democracy, evidenced by the       wide reference to the work in numerous policy documents produced by       governments and non- governmental organisations.
This research has engaged       critically with the `campaign for parity', and had a material and distinct       impact on debates around gender parity, women's representation, quota       campaigns, legislation, and other forms of public policy in France and in       countries including Canada, Spain, and Italy.
The outcomes of Allwood's research into gender quotas were published in Women         and Politics in France (Routledge 2000), which has had a       considerable enduring impact.
The book, as demonstrated by citations, is       used as a reference by:             Government Agencies (e.g.
Saskatchewan Institute of Public Policy         2008),        Regional Organisations (e.g.
International Institute for Democracy         and Electoral Assistance 2013) and        Non-government organisations (e.g.
the Building Democracy Project         2009).
Chapter 5 of Women and Politics in France, which explains women's       absence from politics, was translated into Ukrainian and included in a       textbook, Osnovii Demokrati (Fundamentals of Democracy) (2003) produced by       the Building Democracy Project, a Canadian and Ukrainian partnership,       funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and Queen's       University Canada, to provide Ukraine with a comprehensive programme of       professional and post- secondary education about democracy and human       rights.
In 2009, the book was updated and is used in distance learning       courses on democracy which have been created for public servants; courses       on democracy and human rights, established as part of the compulsory       curriculum in institutions that train internal security personnel for the       Ministry of Internal affairs; and on a course on teaching civic education       introduced in institutions training new secondary school teachers (http://www.queensu.ca/sps/bdu/foundation.html).
The textbook in which her research was printed forms a key resource in       this inter-governmental partnership, designed to help Ukraine develop a       self-sustaining education program to foster and strengthen commitment to       liberal-democracy.
Its post-secondary courses have annual enrolments of       more than 40,000 students and through a new compulsory Grade XI course it       will reach 200,000 students each year.
Here, Allwood's research is having       a direct impact on the Ukrainian democratic transition, significantly       communicating the outcomes of her research on gender and democracy to an       international audience and demonstrating enormous reach, whilst playing a       part in a project working towards an enduring impact.
The research on prostitution policy led to participation in networks       involving beneficiaries from various stake holding groups, from Police       Organisations (e.g.
Gloucestershire Police and Suffolk Constabulary) to       charities (e.g.
The Poppy Project and Streetreach).
In particular, The       Study Group on Prostitution brought together practitioners, policy makers,       NGO workers and academics in a series of seminars in 2005 (September,       London) and 2006 (September, London and Reading) intended to inform       policy.
Its results were published in an edited volume Demanding Sex?
(2008).
Gill Allwood was also invited to contribute to a policy advisory       seminar on Legislation to ensure human rights, 16-18 January 2007, Vienna,       part of the symposium on women, human rights and prostitution, organised       by Barnados, SOVA Women into Work: Moving On, and Sheffield Hallam       University http://shura.shu.ac.uk/990/1/fulltext.pdf.
The aim of the Symposium was to ensure that women involved in prostitution       were considered by policy makers, an aim which was demonstrably achieved       by the report's citation in subsequent parliamentary debates.
Allwood's research on refugees, published in Refugee Women in Britain         and France (2010), led to an invitation by the French Institute of       International Relations (IFRI), the prestigious Paris-based think tank, to       participate in the European Task Force on Irregular Migrations (ETFIM),       between 2009 and 2011, an initiative funded jointly by the Barrow Cadbury       Trust and the Conseil R&#233;gional d'&#206;le-de-France.
Allwood's research, which has drawn on a collaborative approach involving       external voices and actors, has had a material impact on policy       surrounding gender and democracy.
This can be seen by copious references       to her research outputs in discussion documents which have informed       parliamentary debates, think tanks and the policy recommendations       inter-governmental organisations.
