     Bovine mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary gland following bacterial       invasion, is the       foremost endemic infectious disease of dairy cattle worldwide.
Mastitis is       financially the most       important disease of dairy cattle, causing annual production losses of       more than &#163;170M in the UK       and US$ 2.0B in the USA, and is one of the most important diseases of       farmed livestock.
The       welfare implications of mastitis are severe and were highlighted in recent       UK Farm Animal Welfare       Council Reports on the Welfare of Dairy Cattle.
The impact of bovine       mastitis on the environment       is also important because an increased incidence of mastitis requires more       cows to produce a       given quantity of milk resulting in an increased environmental footprint.
In Great Britain the       incidence of mastitis in dairy cattle is between 47 - 65 cases per 100       cows per year.
Mastitis has a       multi-factorial aetiology and any control programme has to involve a       number of management       changes in order to derive benefit.
The DairyCo Mastitis Control Plan is a       new control strategy to       enable veterinarians and consultants to identify best interventions for       individual dairy farms and       produce a farm-specific preventive plan.
The plan includes a novel piece       of software to enable       trained users to carry out the process.
The control plan produces a       hierarchical ranking of possible       farm interventions, and places them in order of likely efficacy, dependent       on the farm's mastitis       pattern.
The DairyCo Mastitis Control Plan encompasses the entire process;       from farm diagnosis,       to identification of the best control measures, to implementation of the       measures on farm &#8212; all       based on the research detailed in this statement.
For example, control       measures could include       making alterations to the cow's environment, changing the milking       procedure or changing dry cow       nutrition.
The control plan incorporates all aspects known to influence       the risk of mastitis but       uniquely does so in a way to identify the optimal control strategy for       each individual farm.
Over two       hundred and fifty veterinary surgeons and consultants have been trained in       the application of the       control plan since 2009 (Source 2), and it continues to be       implemented in a coordinated way       throughout Great Britain (Sources 1 &amp; 2).
The national acclaim       and media attention (Sources 3, 4,         5 &amp; 6) provides evidence of the scheme's widespread uptake and       influence.
Approximately 90% of the work to develop the scheme was conducted by       researchers at       Nottingham.
UoN researchers provided the entire underpinning           information for the development       and implementation of the national mastitis control scheme, in terms of       its technical make up,       optimisation, execution and evaluation.
The national scheme was designed       and tested in a       randomised controlled trial and this directly led to the scheme being       chosen and started by       DairyCo UK.
The original control plan was honed prior to national launch,       through the subsequent       analytic research that introduced refinements.
Bespoke software was       developed to translate the       research findings into a format appropriate for use on a national scale       (the DairyCo "ePlan"), and       this software was designed from the findings of the research described (Source         2).
Current analysis of farms in the mastitis control scheme (2009 - 2012)       indicates that a reduction in       clinical disease of between 10-20% per year is being achieved (Source         7) and this means that, in       the first three years of operation the scheme has provided multi million       pound savings to the dairy       industry (Sources 2 &amp; 7).
The scheme has coverage across the       whole of Britain and is available to       all British dairy farms.
The total population of cows in Britain is ~1.6       million and in the first three       years the scheme (2009-2012) was implemented on 980 farms containing       &gt;10% of the cow       population (Source 7).
The economic value to the British dairy       industry from the improvements       made by these farms is &gt;&#163;3 million p.a.
in terms of clinical disease       alone (Source 2) and &#163;5-10M       p.a.
when subclinical disease is included (Source 7).
There are       many beneficiaries of the scheme.
Dairy farmers benefit from reduced clinical and subclinical mastitis with       large financial gains,       improved cow welfare, reduced environmental imprint and improved       sustainability of milk       production.
The wholesale and retail sector benefit from improved image       and value of milk       produced.
The veterinary sector benefits from increased sustainability of       the practice model, with       increased focus on disease prevention rather than treatment.
The research and national control programme have had an international       impact by being       incorporated into other national disease policies and programmes.
This       influence is evident in a       variety of countries, including the Netherlands (Prof Green presented the       research to key opinion       leaders in the Dutch National Udder Health Programme, in 2009 and 2011,       and also gave a       keynote presentation to the international conference on Udder Health and       Communication (Source         8), the USA (Source 9), Australia (Prof Green presented the       GB scheme to managers of       `Countdown Downunder', the Australian national mastitis programme, and the       DairyCo Mastitis       Control Plan is being used to direct and inform the programmes in       Australia (Source 9) and Chile       (Prof Green was invited to present to key academic and industrial leaders       in 2012).
In a statement       (2013), the Countdown Project Leader in Australia stated ' Of         particular interest to Countdown was         the design incorporated into the investigation pathway as delivered by         trained GB milk quality         advisers outlined within the DairyCo framework.
We are also impressed         with some of the adviser-farmer         communication pathways employed by the DairyCo scheme such as the         interactive adviser         map on the web resource.
It is clear to me, having been involved with         the Countdown project since         its inception, that we have many useful things to learn about project         design, delivery and evaluation         from the DairyCo scheme " (Source 10).
The impact of the British national mastitis control scheme is highlighted       by its recommendation in       the National Dairy Cow Welfare Strategy &#8212; a national strategy for cow       welfare supported by all of       the major dairy organisations (Source 3).
Further evidence of the       extent of the impact is found on       the DairyCo website (Source 2).
The scheme is supported by the       British Cattle Veterinary       Association (Source 4).
