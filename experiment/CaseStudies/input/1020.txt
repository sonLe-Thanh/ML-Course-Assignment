     References refer to those listed in section 3     The research findings were presented to a wide range of stakeholder       audiences, including the Department of Health, the NHS Screening       Programme, the Sickle Cell Society, the UK Thalassaemia Society, NHS       Scotland, the Royal College of Midwives, the UK Forum on Haemoglobin       Disorders, the British Sociological Association (MedSoc), ESRC research       seminar series, Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Association of Nurse       Counsellors, and the London Genetic Knowledge Park, and abroad to the       Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, the Anemia Institute (Canada),       and the Global Alliance for Nursing Education and Scholarship.
The report       to the NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme proposed an       evidence-based ethnic/family origins screening question [3], providing       policy-relevant evidence of the validity and reliability of such questions       [4]; the practicalities of implementing selective screening in busy       practice [3] and the particular lessons for low prevalence areas [5].
It       also raised the issue of negative reactions of ethnic majorities to       screening results [3].
From 2005 onwards half of NHS Trusts in England       (areas designated of low prevalence for sickle cell/thalassaemia) began to       use the Family Origins Questionnaire (FOQ) to identify which women to       offer a full laboratory screen for sickle cell/thalassaemia.
From 2009       onwards, the remaining NHS Trusts in England (areas designated of high       prevalence for sickle cell/thalassaemia) also began to use the FOQ because       (as pointed out in our research) ethnic/family origins helps laboratories       target which laboratory tests to apply, especially in identifying       potential cases of severe alpha-thalassaemia.
The Family Origins Questionnaire used by the NHS Screening       Programme includes several specific features taken directly from our       research, including:            An evidence-supported, category-based question was chosen, not an         open-ended one [3, 4], nor one based on locally devised, common sense         racialised categories [1, 5].
The categories used in the question departed from Census categories to         amplify those ethnic groups at greater risk of sickle cell/thalassaemia         [2].
The fact that an "ethnic/family origins" screening would have utility         in high prevalence areas (for assessing those at risk of severe         alpha-thalassaemia) as well as in low prevalence areas [4].
The screening programme commissioned an "ethnicity" screening         question, but our research suggested an "ethnic/family origins" question         and the policy-makers eventually picked up on and used the phrase         "family origins".
[4]       The ethnicity screening question developed encouraged those of "mixed"         heritage ethnicity to tick any combinations not just the         restricted range of mixed options in the 2001 Census[4].
The fact that midwives required prompts as to which ethnic categories         constituted higher risk groups to whom an offer of a screen should be         made [5].
The fact that, if a woman ticked certain boxes, instructions for the         midwife on what to do in terms of bottling, labelling and sending off         blood for testing were required [5].
The reach of the impact is possible to quantify.
All pregnant       women in England (approximately 3 million between January 2008-July 2013)       will have been administered the family origins questionnaire (the       development of our ethnic/family origins screening question).
Although the       screening question was initially (2005-2009) used in only 50% of England       (low prevalence areas) to identify pregnant women at higher risk of       carrying genes associated with sickle cell/thalassaemia for the purposes       of targeting an offer to screen in the laboratory for sickle cell, from       2009 onwards the questionnaire was also used in the rest of England       designated as high prevalence areas (where all women are offered a       laboratory test to screen for sickle cell/thalassaemia).
This is because,       as part of the research programme recommendations, it was pointed out by       us that all screening laboratories made use of the ethnicity information       to further target laboratory tests.
For example, there are thousands of       different types of mutations underlying thalassaemia, and if the       laboratory knows a woman's ancestral origins they can more quickly and       efficiently confirm thalassaemia by targeting their laboratory       investigations to those genetic variations found more commonly in the       woman's particular ethnic group.
The programme therefore followed our       specific recommendation that the same screening question would be       appropriate in both low prevalence areas (for targeting whom to offer an       initial laboratory screen) and in high prevalence areas (for targeting       further laboratory tests).
The Family Origins Questionnaire as an ethnicity screening tool was part       of the 2008 National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines       for antenatal care of women.
These NICE guidelines cite the quality of the       evidence provided by our reference 4 as Evidence Level 1+, the top level       of evidence.
The NICE guidelines summarize the evidence underpinning       policy deriving from our research as "A fixed response question for       screening for family origins is supported by findings from an RCT as being       a useful screening test".
(NICE, 2008: 132) and cite their Guideline       Development Group interpretation of this evidence as "Screening for family       origins using a fixed response tick box question is effective in       identifying pregnant mothers at risk of haemoglobinopathy (i.e.
sickle       cell/thalassaemia).
A validated family origin questionnaire has been       developed for use (NHS Antenatal and Newborn Screening Programme).
This is       in line with National Screening Committee policy".
(NICE, 2008: 132)     In summary, since 2009 all pregnant women in England (approximately       670,000 a year) are offered the Family Origins Questionnaire at their       first antenatal appointment with their midwife as part of NHS Screening       Programme policy.
Eight key features of the design of this question derive       directly from our research.
