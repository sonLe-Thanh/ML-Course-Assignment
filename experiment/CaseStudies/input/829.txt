     Much of our research in microwave/millimetre-wave frequency components       post-1993, together       with its translation and impact post-2008, has been in partnership with Filtronic       or companies that       have arisen from Filtronic.
In October 2006, Filtronic       sold the majority of its wireless infrastructure       division, Filtronic Comtek, to Powerwave (USA), with key       staff from the filters division forming a       new company Radio Design Ltd in August 2007.
In March 2008, Filtronic         Compound         Semiconductor's GaAs business was sold to RF Micro Devices Inc.,       and the facility (RFMD (UK)         Ltd) became the largest volume manufacturer of GaAs devices in       Europe.
In August 2008,       Filtronic sold its defence business to Teledyne Technologies         Inc., forming Teledyne Defence Ltd.
In this case study, we focus on the creation of impact post-2008 of two       areas of Leeds research:       the development of RF filters principally through Radio Design Ltd,       and the design and       manufacture of high breakdown voltage power transistors through RFMD         (UK) Ltd.
However, all       the companies discussed above derived from Filtronic PLC and were       all underpinned by Leeds       research and researchers post-1993 &#8212; Filtronic Wireless, Filtronic         Broadband, RFMD (UK), Radio         Design Ltd and Teledyne Defence Ltd between them had &gt;500       employees and a total turnover of       ~&#163;80M in the most recent financial year [A].
Radio Design Ltd designs and manufactures single-band and       multi-band RF filters and combiners       for cellular radio systems, focusing on: inter-operator and technology       sharing; tower mounted       amplifiers; interference reduction; and, the provision of test equipment.
It has grown from 11 staff       in 2008, to 70 staff and sales of &#163;8.7M in 2010, to 150 staff and sales of       &#163;14.7M in 2012, with `75%         of the company's products derived directly from underpinning research at         the University of Leeds'       [B].
Its original (2007) 30,000 sq ft, manufacturing facilities in       Shipley, Yorkshire have expanded to       include 10,000 sq ft facilities in India (December 2008), and 20,000 sq ft       in China (March 2012).
Markets include the UK, Ireland, Scandinavia, Eastern and Western Europe,       China, India, and       recently the USA [B].
As examples of the uptake and exploitation of Leeds research by Radio         Design Ltd, our       development of non-uniform Q filters led to the company's 3G       Universal Combiner Unit, with       sales of &gt;40,000 dual-channel units (total value &#163;18M) from 2008 and       creation of &gt;50 jobs; this       resulted in the company's Queen's Award for Enterprise (Innovation) in       2011 [B].
Based on the       success of this product, Radio Design Ltd were contracted to       design and build 35 power combiners       (each costing ~&#163;35k) to enable all five cellular operators to share a       common antenna system at the       2012 London Olympics, removing the need for multiple cellular base       stations.
Leeds' subsequent       development in 2012 of 4G power combining technology in       conjunction with Radio Design Ltd       has already led to sales in 2013 of 6,000 units (average cost: &#163;700/unit)       to cellular radio operators       for use in LTE and 4G systems (with anticipated sales going forward of       18,000 units in 2014 and       35,000 units in 2015, leading directly to the creation of a further 50       jobs) [B].
Leeds' development of miniaturized filters has, however, not only       led to the growth and success of       Radio Design Ltd, but also the "tens of thousands of dielectric         resonator filters ... manufactured by         Filtronic and subsequently Powerwave ... for use in US cellular radio         infrastructure, which has been         widely utilised in the period 2008-2013" [B].
Furthermore,       the technology "is now used by many         manufacturers of filters, and I would estimate that there have been         sales since 2008 of tens of         millions of pounds" [B].
Bespoke filters were also designed by Leeds       for Selex Galileo, who have       integrated these filters into new designs for wideband defensive airborne       radar [C].
(Owing to       defence implications a definitive statement on how many &#163;30M fighter       aircraft have adopted this       technology is not available.
Indicative sales are of 500 units (two       filters per unit) [C]).
In parallel with the above, between 2008-2013 RFMD (UK) Ltd at       Newton Aycliffe produced       pHEMT switches for all major mobile phone manufacturers, based on the       initial Leeds research on       the design of high breakdown voltage power transistors, which was       first commercialized from       2005 through Filtronic Compound Semiconductors (CEO: Snowden) [D]       &#8212; "I therefore anticipate         that during the period 2008-2013 over 2 billion pHEMT switches have been         produced and used, all         originating from the Newton Aycliffe site and all deriving from         Professor Snowden's initial research         on the modelling of semiconductor devices.
This corresponds to sales in         excess of &#163;250M" [D].

In 2013, RFMD (UK) Ltd sold the volume manufacturing facility established       at Newton Aycliffe to       Compound Photonics, with the planned creation of an additional 200 jobs       [F].
[figure removed for publication]     Figure 1 [text removed for publication]     Our close relationship with Filtronic led to Hunter's appointment       at Leeds in 1998 as a part-time       Senior Research Fellow (full-time from 2001) from his position as Fellow       Engineer at Filtronic, with       the objective of building research collaborations through PhD studentships       (12 based at Leeds, 3       in Filtronic), and research grants.
Filtronic also funded       an undergraduate degree programme and       a Masters degree programme at Leeds, with total sponsorship of over &#163;1M.
The impact of this       support, and the strength of our underpinning research, is evidenced by       the number of former PhD       students who held/have taken up senior positions in the UK and overseas       over the period 2008-2013,       including: Christoph Ernst (PhD awarded 2000), currently head of R&amp;D       for passive       microwave components European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands;       Vanessa Walker       (2003), senior research engineer, Filtronic; Ben Senior (2003) and Michael       Guess (2012) filter       designers, Radio Design Ltd, Shipley, UK; Andrew Guyette (2006), Research       Engineer at Naval       Research Labs, Washington DC, USA; Alaa Abunjaileh (2007), antenna       designer, EADS/Astrium,       Stevenage, UK; Emika Sandhiya (2007), MMIC designer, SELEX Galileo, UK.
