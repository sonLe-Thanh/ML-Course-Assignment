     Hawkins' academic work has broadened the audience for chanson and       significantly       increased popular knowledge of it in the U.K.
In recognition of the impact       of his research, He       was made Officier dans l'Ordre des Palmes acad&#233;miques in 2009, an       order bestowed       specifically in recognition of contributions by members of the academic       and teaching       communities to the growth and development of the impact of French culture       internationally.
L&#233;o Ferr&#233; (1916-1993) was one of the greatest French-language       singer-songwriters, along       with Jacques Brel, Georges Brassens and Charles Aznavour.
Unlike theirs,       however, his       songs are very little known in the English-speaking world.
He was a poet,       a classical       composer and a dynamic and controversial live performer whose career in       France dominated       the years after the Second World War until his death in 1993.
He released       some forty albums       over this period, composing the music and the majority of the lyrics, and       released many hit       singles, particularly between 1960 and the mid-seventies.
The Love and Anarchy project central to this case study aims to       create similar success       for L&#233;o Ferr&#233; in the UK &#8212; a figure so popular in French culture that even       the French President       Fran&#231;ois Hollande has identified himself as one of Ferr&#233;'s admirers.
Ferr&#233;'s music had a       considerable influence over the development of French music culture during       the 1970s,       inspiring celebrated French artists such as Bernard Lavilliers, Jacques       Higelin and Julien       Clerc.
The project, therefore, is intended to enhance the cross-cultural       nature of British and       French popular music, but also puts the cultural heritage of French music       into an international       context.
Love and Anarchy incorporates three impact initiatives:            concerts of Ferr&#233;'s work since 2011, of which three from 2013         (Bristol, London, Sheffield)         are central for this Impact case study, where Hawkins performed         translated versions of         Ferr&#233;'s music and introduced Ferr&#233;'s songs with contextual information         based on         Hawkins' research on chanson;       public songwriting and guitar workshops on the day after the concerts         where Hawkins met         with members of the audience, in particular guitarists and songwriters,         who used the         opportunity to learn about popular French music, and to experiment with         and incorporate         this music genre into their own music production;       the publication (March 2013) of a CD Love and Anarchy &#8212; The Songs           of Leo Ferr&#233;,         containing 25 studio recordings of Ferr&#233;'s songs and an extensive         50-page booklet with         Ferr&#233;'s songs and poetry in English translation.
The CD has a         `print-run' of 1000 copies         and is being sold world-wide;       a website (www.onemanchanson.com)         that presents Hawkins' work on Ferr&#233;, offers         `tasters' of his public performance, and includes a feedback section for         the public.
Each concert was followed by an opportunity for the audience to comment in     the form of a     feedback questionnaire.
In addition, Hawkins engaged in discussions and     answered     questions during an audience forum after each concert.
Furthermore, those     attending the     concert were given Hawkins' contact details and web address, and encouraged     to visit the     website and leave comments about the performance, and the project more     generally.
This     information was provided on the concert programme and in the form of a     business-card-sized     contact card, which ensured that the audience was able to take the details     home with them.
The concerts taking place during this Impact period were attended by up to     90 people each     and comments included references to increased `understanding of L&#233;o Ferr&#233;     [and] his music'     and of `an interesting period of French cultural change', to `open[ing]     everyone's minds to     places where they [otherwise] miss things' and the `transcend[ence] of     culture and language'     and a broad appreciation of the extent to which the material presented was     culturally     distinctive.
During the concerts and the workshop, Hawkins offered substantive       introductions to each       song and provided the audience with further contextualization of Ferr&#233;'s       songs, both in their       historical dimension and their current appreciation in modern French       society.
The feedback       suggests that most of the audience had been familiar with French chanson       in general but not       with Ferr&#233; in particular.
70% of the audience say that they enjoyed       listening to French       chanson in translation and that it worked well, whereas 17% prefer       the original French.
Overall, Hawkins' scholarly contribution and his artistic work have       significantly furthered an       awareness of Ferr&#233;'s work in particular and French chanson more       generally.
Love and         Anarchy is internationally available on the iTunes store,       downloadable from amazon.com and       available via Spotify.
