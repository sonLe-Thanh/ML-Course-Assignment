     Principal impacts arising from our research were evidence to government       and NGOs on the risks to biodiversity from air pollution and the       development of methods and policies for upland peatland restoration and       re-establishment of Sphagnum moss.
Impacts on policy of air pollution effects on ecosystems:     Critical loads are used by government and NGOs to inform decision-making       on planning applications for industry and agriculture.
A report       commissioned by Natural England [B], in which CEEREC were lead       authors, assessed the effectiveness of nitrogen critical loads, [T3],       and CEEREC jointly authored a DEFRA report (June 2013) evaluating the       effect of N deposition reduction on ecosystems.
"[CEEREC research] has         made an important contribution to the body of evidence ... used in         supporting our advice to government on the risks to biodiversity, in the         context of the ... new Common Agricultural Policy programme and .. the         Government's commitments to enhancing biodiversity under Biodiversity         2020."
(Natural England, [T4]).
CEEREC played a key role in       evaluating pollution bio-indicators for the protection of biodiversity for       the Joint Nature Conservation Committee [C].
Dise       co-authored the influential paper in PNAS, [2], calling into       question the basis of the Critical Loads policy for protecting       biodiversity: "In some cases, such as the Payne et al.
paper       ....advances may cause us to reconsider the fundamental concepts that       underlie the policy" [D].
MMU field research was used as evidence       for setting critical loads of nitrogen pollution for heathlands in the       2010 European Review and revision of empirical critical loads and         dose-response relationships, Bobbink and Hettelingh 2010, ISBN:       978-90-6960-251-6.
Caporn and Dise have provided expertise and advice to UK DEFRA policy       advisors at twice-yearly consortium meetings, 2001-2011.
Dise was lead       author on a chapter of the 2011 European Nitrogen Assessment on `Nitrogen       as a threat to European terrestrial Biodiversity' [5], [E],       informed by her grassland research.
A work package Indicators of N         deposition and its ecological impact lead by Caporn and Dise, [F],       also led to them authoring sections on nitrogen impacts in the 2012 UK       Review of Transboundary Air Pollution report (ROTAP, 2012, [I])       which is the background to DEFRA's strategy on air quality and ecosystems.
Caporn sits on the steering committee for CAPER (UK Committee for Air       Pollution Effects Research) which has met six times, 2008-13.
CAPER holds       annual conferences to communicate outcomes to end users (e.g.
DEFRA, EA,       Natural England and Natural Resources Wales).
In July 2013 the PEATBOG       project was one of only two EU funded projects from the `Biodiversa' 1ST       round to provide the basis for policy briefs to the EU.
These briefs were       prepared by Dise for environmental policy representatives all Member       Nations, the EU Environmental Attach&#233; and other parties for direct input       into policy on mitigating climate change and air pollution emissions.
"MMU         have been instrumental in considering complex, multidisciplinary         responses to restore habitats to favourable conservation status"       (Chair, Air Pollution Information System Steering Group and Senior       Pollution and Climate Advisor, Natural Resource Wales, [T3].
Mitigation and restoration of pollution affected landscapes:     Natural England is working closely with MMU on an innovative and       productive project to re-establish Sphagnum moss at a landscape       scale across the uplands of England, [T1].
Moors for the Future       commissioned a report from CEEREC advising on restoration strategies, [G].
CEEREC provided key advice on the potential for successful Sphagnum       restoration and extensive technical advice on an advisory group which       oversees this work.
Atmospheric pollution leaves a legacy of negative       environmental effects.
A consortium including MMU advised Natural       Resources Wales in April 2013 on management options to reduce the impact       of nitrogen accumulation in different habitats.
The collaborative work on       Sphagnum moss with Moors for the Future (2008-2013) and       Micro-Propagation Services Ltd (2008-2013) has provided commercial impact       since October 2012 proving that that planted Sphagnum in a novel       form called BeadaMoss&#8482; produced by Micropropagation Services Ltd, could       establish and grow in harsh upland conditions.
"MMU has enabled our         business to commercially develop our new Sphagnum product and have been         greatly assisted by having sound scientific data.
It has enabled us to         be seen with credibility and to successfully deal with NGOs, large         businesses and government bodies" [T5].
This knowledge gives       valuable underpinning to the &#163;5.5 M EU-funded `Moorlife' moorland       restoration project (2010-2015).
(http://www.moorsforthefuture.org.uk/sphagnum-project)       as articulated by Moors for the Future, "this programme of research by         MMU has provided an incredibly valuable body of evidence that has         enabled us to effectively communicate to policy makers and funding         bodies to successfully secure funding to continue restoration and land         management and informed the development of restoration methods to         increase efficiency and efficacy", [T2], Letter from         Research Manager, Moors for the Future).
The impact of CEEREC's       research has been to support the re-vegetation of around 2500 hectares of       previously bare and degraded upland peat soils in the Peak District       National Park.
In 2012 our research gained media exposure through       interviews on BBC Radio 4 (Costing the Earth, 14.3.2012); local BBC       stations (Radio Stoke, 25.9.2012; Radio Manchester, 26.9.2012) and       articles in The Sunday Times (23.9.2012).
Our expertise was acknowledged       by Natural England who appointed Caporn as one of two academics to the       Upland Evidence Review panel on upland restoration (2012-2013),       (http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/uplands/reviewgroups.aspx)
