     The impact of ACER's research since 2008 has been realised via its       established relationship with the Autism Education Trust (AET), which was       launched in November 2007 with support and funding from the government.
The findings from ACER's research programme guided the development of       resources and training material: all AET materials referred to below have       been led by, produced and delivered by members of ACER in collaboration       with local authority hubs and other stakeholders, and with schools and       practitioners involved in autism education.
As evidenced below the impact       has been to improve teachers' understanding of autism, their knowledge and       confidence in working with autistic pupils and consequent changes in their       practice.
Development of resources and training for teachers     ACER's research on `Educational provision and outcomes for people on the       autism spectrum' (R4) was described by the AET as the most comprehensive       study to date in considering what `"good outcomes" for individuals         with autism might look like' (source 1 below).
ACER was then       commissioned by the Department of Education in 2008 to translate its       research into the development of the autism component of the national       Inclusion Development Programmes (IDP).
The aim was to improve teacher       workforce skills in order to enhance autism practice.
ACER academics not       only produced the content of these but were also closely involved in the       national dissemination strategy in partnership with National Strategies       and Local Education Authorities.
The national IDP programme was rolled out successfully to all Early Years       providers, child-minders and schools in England in phases across the       country, with the autism IDP delivered in 2009-2010.
The Early Years       Autism IDP alone was sent to 140,000 locations.
The DfE later provided       funding for the Early Years, Primary and Secondary IDPs in autism to be       placed on the Autism Education Trust website for ease of accessibility.
The programme was launched through 20 conferences in 2009-2010 across       England (at which Guldberg and Jones presented) which were attended by       2,500 people.
This involved a number of local authority hubs, including       LEA leads, head teachers of schools, school staff and early years       practitioners.
An independent evaluation of the Inclusion Development Programme was       undertaken by the Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and       Research, University of Warwick (CEDAR) (source 1).
The CEDAR team       consulted over 12,000 practitioners who had implemented the IDP in 2009       and 2010 and found it was highly effective in raising knowledge,       understanding and confidence in teaching pupils with Special Educational       Needs and Disability (SEND).
The autism materials in particular, were       consistently rated (73%) as having a greater impact on teachers'       understanding, knowledge and confidence in teaching pupils with autism       than the other IDP materials (source 2, p 64).
The feedback       described them as accessible, manageable in terms of content size and user       friendly, with teachers being engaged by them.
The Government commissioned       Teacher's Voice survey of the IDP (November 2010) also highlighted that       79% of respondents stated that the autism IDP had improved their ability       to provide support for pupils and 84% of teachers undertaking IDP autism       training rated it as effective (pp.
61-64).
The report states that "the         autism spectrum materials were particularly well regarded" (p.10).
Significantly, teachers were reported to have changed their practice as a       result of the autism IDP.
Examples of this include reviewing classroom       organisation to create autism friendly environments; making quiet areas       more prominent and staff using more visual aids (p.71) as recommended by       the ACER research and outlined in the autism IDP.
Building on this, the DfE funded the Autism Education Trust to use its       research to produce and implement: (i) a set of National Standards in       autism education; (ii) a Competency Framework; (iii) three tiers of       training materials.
The Autism Education Trust commissioned ACER to lead       all three elements of this programme, with the training component being       delivered by a network of hubs across the country:     (i) The development of National Autism Standards was commissioned in       December 2012.
It provides educational settings with a framework to       evaluate their practice in addressing the needs of pupils on the autism       spectrum.
The framework is downloadable as a self evaluation tool that       settings can use to evaluate their practice (source 3).
Evaluation of the       materials by CEDAR is currently ongoing and downloads data are not       available, but page views are high (16645 page views and 9552 unique page       views), suggesting engagement with the materials is also good.
(ii) The development of a Professional Competency Framework was       commissioned in January 2012.
It sets out knowledge, skills and personal       qualities that are required for professionals in educational settings       working with pupils on the autism spectrum (source 4).
The framework was       available from 31st August 2012 as a downloadable       self-evaluation tool that practitioners can use to rate their current       practice and understanding against a set of descriptors.
As with the       Standards, evaluation of the materials by CEDAR is currently ongoing and       downloads data are not available, but page views are high (8102 page views       and 6158 unique page views), suggesting engagement with the materials is       also good.
(iii) On 31st May 2012 the Autism Education Trust announced       the largest ever face-to-face autism training scheme for schools across       England.
The three tiers of training materials, developed by ACER were       delivered through the hubs to over 13,000 school staff from the start of       the programme in February 2012 to July 2013.
Steve Huggett (AET Director)       is clear about the impact of the training: `this programme is         transforming autism education and is making a real impact         because all elements of the programme have been developed and delivered         collaboratively; involving the Autism Centre for Education and Research,         University of Birmingham, voluntary organisations, schools, local         authorities and, crucially people with autism themselves.
This has         contributed to the very positive feedback and has led to over 11,000         people being trained in just a year" (source 5).
In their       interim evaluation report, Cullen et al.
(2013) reported a "statistically         highly significant rise" in the knowledge and understanding of       participants after the training (p.15); and that the training provided       staff with activities and ideas for classroom practice in working with       pupils on the autism spectrum (source 5).
Contributing to raised awareness of the importance of autism           training     Sarah Teather MP, Minister of State for Children and Families, with       responsibility for SEN, said (press release dated 15th May       2012);"It is really important to get support for children with autism         right...
Awareness and the skills to address autistic children's needs         are crucial and this is why I am so pleased with the take up of the         AET's training" (source 6).
At a conference on the national       programme held at the University of Birmingham in March 2013, hosted       jointly by ACER and the AET, opened by Stephen Kingdom, head of Special       Educational Needs and Disability, Department of Education and attended by       350 delegates, Lesley Baker, from Birmingham Local Authority Communication       and Autism team stated: "For Birmingham Communication/Autism team, the         training programme along with the national autism standards and         competencies framework, have provided a structured framework for the         development of autism provision and a vehicle for quality assurance         across the local authority" (source 7).
