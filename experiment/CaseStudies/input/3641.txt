     ATAC was the first trial to show that an aromatase inhibitor alone is       more effective than tamoxifen for adjuvant treatment of early breast       cancer, with fewer adverse effects.
This has now been confirmed by       subsequent studies [a, b, c].
ATAC has been the only trial to       perform a direct head-to-head comparison of anastrozole against tamoxifen       alone.
The trial has the longest duration of follow-up, with benefits of       anastrozole maintained out to at least 10 years.
Anastrozole is now the       most widely prescribed aromatase inhibitor worldwide, with more than twice       as many prescriptions annually as the next most widely prescribed       aromatase inhibitor.
Over 5.5 million patient years of experience with       anastrozole has now accrued, and global sales totalled $2.8bn for the       period 2010-12, with the manufacturers citing the ATAC trial as the basis       of this success [d].
National and international guidelines now advocate use of an aromatase       inhibitor as first-line adjuvant therapy instead of tamoxifen, based       principally on the results of the ATAC trial.
In 2005, a technology       assessment from the American Society of Clinical Oncology on the use of       aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for post-menopausal women with       hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer recommended that: "Based         on results from multiple large randomized trials, adjuvant therapy for         postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should         include an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor         recurrence" [e].
The document refers to the ATAC trial       throughout.
The following year, a NICE technology assessment recommended       that "The aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole,         within their licensed indications, are recommended as options for the         adjuvant treatment of early oestrogen-receptor-positive invasive breast         cancer in postmenopausal women" [f].
In March 2009, NICE       Clinical Guideline 80 on `Early and locally advanced breast cancer'       recommended that "Postmenopausal women with ER-positive early invasive         breast cancer who are not considered to be low risk should be offered an         aromatase inhibitor, either anastrozole or letrozole, as their initial         adjuvant therapy" [g].
This was listed as a key priority.
Anastrozole is now become standard treatment.
A commentary on our 10-year       analysis (ref [4] above) in the Lancet Oncology in 2010 stated that "Mainly         on basis of the initial results of ATAC, aromatase inhibitor treatment         has now been declared the standard adjuvant treatment of         endocrine-responsive breast cancer by the St Gallen International Expert         Consensus" [h].
Anastrozole offers significant benefits to patients.
While anastrozole       and tamoxifen demonstrate similar outcomes in terms of overall survival,       anastrozole increased absolute progression-free survival by 3%.
Patients       were also less likely to stop treatment because of treatment-related       adverse effects.
The following adverse effects were less common with       anastrozole than with tamoxifen: hot flushes (5% absolute risk reduction),       vaginal bleeding (5%) or discharge (9%), venous thrombosis (2%), stroke       (1%) and endometrial cancer (0.4%) [i].
Anastrozole has been estimated to lead to 0.26 QALYs gained per patient,       with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately &#163;12,600 per       QALY gained and &#163;14,700 per life-year gained [j].
