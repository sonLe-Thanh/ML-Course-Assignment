     Multinational Enterprises: Nestl&#233;     The findings of the first and third strand of CIBUL's researchregarding       the effects of foreign investment and the locational strategy of       multinational firms are used globally by Nestl&#233; - the world's leading       nutrition company which employs 280,000 individuals and has operations in       over 200 countries.
Nestl&#233; has employed CIBUL's research, and more       specifically a conceptual framework developed by CIBUL,to assess the       impacts of its international operations, develop its value creation       strategy, and improve its corporate communication plans.Nestl&#233; has made       extensive use of the research to measure how its actions and investments       both create value and benefit societies in the countries where it operates       (both in home and host countries) - for example, the construction of its Nespressofactory       in Avenches (Switzerland) and its milk district operations in Pakistan.
[A,         B]     Nestl&#233; has incorporated a conceptual framework developed by CIBUL in its       annual reports and global websites - this is now part of Nestl&#233;'s toolkit       for evaluating its overall economic, innovation and social impacts on       different stakeholder groups in various countries around the world [A,         B].
According to Nestl&#233; itself, the research has helped to "measure       the company's overall net impact on its stakeholder groups" [A].
Put differently, the framework has enabled the company to improve its       corporate communication strategy, more effectively conveying the different       facets of itseconomic, innovation, social and environmental contributions       to various groups including consumers, suppliers, industry, employees and       governments.
This research is useful to companies such as Nestl&#233; because       it also identifies the channels and mechanisms through which the foreign       investment of multinational enterprises can be more successful.
To enhance       this impact further, Nestl&#233; commissioned a report from CIBUL.
The research of CIBUL has also been used as a basis for discussion,       analysis and decision making in the Seoul G20 Business Summit.
More       specifically, in November 2010, the Chairman of Nestl&#233; and Convenor of the       Seoul G20 Business Summit Group on Foreign Direct Investment(FDI)       emphasised in his foreword that CIBUL's research findings not only       benefited the company's senior managers but also "...stimulated a         systematic debate on and analysis of the impacts of FDI... and served as         an important input towards the work of the G20 FDI Working Group [which         included CEOs from several leading multinationals]".
He further       emphasised the role of this research by saying that "For companies,         policy makers and the wider public, it is important to understand where         and how business and more specifically FDI can have a positive impact on         stakeholders and society at large".
[C]     International policy agenda: United Nations     CIBUL's research has shaped the policy agenda of the United Nations       Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), particularly in theWorld         Investment Report (WIR).
The WIR is the world's most       authoritative analysis of international businessandisextensively used by       the UN, policy units, statistical offices and government institutions.
The       `Global Factory' theory and findings from CIBUL's research on optimal       location, innovation and foreign investmentare a key part of the WIR         2011, for which Buckleywasprincipal consultant, devising its       conceptual structure.
The worldwide reach of the impact is made evident by the fact that more       than 115,000 people from 160 countries (including around 1,000       policy-makers) have downloaded the report [D] [E].
The Director of       UNCTAD's Investment and Enterprise Division, reported that the WIR       and its forum offered `unique opportunities for cross-fertilisation and         networking between a wide range of investment stakeholders, allowing the         initiation of concrete investment projects and policy initiatives.
The         success of the Forum is very much owed to you [Buckley].
Your contribution helped elevate the Forum to the highest standard, and         helped establish it as the new centre of gravity for new international         investment and policy formulation'.

British business communityand intermediaries     CIBUL's research has led to service innovations in the advisory sector       via intermediaries such as the UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) and the       China-Britain Business Council (CBBC).More specifically, the UKTI funded       CIBUL to conduct two research projects, and the findings were used to       writethe Chinese Regional Cities report.
This research report, which is       the outcome of collaboration between CIBUL and CBBC,has benefited British       businesses by identifying which locations and marketsoffer superior       business opportunities following the global financial crisis [G].
Therefore, CIBUL's first two research strands have benefited these bodies       by enabling their advisors to articulate and integratein written reports       and in the various workshops described below (1) how particular locations       fit with firms' strategic goals and capabilities, (2) the factors that UK       firms should consider when sourcing scientific talent, knowledge and       technologies from abroad and (3) how firms can derive greater value from       investment locations in China.
When the Chinese Premier (Wen Jiabao) visited the UK in 2009, he and       then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown discussed the findings of the Chinese       Regional Cities report at 10 Downing Street.
The two leaders agreed to       promote UK trade and investment in China's Regional Cities, and following       the meeting, thePrime Minister said that "...the agreements, which         include a memorandum of understanding on the promotion of UK trade in         regional cities in China, would help double the UK's exports to the         country to &#163;10 billion by 2010" [H].This view was reinforced       by the UKTIwhich announced that "Britain and China signed a Memorandum         of Understanding (MoU) committing both countries to work together to         highlight opportunities for UK business outside the traditional centres         ...
The agreement follows on from a report on Chinese Regional Cities"       [G].
Since 2009, the research has been used in 17 workshops in the UK and       China run by the UKTI, the British Consulates-General in China and CBBC.
Nearly 1,000 companies,over 200 in China,attended the workshops.
British       firms took part in business trips to the cities on the location shortlist       drawn up by the research[I], and the international press recognised       the importance of the findings [J].
A CIBUL-CBBC study found that       nearly 50% of the participating investors indicated the study had an       impact on their thinking towards investing in China.2The CBBC       has presented this research at fora in the UK and China (CBBC Regional       Cities Roadshow).
As a result, CIBUL's research catalysed numerous city       missions, leading to businesses-seeking opportunities.
