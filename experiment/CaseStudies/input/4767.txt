     The UK has pledged to derive 15% of its energy from renewable sources by       2020.
Key to achieving this target is the development of offshore marine       renewable energy devices in Scottish waters.
Scotland holds one quarter of       Europe's potential offshore wind resources, and the power density       achievable in Scottish waters has resulted in the world's largest       concentration of wave and tidal energy devices currently under development       and testing.
A potential conflict therefore exists between offshore       renewable energy developments (such as wind farms, tidal and wave energy)       and seabird conservation.
Before such developments can be approved,       Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) must be carried out to assess the       potential impact on wildlife and the environment.
These assessments       require that those seabird species most at risk from such developments are       identified.
Research by Furness described above has helped to strengthen the work of       environmental consultancies specialising in the assessment of the impact       of renewables on birds.
It has also produced a robust methodology to       assist developers and provide guidance to statutory bodies, mitigating       conflicts between marine development and conservation.
Environmental consultancy     In August 2011, Furness was recruited as a consultant to the       environmental consultancy MacArthur Green Ltd.1 in recognition       of his expertise in seabird ecology and conservation.
Furness's expertise       has considerably strengthened the work of this consultancy, particularly       in industry guidance work that required a specialist in seabird       conservation.
This has resulted in several significant commissions with       industry-wide impact, some of which are described in subsequent sections.
"MacArthur Green was involved in Marine and Offshore projects before         Bob started however I was keen to expand this part of the company and         Bob's skills and experience fitted our need perfectly.
Bob has brought         considerable value to MacArthur Green through his already well         established reputation for excellence in his field.
This has led to us         growing our work in marine ornithology considerably."
&#8212; Director,       MacArthur Green Ltd.a     Developing guidance on Ornithological Environmental Impact           Assessments     In 2012, Prof Furness, through his consultancy role with MacArthur Green       Ltd, was commissioned to review the sensitivity of seabirds in Scottish       waters to offshore windfarms (by statutory regulator Marine Scotland)b       and to tidal turbine and wave energy devices (by statutory advisor       Scottish Natural Heritage).c Marine Scotland is responsible for       marine licensing and enforcement in the Scottish coastal region on behalf       of the Scottish Government.
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is one of       several statutory advisors to Marine Scotland, and is responsible for       providing advice to developers on the scope of EIAs, and for reviewing       EIAs as part of the planning consent process.
Furness's reports, the research within which was published,2,3       identified criteria for quantifying the vulnerability of Scottish seabirds       based on ecological and behavioural data, and also draw upon earlier       University of Glasgow research described above.1,4,5 The two       reports identified which few seabirds could be adversely affected by these       developments, and which (all but a few) did not need to be considered by       ornithological surveys.
"The report on tidal and wave energy devices was useful because it was         commissioned by the regulators themselves, undertaken by a respected         ornithologist and had a very definitive set of recommendations with         regards potential impacts of wave energy converters.
Such research         undertaken by developers would not necessarily inform a consensus         approach at the strategic level.
The peer reviewed nature of both the         underpinning vulnerability indices, and the final publication based on         the report has added significant credibility to the guidance."
&#8212;       Project (EIA) Manager, Pelamis Wave Energy Ltd.d (one of the       leading technology prospects for Scottish renewables)     As these reports had been commissioned and endorsed at the statutory       level by Marine Scotland and SNH, the guidance provides consistent advice       at the highest level across the industry.
This benefits stakeholders at       all levels including landowners, the Crown Estate (who lease the seabed),       renewable power developers (and the environmental consultants they       commission), conservation groups such as the RSPB, and other statutory       advisory bodies such as the Joint National Conservancy Council (JNCC).
Application of the research reports     SNH has used the research reports to assist the applications review       process (consenting) by identifying those species most susceptible to       impact, and to guide the advice they provide in statutory responses to       Marine Scotland.
It also uses them to challenge statements in EIAs where a       given bird species has been incorrectly described as invulnerable, and to       shape advice on monitoring bird-related impacts to existing or planned       research proposals.
The influence of this research2,3 is       evident in the fact that it has been cited in 15 applications (for       offshore wind, wave or tidal developments in Scotland) since first       reported in 2012, representing over half of the marine renewable schemes       on which SNH have been consulted.e     "[T]hese are the best guides we have to potential sensitivity [of         seabirds to renewables], and so both we and the developers will continue         to use them to guide the ornithological content and focus of the EIA         process."
&#8212; Policy &amp; Advice Manager (Marine Renewables), SNH.f     Establishing a framework for Cumulative Impact Assessments     In addition to EIAs undertaken for single development sites, cumulative       impact assessments (CIAs) are necessary to look at the cumulative impacts       of all developments in a given region on vulnerable seabird species.
This       will become increasingly important as the number of developments increase,       and there had been a lack of standardised methodologies for assessing       CIAs, particularly with regard to seabirds.
In 2012, Furness contributed to a report by Wetlands Trust (Consulting)       Ltd., commissioned by the Crown Estate, to perform a population viability       analysis of northern gannets in the UK, with the aim of assessing the       cumulative impacts of existing and consented wind farms.
This also drew on       University of Glasgow research to identify strengths and weaknesses to       different approaches for monitoring bird populations movements.1,5       The report was prepared on behalf of a wider stakeholder consortium, the       Strategic Ornithological Support Services (SOSS), which represents the       marine planning regulators (Marine Scotland), advisors (SNH, JNCC),       land-owner (The Crown Estate) and renewables developers.f It       therefore provides guidance at the highest strategic level.
In 2013, Furness and MacArthur Green Ltd. developed a methodological       framework for the CIA for the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters wave and       tidal projects.g This built upon Furness's framework for       assessing the vulnerabilities to seabirds of such projects in EIAs.3       The report was commissioned by The Crown Estate on behalf of a project       steering group comprising the same stakeholders involved in SOSS, and was       intended to accelerate and de-risk the development of renewables at a       strategic level.g
