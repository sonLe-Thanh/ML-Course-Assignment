     The research has enhanced lending bodies' understanding of SME behaviour       and has refined existing credit scoring models by providing additional       detail, thereby improving SMEs' access to credit.
In the field of credit       scoring, conference presentations have more immediate reach and impact as       they avoid the significant time lag before results are published in       journals.
In the case of the research reported here, the findings have       reached a wide range of leading lenders via INFORMS 2012, Credit Scoring       &amp; Credit Control (CS&amp;CC) 2007, 2009, 2011 conferences.
CS&amp;CC2011 attracted 349 credit practitioners, with major lenders       (Lloyds, RBS, Barclays) attending [5.1].
In addition, in June 2013 Dr       Andreeva organised a workshop specifically focused on SMEs which brought       together 30 practitioners and 40 academics [5.2, 5.3].
1.
Modelling risk of leasing to SMEs.
[text removed for publication], the leading [text removed for publication]       leasing company hiring out transport and equipment predominantly to SME       customers, took into account the results presented at CS&amp;CC2007, 2009       conferences and later published [in 3.1] when designing their first       statistical scorecard (implemented in 2011).
Their statistical scorecard       is now based on the methodology outlined in the paper.
Previously, [text       removed for publication] used a subjective judgmental approach to credit       risk assessment.
The new statistical model allowed them to automate a       significant part of this process.
This led to faster decision-making       whilst ensuring an acceptable risk level [5.4].
Communication with the       company was conducted via e-mail, telephone and visits to [text removed       for publication] by Dr Andreeva between 2008 and 2011.
2.
Management Capability.
[text removed for publication] (a leading [text removed for publication]       bank with more than 30 million customers) approached Dr Andreeva and       Professor Ansell after the CS&amp;CC2007 conference.
Together, they       devised a PhD project which used [text removed for publication] internal       credit transactions data.
Obtaining highly sensitive commercial data for       research is extremely difficult; it will not be made available unless       lenders see clear benefits.
The release of this data is therefore in       itself a testimony to the research's perceived practical value by [text       removed for publication] [5.5].
The research and discussions with [text       removed for publication] have led to an improved understanding of the       underlying structure of transactional data.
As a direct outcome of this       PhD studentship collaboration, elements of Management Capability that       underpin variables in [text removed for publication] scorecards can be       shown in a more visible way than was previously the case [5.6].
The PhD       student, [text removed for publication] now has a job with the Central       Bank of China, and her expertise in the assessment of SMEs' risk was a       decisive factor in her obtaining this position [5.7].
3.
SME behaviour during the credit crunch.
Similarly to the case with [text removed for publication], [text removed       for publication], one of the [text removed for publication] largest       credit bureaux, supplied its data for research following the CS&amp;CC2009       presentation (data received in spring 2011).
Again the very fact of data       provision signifies the provider's confidence in the practical value of       this research.
The research value has been to disaggregate the effects of       the credit crisis on the performance of different segments of SMEs.
The       in-depth knowledge generated has allowed [text removed for publication] to       check assumptions around stability of variables in their scorecards.
This       has engendered improved understanding of SMEs' vulnerability and their       risk drivers, which in turn has enhanced [text removed for publication]       analysts' ability to make scorecard developments robust to economic       downturns [5.8].
Because of the commercial sensitivity of a scorecard's       predictive performance and the complex, iterative nature of scorecard       development, no data exist to quantify the precise impact of this, or any       other, discrete piece of research.
However, we know that even a small       improvement in predictive accuracy translates into less loss (Berger,       Cowan and Frame, Journal of Financial Services Research, 2011),       thus leading to savings which can be re-invested into new credits, and       ultimately expanding the credit available to SMEs.
