     Although still ongoing, Redeeming Power has already had       significant, international impact, especially in relation to the Catholic       hierarchy, and those with oversight over the Church's response to       instances of abuse (and allegations thereof).
The launch conference featured around 60 delegates, coming from Austria,       Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland,       Slovakia, the UK, the USA, and Vatican City.
In addition to       university-based scholars from a large number of backgrounds (theology,       religious studies, canon law, secular law, education, bioethics,       paediatrics, psychology, sociology, and social work), the conference       attracted significant numbers of safeguarding professionals.
Among these       were psychologists working with abuse survivors, the Safeguarding Officer       for the Archdiocese of Birmingham; and three current members (and one       former one) of the National Catholic Safeguarding Commission       (NCSC), including its current Chairperson.
The NCSC is an independent body       established by the Catholic Church in England and Wales in response to the       Cumberledge Commission's final report (2007), with oversight over the       Church's safeguarding policies and procedures (see http://www.catholicsafeguarding.org.uk/).
Among the keynote speakers were Monsignor (now Bishop) Charles Scicluna,       who was at that time the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's       'Promotor of Justice' (i.e., its head prosecutor of abuse allegations),       and Bishop John Arnold, who is one of two representatives of the Catholic       Bishops' Conference of England and Wales on the steering committee of the       NCSC.
The one-day Bratislava conference, Prekon&#225;vanie zneu&#382;&#237;vania moci v         Cirkvi a v spolo&#269;nosti, brought together leading Slovak academics       with politicians, and journalists, to explore the theme 'overcoming abuse       in Church and society' with specific reference to the Central European,       post-communist situation.
Finally, the Manila conference on 'Power and       Theology' included a half-day public event for over 100 theologians,       students, and Catholic educators (including papers from Bullivant and Pia       Matthews from St Mary's).
As mentioned above, a key 'impact aim' among the delegates at the launch       conference was the wider dissemination of academic research into the       nature and context of sexual abuse, in order to inform Church responses.
Part of its impact strategy, therefore, involved building &#8212; and thus       fostering dialogue &#8212; with key national and international figures.
Even at       so early a stage (at the time of writing, only one of the main research       outputs has appeared in print), there is evidence that this strategy has       borne (and this, will continue to bear) notable fruits at both       international and national levels.
At an international level, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the       Faith's Mgr Charles Scicluna spoke to Vatican Radio from the launch       conference (as part of a half-hour feature programme on Redeeming         Power, also including an interview with Bullivant).
Having mentioned       that the Vatican's own February 2012 'Toward Healing and Renewal'       conference was the Church hierarchy's 'opportunity to reflect on this most       tragic wound in the Church and in society', he emphasized the landmark       nature of Redeeming Power as:     ...an important moment to move from the hierarchy to the theologians.
I think that slowly, slowly, we're getting towards a response which is         truly ecclesial &#8212; we're in this together, in suffering the wound and         trying to respond to it &#8212; I think that's a very important aspect that I         bring away from the conference, to share concerns.
[...] We need the         input from psychology, sociology, psychiatry, we need the human sciences         to not only diagnose, but also to have a prognosis and also an efficient         therapy.
(Vatican Radio 2012a; 2012b).
In addition to this half-hour feature broadcast on 6 September 2012,       Vatican Radio also published a series of articles deriving from it on its       website (in a variety of world languages).
The conference also received       coverage in The Tablet (UK), Tertio (Belgium), and in a       number of other news outlets via the Catholic New Service (USA)       (see section 5, below).
Closer to home, emerging directly out of the project &#8212; and the specific       engagement with safeguarding professionals fostered by the launch       conference &#8212; in summer 2013 the National Catholic Safeguarding         Commission invited Dr Bullivant to conduct a 10-year analysis and       review of its abuse allegation statistics for England and Wales.
This       project, which the NCSC is funding, is being undertaken in Autumn 2013,       and its findings and recommendations will be made public with a press       conference in early 2014, and will form the basis of the NCSC's Annual         Report for 2013/14.
