     The underpinning research has been developed internationally through a       range of projects and       networks in: the Social sector in Finland and Spain; Education in Finland,       Palestine, Japan and       Sweden; Health care and Leadership and Management in Finland.
The impact and benefit of the research can be traced chronologically:             Through links with the outward-facing Creative Business Unit of the         Finnish Theatre         Academy (Kookos) from the mid 1990s, Owens was invited to develop         artistic inquiry         approaches with other key Finnish institutions.
His pre-texts were         translated into the book         `Dramakompassi' (2010).
This is required reading for drama pedagogues in         Finnish         universities.
Examples of specific impact include the adopted use of         pre-text in 18 business         and organisational contexts through the nationally funded project         Manager 2.0 (2011-2012)         and in two health care institutions (2009-2011).
Since 2008, Owens has         also worked on eight         other projects in universities, prisons, city theatres and the Tampere         Theatre Festival,         reaching approximately 2,000 participants.
As noted by users of Owens' research in Finland, his work:         `...has had remarkable influence on Drama/Drama Education in Finland           and his           ideas/theories have spread to our neighbour countries including           Estonia, Sweden.'
(Raija Airaksinen-Bj&#246;rklund, Publisher, Finland)       `... has mediated at least [the] following fields: Social           Sector, School context, Health care, [...]         Leadership, managing and innovative action, [...] wellbeing           in working life and developing           work in business context.'
(Pekka Korhonen, Senior Projects Manager, Kookos Services, Theatre         Academy, Helsinki)       `...has made a significant contribution to the range of forms           available in for use in           professional institutions including schools, university departments,           health faculties [...]         business.'
(Dr Anne P&#228;ssil&#228;, Researcher LUT &amp; Partner Susino Ltd, Lahti,         Finland)        In 2000, Owens was approached by Mayumi Fukashima of NEC Tokyo to         create pre-texts         that moved between Japan and the UK.
These included performances in         collaboration with         Taichi-Kikaku Theatre in the New National Theatre, Tokyo, NEC, and for         the Japan         Children's Theatre Association (JCTA).
Specific impact included the         adopted use of pre-text         in Taichi-Kikaku's theatre practice and by approximately 30         professionals in JCTA         mainstream primary, secondary and special schools (2008-13).This paved         the way for a         book co-authored by Owens and Green&#8212;the first on the application of         drama pre-texts to         originate in Japan (2010).
The 22 performances (10 since 2008) and         workshops in Japan         and the UK, over 13 years, involved approximately 2,500 participants         (1,200 since 2008) and         included three reviews in the JCTA publication.
In 2010, Owens became an         editorial board         member of the Asian Journal for Drama and Theatre in Education.
`There have been few practical and pedagogical drama education           methods in Japan before           Professor Owens' work.'
(Yosuke Ohashi, Vice-President Taichi-Kikaku Theatre, Tokyo)        In 2011, the use of pre-texts in Palestine was substantially extended         by the two-year World         Bank-funded project `Reviving Palestinian schools' (2011-2012) and this         impacted directly on         the pedagogical approaches of 28 teacher educators.
The extent to which         this form of         creative pedagogy transferred to Palestinian universities and schools is         currently being         evaluated through a British Academy Research Project (2012-15).The         number of colleagues         worked with between 1996 and 2013 is approximately 1,400.
`This process [...] is helping us as Palestinian academics           in integrating all new creative           pedagogies in teaching and learning in all educational levels         [and] in developing the           educational sector in Palestine.'
(Dr Hala Al-Yamany, University of Bethlehem, Palestine)        An invitation to join the Finnish multi-partnership, EU-funded,         Grundtvig Project `Dramaway'         in 2002 led to the pre-text approach being taken up in Spain in 2002.
Owens subsequently         started long-term work with two of the key social participatory theatres         in Catalunya, Theatre         Patothom, Barcelona (2002-2013) and La Neveva, Girona (2007-2013), and,         more recently,         in Lorca with Euroacion (2011) and the University of Girona (2013).
Specific impact has been         on the adopted use of pre-text approaches by these two companies and,         since 2008,         approximately 400 professionals working in education and social work.
The practical use of         the approach by professionals in the social sector led to the         publication in Spanish of the pre-         texts Mapas Teatales (2011), edited by the artistic director of         Theatre Pa'tothom.
The         number of professionals engaged over 10 years is approximately 900.
`... his work with pre-text drama has been very present in           Catalonia with a strong influence           over drama workers.
Many professionals are using his pre-text drama in           Spain nowadays.'
(David Martinez, Artistic Director, La Nave Va Theatre, Girona, Spain)        The research has also been extended in the period 2007-2013, via the         collaborative work         with the Theatre Academy Finland, to Sweden, where `Draamakompassen' was         published in         2007 and Owens' was involved in direct work with some 230 professionals,         as well as         Lithuania in 2008 (Draama Darbi) and Estonia in 2013, where work has         benefited 300         professionals.
The development of this involved keynotes and courses run         by Owens in         Sweden (2008, 2009, 2011, 2013), and Estonia (2010, 2011, 2012).
`...Owens' has been involved in our long-term efforts to build           academic research in the           Swedish drama field...this collaboration has proven to be of great           value and truly inspiring for           us.'
(Eva &#214;sterlind, University of Stockholm)       `The role of Allan Owens has been to expand pre-text based process           drama method in           Estonia, to introduce the pedagogical, cultural and political theory           that informs it.'
(Katrin Nielsen, Viljandi Culture Academy, Estonia)
