Economic benefits from the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas         fields (Primary Impact)     Pathway: The fundamental and applied research on industry data       sets, often undertaken closely       with the sponsor companies, has provided case histories that have had a       direct impact upon       commercial decision makers in multi-national companies operating in the       North Sea.
Three such       examples are given here:            Applied research by Underhill (encapsulated in output [4], Section 3)         demonstrated the         viability of, and formed the basis for, a successful bid in 2003 by         Xcite Energy Ltd (UK) to         produce the Bentley oil Field.
That this bid was underpinned by the         Edinburgh research can         be confirmed by the Chief Operating Officer [A].
The first well         was drilled in December 2007         - January 2008 and since then Xcite has continued to develop the site.
The most recent         drilling programme, pre-production wells 9/3b-7 and 7Z (cost ~&#163;10         million each), began in         2011 and concluded in September 2012, having flowed for 68 days,         demonstrating that the         viscous and heavy oil is movable, as described on the Xcite website [B].
The Scram Discovery was first made in the Southern North Sea in 1967         but lay dormant         primarily because the Upper Permian Zechstein Group carbonate reservoir         was considered         anomalous.
The applied research by Underhill's group (encapsulated in         output [6], Section         3) led directly to Tullow Oil plc (Rep. Ireland) investigating (2007         onwards) the viability of         developing the discovery, as can be corroborated by the then Southern         North Sea         Exploration manager [C].
High flow rates resulted from the         optimal exploitation of newly         interpreted fracture networks derived from 3D seismic methods and this         led to Tullow         bringing the field &#8212; now rechristened the Wissey gas field &#8212; on stream         in August 2008 [D].
The discovery of carbon dioxide in UKCS license block 49/30 was         initially treated as an         exploration failure, christened Fizzy because of its gas composition.
The discovery lay         dormant, passing from one operator to another until it was eventually         relinquished by Tullow         in 2008.
However, Tullow acted on the implications of Underhill's         research (encapsulated in         output [5], Section 3) that such sites could act as carbon storage         opportunities and         successfully re-applied for the block in the recent 27th licensing round         (October 2012)         [C,E].
Significance and reach:            Independent trade sources confirm that over the period 2011 - 2012         47,000 barrels of oil         (value ~$4.7M) were produced at the Bentley Oil Field [F].
The         field is now estimated to         contain some 900M barrels of oil in-place, as stated in Xcite reports [B,G].
Xcite have         confirmed that the "Net Present Value after tax for Bentley Field is           $2.2billion on a 2P basis"         [G].
The field continues to be developed by Xcite, including acquisition         of licenses over         Blocks 9/4, 9/9f, 9/8b in the UK 27th Offshore Licensing         Round (October 2012) [E].

Training of industry-based practitioners (Secondary Impact)     Pathway, significance and reach: The concepts of maximum flooding       surfaces are now widely       used by oil and gas company geologists in a wide range of tectonic and       stratigraphic settings       across the world.
Training in these research-derived methods occurs       through both badged courses       and consultancy work.
The Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain       (PESGB) run an       industry-based course on an 18-month cycle, including 5 times over the       period 2008 - 2013, with a       total of 475 oil company employee attendees over that time [H].
Other professional societies that       have run badged courses and workshops include the European Association of       Geoscientists and       Engineers (EAGE), Geological Society of London, and the American       Association of Petroleum       Geologists (AAPG), who recognised the value of Underhill's contribution to       geological training by       their Murray Distinguished Educator Award in May 2013 [I].
