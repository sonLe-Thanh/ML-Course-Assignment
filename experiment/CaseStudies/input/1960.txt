     The research has been disseminated by two principle means: workshops and       practitioner articles.
A series of practical workshops were run by Francis-Smythe and her team       over the period 2006-2008       for a number of public and private sector organisations:            April 2006 for Midlands Excellence as part of a `Time to Lead' event         (22 delegates).
July 2007 for Worcester City Council as part of a Work Life Balance         Conference         (approximately 150 delegates).
October 2007 for Worcestershire's Jobcentre Plus Annual Conference         (approximately 100         delegates).
August 2008 for Southco (a Worcester-based global manufacturing         organisation) as part of         their `Learning at Work' day (approximately 100 delegates).
These workshops broadly followed the same format; they all included the       delivery of a       presentation on the concepts of Time Personality and Temporal       Intelligence, as well as interactive       components whereby delegates were invited to:            share the issues and challenges they have faced relating to time;       assess their `time personalities';       reflect on how their time personalities may have predicted their         issues and challenges; and       identify individual solutions and alternative ways of working to         prevent such issues and         challenges arising in the future.
Not only did these workshops disseminate the findings of the research,       they also demonstrated to       delegates how their time personalities can influence their time management       and, subsequently,       their workplace effectiveness.
Testimonials from the workshops demonstrate       the on-going impact       of the research both for individuals and organisations.
For example, the       Manager of Network and       Event Services for Midlands Excellence has noted: "Leaders and         managers from West Midlands         based organisations have gained much value from sharing in some of Jan's         expertise and         research, which has allowed them to develop individually, but also to         take valuable knowledge         back into the business/workplace" (Source A).
In addition to the workshops, a practical article raising leaders'       awareness of the emerging       construct Temporal Intelligence was published in LT Focus; the       practitioner magazine produced by       the highly regarded Leadership Trust organisation (Source B).
However, whilst the workshops and the Leadership Trust article enabled       wide and varied       dissemination of the research to non-academic audiences, the dissemination       that led to the       greatest impact in terms of both reach and significance, was an article       published in Professional       Manager; a practical publication in a major management practitioner       journal advising people on       specific ways to enhance their management of time.
This article reached       approximately 50,000       readers (Source C).
Dr Francis-Smythe received considerable direct feedback on the article       from practitioners.
Readers' commented on how the article had encouraged them to reflect on       their own workplace       effectiveness and on the relationship between time management and       workplace stress.
One       reader noted: "We provide specialist management consultancy to large         government departments         and blue chip corporates.
While we are all extremely successful in         managing time, I have been         aware for some time that people do have different `time personalities'         as you call it.
This can lead         to stress, both between us and within project teams."
Some readers       asked for more information       regarding how the research could be further applied in specific workplace       environments.
One       reader, working in the area of talent management, requested advice       regarding "how I could apply         your research further into my customer group in a large multi-national".
Some readers asked if they       could directly participate in the time personality research in order to       diagnose, and receive       feedback on, their own time personalities.
As one reader noted: "As a         manager for an engineering         consultancy I feel I have quite good time management skills but it would         be interesting to get some         feedback!"

In addition, this article reached the Personal Development and Management       Development       Trainer at Reed Learning (formerly Reed Training).
Reed Learning is one of       the UK's leading       providers of training and development services.
Reed Learning has been       delivering learning       services since 1995, during which time they have trained over 250,000       people.
With reference to       the article published in January 2010, another article; `Time       Personalities' was posted on Reed's       `Love Learning' blog in February 2010.
Following this blog post, Reed       Learning began to       incorporate the Time Personality research into their Time Management       course.
During the course,       delegates are asked to reflect on their Time Personalities and, in       collaboration with other       psychometric tools, to choose the techniques that most fit their       personality and which they could       adopt to improve their time management and effectiveness in the workplace.
This has helped Reed       Learning to offer an individualised approach to their time management       training, as stated by The       Learning Content Designer at Reed Learning: "It has sparked some         interesting discussions and         has been of great help/comfort to delegates, particularly the idea of         choosing the techniques to         match your personality, rather than having a "one-size-fits-all"         approach to time management."

These courses are run throughout the year across different locations;       approximately three times       per month in London (36 per year), and once every two months in Birmingham       (6 per year).
The       courses, charged at &#163;570 per delegate, are delivered to group sizes       ranging between 3 and 14       delegates.
So, with 42 courses being delivered, between 126 and 588       delegates complete Reed       Learning's Time Management course each year which features       Francis-Smythe's Time Personality       research.
