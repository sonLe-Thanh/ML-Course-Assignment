     Newcastle University research conducted between 1998 and 2000 has       underpinned a change in the way that the EU allocates funds for rural       development and biodiversity conservation.
In the period 2007 to 2013       &#8364;20.3 billion (&#163;17.6 billion) have been allocated towards agri-environment       measures, including measures which promote biodiversity such as the NATURA       2000 measures, [E1].
This represents 48% of global aid spending to       biodiversity in the same period [E1].
This level of spending on       environmental and other measures could not have been possible without the       European wide implementation of modulation which from 2008 to 2013 was       responsible for approximately &#8364;10.45 billion (&#163;8.84 billion) of additional       spending on rural development measures [E2].
In England modulation       helps to fund the Environmental Stewardship scheme, the entry level of       which is open to all farmers.
Modulation supports additional spending on       similar rural development programmes in the rest of the UK and across an       additional 14 EU countries.
Research carried out on behalf of the EU [E4]       has recognised that the overall "impacts of modulation on the         environment are positive for all environmental parameters" and that       "these positive impacts are the result of the availability of         additional funds within Pillar 2 and relate to a whole range of measures         across all four Axes".
However, it is acknowledged that the extent       of these impacts is "hard to quantify beyond general terms" [E4].
Route to impact     From 2000, the Rural Development Regulation (Regulation (EC) 1257/1999)       gave EU states the option of introducing a process called `modulation'       into how they spent their CAP budgets.
Modulation works by reducing the       direct payments made to farmers under Pillar 1 of the CAP (used to       subsidise agricultural production), with some of the savings being       transferred to Pillar 2 of the CAP where it pays for measures to support       environmental management and rural development.
The research on the impacts of modulation produced by Newcastle       University was promoted through direct interaction with policy makers at a       UK cabinet level.
Ward was seconded to the Prime Minister's         Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) in the Cabinet Office to       review rural and agricultural policy and to advise the Prime Minister and       other key ministers directly on how the government should pursue CAP       reform in the UK.
This advocacy convinced the UK Government to take a lead       in switching hundreds of millions of pounds from production subsidies to       environmental payments.
This decision had required a U-turn from the then       Agriculture Minister, who in February 1999, prior to Ward's secondment to       the PIU, had declared that the UK was `not minded' to introduce modulation       (House of Commons Agriculture Committee 1999, para.114).
The influence of       Newcastle University research is reflected in the following quotes from       the then Minister of Agriculture "I remain grateful for the research         undertaken by Newcastle University's Centre for Rural Economy on the         potential impacts on environmental management and rural development of a         policy of modulation of CAP payments.
Newcastle University were pioneers         of this development in the late 1990's.
The research that was undertaken         by Professor Philip Lowe and Dr Neil Ward helped inform policy within         the Ministry of Agriculture and later on within Government more         generally" [E7].
The adoption of modulation "... has led         to a significant restructuring of the CAP.
As a reform it is far more         sustainable than the regime it came to replace.
That's quite an         achievement but I don't think we would have got there without being able         to back our point up with the evidence and arguments provided by         Newcastle University's early research."
[E7]     The UK's early and voluntary adoption of modulation, based on the       findings of Newcastle University's research, set a new and more radical       course for Europe in redirecting the financing of the CAP during       subsequent reforms, opening much wider opportunities for the CAP to       support environmental and rural development objectives which would lead to       substantially increased budgets (releasing additional funds in excess of       &#8364;10 billion, &#163;8.46 billion) for environmental management and rural       development through the period between 2005 and 2013.
The broader impacts       of the Newcastle University research is illustrated by the following       quotes from the then Agriculture Minister and a senior figure in the rural       policy community "The Newcastle University research was invaluable in         informal meetings with other Agricultural Ministers in helping convince         them that modulation, and indeed the very existence of a second pillar,         was a viable way forward for the CAP."
[E7]     Newcastle's "...research played a highly influential role in providing         the evidence and rationale for a major shift in the UK Government's         position on modulation and subsequently in adoption of mandatory         modulation by EU member states during reform of the Common Agricultural         Policy.
This was helped by the quality of [Newcastle University's]         connections in the policy community and the effective dissemination and         promotion of its research."
[E8]     The impact in the period 2008 - 2013     The CAP Reforms of 2003 (the Mid-Term Review) stipulated that direct       payments over &#8364;5000 (&#163;4229) to farmers in the EU-15 (the fifteen EU       members states before the accession of 10 new members in 2004) would be       decreased by 3%, 4% and 5% respectively from 2005, 2006, 2007, staying at       5% for the following years.
At a 5% rate, modulation across the EU-15 led       to an annual transfer of about &#8364;1.2 billion (&#163;1.02 billion) (in current       prices) [E2] from the production subsidies to rural development and       environmental schemes.
From 2010 modulation rates increased progressively       to 7%, 8%, 9% and 10% for 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.
This       increase led to a net additional transfer from the first pillar to the       second of &#8364;3.25 billion (&#163;2.75 billion) (2010: &#8364;0.48 billion (&#163;0.41       billion); 2011: &#8364;0.69 billion (&#163;0.52 billion); 2012: &#8364;0.91 billion (&#163;0.77       billion); 2013: &#8364;1.2 billion (&#163;1.02 billion) [E2].
Specific examples of the benefit of increased spending on the environment       include increased bird densities.
A winter survey of seed-eating birds in       two areas of England by the RSPB during winter 2007-2008 found that wild       seed mixture crops supported the highest densities of seed-eating birds E3].
Similarly Baker et al.
(2012) [E5] examined how uptake of the       English Environmental Stewardship scheme links to changes in national       farmland bird populations from 2002-2010, finding evidence for positive       effects on biodiversity of nationally implemented agri-environment       schemes.
A review financed by the Commission of European Communities       (Pol&#225;kov&#225; et al., 2011) [E6] summarised evidence of the impacts on       biodiversity and habitat creation of spending on agri- environment       measures under Pillar 2 of CAP up to 2011 and concluded that "the       biodiversity status of agricultural habitats subject to agri-environment       measures is significantly better than would have been the case if the       policy had not been in place" (Executive Summary pp xxi).
