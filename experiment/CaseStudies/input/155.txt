     The impacts are in healthcare, public awareness, and quality of life.
We       detail how we attracted support to undertake impactful activity with EPG,       how the media has presented our work, and the positive effect it has had       on some clients.
Its use has been seen in three main clinical areas:     a. speech disorders in children with cleft palate, in cleft palate       centres in UK and Scandinavia;     b. speech disorders in children with hearing impairment, in Cornwall, as       part of a pre-RCT;     c. speech disorders in children, with no known aetiology ("phonological       disorders").

Charitable Funding Awards to provide clinical treatment with EPG       Project #1 - Cleftnet.
The support from various charities (&#163;20k         in 2008-2012) maintained a national Cleftnet network linking EPG         therapists in the cleft palate centres in the UK and linking to QMU for         expert support for their caseloads.
Project #2 - Baily Thomas.
This support (&#163;37k in 2008-2010, for         "Enhancing Speech Intelligibility in Children and Young People with Down         syndrome") offered EPG therapy to 18 children who had volunteered for an         MRC research project but had been allocated as controls for the         research, therefore receiving either no treatment or conventional         treatment.
This donation was "to aid the care and relief of those         affected by learning disability".
In all, the MRC research project had         given EPG therapy to 8 children.
We have generally not kept records of         parental testimony nor taken quality of life scores as outcome measures,         but we have speech analysis scores that show improved speech as evidence         of impact.
Evidence of impact on public awareness and quality of life of         participants is provided by the Client D testimonial (below) from press         coverage (06/12).
Project #3 - Nuffield.
This award of &#163;147k, from April 2012-May         2014, ("Improving the speech communication abilities of children with         Down's syndrome: A new model of service delivery using         electropalatography") was mainly for therapy.
A component of applied         research is also included, primarily to design therapy protocols that         can be implemented by learning assistants in schools and to assess the         level of improvement in speech.
Treatment of 17 children is on-going.
This award also attracted press and TV reports, quoting testimonials         (04/13).
The City of Edinburgh Council's Support to Children and Young         People unit was very supportive in preparation and has provided the         liaison, resourcing and support for the classroom assistants and         teachers involved.

Uptake of training in EPG by therapists       NHS Education Scotland.
A CSMEN award (&#163;5k) was made during the         census period to support WOOD to train therapists in EPG and to support         a small clinical caseload of 3 children in Edinburgh, East Lothian and         West Lothian.
The actual intervention started after 31 July, so is         detailed in our impact template as future activity.
The Clinical Lead         Community Services will corroborate the need for such treatment and         associated training for NHS staff.
EPG workshops (QMU).
Whole day workshops (2010, 2011, 2012) have         attracted around 20 clinicians.
(The 2013 workshop is a UTI workshop,         associated with Ultrafest VI.)
EPG workshops (elsewhere).
Workshops for clinicians have been         run at other locations when QMU staff have been invited and funded to         attend.
This shows an on-going demand from professional organisations         for training and discussion of clinicians.
Notable events:                2008 Stockholm, Sweden, EPG workshop (WRENCH, CLELAND);         2009 Salzburg, Austria, EPG workshop (WRENCH);         2012 Osaka, Japan, EPG symposium (WRENCH);         2012 London, England, ASLTIP (Association of SLTs in Independent           Practice) EPG &amp; Ultrasound workshop (WRENCH, CLELAND);         2013 Link&#246;ping, Sweden, EPG workshop (WRENCH).

NHS trials         Though EPG is not routinely available, small-scale implementations of         therapy associated with research in particular caseloads typically show         improvements to speech.
4.
Cleftnet UK         Prior to her departure in 2009, Gibbon coordinated a network of all 14         NHS cleft-palate centres in the UK, offering EPG in all locations to a         small trial caseload.
5.
Cornwall trial         There was a pre-RCT trial in Cornwall (2011-2013) of EPG therapy for         children with severe and profound hearing impairment.
It was supported         by a Research for Patient Benefit grant (&#163;250k) from the National         Institute of Health Research.
Again, this was a mixed research/impact         activity, providing EPG therapy and evaluating the feasibility of a full         RCT leading to improvements to delivery in non-academic contexts.
Improvements in children's speech performance were observed and         reported, providing evidence of impact.
6.
Testimonials and public awareness via press coverage following EPG           therapy       Client A. EPG therapy (and latterly some that was         ultrasound-based) was given to a 10-year-old girl fitted in infancy with         a cochlear implant, who had been referred by a CASL audiologist (White).
Aged 15, A was keen for her testimonial to be featured in the press and         in other publicity, because, in her words: "The EPG helped me relearn           how to speak.
I didn't realise what I was doing wrong before but           seeing the shapes my tongue made on a computer screen made it easy for           me to learn how to change my words.
People understand me so much           better now and I don't have to repeat what I say nearly so much.
And           having better speech gave me the confidence to be a speaker at a           conference for parents of deaf babies.
I wanted to show how well their           children could do when they grow up.
Lots of the mums and dads were so           moved they cried - even my mum."
The article concludes that Client         A: "now wants more deaf people to benefit from the same techniques           that helped her.
"I'm the only one of all my deaf friends who has had           EPG and that's not fair.
Everyone should have an equal chance to           improve their speech," she said."
(14/05/11)       Clients B and C, Parent, Classroom Assistant.
After 3 months of         the Nuffield project, a classroom assistant said: "It's been very           positive... [B, age 11] knows exactly how to produce sounds because           she's seeing them on a screen and she really enjoys using the palate."
"[C]... was also benefitting from the trial, with nine-year-old [X]           also set to get on board."
Additionally, B's mother said: "I           think EPG has made her think about the sounds she's producing much           more.
The screen makes it easier to imagine the sounds and picture           them, and I think the whole experience has just given her more           confidence."
(09/04/13) (See also press coverage 05/02/13,         05/02/13.)
Client D. D (aged 8) was selected to meet H.M. the Queen when         she opened QMU's new campus in 2008.
In April 2012, she voluntarily         contacted the BBC in response to a call for stories to illustrate         "meeting the Queen" as part of the Diamond Jubilee.
In 2012, aged 12,         she reminisced:         "The Queen watched me doing speech therapy.
She was in a room next           door, looking through a window.
I was using an electronic palate,           which showed different patterns on the screen when I made different           sounds.
I met the Queen afterwards.
I was excited, because she's a           character in one of my favourite books - The BFG by Roald Dahl.
I told           my mum I would say 'Hello, your Majister', like the BFG, but my mum           said I shouldn't.
So I just said, 'Hello, Your Majesty'.
The Queen           asked me if I found it interesting working with the electronic palate.
I said 'Yes, I did, your Majesty'."

Un-met demand for EPG therapy from clinician workshops,           self-referrals, etc.
The local model of integrating EPG into available care pathways, devised         in collaboration with local SLT services, concentrates on clinical         activity being targeted towards specific client groups, in small,         manageable cohorts.
We therefore discourage unsolicited referrals to QMU         for EPG therapy.
Even so, from 2008-2012 WOOD's records confirm we         received 15 enquiries for therapy coming from word-of-mouth contacts of         research participants.
Following the February 2013 press stories about         EPG, WOOD received 12 requests for therapy from clinicians and the         general public.
In association with calls for participants in         therapeutic case studies, we receive many more referrals than we can         satisfy.
A brief 2008 call to SLTs for 2 cases to be the basis of a book         chapter illustrating the methods and results of EPG therapy (Gibbon and         WOOD, 2010) quickly drew 6 referrals.
The CSMEN award (2013) to treat 3         children attracted 24 new referrals from local SLTs.
After EPG workshops         for about 6 SLTs, we predict a dozen or so referrals.
As we         unfortunately lack the resources and mandate to provide a therapeutic         pathway of care and EPG is not yet available on the NHS, we have been         careful not to create unmet demand.
Nevertheless, the amount of pent-up         demand revealed by spontaneous enquiries demonstrates impact in a way         that also illustrates some of the ethical difficulties in aiming for         impact in the first place.
