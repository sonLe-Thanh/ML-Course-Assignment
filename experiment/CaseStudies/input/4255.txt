     The impact of David Robb's research can be measured particularly with his       recent 1848 `Liederlexikon' project, which has been used by teachers       within political education in Germany.
A wider public interest in Robb's research dates back to his monograph on       Wenzel and Mensching which was launched at the Leipzig Book Fair by the       commercial publisher Ch.
Links in March 1998 (references 1 and 2).
The       many reviews included one in the Deutsche Lehrerzeitung (Teachers'       Paper), which praised Robb's raising of the profile of East German       identity, which was perceived as being marginalised by the mainstream       media (reference 3).
Further impact was shown by the inclusion of his       essay as a `special feature' of Wenzel and Mensching's DVD Latest from         the Da-         Da-R, which had its international release in 2009 (reference 4).
Robb's second book Protest Song (2007) was widely commended for       increasing awareness of the German political song phenomenon in the       English speaking world, for example in the Times Literary Supplement       (7 March 2008) and in World Music, which described it as `simply       peerless [...] indisputably the best account on the subject in English       [...] a wonderful book' (27 May 2008, reference 5).
Further impact was       demonstrated by Robb's radio interview on `PRI's The World' for a       documentary `Protest Songs' on 9 November 2009 for the 20th anniversary of       the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Robb's impact can best be measured with regard to his current on-line       project `Songs of the 1848 Revolution' (with Eckhard John).
The interest       in their work is documented by the positive feedback in emails from people       who use their 1848 website in their work, for example, Christian Souchon       who used an excerpt from their work on his homepage `Jakobite Songs'       (reference 6) and Bernd Hans G&#246;hrig who requested permission to reprint       one of their commentaries in his magazine Querblick (reference 7).
Robb's research has been given a prestigious public platform at the       Rudolstadt Folk Festival, the largest festival of its kind in Germany.
On       3 July 2010 he presented his work on Burns' `For a' that' within a       colloquium led by cabaret artist Dieter Beckert " for the 200th       anniversary of the birth of the song's translator Ferdinand Freiligrath.
The Folker journalist Reinhard St&#228;nder wrote how the show cast a       new light on the relationship between German and Scottish folk music       (reference 2).
Beckert wrote how the revelation of this connection       inspired his new cabaret production featuring the character Findlater       based on a Scottish Earl, resident in Saxony in the Romantic period.
It       also resulted in an annual Burns Supper in the Albrechtsburg Castle       (reference 8).
Robb's workshop, `Historical Political Songs in the 21st Century', took       place at the Rudolstadt Festival on 7 July 2013.
He and John presented       their research in front of a 50-strong audience comprising teachers       (Music, History, Politics or German), social workers, musicians,       translators and journalists.
This was followed by a discussion entitled       `New Perspectives for School and Political Education' featuring guests       from the worlds of folk music (J&#252;rgen Wolff), political song (Heinz Ratz),       the media (Michael Kleff) and the Centre for Political Education of       Thuringia (Peter Reif- Spirek).
22 participants filled in questionnaires       (reference 9) and discussed how the research could be used in their       professions (reference 10).
The questions were:            What relationship do you have to songs of the 1848 Revolution and how         did you come across the theme?
Why does a theme such as this belong to a folk festival?
Can you use the research results presented here in your own work?
If         so, in what area?
Have these research results cast a new light on the subject?
If so, in         what respect?
Summary of questionnaire answers:     Haupert and Kr&#246;ger (reference 9) and Melchior (reference 10) indicated       they already used the `Liederlexikon' in school teaching.
Several other       teachers said they would use it.
It was praised as a useful resource for:            the origins of songs and their process of transformation, for example,         in the adaptations and parodies (Brock).
Meijer (translator, singer)         stated that the research illustrated how `the path a song takes is just         as important as the song itself'.
B&#252;lzingsl&#246;wen commended the updating         of tradition through the discovery of new composers.
political education classes dealing with Neo-Nazism and nationalism         (Melchior), the definition of freedom (B&#228;rtel), or in talking through         historical c ontexts (D&#246;rnenburg).
the repertoires of singers and choirs         (von B&#252;ltzingsl&#246;wen, D&#246;rnenburg, Nagel, Vierheilig)       journalistic and media work: Lehn for his book on the GDR folk scene;         Nagel for his articles for the German Wikipedia; Engelle in an article         he is currently writing for Folker.
