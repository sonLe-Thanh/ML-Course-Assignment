     On the strength of their research expertise in the media and public       protection, in 2010, Gaber and       Silverman were appointed to the Government's Munro Review of Child         Protection.
Community       Care magazine wrote that, "A key task of Professor Eileen Munro's review       of child protection is to       examine the public perception of social workers and the media coverage of       the profession."
Gaber       undertook a research project into how the police and council social       services in Sheffield and       Lincolnshire handled a sensitive child protection issue that at the time       had attracted a great deal of       media coverage.
The confidential report, Crisis Media and         Communications Management in Social         Work: a case study, was submitted to the Inquiry in February 2011.
The final report &#8212; The Munro Review of Child Protection: A         child-centred system &#8212; received       widespread approbation on its publication by the Department of Education       in November 2011.
Only       one of its 14 principal recommendations was rejected.
A recent article in       the British Journal of         Social Work (Warner J.; `Heads Must Roll'?
Emotional Politics, the       Press and the Death of Baby P)       noted the importance that Munro gives to the issue of media coverage.
In The         Munro Review of         Child Protection (Munro, 2011), the relationship between social work       and the media receives a       significant amount of attention (see pp.121-7).
Munro explicitly       highlights the need for politicians       and other public figures to avoid `knee-jerk reactions or conclusions' and       for `actions to be       thoughtfully reviewed' This reflects an important aspect of Gaber and       Silverman's work.
Following publication of the Review, Gaber and Silverman were asked by       the College of Social       Work to distil their research and experience, into a comprehensive media       training programme for       the College staff and spokespeople for the social work profession around       the country.
They ran       eight workshops for the College throughout 2012.
Some 35 social work       practitioners were trained       to undertake both radio and television interviews to explain the varying       demands of social work to a       general lay audience.
The response to the training was overwhelmingly       positive and most of those       trained have appeared on local radio or regional media at some point to       represent the profession.
Further details of this can be obtained from Mark Ivory, Policy and       Communications Manager at       the College of Social Work (see below).
Drugs Policy     Silverman's book, Crime, Policy and the Media, was widely read in       policymaking circles and led to       an invitation to give evidence to the UK Drug Policy Commission (UKDPC),       set up to examine the       case for a fresh approach to drugs policy.
He was interviewed by the UKDPC       chief executive,       Roger Howard (June 12, 2012) about the likely media response to any form       of legalisation or       gradual decriminalisation of certain drugs in the UK.
Silverman also took       part in a select round-table       (11 October 2012) and his contribution helped fine-tune the UKDPC's final       report `A Fresh         Approach to Drugs', published that month and well publicised in the       media.
The report was       endorsed by the Commons Home Affairs Committee which also advocates an       evidence-based       approach to drugs strategy.
Silverman's research is referenced in Daly, M., and Sampson, S. (2012) Narcomania:         A Journey         Through Britain's Drug World, London: Heinemann, pp.288-90 (for       which he was interviewed).
Furthermore his research/media expertise was used by DrugScope when       compiling `The Media         Guide to Drugs' (2011).
Silverman's research also underpinned two drugs policy debates organised       by him and held at       Kings College, London on March 30 and April 6, 2011, under the title, "A       Ceasefire in the War on       Drugs?"
Amongst the high profile speakers were the Colombian Ambassador to       the UK, His       Excellency Mauricio Rodriguez Munera, and the Mail on Sunday       columnist, Peter Hitchens.
The       Ambassador has since been prominent in policy discussions in Latin America       around drug       decriminalisation.
The former Home Secretary, David Blunkett, had to pull       out from speaking at the       last moment because of House of Commons business.
The event was attended       by the chief       executive of the UK Drug Policy Commission, Roger Howard, and contributed       towards the       commission's final report of December 2012.
Mental Health Issues and the Media     Professor Gaber was appointed to the inquiry that examined the care and       treatment of Michael       Stone who had earlier been convicted of the killings of Lin and Megan       Russell.
His role was to       advise on the role played by the media in the events leading up to Stone's       arrest and conviction.
The Inquiry reported in 2006.
Robert Francis QC (Chair of the recent       inquiry into Mid-Staffordshire       Hospital) can be contacted for further information about Gaber's       contribution to the Inquiry.
In       addition, Gaber's reputation in this field led him to being asked by the       Mental Health Alliance to       assist in their campaigning around the changes to the Mental Health Bill       which was going through       Parliament between 2006 and 2008.
This he did by devising and running       media training       programmes for members of the Alliance and addressing a seminar of mental       health workers       convened by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health in 2007.
