     Pathways to impact       The above articles by Sandercock et al.
have been cited over 1250 times       and together with the       Cochrane reviews have been cited in the stroke guidelines of the Royal       College of Physicians, and       the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence stroke guidelines in       the UK, the European       Stroke Organisation, the American Stroke Association, Canadian Best       Practice Guidelines, and       Singaporean, Australian and New Zealand national guidelines.
Sandercock       has given lectures and       conference presentations on these findings in 18 different countries       (1997-2013).
Impact on public policy       Aspirin is now strongly recommended, and high-dose heparin is `not       recommended', for routine       use as part of standard treatment for acute ischaemic stroke worldwide in       UK [5.1], European [5.2],       North American [5.3] and Australasian [5.4] guidelines.
Impact on clinical practice       The guideline statements have led to implementation of appropriate health       policy and quality       improvement and audit programmes.
In the UK, the administration of aspirin       within 24 hours is a       quality standard against which services are judged nationwide.
The       National Stroke Strategies in       England and Scotland state that aspirin should be administered as soon as       possible after onset of       stroke.
The UK-wide National Sentinel Audit has set the proportion of       patients with acute stroke       started on aspirin within 48 hours of stroke onset as one of its nine key       quality indicators.
A 2010       National Sentinel Audit of Stroke in England showed that 92% of patients       received aspirin within 48       hours (up from 65% in 2001) [5.5], and in Scotland in 2010, 73% of       ischaemic stroke patients were       prescribed aspirin by one day after admission (up from 41% in 2005) [5.6].
As regards heparin use,       the evidence of lack of benefit and the risks of significant bleeding with       anticoagulants have led to       a decline in the use of heparin.
While some local registry data have shown       a decline in heparin       use, the only nationwide quality improvement effort on heparin has been in       Sweden.
The Swedish       Riks-Stroke quality improvement programme clearly demonstrates a dramatic       decline in the use of       full-dose heparin in acute stroke, from 7.5% in 2001 to 1.6% in 2008       [5.7]; quality improvement       programmes in other countries have yet to focus on efforts to minimise the       unnecessary use of       heparin and other anticoagulants in stroke.
Impact on health       Warlow estimated that in a population of 1 million people, routine use of       two weeks aspirin therapy       for all eligible stroke patients would avoid 15 deaths and result in 29       more people being alive and       independent each year [3.6].
For the UK population of 62 million, this       would translate to 930 fewer       deaths each year and 1800 more people alive and independent.
The avoidance       of heparin likewise       will reduce the number of treatment-related disabling and fatal cerebral       haemorrhages.
Impact on the economy       In the UK, the estimated cost to health and social services of a dependent       stroke survivor is       &#163;11,292, and the annual cost of an independent survivor &#163;876; the       avoidance of post-stroke       dependency therefore can save the UK health care system substantial       amounts.
Warlow estimated       that the 2008 treatment cost per patient with acute stroke of the two-week       treatment course with       aspirin was &#163;0.50, the annual cost of treating all eligible patients in a       population of 1 million was       &#163;955, the cost per death avoided was &#163;62.50, and the cost per death or       disability avoided was       &#163;33.50 [3.6].
Routine use of aspirin in acute stroke is therefore highly       cost-effective.
Maximising global impact       The World Stroke Organisation (Sandercock is a member of the Board of       Directors) established       the World Stroke Academy (Sandercock is a member of the Steering       Committee) [5.8], which       seeks to improve stroke education on a global scale.
It has a programme of       educational events       that is being delivered in several countries in Europe (Greece, Hungary),       but also in China (2006),       South Africa (2006), Vietnam (2009) [5.9], Korea (2010), Brazil (2012) and       West Africa (2013;       jointly with the European Federation of Neurological Sciences) to       implement affordable evidence-       based stroke care that includes implementing aspirin and avoiding heparin.
