     Impacts on health and welfare:     New clinical interventions, with improved outcome for patients:     1.
Improved diagnostic technology, predicting risk of VF with           increased accuracy (clinically           appplied conduction assay): Clinical trials lead by Grace and       Richard Saumarez (Honorary       Member, Depts.
Engineering and Medicine: 1998-2008) from 1998 to 2002       demonstrated that their       observations in mice translated to human hearts (see Sections 2.1, 2.2).
This allowed development       of a new diagnostic technology which has been trialled with         patients, yielding a definite         outcome: In a trial of 179 patients, 156 patients tested negative       and 23 tested positive; the latter,       being identified as at high-risk, were fitted with an ICD.
9 of these 23       patients (39%) developed an       event (6 in the period of observation leading in 2008 to the publication       of Ref.
5, Section 3, a       further 3 since then), compared to 3% (4 out of 156) of the patients that       tested negative.
Thus,       during the eligible impact period three lives were saved in this       relatively small clinical trial of 179       patients because they had been fitted with an ICD due to identified high       risk, with the positive       predictive value of the new assay (0.38) being at least three-fold that of       conventional assessments       (0.106) (Ref.
5, Section 3).
In addition, the quality of life of 152       patients who were identified as not       being at risk improved as they were strongly reassured that they need not       live in fear of SCD and       were also spared the unnecessary implantation of an ICD.

Improved therapeutic intervention combating VF with fewer side           effects (subcutaneous           ICD): A diagnostic assay is only of value if an effective       therapeutic intervention exists for the       diagnosed condition.
The development of the propagation assay with       improved risk stratification by       Grace and Huang provided a strong incentive for the clinical work of Grace       and colleagues to       develop a safer, improved ICD device.
The development of this, the       subcutaneous ICD (SICD),       progressed effectively through all stages of clinical development also       fulfilling stringent       international regulatory assessment and has been implanted in more than       2500 patients in 16       countries world-wide (Refs 1,3 &amp; 4, Section 5).
Impacts on commerce:     Conduction assay:     A provisional patent application has been filed by Grace in the United       States (`Systems for       assessing risk of sudden cardiac death, and related methods of use';       Application Number       61/860,854).
The assay is being commercialised through a spin-out company,       Electus Medical Inc       (EIN assigned: 46-3330185) founded by Grace, Huang, Van De Sluis and       Wigdahl (the latter two       are respectively US- and UK-based entrepreneurs).
The company is in the       advanced fund-raising       stage.
The assay provides a powerful basis for a systems approach to human       disease (Grace AA, Roden       DM.
(2012): Systems Biology and Cardiac Arrhythmias.
Lancet 380:1498-508)       and Illumina Inc.       have entered into an agreement to conduct whole genome analysis comparing       patients with high       and low risk characteristics, with the objective to extend personalised       approaches to the       identification of those at risk of SCD to the largest possible population       (Ref.
2, Letter of support       from Illumina, Section 5).
SICD:     The SICD technology has been commercialised by Cameron Health Inc, which       in 2012 were       acquired (having hit key milestones) by Boston Scientific for $1.35       billion (ca &#163;870 million).
They       have to date sold 2500 SICDs into 16 countries generating revenues of       approximately $50M (ca       &#163;32M) (Ref.
1, Section 5).
Impacts on practitioners and services:     Influence on professional standards and guidelines     The SICD has received approval by the FDA in September 2012 (Ref.
3,       Section 5), and a positive       guidance from NICE in April 2013 (Ref.
4, Section 5).
Grace serves as a Member of the MHRA Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Renal,       Respiratory and Allergy       Expert Advisory Group of the Commission on Human Medicines (2006-present;       Ref.
5, Section 5)       and the Cardiovascular Specialist Advisory Group of the European Medicines       Agency (EMA; 2010-present;       Ref.
6, Section 5).
This contribution is informed by the body of work       described in Section 2.
Influence on training and subsequent work of practitioners     Implantation of the SICD has a rapid learning curve but training has       facilitated this process.
Grace       completed the first permanent implants in the Netherlands (02.2009,       Amsterdam), the United       Kingdom (02.2009, Birmingham) and Germany (06.2010, M&#252;nster) with       subsequent cases then       completed by local physicians under his immediate supervision.
Since 2009       numerous UK-based       doctors (e.g.
Lambiase (London), Barr (Birmingham), Till (London) etc.)
attended SICD implants at       Papworth to facilitate skill transfer.
An animated video of an       implantation based on movies made at       Papworth in which Grace demonstrated the technique is one of the main       tools for training used       worldwide (Ref.
7, Section 5).
Impacts on society, culture and creativity:     The benefits to heart patients arising from the research described in       Section 2 has been brought to       the attention of the public through press coverage, including BBC News,       the Daily Telegraph, the       Daily Mail (Refs 8-10, Section 5), as well as internationally renowned       medical press such as the       Lancet.
It has been featured on YouTube (143 views between 23/5/13 and       31/7/13; Ref.
11,       Section 5), in an Expert ConsultBook (Ref.
12, Section 5), and by       medical webpages.
Through the       newspaper articles alone, 1.5 million people have been informed of the       research (based on their       traffic figures).
