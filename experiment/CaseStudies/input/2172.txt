     The research has informed the direction and focus of a parliamentary       inquiry, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Speech and Language,       chaired by Lord Ramsbotham.
Lord Ramsbotham who led a parliamentary       discussion on the issue on January 29th 2013, also confirmed: "In         addition to his willingness to advise, based on his deep knowledge and         understanding of the subject, he (Law) was able to suggest people from         whom we ought to seek evidence, and topics that we could pursue with         advantage.
We could not have completed our work without him...I can         think of no better example of how research can be used to impact on         policy" (IMP1).
Law presented research evidence to the APPG       and he was identified as a key contributor by the Royal College of Speech       and Language Therapists (RCSLT).
As a result, the underpinning research is       cited multiple times in the final report (IMP2).
The underpinning       research output (2) was also cited in the RCSLT's response to the       House of Commons Education Committee in October 2012, to highlight the       relationship between language delays in children and social disadvantage (IMP3).
The significance of the RCRP and APPG reports are highlighted by Lord       Ramsbotham: "[the reports] were published in time to inform debate on         the Children and Families Bill...if successfully enacted, these will         change the life prospects of many young people, for which there is no         doubt that much of the credit will be due to Professor Law for educating         members of both Houses of Parliament" (IMP1).
The Communication Trust, an umbrella organisation representing more than       40 charities which have speech and language as a focus of their       activities, drew directly on the BCRP evidence to develop an interactive       online database, `What Works'       www.thecommunicationtrust.org.uk/schools/what-works.
The Director of The Communication Trust, said; "This landmark research         is to be welcomed by all those committed to supporting children and         young people who struggle with communication...The Trust and our         Communication Consortium is fully committed to ensuring all those who         work with children and young people with SLCN know how to support them         and have practical tools to do this... We're working with the Department         and the research team to disseminate the resources and outcomes of the         research, including an online database of evidenced interventions to         support children's communication" (IMP4).
The database has also been endorsed by the RCSLT and the organisation's       Chief Executive was quoted in a Communication Trust Newsletter as saying:       "The RCSLT is delighted to have had the opportunity to work with         partners at The Communication Trust to support the evaluation and         development of the What Works website.
At a time when commissioning of         services is becoming more complex, any resource that supports this         process is going to be vital" (IMP5).
Indicating the       significance of the database, RCSLT's Chief Executive has also confirmed       that feedback from the membership (12,201 people in the UK) has been       positive and that "we believe that the database, to which James Law has         been so instrumental, has the potential to make a major contribution to         the development of evidence based services across the UK and beyond"       (IMP6).
The online database aims to support a range of users, including speech       and language therapists (SLTs), commissioners, teachers, practitioners and       other specialist staff and draws together the best available evidence in       an accessible form.
It was launched March 2013 and by the 31st       of July 2013, it had been accessed by a total of 22,700 visitors, with       49,500 page views (IMP7).
4,200 professionals are already       registered to use the database.
The Professional Director of the       Communication Trust states that "The data base is a direct result of         the research and we have worked closely [with Law] to ensure the         research information is accessible to the widest audience while not         losing the robust nature of the content.
The data base has been         important to our sector in providing up to date information on evidenced         interventions that can apply positively on outcomes for children and         young people with speech, language and communication needs...the what         works data base has been incredibly well received across our sector"       (IMP7).
Feedback from users is positive, and comments left by       professionals who have accessed the database include:     "I've already used information I have found on the database to discuss         interventions with parents, schools and speech and language therapists.
I have also found the links to various websites extremely useful and         have recommended some to parents and EY [early years] practitioners.
Thank you!"
(Educational Psychologist)     "[The database] helps influence our service delivery design; supports         advocating to commissioners/our managers for evidence of why we need         Speech Language Therapy" (SLT)     "Although we have always strived to be evidence based as a profession,         in the day to day job of a Speech &amp; Language Therapist, there is not         often time to find this research.
Having a database will be a fantastic         resource when sharing with parents and professionals why we have chosen         an intervention (or why we have chosen NOT to use something!)"
(SLT)         (IMP7).
Significantly the database is funded by the Department of Education       through to 2017 and the moderating group of which Law is a key member will       continue to monitor its quality.
The Communication Trust also cited the research findings as corroborating       evidence in their case for support for an Early Endowment Foundation grant       of &#163;967,780, which is funding a new trial based on their programme, Talk       of the Town (IMP8).
The programme "was developed with the aim         of providing a framework where evidenced approaches and interventions         could be dropped into place within the early years, primary and         secondary school in one community...We were able to take this approach         and the What Works data base as a foundation to seek further funding to         test out the approach more robustly and have recently secured a         significant grant from the Educational Endowment Foundation to run a         randomised control trial on the approach in 64 primary schools across         three areas of the country" (IMP7).
In the `Latest News'       section of their website the Communication Trust noted that: "the         underlying interventions supported as part of Talk of the Town are those         that have been identified through the Better Communication Research         Programme as having good evidence of impact" (IMP9).
The comprehensive review of the relevant research literature in the BCRP       research also produced a `Communication Supporting Classrooms (CsC)       Observation Tool' (with supporting guidance) &#8212; one of few such tools that       are evidence-based (IMP10).
The Tool provides professionals with       the means of profiling the ways in which oral language is supported in       Reception and Key Stage 1 and 2 classrooms.
It has been published on The       Communication Trust website `Resources for Practitioners'.
In summary, the underpinning research has significantly informed and       influenced high level policy makers and professional organisations.
In       particular, the BCRP research was (i) instrumental in placing SLCN on the       political and policy agenda, and (ii) led directly to the introduction of       a database of evidenced interventions, aimed at supporting practitioners,       and a new programme which has produced positive outcomes for schools,       children and young people.
