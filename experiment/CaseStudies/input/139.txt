     Impact on Government policy: CSERGE played a major role in       the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (UK-NEA) [7,8] with Watson,         R. Co-Chair of the Assessment, Bateman leading the UK-NEA       Economics Team, and Burgess (since 2007, now Emeritus) leading the       Cultural Services team with major inputs from Watkinson (since       1976) and Turner.
Indeed the CSERGE SEER project is explicitly       acknowledged as the only external research underpinning the UK-NEA       (see page 2 in [8]).
The UK-NEA in turn became the empirical basis of the       Government's 2011 Natural Environment White Paper [9], an impact       explicitly acknowledged in its Foreword by the then Secretary of State for       Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Caroline Spelman, who stated:     "The National Ecosystem Assessment has given us the evidence to inform         our decisions.
It makes clear that government and society need to         account better for the value of nature, particularly the services and         resources it provides".
The UK-NEA is by far the most cited document in the Natural Environment       White Paper, which has provided a 25 year vision for management of the UK       natural environment and underpins all related policies.
Impact on Government investment appraisals: CSERGE wrote       the UK Government official guidelines for the valuation of the       environmental impacts of investments [4] and these have been used       continuously in official appraisals since their publication in 2002.
Indeed the Environment Agency inform us that these guidelines have been       used as the basis of several hundred appraisals for the on-going Water       Industry Price Review process [10].
These appraisals have determined       decisions regarding several billion pounds of investment in water quality       improvements across the UK.
This guidance has also been used in various       other appraisals covering a variety of environmental impact contexts too       numerous to include here.
In 2007-08 Day was commissioned by the Government to undertake an       assessment of the impact of varying vehicle taxation as a means of       reducing emissions.
His recommendations formed the basis of changes in       taxation announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 2008 Budget [11].
Day also led the 2009 study for the Department for Transport which       led to their incorporation of noise impacts into the policy and practice       regarding the planning of all UK trunk roads [12].
Impact through projects undertaken for the business sector:       The School's work on economic valuation [4] has been used extensively by       the private sector, most particularly by water companies in preparing       submissions to the Ofwat Price Review processes (PR09 and PR14).
As       confirmed by [13], CSERGE researchers designed many of these studies       including: appraisal of the &#163;4 billion Thames Tideway investment       (construction approved for 2012-23); appraisal (in 2008) for Thames Water       Utilities of their &#163;1 billion leakage reduction scheme and in 2011-2013 of       their 5 year &#163;5 billion investment plan for the 2014 (PR14); studies in       2008 and 2012-13 for the United Utilities PR09 and PR14 business plans       entailing investment of around &#163;3 billion; Southern Water PR09 study.
CSERGE also provided peer review of the first Triple Bottom Line Account       for a water company in the UK; and of the Severn Trent Water PR14       submission involving investment expenditure of around &#163;2.5 billion.
In sum       this shows the active involvement of CSERGE in informing over &#163;15 billion       of water sector investment during the present REF period.
Pathways to Impact #1: via direct advice to Government and via           Government Committees: Since 2009 Bateman has given       personal briefings to a variety of senior decision-makers including: The       Defra Secretary of State, Oliver Letwin, MP and Minister of State at the       Cabinet Office; Ministers from H.M. Treasury, Defra, Foreign Office, UK       Trade and Industry, Department for Communities and Local Government, the       Department for Transport, the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the       Department for International Development and the Department for Business,       Innovation and Skills; Members of the House of Lords and House of Commons;       various Departmental Permanent Secretaries, Director-Generals, etc.
Bateman       also gave formal presentations and answered questions at the House of       Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee; also to the       Government Chief Scientist, Sir John Beddington; all Government Chief       Scientific Advisers and held regular meetings with the Defra Chief       Scientist.
He was appointed to the Defra Science Advisory Council       in 2010 and to the H.M. Treasury/Defra Natural Capital Committee       in 2012 (delivering the first State of Natural Capital report to the       Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborn in 2013 [14], and providing       briefings to Owen Paterson, Secretary of State for the Environment).
Pathways to Impact #2: through networking, capacity building and           wider engagement: CSERGE leads the NERC Valuing Nature Network       (http://www.valuing-nature.net)       which has over 1,200 business and policy members across 43 countries, and       undertakes numerous collaborating studies worldwide.
From 2011 it has       co-funded 18 studies with the business and public sectors, including the       joint business/Defra Ecosystem Market Task Force (EMTF).
Bateman       wrote the EMTF Top Ten Opportunities paper [15] which led directly to       their final report recommendations for business opportunities raised       through the delivery of ecosystem services [16].
Finally impact through       raising awareness of ecosystem service related issues has been generated       through more than 50 media interviews including TV appearances for BBC and       ITV news, interviews on national and regional radio, and newspaper       features in The Telegraph, The Times, The Guardian and others.
