Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) uses science       and technology for the defence and security of the UK.
We have helped DSTL       develop new possibilities for analysing the kinds of complex, conflicting       and unstructured data collected in areas of conflict such as Afghanistan       and Iraq.
Our architecture, software prototypes and other research outputs have       enabled DSTL to establish possibilities, identify analytical requirements       and develop internal (confidential) software capability.
Leo Borrett,       Capability Lead at the Counter Terrorism Science and Technology Centre       confirms that: "Through working with City ... MOD's understanding of         its requirements for multi-faceted data visualisation is sufficiently         mature that we are able to start placing external work for software         development to support our intelligence analysis applications.
The         concepts presented ... are now central to our thinking when planning for         future visual interfaces for security critical data analysis."
Our       techniques and prototype visualisation applications are deemed "exploitable"       within DSTL's MAMBA framework for analysis.
(MAMBA is a high-level RAD       (rapid application development) Web Applications framework.)

Transport for London (TfL) is responsible for London's       transport system.
Our visualisation work with the Cycle Delivery Planning       team has enabled them to iteratively develop knowledge of the complexities       of cycling behaviour including when and where cyclists start and end       journeys and how different types of cyclist behave.
This helps TfL provide       bicycles in the right places at the right times for users of the scheme       with broad benefits: "fitness, enjoyment and easy travel for millions,         cleaner air and less traffic for all" (http://bit.ly/19GacTQ).
Our visualisation of the journeys made since the start of the scheme       (over 20 million) detected important, previously unknown patterns,       including responses to station closures and differences in behaviour       between locals and commuters, cyclists in west and east London and males       and females.
For example, female cyclists select quieter parts of the city       for their journeys and are less likely to cross the Thames than male       cyclists.
Our work has been used in the day-to-day running of the scheme and the       information it has uncovered about general cycling patterns supports wider       ambitions and longer term planning.
It is contributing positively to "the         main cross-London physical legacy of the 2012 Olympic Games" on       which &#163;913M will be spent over the next decade (http://bit.ly/19GacTQ).
Peter Wright, Senior Cycling Delivery Planning Manager for TfL, confirms       that this work is being used to (1) inform decision-making: "Your         visualisations have been so useful for getting the message across to         others in TfL and borough planning officers"; "the findings you         have made so far are already influencing some of our decision-making";       (2) inform policy: "your customer classification and analysis of         geographic trends has informed phase 3 of the scheme's expansion into         south-west London and intensification of the existing area"; and (3)       secure the Mayor's vision: "The analysis of gendered motivations and         barriers to using the scheme tell us something about broad cycling         behaviour in London.
This substantial evidence base will help us secure         sustained political and financial support to the ambitious plans set out         in the Mayor's 2013 Vision for Cycling in London".

E.ON is a leading energy provider in the UK, supplying 5       million people with energy.
The New Technology team has significantly       improved its understanding of home energy consumption by working with us       to visualise data collected through a trial of Smart Home technology       installed in 100 houses in Milton Keynes.
They have also established new       and effective ways of visually analysing these kinds of large dynamic data       sets by participating with us in creative visualisation development work.
This has enabled the team to see previously unknown patterns in the Smart       Home data and created the potential for using data more effectively in       their organisation.
In evaluating our visualisation solutions, E.ON data analysts made the       following comments: "very powerful and very useful"; "18 million         data points!
[It] is just impossible for us to get our head around the         real value that is contained in that"; "it gives us a whole new         way of analysing people"; "you could spend months searching the         data for insights but this just points you straight at it"; "the         [Smart Home] project will be better for it".
Our work uncovered previously unknown characteristics in the data, which       persuaded E.ON to use the Smart Home data in their decision-making.
This       is evidenced again in the evaluation: "I wouldn't be able to spot the         problem before I saw this graph"; "I didn't expect to see these         patterns"; "before I thought the trial data could not be used due         to errors and outliers.
The visualisation showed me that you can use         this data and detect different patterns and user behaviour".
These       reactions reflect how our research can provoke a change in approach to       data collection and use.
The visualisations led to the discussion of new       approaches to managing peak demand and the establishment of a new       long-term plan with the objective of flattening peak consumption and       reducing energy production.
Our analytical work led to direct ideas about       offsetting and delaying consumption associated with particular household       devices such as freezers, washers and dryers.

We have worked with Leicestershire County Council (LCC)       to develop techniques and design methods to support decision-making,       improve services and planning and inform citizens.
Andy Robinson, Assistant Chief Executive at LCC reflects: "We're         making better decisions, more informed policy and better use of our data         across the organization ...
The City visualisation work has been         fundamental in helping us do so."
Our techniques were developed with and used by LCC.
Spatial treemaps and       Origins and Destinations (OD) maps were used to interpret commuting       patterns and identify areas for LCC intervention in the Local Transport       Plan (LTP) evidence base.
The LTP is a major report required by the       Transport Act 2000 to encourage effective delivery of high quality       transport planning.
It aims to contribute to economic growth, emission       reduction, quality of life, safety and health.
It also promotes equality       and opportunity and defines the basis for monitoring transport       performance.
Our visualisation contributed directly to LCC's sustainable       transport policy (http://bit.ly/9r98dQ).
Steve Rothwell of LCC's transport policy team confirms that the maps in       the evidence base helped the team understand the data in developing the       plan: "the graphics have been really useful and have helped us to         highlight possible areas of intervention" and that the OD maps       enabled analysts to "genuinely get a sense of commuting patterns in         Leicestershire".
We have also developed and used novel visualisation systems with and for       LCC:     Place Survey (http://bit.ly/gRVKkb)       delivers information to citizens on attitudes to quality of life and       services across the county in more detail than ever before, through a       completely new approach using personalisable, exploratory graphics.
It       also helped to inform an LCC initiative to improve access to services       through closer work between partnerships: "[PlaceSurvey] enabled the         place survey to be easily interpreted so that we could understand issues         for specific demographics within the locality at ward level &#8212; which fed         into the proposal for an integrated model of service delivery".
Green Spaces enabled LCC to run a policy-forming public       consultation to capture (http://bit.ly/18nsPty)       and analyse (http://bit.ly/hhdODT)       the parks and open spaces valued by citizens in response to a government       initiative to safeguard the environment.
Our web-based interface helped       raise awareness of the issues &#8212; with local campaign groups encouraging       participation &#8212; and made the evidence base available to planners and the       public.
The work was commended as "really innovative" by the       council leader in a December 2010 speech to Council where he urged       district councils to use it to "actually look at what people in         Leicestershire are saying".
It has generated local discourse that       has enriched the public consultation (http://bit.ly/1bFckNY).
Harborough district, Melton district and the Fosse Villages Neighbourhood       Plan group use the software for identifying green spaces for protection       through local and neighbourhood plans.
Flood Spaces (http://bit.ly/182NEuy)       is helping LCC build a comprehensive picture of flood risk through public       engagement.
Doing so meets a statutory requirement arising from the Flood       and Water Management Act 2010 to assess the flood risk within the County.
The crowdsourcing that our work facilitated captures local knowledge in       advance of flood incidents.
As many flood incidents go unreported and a       recent flood in Market Harborough caused damage in excess of &#163;1M, this       data is valuable in terms of economic savings and environmental       protection.
Our relationship with LCC has resulted in a wide and pioneering uptake of       visualisation that they describe as supporting "situation-driven data         use".
Visualisation approaches introduced by and developed with City       are being used in numerous departments (Performance; Research; Public       Health; Museums; Climate Action Team) for various purposes (scrutinising       expenses and mileage to make savings and reduce carbon footprint;       considering social fund expenditure by area; analysing museum income).
Performance monitoring of children's centres is an important example       whereby services have improved through more effective use of data: "We         failed [OFSTED] inspections in the past &#8212; but we don't now due to the         data visualisation work" (Robert Radburn, Research and Insight).
The       relationship between LCC and City is reciprocal: the needs of LCC have       inspired many of our transferable designs: e.g., spatial treemaps and OD       maps.
As a result of this knowledge transfer, LCC increasingly adopts visual       approaches to data analysis that use techniques and methods established       through our collaborative work.
For example, the current budget       consultation at LCC will radically change the council as &#163;110M of savings       must be delivered to achieve a 30% cut to the budget.
Visualisation is       being used to inform this consultation: the three key decision-makers       receive visual summaries of consultation responses, updated each hour, on       their desktop.
These details informed the initial savings required for       October 2013 and will be used in subsequent spending reviews.
The work has been funded through short-term consultancy, Research Council       fellowships (in both directions) and research grants (e.g., Department for       Communities and Local Government Timely Information for Citizens).
It has resulted in the establishment of information visualisation at the       core of the organisation's use of data, which is increasingly being used       to inform decisions (http://bit.ly/13Px67X).
This approach is "opening up data to improve policy debates [by]         enabling policy officers to analyse and discuss data on demand" and       resulting in "better conversations internally and better service from         Research and Insight" in an organization that employs 15,000 staff       to support 600,000 residents through a range of services in the context of       significant pressure on its &#163;300M budget.

Willis, one of the world's largest insurance brokers, have       improved their understanding and communication of risk in the insurance       industry through the use of our visualisations.
For example, we furthered       understanding of windstorm risk by presenting complex and uncertain       windstorm model outputs in an accessible and interpretable way.
This work       was long-listed for Lloyd's 2011 Science of Risk Prize and won the       prestigious 2011 IEEE Discovery Exhibition award for industry impact (http://bit.ly/10WuYKs).
Willis use our visualisation approaches to proactively manage risk and       communicate its complexities to their clients at their facilities across       the globe.
For example, Atlas &#8212; a system supporting this activity &#8212;       incorporates work undertaken through a City MSc project.
Willis funded Slingsby's post-doctoral position for two three-year terms       through the Willis Research Network (WRN).
We are core members of what is       the world's largest collaboration between public science and the financial       sector, developed to "improve resilience by integrating first class         science into operational and financial decision-making" (http://bit.ly/191DGHf).
