     DISPERSE software:       The theory work of [1,2] is incorporated into the commercial package       DISPERSE [A] v2 which was released in 2002 and continues to be updated and       developed by Imperial College, led by Prof M Lowe, Mechanical Engineering.
DISPERSE was first released to external users in 1991 [text removed for       publication] [C].
DISPERSE is an interactive Windows program designed to       calculate dispersion curves for multi-layered flat or cylindrical       structures.
The facility to model accurately circumferential modes (added       in 2002) is an attractive addition to the original code and has helped it       to maintain its pre-eminent position in this area.

The spectral approach to generating dispersion curves       accurately, developed in paper [3] drove the development of a porous       elastic version by Karpfinger and colleagues at Schlumberger Oilfield       Services and Shell International.
This allowed real time completion       modelling in deepwater oil wells with the technique now widely utilised in       those applications.
An article in The Leading Edge, a magazine reporting       new geophysical advances to the Society of Exploration Geophysicists,       acknowledges the contribution of the spectral theory based on [3] to both       experiments and the development of real-time completion modelling for oil       fields [B].
Rolls-Royce Submarines:     Since 2004 Rolls-Royce has been working in collaboration with Imperial's       departments of Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering on the development       of the Finite Element Method (FEM) for the modelling of ultrasonic wave       propagation and defect interaction [G2].
The aim of the work was to model       capably the interaction of ultrasonic waves with small and geometrically       complex flaws typical of the types found in nuclear plants due to       manufacturing and service induced mechanisms.
The limitations of existing       models placed unnecessary cost on the company due to "extended         inspection durations and test piece trials" [E].
An aim of the       collaboration with Imperial was to "provide a generic modelling         capability to reduce inspection development costs through a greater         emphasis on modelling rather than test piece trials" [E].
The       absorbing boundaries work [4,5] proved "invaluable for the overall aims         of Rolls-Royce as it allowed small regions of a component to be modelled         using the FEM without wasting computing resources on unnecessarily large         models" [E].
These developments have "delivered significant         reductions in the model sizes required of typical inspection scenarios"       [E].
Financial impact to Rolls-Royce can be summarised in two ways:            The modelling improvements described above "will significantly           reduce the number of ultrasonic test pieces required during inspection           development" where a typical test piece adds in the region of         &#163;50,000-100,000 to inspection costs;       The "production of component safety justifications requires           thousands of man hours that represents millions of pounds of cost"         and a small benefit provided to this effort removes "significant cost           from the submarine enterprise" [E].
The projects that the Imperial group delivered "provided Rolls-Royce         with a significant improvement in modelling capability" and have led       to two sponsored EngD projects to further refine the ideas and transfer       the technology into Rolls-Royce.
Additionally, one of the collaborators       for this work, M. Drozdz, is now a fulltime employee at Rolls-Royce.
SIMPOSIUM:       The hybrid technique [6] has similarly been implemented in code by       Rolls-Royce and this successful implementation has created momentum with       the impact on-going and developing internationally.
For instance, it led       CEA (the developers of CIVA, the pre-eminent ray code used in ultrasonics)       to invite Imperial College to join the EU project `Simulation Platform for       Non Destructive Evaluation of Structures and Materials' (SIMPOSIUM)       that it project manages [F].
SIMPOSIUM started in September 2011 and will       develop over a period of 3 years.
The cost of Project is &#8364;5.99m and       involves Volkswagen, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS),       SKF and Serco amongst others as industrial partners [D].
The key objective       of the SIMPOSIUM project is to "build interoperable tools based on         hybrid modelling, for ultrasonic and electromagnetic NDE, in order to         solve very complex industrial cases from different fields (steel         nuclear, energy, aeronautics), software solution providers, and academic         teams" [F].
The "expertise, skills and know-how concerning both         NDE and mathematics from Imperial College" is leading the       developments based on hybrid modelling for ultrasonic simulation, for       which it is "necessary to combine mathematical and physics knowledge to         develop efficient hybrid and coupling formulations" [F].
The core of       the work being delivered by Imperial College relates to "a hybrid code         dedicated to ultrasonic simulation, based on the CIVA beam module         (prediction of the incident ultrasonic beam) and a "scattering box",         based on the well-known ABAQUS software, which contains a complex flaw"       [F].
The advantage of the absorbing boundaries work combined with the hybrid       work is profound.
For the first time, industrial companies such as       Rolls-Royce are able to perform realistic simulations of the scattering of       ultrasound from defects, using FE codes that are accepted in the industry.
The realism includes thick and complex-shaped components, containing       complex-shaped defects, including fatigue cracks with rough surfaces       (collaborative research is on-going on this aspect too).
This means that       they can make cases to justify proposed inspection of safety-critical       components at much-reduced expense.
The cost reductions include the       reduced need to make experimental test (justification) samples, and the       possibility to replace radiographical inspections with ultrasound       inspections, avoiding the need to evacuate personnel during inspection and       the attendant health and safety issues.
