     Process/events from research to impact     EDF Energy first commissioned research into the use of intelligent       analysis techniques applied to condition monitoring data gathered from       their fleet of Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) stations in September       2003.
Research into suitable algorithms led to their deployment, first as       prototype stand-alone systems (7/7/2005 for BETA and 7/9/2007 for IMAPS),       then to full industrial strength systems on the EDF intranet (16/5/2008       for BETA and 5/3/2009 for IMAPS).
Types of impact     Enhanced operational safety through improved analysis of reactor core         condition:       The immediate beneficiaries are engineers involved in monitoring the AGR       stations, and EDF Energy, the operator of all the AGR stations in the UK.
The BETA system has been used by engineers in the EDF Energy Graphite Core       Project Team on a daily basis to provide an automated assessment of every       refuelling event undertaken at Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B power       stations since the first release of the software in May 2008.
An improved       version of the software was deployed in May 2013.
The results of the       assessment are fed into the relevant Monitoring Assessment Panel (MAP)       meeting.
The MAP meetings are held quarterly at each participating station       where a panel of engineers make decisions as to whether any operational       action is required, based on all condition monitoring evidence gathered       since the last MAP.
As of May 2013, the BETA system at EDF Energy       contained information on 2549 refuelling events dating back to November       2003.
"The graphite cores are the life-limiting component in our AGR         stations and as they age, the need for high quality information about         their health increases.
The BETA system supports the monitoring         functions within the graphite core project team ... by driving towards         their objective of an average of 9 years lifetime extension for each         power station" [Source 1 Group Head &#8212; Existing Nuclear, EDF Energy].
The IMAPS system is used to support the MAP meetings at the oldest four       participating stations (oldest in terms of the cumulative irradiation to       which the reactor core has been exposed).
As the remaining stations age,       there will be the need to instigate MAP meetings at them, and the IMAPS       system has been designed to accommodate this.
The system allows any       monitoring observation to be stored, whether that be a possible cracked       brick identified through Fuel Grab Load Trace (FGLT) analysis or a control       rod which appears to have impeded movement.
The IMAPS software meets       rigorous requirements set out by EDF, based on the Programmable Electronic       Systems (PES) guidelines, in terms of the quality and management of the       lifecycle of the data stored within the system.
The IMAPS system was       deployed on 5th March 2009 with improved versions of the       software deployed in November 2011 and May 2013.
As of May 2013, the IMAPS       system contains 19,873 reactor core observations and has supported 64       station MAP meetings.
The Nuclear Safety Group Head at Hinckley B notes       that "The IMAPS system is an integral part of our MAP process and         provides us with an effective tool for managing all the observations         discussed during each meeting.
It is also a one stop shop for the data         relating to findings for any fuel or control rod channel.
It is used at         MAP meetings to look at channels history and supports decision making in         regard to future strategy for inspections or study " [Source 2 MAP       Chair, Hinkley Point B Power Station].
Improving Business Performance within EDF: Analysis of condition       monitoring data is used to offset some of the current and future need for       an increased number of inspections required during an outage (as a guide,       each day an AGR reactor is on outage equates to approximately &#163;0.5M in       lost revenue).
IMAPS has changed working practice within EDF Energy as it       is now the recognized repository for storage of all condition monitoring       observations made at the MAP meetings, and is stated in the formal       Departmental Instruction documentation for each station involved.
Furthermore, IMAPS has become the first point of call for the graphite       core project team whenever an issue arises with a fuel channel, as it       contains the most up-to-date verified information relating to the       condition of the channel, along with useful historical information.
"The         IMAPS system is consistently used to view the history of a fuel channel         as the principal data is displayed immediately with links to more         detailed information in our document management system.
In addition,         IMAPS is used to assist in the selection of channels for inspection         during an outage" [Source 3 Monitoring Team Leader EDF].
The systems have proved extremely beneficial to EDF Energy as they       provide a rapid and auditable manner of assessing Fuel Grab Load Trace       data.
Further, the systems provide a means of managing and trending large       volumes of condition monitoring data, which provides supporting evidence       to the claims that the reactors are currently healthy, thus supporting the       safety case for continued operation.
"The BETA and IMAPS systems         directly support the analysis of our core condition monitoring data         which feeds into the monitoring leg of our safety case for continued and         future station operation" [Source 4].
Reducing the risk to energy supply by extending lifetime of nuclear         power stations: Another impact is on the energy supply available to       UK consumers, via the Department of Energy and Climate Change's policy on       "Maintaining UK energy security."
In the wider societal context, keeping       the existing nuclear power plants generating, and extending their       operational lifetimes, providing it is safe to do so, is of great       significance to the UK.
Civil nuclear power generation plays a substantial       role in the UK's current energy mix, by providing low carbon, base load       generation.
In 2012, 63.9TWh of electricity was supplied by nuclear power       in the UK, which is equivalent to 18.5% of all electricity supplied, and       the AGR stations supplied over 83% of this electricity.
In December 2007, the oldest power stations Hunterston B and Hinkley       Point B were granted 5-year operational extensions to 2016, and a further       7-year extension to these stations was announced on 4th December 2012.
In       2010, both Heysham 1 and Hartlepool were granted 5-year operational       extensions to 2019, and it is likely that the case will be made for       further extensions in the future for these newer stations.
Dungeness B,       Torness and Heysham 2 are newer still and the likelihood is that similar       extensions will be sought.
Without the existing nuclear generation       portfolio, the UK would be facing a significant gap of about 19% of total       demand in its energy supply, and though new stations are planned, these       are not due to come online for at least another 8-10 years.
Furthermore,       the upcoming energy crisis that the UK risks facing was highlighted by       Ofgem, which stated on 27th June 2013, that "electricity         supplies are set to tighten faster than previously expected in the         middle of this decade" [Source 6].
Extended operation of the       existing nuclear power plants mitigates some of this risk to supply,       without which the country would be facing the increased possibility of the       lights going out.
The likelihood of this occurring is part of the current       public energy debate, but what is clear is that extended operation is       beneficial to security of supply.
Influence on international planning: Though the algorithms are       specific to the AGR design of reactors, the wider international community       benefits from the lessons learned from deploying such systems for lifetime       extension.
Dr West was a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency       (IAEA) co-ordinated research program entitled: "Advanced Surveillance,         Diagnostics, and Prognostics Techniques used for Health Monitoring of         Systems, Structures and Components in Nuclear Power Plants" which       focussed on the latest developments in techniques to support continued and       extended operation of nuclear power plants worldwide [Source 5].
Dr West's       input was also provided to the U.S. Department of Energy sponsored       "invitation only" workshop to solicit input from nuclear power experts to       support research planning for the Light Water Reactor Sustainability       (LWRS) program [Source 6].
The goal of the workshop was to supplement the       US Department of the Environment's understanding of research needs to       close the technology, economic, implementation, and regulatory gaps for       the economically justifiable integration of advanced on-line monitoring       (OLM) technologies into the aging fleet of nuclear power plants.
