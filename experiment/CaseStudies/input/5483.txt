     Process from research to impact     The intervention protocol and the Language Therapy Manual were       disseminated as the Strathclyde Language Intervention Programme (SLIP),       supplemented later by the Language Support Model for Teachers (LSM);       SLIP and LSM were placed online in the institution's       repository, Strathprints [Sources A &amp; B].
Published reports of the       studies were disseminated in journals read by relevant professionals.
Health         Technology Assessment is widely read by medical professionals; the International         Journal of Language and Communication Disorders is the journal of       the UK SLT professional body the RCSLT; the Journal of Research in         Special Education is the research journal of the National       Association of Special Educational Needs (NASEN), and Child Language,         Teaching and Therapy is read by teachers and therapists working with       language-impaired children.
Professionals reading the papers could access       the Language Therapy Manual and the LSM from Strathprints,       for direct use.
Thirty-two presentations (17 invited) were made to       professional conferences, teacher and SLT study days, and seminars across       the UK, in Europe and in New Zealand.
Types of impact     Impact on UK policy and practice: The positive results of Study         1 were cited in the Bercow Review, 2008 [Source C p. 24), a       cross-party review of services in England for children with speech,       language and communication needs (SLCN), chaired by MP John Bercow.
In       response to this review, the UK Government commissioned a Better         Communication Research Project (BCRP), to develop policy and       practice in English schools.
BCRP evaluated international       evidence-based interventions and listed them on a `What Works' website       [Source D]; SLIP appears with a `moderate' level of evidence of       efficacy, which is the highest level listed for language impairment       interventions.
SLIP is recommended for use in schools, impacting       upon professionals' choice of interventions.
In 2009 The Royal College of       Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) cited Study 1 as their       evidence for intervention for children with language impairment in their `Resource         Manual for Commissioning and Planning Services for SLCN' [Source E],       which lists efficacious therapies appropriate for NHS delivery.
Impact on cost-efficient public services: In 2010, RCSLT       commissioned an economic evaluation of therapies from international       consultants Matrix Evidence, which also analysed language outcomes from Study         1 as the evidence related to language impairment.
Since language       benefits exceeded costs (benefit:cost ratio 6.43), Matrix Evidence       concluded the intervention represented an efficient use of public       resources [Source F p. 47].
In 2013, RCSLT commissioned new consultants       (RTK Ltd and Concentra) to update the Matrix model regarding population,       prevalence and cost statistics, and to develop an on-line cost-benefit       analysis tool for local NHS services' use [Source G], which also uses Study         1 as the evidence for language gains.
The RCSLT also presents this       information to other professions, such as the Royal College of General       Practitioners, as evidence of the value of therapy.
The outcomes of Studies         1 and 2 have informed the amount of intervention understood to be       needed by children with language impairment, and correspondingly, have       impacted on those planning and developing SLT services; on decisions about       the amount of therapy and delivery mode; on workforce planning in relation       to the use of assistants, and on the provision and purchase of efficacious       interventions, particularly within current service commissioning regimes       in UK NHS and education services.
Improved practice and language gains for children: SLIP       provides an evidence-based intervention that can impact positively upon       the expressive language skills of children with language impairment.
The       randomised controlled trial design, the rigorous analysis of effects, and       the replicable therapy mean it can safely be used by SLTs directly or via       supervised assistants, with the LSM, to achieve language gains for       children in schools.
Influence on SLT education internationally       Email correspondence, course documents, professional forums, and       invitations to present and publish indicate that SLIP and the       underpinning research is taught in SLT qualifying courses in the UK, South       Africa, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and in other European       countries, and has influenced the international SLT professional knowledge       base.
SLIP and the LSM have also impacted upon the design       of an Australian trial of language intervention for pre-school children       [Source H].
Reach and significance       The strong research support for SLIP, its accessible information       on implementation and materials, and the fact that SLIP,       supplemented by the LSM, fits easily into primary school contexts       all mean that it has reached the international community of SLT       clinicians, educators, teachers and other practitioners whose professional       roles commit them to evidence-based practice, and who require       evidence-based interventions that can be used safely and effectively.
Through this community, SLIP has reached many children with       developmental oral language impairments, their schools and families.
Publications from The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists that       draw upon the Strathclyde research have influenced service commissioners       and providers across the UK and beyond who seek cost-effective       interventions, bringing effective changes to intervention practices for       children with language impairment.
