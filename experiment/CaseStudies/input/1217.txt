     An informal survey of radiocarbon dating laboratories worldwide suggests       that over 50,000       radiocarbon determinations are undertaken annually, at a cost of around       &#163;350 each, i.e.
more than       &#163;17.5m pa.
Most users interpret radiocarbon determinations with       freely-available radiocarbon       calibration software such as CALIB (http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/),       OxCal       (http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html)       or BCal (http://bcal.sheffield.ac.uk).
Due to improvements in       accuracy, and for reasons of consistency, the providers of such software       automatically migrate       their packages to the new curves as they are published.
Consequently,       curves estimated at       Sheffield have been at the core of all of these software packages since       2004 until the present time.
One of the three packages, BCal, is an on-line service based at Sheffield,       which is offered free-of-charge       to the international community by Buck and a team of volunteers.
Users in the public and private sectors since 2008 include:            commercial radiocarbon dating laboratories (e.g.
Beta Analytic)       commercial archaeology units (e.g.
University of Leicester         Archaeological Services and         Trent &amp; Peak Archaeology)       palaeoenvironmental scientists in governmental and intergovernmental         agencies (e.g.
the         British Antarctic Survey and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate         Change)       private and public sector staff charged with the care of ancient         buildings and environments         (e.g.
English Heritage)       freelance experts who undertake radiocarbon dating to advise private         customers, public         sector companies and government agencies.
Economic impact     The need to reduce the costs of archaeological work has made the improved       accuracy offered by       the Sheffield curves increasingly important.
The Head of Research at Trent       &amp; Peak Archaeology,       UK says: "As a commercial archaeological unit ... we are of course         reliant upon accurate         calibration methodologies, and hence support strongly the IntCal team's         work on refining         calibration curves.
Refinements in calibration have increased confidence         in the accuracy of this         dating technique and in our area of activity have spurred its wider use         ...
This demonstrable         increase in accuracy is especially crucial in view of the ever greater         pressure to reduce the costs of         archaeological work in advance of development, and hence the need to         defend more fiercely         investments in appropriate programmes of radiocarbon dating" [S1].
Impact on national and international policy and services     Consistency is particularly important to those working on international       policy since it allows them to       compare and combine results from different projects.
Eric Wolff FRS,       Science Leader (Chemistry       and Past Climate), British Antarctic Survey says that "Correct and         consistent dating of past events         in the palaeorecord is crucial to our ability to understand processes in         the Earth system, and         therefore to verify and improve models of its future behaviour.
In this         sense the work of IntCal is         one of the cornerstones that allows us to use the past to provide         insights that can inform policy"       [S2].
One of the lead authors, Jonathan Overpeck, of the       Palaeoclimate chapter in the       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report       [S3] - the most       authoritative document influencing international climate change policy       during 2007-13 - says that       the work undertaken by the IntCal group was "a critical underpinning of         much of the chapter that         relied on radiocarbon chronologies.
More specifically, a number of         papers assessed in the chapter         produced timescales based on calibration of radiocarbon ages using         IntCal04" [S4].
Impact on practitioners     Practitioners confirm that the Sheffield curves have offered substantial       improvements, not only       providing a common standard and improved method, but extending the range       of calibration.
The       President of Beta Analytic (the world's largest commercial radiocarbon       dating laboratory) says that       he supports IntCal as "the primary (and preferably only) database used         in radiocarbon dating         calibrations" [S5].
The President of archaeology consultancy,       T. S. Dye &amp; Colleagues,       Archaeologists, Inc., Honolulu, states that incremental improvements to       the calibration curve "have         become increasingly important as Hawaiian archaeologists solve the         substantial problems of         chronologically ordering and dating events important to the short         prehistoric sequence in the         islands" [S6].
The Scientific Dating Coordinator, English Heritage defines the IntCal       programme as `industry         standard' in both economic and professional practice terms.
He says       that the new curves are       adopted "not only because they form a common standard, but also because         of the enhancements         which the new data and compilations provide.
... Key benefits ...         include improved methods for the         modelling of the tree-ring data (Buck &amp; Blackwell 2004 [R1]),         which enable more robust wiggle-matching         procedures to be adopted.
This is critical for the development of this         technique to allow         the dating of historic buildings (e.g.
Tyers et al.
2009 [S7])         to an equivalent level of precision and         accuracy as routinely provided by dendrochronology.
Both this curve and         the subsequent 2009         release have extended the range of radiocarbon calibration to the limit         of the technique" [S8].
Impact on public engagement in science     The dating aspects of high-profile projects also provide archaeologists       with effective ways to       engage the general public in the complexities of modern science-based       archaeology.
The lead       archaeologist on the "Searching for Richard III" project, says of IntCal09       that "Without such a         calibration curve it would not have been possible to place any of the         remains on a real timescale         and thus to determine their validity as belonging to the era of Richard         III.
The IntCal calibration         curve has thus played an important role in helping the project to         capture the public imagination".
He also says that there have been "many thousands of hits" on the       web page       http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/carbondating.html       on which his team documented the       radiocarbon dating parts of their work, that "5 million people watched         the Channel 4 programme on         which we discussed the interpretation of the radiocarbon dating evidence"       and that "the exhibition         at the Guildhall in Leicester in which details of the dating are         presented has had over 60,000         visitors" [S9].
