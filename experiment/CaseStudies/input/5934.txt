     Skinner's research has had two primary impacts.
First, it influenced the       radical re-design of the       child support system through the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act       2008.
Second, it       informed further reforms made to this system under the Welfare Reform Act       2012.
These impacts       occurred by way of three different methods:     Method 1: Establishing a foundational principle for policy re-design     The Child Support Act 1991 is widely regarded as having been a major       policy failure.
In 1999       Skinner (with Bradshaw, Stimson and Williams) published research with a       key finding that became       a foundational principle in the subsequent re-design of the system.
Skinner and colleagues       demonstrated convincingly that the Child Support Act was failing, in large       part, due to its failure to       recognise the deep connections between non-resident fathers' financial       commitments to their       children and their social and emotional bonds with those children.
The       core finding that later       provided the foundation for the radical re-design of the Child Support       System was as follows:     "The results of this research show that no child support scheme has a       prospect of success       unless it is based on negotiation between the parents, which is recognised       as fair, and the       perception of fairness on the fathers' part depends more than anything on       their ability (and the       former partners' willingness) to have shared parental responsibility for       their children... What is       needed is a service that enables these fathers and mothers to work out       arrangements for child       support, contact and other matters that concern them."
(1999: 249)     This core finding was acknowledged and confirmed two years later by       research commissioned by       the Department for Work and Pensions.
Referring to the summary of findings       of the ESRC's       Population and Household Change Programme [Source 1, p. 108],       Wikeley et al reiterated the       York research's basic message that negotiation between the parents that is       recognised by them as       being fair is crucial to rates of compliance with child support law       [Source 1, pp, 107; 159; 161].
This       principle became central to the eventual re-design of the system.
Although       it took until 2006 for the       Government to signal that it was ready for radical reform, the report that       set out the re-design       recommendations focused centrally on the core message that parents should       be able to take       responsibility for making their own arrangements.
Citing Wikeley et al       (who, in turn, had cited the       York research), Sir David Henshaw stated:     "Parents who are able to should be encouraged and supported to make their       own arrangements.
Such arrangements tend to result in higher satisfaction and compliance and       allow individual       circumstances to be reflected."
[Source 2: p. 5]     This core principle was then carried into the Government's White Paper:     "The Government has accepted Sir David's principal recommendations.
Based       on these it has       established four new principles for the reform of the child maintenance       system, [the second of       which is to] ... promote parental responsibility by encouraging and       empowering parents       to2028 make their own maintenance arrangements wherever possible..."       [Source 3, p. 6]     The new child support system was eventually introduced through the Child       Maintenance and Other       Payments Act 2008.
It reflected the core message of the original York       research, embedding the       principle of promoting and supporting parental arrangements about child       maintenance.
Method 2: Commissioned Research Feeding Directly into Policy Change     Skinner also conducted two further research projects that had been       commissioned by policy       makers directly to inform policy design and development.
The first of       these &#8212; a comparison of child       maintenance systems in 14 countries &#8212; was commissioned in 2006 by the       Department for Work       and Pensions to help it undertake the "far-reaching and ambitious"       re-design of the child support       system [Source 5, p. 5].
The significance of the York research report to       the proposed re-design of       the system was noted in the Government's summary of responses to its       consultation:     "The report [by Skinner and colleagues] illustrated how the UK's child       maintenance system       performs in an international context and drew out potential lessons and       policy implications       across areas such as private maintenance arrangements, enforcement,       administration, and       the disregard of child maintenance payments in benefits calculations."
[Source 5, p 90]     The second research project was commissioned in 2009 by the new agency       that had by then       replaced the Child Support Agency.
The Child Maintenance and Enforcement       Commission asked a       research team from PriceWaterhouseCooper (including Skinner as the       academic consultant) to       undertake research that would help it understand the behaviour of parents       with no formal child       maintenance arrangements in place.
This research helped the Government       understand how more       parents could be encouraged to make private agreements.
It recommended a       range of supportive       services that tackled separated family relationships and the practical and       emotional consequences       of relationship breakdown.
In January 2011 the new coalition Government       published a Green       Paper with proposals to further strengthen the new child support system:     "Central to our approach to reform is an integrated model of relationship       and family support       services, which helps parents make their own, lasting arrangements."
[Source 8, p. 5]     The Government cited Skinner's research in its response to the       consultation submissions [source       9, pp.
1, 14, &amp; 17], and in the Minister's public discussion of the       proposals [source 10].
In 2012, the       government's proposals were legislated through the Welfare Reform Act.
The       new policy       framework gave due recognition to the complex range of needs with which       separating parents may       require help before they can focus upon making child maintenance       arrangements.
Five new       `Supporting Separated Family Guides' were produced to offer this support       and advice to separating       parents.
On the last page of each of these guides it is noted that the       main sources of research       used to write them included Skinner's work with PriceWaterhouseCooper       [source 12].
Method 3: Research Expertise Leading to Academic Consultancies     In addition to producing excellent research on child maintenance, Skinner       has also been invited on       numerous occasions, as a direct result of her research experience and       expertise, to act as an       expert consultant.
She was invited to participate in high-level policy seminars organised         to inform the         Henshaw review of 2006 and subsequent White Paper.
These seminars also         involved key         Ministers, the DWP's Director of the Child Support Division responsible         for the policy redesign, as         well as other academic experts [sources 3, p. 94; source 5, pp.
10-11,         para 1.8].
The House of Commons' Work and Pensions Committee appointed         Skinner as one of its         two Specialist Advisors to help it respond to the White Paper proposals         of 2006 [Source 4, p. 7].
She helped to set the key recommendations for its report.
The Committee         called on the         government to introduce holistic support services dealing with all         aspects of parenting in separated         families, not just child maintenance obligations.
Skinner was one of two academic consultants within a research         consortium commissioned         by the Department for Work and Pensions to conduct a further national         survey of separated         parents' experiences and views concerning child maintenance (Source 7,         p. 7, fn 6).
She assisted         in the development of the survey instruments and data analysis.
She also         commented on drafts of         the report.
This research confirmed that parents supported private         agreements, but only if         supported by effective information and support services.
This research         was relied upon in the         Green Paper that preceded the 2012 reforms [source 8, p. 20] and cited         in the response to the         Green Paper consultations [Source 9, pp.
44, 31].
It also directly         informed the development of the 5         new `Supporting Separated Family Guides' (noted above) subsequent to the         reforms [source 12].
In 2008, Skinner presented a paper about her research at a private,         high-level policy         seminar, chaired by a Minister and attended by the first Chair of the         new Child Maintenance and         Enforcement Commission and the Director of the DWP's Child Support         Division [source 6].
Her         findings were key in the development of Child Maintenance Options,         a service offering holistic         information and support to all separating parents (not just CSA         clients), helping them to make         private agreements (http://www.cmoptions.org).
In 2011, Skinner was invited by Maria Millar, the Parliamentary Under         Secretary of State, to         join a `Family Support Services Steering Group' as an academic expert to         help inform the reforms         being developed under the Welfare Reform Act 2012 [source 11].
Conclusion     Skinner's body of work, by various means, has impacted significantly on a       radical change in child       support policy.
Equally, it has directly informed the subsequent       development of a support       infrastructure to promote the success of the new legal regime.
Child       maintenance obligations are       now recognised by policy-makers as being intimately interlinked with       family relationships.
This has       been the consistent message of Skinner's research since the original study       in 1995.
However, these primary impacts give way to clear secondary impacts.
The       policy changes       since 2008 affect all separated parents in the population, not       just CMEC clients.
The agency       tasked with providing information and support to separating parents (Child         Maintenance Options)       estimates that it has already helped one million parents [source 13].
And       in turn, of course, the       benefit of those impacts will then be felt by the dependent children of       non-widowed lone parents       (estimated at 30% of all UK dependent children).
The policy move to       parental agreements and the       delivery of new support services are targeted ultimately at the well-being       of children.
