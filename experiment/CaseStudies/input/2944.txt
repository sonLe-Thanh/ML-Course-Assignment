     Pathways: The projects outlined provide a conceptual framework, an       evidence base, and valuable decision support tools, for UK and overseas       stakeholders to enhance their understanding of urban climate change       impacts and adaptation, and to develop strategies and actions in response.
A key characteristic of this research is its collaborative nature, with a       specific focus on building capacity to adapt.
The GRaBS tools were thus an       attempt to seek out opportunities to support the development of adaptation       strategies and responses, an approach subsequently adopted in the       EcoCities and CLUVA projects; the latter seeking to assist African cities       to manage climate risks, reduce vulnerability and increase climate change       resilience.
More broadly, the collaborative methods employed across these projects       have encouraged the development of policy-relevant and user-focused       outputs.
Accordingly, stakeholders who have been directly engaged in the       research have acted as `champions' for associated outputs, creating       immediate and powerful pathways to impact, including The Mersey Forest's       project director notes UoM's "significant contribution to building the         case for and assessing the effectiveness of green infrastructure as a         powerful tool for urban climate change adaptation.
These ideas are now         incorporated into all of our green infrastructure plans and strategies         that have been completed for a range of public bodies.
We have also used         the work to support international projects such as ForeStClim...
These         approaches continue to influence the work of the Mersey Forest."

At a national level, the TCPA have confirmed that UoM's "work on         urban climate change adaptation, coupled with ongoing stakeholder         engagement, has helped to build capacity for assessing climate change         impacts and risks in urban areas" [2].
The work has become an       exemplar of co-produced research, with academics working in tandem with       public policy makers, urban practitioners, private sector interests and       stakeholders.
Working relationships and ongoing dialogue have been       maintained over time, acting as a central platform for securing impact.
The most significant include links with local councils throughout Greater       Manchester [3] and ongoing engagement and dissemination alongside the TCPA       [2].
Research outputs have impacted on a range of sectors and policy       domains such as spatial planning, flood risk management and green       infrastructure, at the local, regional and international scales.
Greater Manchester Impact: The EcoCities project has fostered       innovative collaboration between UoM and the public and private       sectors in Greater Manchester.
EcoCities was funded via a charitable       donation from the commercial property company, Bruntwood.
This funding       route demonstrates the degree to which the adaptation agenda has become       established in Greater Manchester, signalling that related research,       driven forward by UoM, is sufficiently developed and relevant to attract       interest and funding from non-public sources.
EcoCities also stimulated       the signing of a `memorandum of understanding' (MOU) between UoM and       Manchester City Council (MCC) committing the partners to work more closely       on climate change issues.
The leader of MCC recognises this as "a         central platform for our ongoing engagement with the University",       further noting that UoM research has contributed to MCC's Core Strategy,       and: "provides us with the robust evidence base needed to make         informed decisions at both a local level and city region scale.
We can         therefore confirm that research undertaken at UoM has substantially         improved MCC's understanding of climate change, and has supported the         development of adaptation strategies and responses to locally prevalent         climate change impact...
The key output to this will be the development         of a Green Infrastructure framework for Manchester... put[ting]         the City at the forefront of Climate Change research and help make         Manchester a truly Green City."
[4]     EcoCities researchers have sat on steering committees tasked with       developing adaptation strategies for the City of Manchester and the       conurbation of Greater Manchester, with the resulting strategies       referencing both the project and its role in progressing adaptation in the       conurbation [3][4].
The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities       (AGMA) Director of Environment has recognised the value of the research,       noting that Ecocites "has been successful in bringing academic         research outputs closer to policy making audiences...
Climate change         adaptation research... including the ASCCUE and EcoCities projects, has         supported the development of strategic adaptation responses in Greater         Manchester... significantly influenc[ing] the development and         content of the Greater Manchester Climate Change Strategy (2012) and         Implementation Plan (2013)... Ecocities research in particular... was         adopted by the GM Environment Commission as our baseline research in         this field in July 2012.... [UoM] is a key partner and         stakeholder in Greater Manchester's Low Carbon Hub with representative's         holding seats on several of the Hub Board's Sub-groups."

This       work has been transmitted broadly, with the EcoCities website (www.adaptingmanchester.co.uk)       receiving 4240 visitors, from a range of countries, between its launch in       May 2012 and June 2013, and the BBC featuring EcoCities, successfully       highlighting the issues it raises to an international audience [5].
National Impact: Accordingly, the research has attracted national       interest.

[6]     The TCPA referenced ASCCUE heavily within their influential 2007 guide       `Adaptation by Design'; as their chief executive notes, "this document         remains influential and continues to be utilised by stakeholders... for         example the TCPA used the outputs of the GRaBS project in 24 local         authority councillor training workshops in Yorkshire and the Humber         between October 2012 and February 2013" [2].
The TCPA has also       utilised UoM adaptation research for lobbying purposes, with the "outcomes         and insights that have emerged from the ASCCUE and GRaBS projects....
Instrumental in the TCPA campaigning for urban adaptation and green         spaces... informing TCPA policy responses to consultations such as the       [UK Government's] `Natural Environment White Paper" [2].
Similarly,       members of the UoM research team have made invited contributions in this       field, for example to the `Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution'       and the UK Government's `Adaptation Sub Committee'.
Nationally, local       authorities including the City of Southampton and the London Borough of       Sutton, have used GRaBS to inform the development and implementation of       adaptation `action plans' (www.grabs-eu.org/partners.php).GRaBS       was recently included in DEFRA's `National Adaptation Programme' &#8212;       outlining the Government's responsibilities under Section 58 of the       Climate Change Act (2008) - where it was noted that GRaBS "was one of         the first projects to recognise the crucial role of green and blue space         infrastructure adaptation to help create more resilient urban areas"       [7].
European Impact: UoM research has been influential at the European       level.
Informed by the GRaBS decision support tools, eleven European       municipalities and regions (including the Province of Genoa and the       Amsterdam district of Nieuw-West) now have strategies in place to progress       climate change adaptation responses, raise awareness and bolster local       adaptive capacity, with adaptation plans and strategies available to view       on the GRaBS website (www.grabs-eu.org).
This strand of research is still productive, and associated impact is       increasing.
For instance, in June 2012 GRaBS won the European Commission's       DG for Regional Policy `RegioStars Award' as the best project in the       Sustainable Growth category (one of 5 winners from 107 entries).
The jury       noted that: "While there are many projects working on the environmental         aspects of green and blue infrastructure, this project goes further in         assessing the social and economic benefits..." The European       Commission has also utilised ASCCUE in their work on vulnerabilities       inherent in the `compact city' [8].
Yet further afield, GRaBS was presented at COP17, the UN's annual climate       change conference (Durban, December 2011).
Subsequently, the GRaBS       approach to climate change adaptation in cities was adopted by the       International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), giving       the project the potential to support urban adaptation planning in cities       across the world.
These themes are taken up within ongoing UoM research       (including `Adaptation Strategies for European Cities' and `Climate Proof       Cities').
The former, funded by the EC (2012-2013, &#8364;36.2k), is supporting       the development of the forthcoming EU Strategy on adaptation to climate       change.
The project has been cited in recent communications from the EC on       a European Adaptation Strategy, who note that: "Building upon the         success of its pilot project `Adaptation strategies for European         cities', the Commission will continue to promote urban adaptation         strategies" [8], with Dr Carter appointed as an international expert       to support the Committee of the Regions on their submission to the EC on       the EU Adaptation Strategy.
