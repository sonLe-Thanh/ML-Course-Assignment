     A combination of UCL research between 2004 and 2006, later follow-up       work, and dissemination through nearly 30 conferences and seminars in the       UK and worldwide from 2004-13 has established the effectiveness of design       codes in the delivery of high-quality residential design in England and       overseas.
In the process, research by Carmona et al has become the primary       source for advice on the preparation of design codes for practitioners and       local authorities alike.
Change in policy and practice:     Research described in Section 2 provided the primary evidence base for       the direct endorsement of design codes in the Barker Review of Land         Use Planning (2006) (Recommendation 24 [1], and Planning         Policy Statement 3: Housing (2006), the UK government's strategic       housing policy for England.
The latter recommended that `Local         Planning Authorities should ... promote the use of appropriate tools and         techniques, such as Design Codes', in order to `facilitate         efficient delivery of high quality development' [2; para 18].
It remained in force throughout 2006-12, with three editions, the most       recent of them in 2011.
In 2012, all planning policy statements were       replaced by a unified National Planning Policy Framework which once again       directed that `Local planning authorities should consider using design         codes' as a means to `help deliver higher quality outcomes'       [3; para 59] &#8212; and all this despite wider simultaneous moves       towards deregulation.
The research work was widely referenced by the UK government and its       agencies, including:            Policy and practice documents supporting a dimension of the research         that explored the designation of Local Development Orders (LDOs)         alongside design codes on the basis that they can speed up the planning         process whilst delivering design quality [d; Appendix 1].
Initially this found support in CLG Circular 01/2006, then in         the 2008 Killian Pretty Review of the planning system [4;           item 2.1.2].
The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) published Urban Design           Compendium 2 in 2009, which includes specific reference to the         underpinning UCL research on design codes:         `Research has found that it is sites such as these (large sites where           delivery is phased either over time or between different design teams)           that benefit most from the use of design codes.'
The document thus         endorses the practice guide and goes on to summarise key findings from         the research regarding the benefits of design coding for stakeholders [5;           p. 128]        The 2012 online guidance of ATLAS, the government funded independent         advisory service on large scale development, which advocates the use of         design coding in their work in order to fulfil one of their corporate         objectives, to improve the speed and quality of major housing         developments.
In doing so they draw from the research to shape their own         advice to clients on the use of design codes, quoting Preparing           Design Codes: A Practice Manual [c] as `the key reference'         [6; item T2.9].
This emphasis is reflected in its discussion of         means to ensure design quality through case studies of successful         projects it has advised on, for example, a successful proposal in 2010         to develop west of Waterlooville in Hampshire with 3,000 homes.
In this         case, ATLAS identified the early submission of design codes as a key         driver on quality and a catalyst in creating a conversation about design         [7].
Adoption of design codes:     By providing the evidence base to advocate for design codes, and the       guidance on adopting them, the research has been hugely influential in       driving practice.
This was demonstrated through research led by Carmona       for the Urban Design Group (UDG) in 2012, which tested the diffusion of       design coding as a tool in the development process, and revealed the scale       of this influence.
From an almost standing start in 2003, by 2012 around       45% of local authorities (geographically spread across England) had used       design codes and 66% of urban design consultants had prepared them [8;         pp.
6-7].
From the data it was estimated that over 120 design codes       had been Impact census periodprepared between 2006 and 2012 (85% of these       after 2008), compared to a smattering before, with the rate of adoption       continuing to climb year on year [8; p. 2].
It was found that the       research and accompanying guidance was the primary source of advice on the       preparation and use of design codes by local authorities and private       practitioners alike &#8212; e.g.
West Northamptonshire's 2009 Manual for         Design Codes; in Plymouth's 2009 Design Code Factsheet; or       the 2012 Design Codes for Strategic Development Sites within the         Cambridge Fringe Area [9].
Taken together, design codes now direct the development of many thousands       of houses over many thousands of acres across England.
Taking just one       local authority as an example, since 2006 Swindon Borough Council has used       codes in all four of its major strategic housing sites at Wichelstowe,       Tadpole Farm, Commonhead, and New Eastern Villages, covering 14,580 new       homes on 1,000+ hectares of land [10].
The survey revealed a wide range of projects across England &#8212; from       Ashford to Carlisle &#8212; in which respondents reported that the `innovation'       of codes had enhanced both process and outcomes.
Indeed, 93% of those who       used design codes reported they would do so again [8; p. 12].
By       2012, design codes were advocated in a quarter of local plans, and the       number was rapidly increasing, whilst a large majority of planning       authorities and urban design consultants who have had not yet used design       codes stated their intention to use them in the future.
As one officer       said, `codes are the only way to get volume builders to develop out in         an appropriate integrated manner' [8; p. 12].
As a sign of this significant diffusion of design coding practice, the       UDG study revealed that private developers are now submitting unsolicited       design codes in large numbers as part of planning applications, indicating       how practice has become mainstreamed, whilst survey respondents reported       the following benefits of using the codes [8; pp.
1-2]:            Improving design quality by tying down the `must have' design         parameters that hold the schemes together, and ensuring consistency in         the delivery of key site-wide design principles;       Offering far greater certainly about outcomes and certainly to         developers about the process;       Bringing key stakeholders together early in the process leading to         smoother working relationships and to a better understanding of         constraints from the start;       Speeding up the reserved matters planning applications made in         connection with the successive phases of large development projects.
As one planner put it: `Well framed codes, based on a clear         understanding of the limits of the client's control and influence have         resulted in a clear uplift in quality, principally in the better         integration of complicated development sites or where the landownership         is a patchwork.'
[8; p. 9].
Contributions by UCL research to policy are ongoing.
The above diffusion       of practice was further advanced by a recommendation of the Taylor External         Review of Government Planning Practice Guidance (2012) that the       underpinning practice guidance should be incorporated into the new National         Planning Practice Guidance; this was duly done in August 2013 [11;         ID 26-032-130729].
The reach of these impacts was extended further when the research at UCL       by Carmona et al inspired the HOPUS consortium of universities and       municipalities in the European Union's URBACT programme to focus on the       use and potential of design codes as a tool for improving the       sustainability of housing development.
As its `Lead Expert' through the       project's life (2008-10) Carmona advanced the principles and processes of       design coding developed during the research as a basis for local       investigations in Portugal, Italy, Poland, and The Netherlands, which       enabled HOPUS to assess the value of design coding, as well as the       conditions necessary for its success [12; p. 6].
In Poland, for       example, tests carried out in six cities led to the conclusion that design       coding offers a valuable tool to challenge development practice that is       typically driven by a private sector with little interest in design       quality [11; p. 205].
