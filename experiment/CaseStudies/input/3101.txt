The national implementation of universal newborn hearing screening was       completed in 2006 and to date over 5 million babies have been screened and       over 9,500 identified with permanent bilateral hearing loss (S1).
The       impact of our research work, which coincided with the initial       implementation of universal newborn hearing screening, has continued well       into the current assessment period (2008-2013).
Both the follow-on       research we have completed and the international recognition of our       original studies have formed the basis of national hearing screening and       early intervention developments around the world.
Our original research pinpointed the potential challenges that the       post-screening agencies, most importantly Paediatric Audiology Services,       faced when dealing with the assessment and management of very young       infants and providing appropriate support to their families [2].
It has       influenced developments in paediatric audiology following early       identification of deafness both in the UK and internationally (S2).
The       empirical studies of how families conceptualised the impact of early       identification and its influence on their expectations of services and       their children's development were the first such studies of their kind and       have had a strong influence on how universal newborn hearing screening has       been implemented in several countries.
Our studies have contributed to and       been cited in international consensus statements including Best         Practices in Family Centred Early Intervention for Children who are Deaf         and Hard of Hearing: An International Consensus Statement (2013)       (S3) and Guidelines for Identification and Management of Infants and         Children with Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (2008) (S4)       where our unique contribution is noted: "Your discussion of challenges         to both parents and professionals in the identification of a potentially         transient finding is particularly important and continues to be a vital         consideration in discussions of the evaluation of management of ANSD"       (S4).
Our research on the model of informed choice in multi-professional       service resulted in two guidance documents published by the Department of       Health, on informed choice practice for professionals and parents (S5).
The work has formed the basis of how British Columbia, Canada, has       developed its approach to early intervention services for families with       deaf children: "Your research articles and training on the topic of         "Informed Choice" have had significant impact on services for families         with Deaf babies in British Columbia...This included: Provincial         standards for verbal and written information provided to families after         identification of hearing loss, ensuring families had access to full and         unbiased information.
Provincial training of all service providers on         the topic of Informed Choice.
A Program Evaluation Family experience         survey, which included questions to capture the parent experience of         services through the lens of informed choice" (S6).
The research work on informed choice resulted in an international       training programme led by Young and Carr, who have trained       over 500 early intervention professionals working with early identified       deaf children, in British Columbia (2008) [150 professionals], South       Africa (2009) [90 professionals], in Norway (2011) [120 professionals],       Quebec (2013) [100 professionals], Victoria and New South Wales, Australia       (2013) [80 professionals].
The International Consensus on Family         Centred Early Intervention (2013) draws extensively on our research       (S3): "Dr. Young's work on the theoretical model of informed choice         forms the foundation of the third core principle in this document.
The         third principle provides guidelines for working with families to support         informed choice and decision making.
Dr. Young's research factors         prominently into the concepts presented in this landmark document"       (S7).
Our work also forms a key component of the international Global         Coalition of Parents of Children who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing       statement (2010), which supports the work of various parent-driven       organisations internationally; "Informed choice, as outlined in the         guidance documents, is a key component of the protocols and practices we         wish to be implemented across the world to improve outcomes for deaf         children and their families" (S8).
The development of the standard instrument for assessing the quality of       multi-professional services for families with deaf children (the MVOS) has       been made freely available for translation and adaptation through a       University of Manchester web link since 2010 (S9).
To date 48       people/organisations have registered their use of it across 6 countries.
The version for Queensland Australia (MVOS Qld) is now used as a standard       element of assessment protocol with all families of early identified Deaf       children in that region (S10).
