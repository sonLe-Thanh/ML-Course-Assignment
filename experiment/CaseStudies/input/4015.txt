     Creation of an innovative forum for stakeholder dialogue and policy         influence       GRAMNet brings together 40 member organisations ranging from       community-based groups, local       authorities and campaign groups to large NGOs, such as: Scottish Refugee       Council, the Black and       Ethnic Minority Infrastructure Scotland (BEMIS), Glasgow Housing       Association, Oxfam Scotland       and British Red Cross.
In this way, GRAMNet has successfully shaped the       form and content of       association between these different civil society organisations and       practitioner groups.
This partnership approach has resulted in a strong suite of funded       projects that link researchers       with these practitioner organisations (&#163;5M in research income from 2009 to       31 July 2013),       demonstrating the effectiveness of the network in achieving a broad level       of participation and the       generation of research based evidence for policy and practice across the       UK.
GRAMNet was       specifically recognised as an example of university research delivering       benefit to humanity and       society by the Research Councils UK and Universities UK in its 2011       publication entitled `Big Ideas'       [1].
The overlapping relationship between GRAMNet and TREEC has also led       to joint initiatives       between the networks which have resulted in substantial impact during the       review period.
These       include the following:     (i) Sanctuary, Safety and Solidarity: Enhancing service delivery for         marginalised groups       In collaboration with BEMIS and the Equality Network, TREEC and GRAMNet       members, including       Dr. Francesca Stella, investigated the barriers facing LGBT asylum seekers       in Scotland, under an       Equality and Human Rights Commission funded project between June 2010 and       March 2011.
Stella co-authored the joint research report Sanctuary, Safety and         Solidarity: Lesbian, Gay,         Bisexual, Transgender Asylum Seekers and Refugees in Scotland [2].
The report was shared       through events organised by the Equality Network to practitioners from       public and third sector       organisations working with asylum seekers, including the Glasgow Housing       Association.
It was       subsequently used by the Equality Network when designing training on LGBT       issues for       practitioners and service providers in the voluntary and third sector; the       Equality Network uses the       report in bespoke training as well as making it readily available online       as a training resource [3].
The report is cited by, for example, the           Metropolitan Migration Foundation (pg43) and LGBTory,         the Conservative LGBT Group       (pg9).
It was also presented to practitioners and academics in the       Netherlands examining similar issues as part of the Fleeing         Homophobia Project, funded by the       European Refugee Fund, the Dutch Ministry of Justice and other       organisations.
The report was       featured and circulated by public bodies and organisations beyond       Scotland, such as the Wales           Strategic Migration Partnership       (pg2) whose membership extends to the Welsh Government, the       Welsh Association of Assistant Chief Police Officers, and the UK Border       Agency Regional Director.
(ii) Social and Cultural Impacts of Migration: Influencing policy         debates and developments       GRAMNet and CRCEES form an important contributing force in the Convention       of Scottish Local       Authorities (CoSLA) Strategic Migration Partnership (CSMP).
Kay undertook       research with the       CSMP in 2012 which considered the social and cultural impacts of migration       in Glasgow and       involved interviews with stakeholders from organisations and services       having regular contact with,       or consideration of, issues relating to migration [4].
The Policy Manager       at CSMP notes that the       project `informed policy debates at local, regional and national         level'.
Kay and Flynn also participate in the CSMP Board, which involves senior       officer representation       from local, Scottish and UK Government and various partners in the public       and voluntary sector.
The Policy Manager also expressed the positive contribution that GRAMNet       and CRCEES make to       the work and forward planning of the CSMP through their input to the       Board, which is `...invaluable         as we seek to develop a coherent strategic approach to migration policy         matters'.
Going on to       more specifically outline collaborative initiatives with GRAMNet, he       states that they `...have greatly         enhanced our evidence base in relation to the social and cultural         impacts of migration'.
This joint       work, he notes, has included a collaborative Masters project with the CSMP       on the impact of       migrant children in Glasgow schools.
This included a placement for the       student at the CSMP       during which he converted his academic thesis into a policy paper, shared       with the Glasgow City       Council and CSMP's other partners in local government and beyond [5].
(iii) Future Memory in Red Road: Challenging imaginations through         creation of cultural         capital       GRAMNet and TREEC research fed directly into a series of public engagement       events and       activities around the translation, performance and memorialisation of       different cultures in Scotland.
In particular, Glasgow researchers led initiatives commemorating the       iconic Red Road flats in       Glasgow prior to the start of their demolition in May 2013.
The high-rises       were used to house       asylum seekers dispersed to Glasgow by the Westminster Government.
Glasgow       accommodates       the largest concentration of refugee and asylum seekers in the UK outside       of London.
Designed in       1962 as a cost-effective solution to problems of overcrowding, the Red       Road Flats were a       landmark in the city skyline for over 50 years before their removal began       as part of a social       housing regeneration programme.
By the time demolition plans were       announced in 2005, the flats       had become synonymous with poverty and deprivation.
Future Memory in Red Road was part of a larger project, `Red Road       Flats: Past, Present, Future',       which sought to collect and preserve stories, cultural artefacts and       commentary from the flats for       the future.
It brought TREEC and GRAMNet researchers together with another       AHRC-funded       initiative, `Future Memory in Place', organised through the       University of Exeter (Dr. Elena Isayev;       and artists Catrin Webster and Marion Woods).
Both projects used       collaborations with artists to       engage communities in the production and communication of research       findings.
The University of Glasgow's unique contribution was driven by research       expertise in constructions       of `home' and place-making and living with insecurity developed by Flynn       and Kay, respectively; as       well as the public engagement and knowledge transfer expertise which Kay,       Flynn, Oldfield and       Phipps brought from their lead roles in TREEC and GRAMNet.
Current and       former residents'       portraits and life stories were collected, many of which featured in the       Red Road Flats: Past,       Present and Future exhibition at the People's Palace Museum in Glasgow.
The exhibition opened       in February 2013 and will run for one year.
In 2012-13 the People's Palace       Museum attracted over       310,000 visitors, demonstrating the reach that the Red Road exhibition       will continue to have during       the rest of its run [6].
Glasgow Life &#8212; the City Council's main cultural       and heritage body &#8212; will then       archive the artefacts to memorialise the Red Road Flats and inform the       public about their history       and significance.
Future Memory in Red Road culminated in an innovative public       performance organised by       GRAMNet, TREEC and colleagues from the Future Memory in Place initiative       on 18 May 2013.
A       community choir performed the oral histories of the Flats' residents,       transposed into music, to a       gathering of approximately 500 people and against a backdrop of portraits       of residents and former       residents.
The vibrant performance allowed the translation and expression       of multiple narratives       from changing populations of migrant and non-migrant groups, challenging       public perceptions of       life at the Red Road Flats.
Other events in the project included an       archaeological site survey at the       Flats as well as a programme of oral histories developed by Stella and       Swain (Professor, CEES,       2006-present) with pupils of St. Martha's Primary School, located beside       the Red Road Flats [7].
In a related initiative the team also developed the theme of home and       migration through a series of       workshops involving pupils from five secondary schools in Glasgow,       exploring how students from       diverse cultural backgrounds expressed their understanding of place and       home through creative       forms.
The team subsequently developed the project with two of the       secondary schools,       (Shawlands Academy and Govan High School), by helping students produce a       photography       exhibition of their work and a short animated film in which they discussed       their experiences of the       project.
The exhibition was curated by Street Level Photoworks and       displayed at the University of       Glasgow in December 2012, with the launch event attracting approximately       100 guests.
Thus, by cultivating relationships with policy-makers, practitioners and       other stakeholders,       Glasgow researchers have used their research to influence refugee, asylum       and migration policy       and practice in Scotland and beyond.
