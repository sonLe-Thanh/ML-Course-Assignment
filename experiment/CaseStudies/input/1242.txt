     Dyslexia leads to major difficulties at individual, organisational and       societal levels (see Hakkaart-van Roijen et al., 2011).
The       cost-effectiveness of an intensive treatment protocol for severe dyslexia       in children has been assessed at around &#8364;58,000 per quality-adjusted life       year (QALY) for primary school children (Dyslexia 17: 256-67).
There is therefore great scope for translational dyslexia research.
All       three interconnected strands of the Sheffield translational work &#8212; theory,       diagnosis, and intervention &#8212; have led to impact in their own right, and       in combination.
Consequently, the availability, which started with the       Sheffield tests, of screening and support has had a major impact       worldwide.
Impact on educational practice nationally: uptake     The Dyslexia screening tests (DST) produced by Sheffield have been       heavily used in UK educational establishments.
The success of the first       editions led to second editions in 2004, still with strong sales, with the       DST split into two age ranges (6.5-11.5 and 11.6-16.5) to allow the tests       to be more sensitive at each age range.
The most recent sales data from       Pearson, the distributor for the kits, indicate sales from 2008-12 [S1]       of around [text removed for publication] kits per year, together with       further re-sale of forms, and show that the DST-J (aimed at primary school       children) and DST-S (aimed at secondary school children) reach not only       schools but also children's services, clinics, learning centres,       individual practitioners, psychology teams, therapy centres and       universities.
The adult test, the DAST, is extensively used in employment       and in the University sector to identify potential problems.
Impact on national education policy and practice     Ten-week intervention studies based on DEST/DST-J profiles [R5-R6]       have been identified as an example of best practice in terms of       effectiveness and cost-effectiveness [S2].
The DEST/DST series of       tests were identified as the most highly used screening tests in a report       to the Scottish government drawn from 100% of Scottish schools.
Demand for       training in the use of screening tests is high and increasing, with the       British Dyslexia Association mounting 38 training sessions annually for       both the primary and secondary sectors [S3].
As the major screening       test for adults, a subset of tests from the DAST was chosen to identify       dyslexia in 8,809 34-year-olds from the 1970 British Cohort study.
In June       2008, Fawcett's written and spoken evidence as Advisor to the Welsh       Assembly government led to national policy recommendations [S4]       that endorse the importance of early screening for dyslexia.
This approach       is now ongoing in 36 primary schools in South Wales and newly adopted for       Pembrokeshire.
The Welsh language version is recommended nationally and       has been developed in conjunction with Dyslexia Wales, whose head       describes it as "a vital tool for the assessment of children in Wales         who are taught through the medium of Welsh."
[S5]     The potential for use of the test with other disabilities was illustrated       by Action Duchenne, whose screening and intervention programme identified       a profile of difficulties amenable to support (the charity won the       National Lottery Education Award for this study, in November 2011).
"These         screening tests are particularly appropriate for a range of         developmental disabilities, because they cover a broad range and measure         fluency as well as accuracy."
[S6].
Impact internationally: translations into other languages     In many countries, including the Balkans and India, learning difficulties       have been stigmatised, so that parents have been reluctant to seek help       for their children.
Dyslexia is only recognised in two states in India,       and children are not diagnosed until age 12 or above, leading to       significant mental health issues.
The availability of screening and       support that can be delivered by teachers can cut into this cycle and so       the test has been universally welcomed [S7].
Dr Sunil Karande,       paediatrician, noted "Thank you for developing the DST-J India, which         has tremendous potential for resolving some of the issues related to         SpLD in India."
The most successful screening test in terms of sales and usage, the DST-J       for ages 6.5-11.5, has been translated into Dutch, Spanish, Indian and       Welsh and normed and published by Pearson Education.
The strongest       overseas uptake is in the Netherlands, where [text removed for publication] 	  full kits and [text removed for publication] sets of record       forms have been sold annually over this period.
Figures from Pearson India       show sales of [text removed for publication] kits during the first eleven       months of its availability.
Export of the English versions has been       steady, with [text removed for publication] full kits and [text removed for publication] 	  sets of record forms exported in 2012 [S1].
The       screening tests have also been translated into other languages and normed       for use in many countries, including Greece, Israel, South Asia, the USA       and the United Arab Emirates.
International development and policy     As a consequence of her high profile internationally, Fawcett was       appointed as "Special Envoy to the World" for Dyslexia International and       undertook a range of international profile-raising visits.
These include:            Invited presentation and launch of DST-J India at the World Education         Summit, New Delhi, 2012.
Press coverage noted `the importance of the         DST-J India in bringing about a change in the way schools identify and         support the special learning needs of children with dyslexia [S7]'.
Invited presentations and collaboration with the University of Tuzla         in Bosnia led to an invitation to Fawcett to lead a &#8364;500,000 Tempus         proposal on screening and support for dyslexic students in HE, selected         as best practice for inclusion in Tempus@20, 2011.
Adult screening tests         were normed for Bosnia and used to identify dyslexic students (it had         previously been feared that the project would fail because no dyslexic         students had been recognised).
Four TV companies broadcast material from         the final conference.
As a direct consequence, legislation was brought         in to recognise dyslexia in higher education, and a dyslexia association         was set up to provide support for children and parents in schools [S8].
Invited presentation by Fawcett in South Africa in 2008 on screening         and intervention to voluntary group SAALED led to the introduction of         free teacher training to South Africa with the University of         Johannesburg (potential 200 teachers annually from 2012)       Invited presentation in Singapore on early screening in 2009 led to         the adoption of an early intervention policy by the Dyslexia Association         of Singapore (DAS) [S9].
"If we can work with the preschool           fraternity, to identify children at risk of dyslexia, I think that           would be very good, and a big step towards helping these children much           earlier.
From the results of the past few years, over 80 per cent of           students on our preschool programme are subsequently diagnosed with           dyslexia."
[S9].
DAS has its own pre-school assessment         programme that helps to identify children who could be dyslexic, used in         conjunction with DEST [S9].
Invited presentation in Sarawak at the 1st Asia Pacific         conference on Dyslexia in June 2013 led to a commitment from the         Minister of Welfare to universal early screening beginning at pre-school         level, to allow for the implementation of appropriate interventions.
Public education and understanding     An important aspect of the screening tests has been in helping parents,       pupils, teachers and researchers to fully appreciate the range of       difficulties experienced in dyslexia.
As Vice President of the British       Dyslexia Association, Fawcett was responsible for compiling and editing       the 2013 Handbook on Dyslexia for parents, teachers and dyslexic adults.
A       key component was an article by Nicolson on Positive Dyslexia, a new       discipline that builds on the ability to diagnose weaknesses, as       represented in the DSTs, but goes beyond that to focus on the other side       of the coin, the strengths.
This work has already inspired a set of       symposia in the USA and has captured the imagination of the dyslexia       community on both sides of the Atlantic, with a slideshare presentation       attracting nearly 15,000 viewings since November 2012 [S10].
