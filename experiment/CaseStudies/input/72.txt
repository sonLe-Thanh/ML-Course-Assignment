     Impact activities:            Ten articles were written by Gordon Lynch for print and on-line media         with national and international profiles:                a) `Phone           hacking and sacrilege' was uploaded onto the Guardian         Comment is Free website on 8 July 2011, and reprinted in the Saturday         print edition of the Guardian on 9 July 2011 (250,000 copies         sold).
The Guardian played a leading role in the coverage of the         phone-hacking scandal during that week, following the publication of its         story about the hacking of Millie Dowler's phone on 5 July, and this         comment piece was one of a select number of opinion pieces chosen for         publication by the Guardian during the height of public interest         in this story.
b) six blog           pieces on the relevance of Durkheim's concept of the sacred for         understanding contemporary society were published as part of the `How to         Believe' series for the Guardian Comment is Free website from 10         December 2012 to 14 January 2013.
Comment is Free does not provide         details of individual page hits but has said that each post has, on         average, 10,000 readers.
These articles received a total of 1076         comments on the Guardian website by 31 July 2013.       c) `Shamed media: News           Corp, the profane and the sacred' and `Remapping           space in the wake of violence' (on the murders committed by Anders         Behring Brievik) were published on 13 July 2011 and 29 July 2011         respectively, on The Revealer website, a public engagement         project run by the Center for Media and Religion at New York University.
d) `Re-discovering           values after the English riots' was published on the Open         Democracy website on 17 August 2011.
Gordon Lynch was invited by the RSA to give a lecture, on 17 October         2011, with Prof. Jeffrey Alexander on `The Power of the Sacred' to an         audience of more than 200 RSA Fellows.
An audio           podcast and edited           film of this event were subsequently uploaded onto the RSA website         and the RSA's Youtube channel.
Lynch was also an invited speaker at the         Hay Literary Festival Fringe, on 4 June 2012, on a panel discussion of         journalism after the phone-hacking scandal chaired by Samira Ahmed         (BBC), which also included Yasmin Alibah-Brown (national columnist),         John Tomlinson (QC for victims of phone hacking) and John Kampfner         (former editor of the New Statesman), a film of which was         subsequently made           available online by the event organizers.
Four on-line films, `What           is Sacred?
', `The           Cult of the Child' (on the sacralization of the care of children),         `One Hour           to Save the Nation' (on the sacralization of nationalism and human         rights) and `Is           Nature Sacred?
', were produced by Gordon Lynch in conjunction with         Truetube, an award-winning provider of free on-line educational         materials for religious education, PSHE and citizenship education at         Keystages 3 and 4.
These films were uploaded to Truetube's website with         associated lesson plans in October 2011.
A launch event for the films         was held at Lambeth Palace on 1 February 2012, and attendees included         the Chair of the RE Council, a representative of the National         Association of SACRE's, as well as members of local SACRE's, teachers         and journalists who write on on-line educational materials.
On the basis of his lecture at the RSA, Lynch was appointed in 2012 as         one of the lead advisers for a research programme on the significance of         spirituality and the sacred in contemporary society currently being         undertaken within the Social Brain Centre at the RSA (see sources #1).
He advised the Centre on a successful application for funding for the         project from the Templeton Foundation and his work was cited in           an early article on this project written by the Centre's Director,         Dr Jonathan Rowson, in July 2013 for the RSA's quarterly journal.
The         journal is available online as well as being circulated to its 27,000         Fellows who are based in 80 countries around the world.
Reach of impact:     The extent of public engagement with these impact activities is indicated       by the following:            The print version of the `Phone hacking and sacrilege' article and         seven articles for the Guardian Comment is Free website alone         are likely to have had a minimum of 150,000- 200,000 readers.
Truetube estimate that by 31 July 2013, around 57,000 Keystage 3 and 4         students in the UK had watched the films on the sacred (sources #2).
By 31 July 2013 the film of the `Power of the Sacred' lecture had been         viewed 9,878 times on the RSA's Youtube channel with 107 `likes'.
In addition to first viewings of this material, on-line articles and         films were re-circulated by users through other sites.
Details of the         articles in the Comment is Free `How to Believe' series were, for         example, posted 271 times on to individual Facebook pages and 232 times         on individual Twitter accounts.
In one instance, the third blog in this         series, on sacred ritual, was tweeted by Sonali Ranade in India to her         35,537 followers, with her describing it as a `searing insight' into         morally-charged public protest in the context of the mass protests in         response to the Dehli rape case in December 2012 (sources #3).
These figures suggest that a minimum 250,000-300,000 people are likely         to have read or viewed one or more of these impact materials on the         cultural sociology of the sacred.
Significance of impact:     The overall aim of the impact activities was to encourage more widespread       use of a cultural sociological understanding of the sacred to interpret       contemporary social life.
This change was evident in audience responses       that indicated that this framework was understood and perceived as       interesting, useful and worthy of serious discussion:            The online films produced in conjunction with Truetube were named         `Humanities resource of the week' in the 17 February 2012 issue of the Times           Educational Supplement, with the editor writing that the `films         are fascinating and explore how the sacred can be both profound and         problematic' (see sources #4).
In an evaluation of the Truetube films with Year 10 GCSE Religious         Studies students, respondents commented that they had learned from         watching and talking about the films that the `sacred is not all about         God and religion', `it allows you to critically think about "religion"         and "sacred" and compare what the two mean and whether sacred should         always be linked to religion', `it helps us to see what is important in         our lives', it made `us question what is important, sacred to us', and         that `the sacred can be used to describe a thought or feeling not just         an object' (see sources #5).
Material produced through impact activities (i-iii) above was         circulated and re-used on other websites.
Lynch (2012a) was cited as a         key text on a           resource page on the sacred on the website Philosophy Talk.Org, a         public out-reach programme of Stanford University.
The RSA film, `The         Power of the Sacred', was also adapted as an           educational resource on the leading American educational website,         TED-ED.com.
Two of the Guardian `How to Believe' articles on         Durkheim were reproduced           in full on the website for the Ash Center for Democratic         Governance and Innovation at Harvard University which circulates         resources for policy-makers and policy advisers.
Lynch (2012a) was described as a `lucid reconsideration of the term         "sacred"' by Bernice Martin in the Times Literary Supplement         (see sources #6).
The Truetube films were described as `intriguing and         explore how the sacred can be both profound and problematic [in ways         that are] accessible for a teenage audience' by the national religious         education magazine, SACRE News (vol.
12, p. 13; see sources #6)         and as `an excellent resource to kick-start debates in lessons and         perhaps unexpectedly bring together the subjects of RE, PSHE and         Citizenship by taking a modern approach to asking the question, "what is         sacred?"'
by bee-it.co.uk,         a leading website for the use of technological resources in the         education sector.
Positive comments about impact materials and activites were also made         by other readers.
On his blog (19 August 2011), the journalist Mark         Vernon wrote           that `Gordon Lynch has penned an excellent piece for Open           Democracy on the riots and the habits of virtue', and tweeted this         comment to his 497 followers on Twitter.
Comments on `The Power of the         Sacred' film left on on Youtube also indicated that many viewers had         understood and welcomed this analytical framework.
As one respondent         wrote, `the video shows how important the sacred is to our very secular         lives.
[It] is the unconscious of society.'
Stuart Porter, Director of Innovation and Development at Truetube, has         written that `the subject matter of the sacred films was extremely         interesting to us, and we felt that it would be a strong addition to the         RE section of our site.
The films took a sideways look at religion and         religious behaviour that was a refreshing departure from the usual         knowledge-based films we have for Religious Education.
The films         encourage higher-level thinking in pupils, in terms of understanding the         content, in reflecting upon it, and applying it.
Pupils sometimes         question why they are studying a religion they don't believe in, but         seeing the world in terms of what is deemed "sacred" and what is thought         of as "profane" helps teachers to explain the importance of deeply held         beliefs whether they are religious or secular, and how they might affect         a person's or a society's behaviour' (see sources #7).
Neil McKain, Head         of Religious Studies and Philosophy at John Hampden Grammar School in         High Wycombe, similarly commented that the films `ask profound questions         about whether or not religion is the same as sacred and whether or not         religions `own' sacred anymore.
The tone of the film on children as         sacred clearly engaged my class and, though entertained by it, they came         up with some incredibly thoughtful responses afterwards' (see sources         #8).
