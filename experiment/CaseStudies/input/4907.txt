     Sakel's research on Moset&#233;n has benefitted the speakers, as well as the       wider community, in two       distinct ways:     a) establishing bilingual education programmes, and;     b) raising awareness and changing attitudes.
Both of these have contributed to the maintenance and long-term       sustainability of the Moset&#233;n       language.
a) Sakel's research made it possible to establish bilingual education       programmes for the       Mosetenes [6].
This was in part facilitated by Sakel's accessible       Spanish-language       grammar for the language, as well as Sakel's training of Moset&#233;n speakers       in the       preparation of educational materials.
For example, Sakel's main Moset&#233;n       collaborator [1],       was involved in the preparation of a number of these educational materials       [6], based on       his status as `bilingual educator' due to his work with Sakel [1], as well       as his previous       experience in developing a range of teaching materials for Moset&#233;n in       collaboration with       Sakel [4].
Sakel arranged for these materials to be shared online [4], to       be accessed by the       speakers and educators (as well as found via a simple Google search) [5].
b) Sakel's work has raised awareness of the Moset&#233;n language and has       contributed to a       change in attitudes towards the language by its speakers as well as by       outsiders.
According       to the evidence given by a German Aid worker based in Bolivia who wrote       her PhD thesis       about conflicts between Mosetenes and other actors in the region [2], the       Spanish-       language grammar has given the speakers a way of authenticating the fact       that they speak       a full language, not a mere dialect.
It has put Moset&#233;n on the Bolivian       map alongside much       larger and dominant indigenous languages, such as Aymara and Quechua.
Sakel's work on       Moset&#233;n has led to a measurable change in mind-set and identity amongst       the speakers of       Moset&#233;n. While the language can still be considered endangered today, many       speakers       have become aware of the value of Moset&#233;n, both as a good among the people       themselves, but also as a marker of ethnic identity that can be exploited       in their newly       developed projects of eco-tourism.
This change in attitudes towards the       Moset&#233;n language       was documented by the German Aid worker in her study of the conflicts and       relations       between peoples in the region, in which the status of the Moset&#233;n language       played a       central role [2] (originally in Spanish).
She concluded that "a new       awareness of the       importance of the native language" has arisen as a result of Sakel's work.
It is possible to measure the impact of Sakel's research in the following       ways:     Testimonials.
1) by a prominent Moset&#233;n speaker who became a locally recognised       authority and bilingual       educator through his work with Sakel [1].
2) by an Austrian neurologist, who worked with the Mosetenes during       2012-13 and who testifies to       the use of Moset&#233;n today, as well as the status of [1] as an authority in       his language through his       work with Sakel [2].
3) by a German geographer based in Bolivia, who wrote her PhD thesis       (2010) on conflicts       between Mosetenes and settlers in the Moset&#233;n region and who is now       working as an aid worker       in lowland Bolivia.
She testifies to Sakel's influence in changing       attitudes towards the Moset&#233;n       language, which she both encountered through her own research on the       group, as well as by living       in the community and gaining an in-depth knowledge of the people and their       language.
She       comments that "the current Bolivian Government tries to introduce       bilingual education in the       regional native languages... and this would be impossible without the       professional materials       provided by Dr Sakel" [3].
Statistics from Sakel's Academia profile     These show the access to materials made available online by Sakel and       include educational       materials provided by Huasna and Sakel [4], as well as a pre-publication       version of Sakel's       Spanish-language grammar of Moset&#233;n and Chimane [5].
Statistics show that       the latter is       accessed approximately twice a day from Bolivia, usually referred by       Google [5].
The most       common search keywords &#8212; all in Spanish &#8212; appear to be from the general       public, typically       including questions about customs of the Mosetenes or the words for       specific cultural goods.
The presence of Moset&#233;n in public discourses inside Bolivia     Sakel's work has facilitated and inspired not only Bolivian academics,       but especially members of       the Bolivian public to be interested in the Moset&#233;n language.
This has       involved the development of       language materials for bilingual education and cites Sakel's work in a       blog about language       maintenance in the Amazon [6].
