     The primary impacts from our work are on public policy, practice and       health &#8212; with the key beneficiaries being government (international and       national), international and national non-governmental organisations,       public sector and charitable organisations (including schools), healthcare       providers and the broader public.
International Policy and Practice &#8212; Physical Activity Guidelines     The Canadian physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines which       Riddoch helped co-produce have been endorsed and promoted since 2010 by       the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Society for Exercise       Physiology and ParticipACTION [10].
ParticipACTION is a not-for-profit       organisation solely dedicated to inspiring and supporting healthy and       active living for Canadians.
In 2010-12, ParticipACTION launched a       multi-million dollar national media campaign including television and       radio adverts, newspaper articles, and toolkits specifically developed for       health practitioners, teachers, parents and children.
The announcement of       the new guidelines by ParticipACTION generated more than 100 million       earned media impressions [11] and over 50% of parents of 7-12 years olds       reported that they had become more active as a family, spoken to their       children about being more active, or established stricter rules regarding       sedentary behaviour, as a result of viewing the ParticipACTION campaign       [12].
In addition, as described by the CEO of Active Healthy Kids Canada "the         Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for children serve as a         scientifically grounded benchmark against which the physical activity         levels of Canadian youth are assessed" [13].
The guidelines are also       used to benchmark population levels of physical activity in Canada via       national surveys, including the Canadian Community Health Survey       (N&gt;65,000 individuals &gt;11 years) and the National longitudinal       Survey of Children &amp; Youth (N&gt;35,000 individuals 0-11 years) [10].
Assisting International Agencies with their mission &#8212; International         Olympic Committee     The IOC consensus statement which Riddoch helped co-produce includes       recommendations for governments, international sports organisations,       non-governmental organisations as well as for future research &#8212; all of       which has been disseminated via the IOC website since 2011 [14].
This       consensus statement is used by the IOC to help fulfil their mission &#8212; for       example, it was used by IOC president Jacques Rogge in his address to the       General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) in New York in September 2011       [14].
In the subsequent UN resolution on the prevention of       non-communicable diseases (Resolution A/66/L.1), the importance and role       of physical activity in children was highlighted as a global priority.
National and Local Policy and Practice &#8212; Physical Activity     Research from Bath has influenced national and local policies regarding       physical activity promotion and guidance throughout the UK.
The technical       report that Riddoch helped to co-produce was used as the basis for updated       UK Physical Activity Guidelines for children and adults that were released       in 2011 [15].
These guidelines form the basis of the Chief Medical       Officer's (CMO) report `Start Active, Stay Active' which has been       distributed to all PCTs, local authorities, voluntary organisations (etc)       throughout the UK [16].
The CMO report is endorsed and disseminated by       agencies such as NHS choices [17], Macmillan Cancer Support and the       British Heart Foundation.
The physical activity guidelines pages within       NHS Choices receive approximately 23,000 visitors per month.
The British       Heart Foundation National Centre for physical activity and health has used       the guidelines to develop a resource for people directly involved with the       promotion of physical activity to children (e.g., teachers, youth workers,       public health commissioners) helping them to interpret the guidelines to       inform their practice [18].
Locally, Gillison and Standage have used their research to influence       strategy and policies for children's health and wellness within Bath and       North East Somerset.
This includes tailored recommendations to meet       specific local needs/challenges [e.g., Grant 3]; including direction on       how to produce resources which engage parents with local obesity       prevention strategies [19], and input into the design and content of an       initiative to replace Healthy Schools (The Director of Public Health       Award) [20].
This package was adopted by 41% of local schools in its first       year.
National and Local Policy and Practice &#8212; Energy Requirements     The revised Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) co-produced by Riddoch and       published by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition are reported       directly to Public Health England, the Department of Health and other       government departments.
The advice given to health professionals and those       planning menus for specific groups in the UK since 2011 has been changed       [21] and so too has the generic advice to the general public via NHS       Choices [22].
National Policy and Practice &#8212; UK National Curriculum     The BtBYCB London 2012 initiative which Standage, Cumming, and Gillison       helped to refine, improve and evaluate [23] was successfully launched by       21st Century Legacy in March 2011.
The aim of 21st       Century is to have 80% of secondary schools in the UK participating in the       BtBYCB programme by 2016 [24].
HRH the Princess Royal provided the       following endorsment "The BtBYCB programme is a great way to help         fulfil the promise that the London 2012 Olympic Games would be an         inspiration to the youth of Britain and the rest of the world.
The         Programme, which inspires, engages and empowers young people, gives them         the opportunity to find their unique potential and to follow their         dreams" [24].
By July 2013, BtBYCB had already been delivered to       over 115,000 pupils in a diverse range of schools across England,       Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland [25].
The programme has a broader       reach than physical activity alone as indicated in the following statement       from the founder of 21st Century Legacy, "Schools report         that the enthusiasm generated by BtBYCB, driven by the programme's focus         on personal agenda, is leading to increased aspirations in other areas         of students' lives" [23].
The development of the programme received       support from the Chair of Ofsted who commented that the unique       characteristics of BtBYCB "...gives your dynamic project a real         credibility that is not often found in other projects whose aspirations         may be similar" [26].
In April 2012, the BtBYCB initiative was       integrated into the New Curriculum for Secondary Schools (under the       subject heading of PSHE; Key Stage 3).
That is, via ASDAN Education, the       completion of BtBYCB now results in 3-credits towards the Certificate of       Personal Effectiveness GCSE equivalent qualification [24].
