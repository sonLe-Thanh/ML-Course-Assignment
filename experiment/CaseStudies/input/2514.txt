     Linear optimization and quadratic optimization are at the heart of       numerous industrial and commercial applications of mathematics.
These       arise in very different problems and in broad variety of sectors of the       economy &#8212; finance, energy, telecommunications, transport, manufacturing,       to mention but a few.
Although many such problems involve some form of       nonlinearity, the need to find a compromise between modelling accuracy and       ability to solve the resulting optimization problem often necessitates       using simplifying assumptions and employing the modelling based on linear       and quadratic optimization.
As a result, millions of optimization problems       are solved every day and the vast majority of them, 90-95%, rely on linear       or quadratic optimization models.
The ability to solve such problems efficiently is therefore crucial.
In       many situations, optimization problems have to be solved in real-time;       this is for example the case when optimizing portfolios in high-frequency       trading, when optimizing the usage of electricity transmission networks       following the changes in energy demand, assigning frequencies to mobile       phone communications, scheduling crew for sea or air transport, etc.
The       corresponding businesses are worth billions of pounds and any improvement       in their operations achieved by optimization is of great value to the       companies and to society.
An indication of the size of the optimization       software market is provided by the investment made in recent years by       major companies: in 2009, IBM (market capital $220B) acquired ILOG, then       owner of Cplex software for $340M (see http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/26403.wss); in       2008 Fair Isaac (FICO, market capital $1.7B) acquired DASH, owner of the       software Xpress (see http://www.fico.com/en/Company/News/Pages/01-22-2008.aspx).
Fast optimization solvers that can deliver reliable answers to       challenging problems in acceptable time frames are the key to the       successes of Cplex, DASH and others.
The methods developed by Gondzio,       specifically the technique of multiple centrality corrections [1], special       preconditioners for KKT systems [2] and warmstarting techniques [3-4] have       influenced the design of these modern optimization software.
Multiple       centrality corrections, in particular, have been implemented in all major       commercial optimization solvers: IBM-Cplex, Gurobi, MOSEK, FICO Xpress,       and in numerous academic optimization solvers: PCx, BPMPD, HOPDM, OOQP and       OOPS [5-9].
Their use contributes to these codes' ability to solve       difficult optimization problems.
In some cases their use is essential to       ensure that a problem can be solved at all.
Their importance is reflected       in a remark by a senior executive from Gurobi Optimization who stated that       `it is not possible to build a competitive interior point code without       centrality correctors' [6].
The following optimization solvers, which together dominate the       optimization market, use multiple centrality corrections:            IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer [5]         http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/        Gurobi Optimization [6]         http://www.gurobi.com/        MOSEK [7]         http://www.mosek.com/        FICO Xpress Optimization Suite [8]         http://www.fico.com/en/Products/DMTools/Pages/FICO-Xpress-Optimization-Suite.aspx        PCx [9]         http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/PCx/        OOQP [9]         http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp/reference-manual/classGondzioSolver.html           Gondzio's research has therefore had an economic impact on the companies       commercialising these solvers, and on their numerous customers across the       world.
