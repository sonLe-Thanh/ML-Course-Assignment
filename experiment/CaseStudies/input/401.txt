     Latin-American economies have traditionally been unable to decouple       environmental damage from economic growth, with low levels of       governability leading to poor management of the resulting risk posed to       local communities.
In this context, by providing a methodology that can       help those involved achieve increased awareness, improved understanding       and effective risk management, CBS researchers have enabled governments       and corporations in Latin America to make progress towards alleviating       risk hotspots.
By using the framework developed, risk maps were produced       for Argentina, Spain and Bolivia, and for selected regions within these       countries.
In each case, the project created quantitative indicators and a       methodology for data collection adapted to the local conditions and       resources.
In Brazil, researchers focused exclusively on case study       material due to the lack of available data for producing the maps.
Argentina     In Argentina, CBS research has contributed to "a much needed better         understanding of relations between poverty, vulnerability and         environmental impact among policy-makers and communities"5.1.
The impact has been felt in two main areas of policy development &#8212;         infrastructure and education.
The Ministry of Planning, Public Investment and Services has       taken up the methodology to evaluate the environmental hazard posed by       firms and integrated it into cost benefit analyses of the       socio-environmental impacts of new infrastructure projects at the national         level.
This adoption was the result of representatives from the       Ministry being involved in the project from the outset; this ensured a "high         level of bottom-up engagement", which gave users "the opportunity         to be part of the design of objectives and products of the project from         its early stages.
In this way, the outcomes of the project have been         responsive to the needs and context of [the] organization.
"5.2     In 2012, the research team signed a Technical Cooperation Agreement with       the Ministry of Infrastructure, Buenos Aires Province, to       "use the results of this project to identify target areas of the         Strategic Plan for Water and Sanitation, specifically for the expansion         of health infrastructure and optimization of existing infrastructure,         maximizing the benefits in terms of reduced environmental risk, health         and social vulnerability"5.3.
The Provincial         Department of Public Utilities Water and Sewer, Buenos Aires,       have successfully applied the maps and methodology to identify "populations         that are in situations of vulnerability"5.4 that can be       mitigated by sanitation infrastructure.
CBS researchers helped technicians       to adapt the methodology to capture situations of sanitation risk.
The       approach has also been integrated into the geographic information system       that supports the province's "MasterPlan" (a works plan for       infrastructure)5.4.
A report published in 2010 by the Defensor del Pueblo de la Naci&#243;n       (ombudsman) in Argentina (an independent body related to the Argentine       National Congress responsible for the defence of human rights) presented       the conceptual and methodological framework contained in 3.5 as part of an       Environmental Risk Atlas of Argentina's Children5.5.
The       Atlas was the output from a United Nations Development Programme       (UNDP)-sponsored project and provides a tool for the government to assess       the interaction between environmental hazards arising from production       activities and/or services, and human groups susceptible to being affected       by them.
Natenzon, also of the Environment and Natural Resources Research       Program (PIRNA) of the University of Buenos Aires, presented the framework       to the technical team in charge of the project in two workshops.
Since       2012, the Ministry of Education of the City of Buenos Aires has       used the project's findings and methodology in two of its school         programmes &#8212; Plan Sarmiento and Escuelas Verdes (Green Schools)5.6.
Plan Sarmiento is an integral part of the Ministry's Digital Education       Plan and aims to promote innovation in teaching and learning processes       within the new digital society model.
The Green Schools programme aims to       promote sustainable development through environmental education and       management.
The project's findings and methodology, including interactive       maps, have been used "to introduce the concepts of social         vulnerability to primary school children" and feedback from teachers       "suggests that maps are powerful resources to introduce the topics of         environmental threats and its relation to social vulnerabilities, mainly         because they are based on visual information.
This seems to be more         friendly and engaging..."5.1 The project has also "informed         the successful implementation"5.1 of a Buenos Aires       Municipality supported project, `Fantasias           2.0'.
This project followed on from a pilot project funded by       the telecommunications giant Telefonica and examined by researchers as an       example of a community- business partnership.
The initiative, designed to       break poverty traps by stimulating creative thinking in children from of       one of the most critical hotspot areas mapped in Argentina (La Boca       neighborhood), subsequently underpinned the development of a similar       initiative in schools5.1.
Brazil     In Brazil, the research impact has been centred on the biofuel sector.
In       2004, the Federal Government introduced the National Biodiesel Program a       key element of which was the incorporation of small-scale family farmers       into the supply chain.
In a case study, researchers analysed the       interaction between actors and processes in the programme, offering       insights into its effectiveness of as a sustainable development tool.
This       opened avenues to influence the thinking of the corporate world, with       researchers being invited by the multinational firm Petrobras to       investigate how they in particular could engage small-scale farmers while       promoting sustainability in the Biodiesel Program.
Findings were published       in 2010 as part of the UNDP's International Policy Centre for Inclusive       Growth's (IPC-IG's) series of research briefs (Retrofitting           the Brazilian Biodiesel Programme: Implications for Policy Design)       and working papers (Productive           Inclusion of Smallholder Farmers in Brazil's Biodiesel Value Chain:           Programme Design, Institutional incentives and Stakeholders           Constraints).
To date, the impact of this research, enhanced       by Zapata's move to become a researcher at the IPC-IG, has been to:     Inform policy debates The Brazilian Government invited       researchers to present their findings to the Presidency of Brazil (with       the participation of senior public officials).
The research and its policy       implications featured in two Brazilian radio programs, including the `Talk       about Politics' programme from the Chamber of Deputies for which Zapata       was interviewed (The           National Program for Production and Use of Biofuels in debate,       20 May 2011) and which is very influential for future policy negotiations.
The bio-fuels research also successfully engaged a global audience.
In       August 2010, Zapata was invited to present the biofuel case study to both       the Ministry of Science and Technology of China5.7 and to the       UNDP in India.
Furthermore, in 2012, the IPC-IG working paper was cited in       a policy briefing prepared by `Evidence and Lessons from Latin America', a       programme sponsored by the UK Government Department for International       Development5.8.
Inform CSR policies Among their recommendations to       Petrobras, published as a short policy brief by the IPC-IG in 2010 (How           can Petrobras Biocombust&#237;veis engage small-scale farmers while           promoting sustainability in Brazil's Biodiesel Program?)
and       presented directly to the company's technical arm, was an enhancement of       stakeholder integration into the programme.
Enhance public understanding The research findings       contributed to the wider public debate in Brazil via online news articles,       for example, by Ang&#234;ncia Brazil, the national broadcaster who quoted       Zapata in a 2011 article (Lack           of investment in research threatens the hegemony of Brazilian           sugarcane ethanol, experts say), and via a television show on       bio-fuels.
In Bolivia, the research results and methodology have been       included in the curricula of Secondary School Pestalozzi, in Sucre.
After       the project, a conference was introduced to disseminate the results to       students.
The conference has been "well received" and the content       is considered to be "of interest to the students and teachers and even         parents."
In 2013, the research was introduced into the school's       Workshop on Entrepreneurship in order to "teach how the environmental         risks of a venture have to be evaluated and taken into account within         the business plan."
[5.9]     In Spain, the primary beneficiaries of the research are       firms looking to establish operations in developing countries.
The results       of the project contributed to the enhancement of the CSR standards of the       Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Almeria Province which represents       42,000 firms.
This professional association states on their website       how the results of the project have informed the design of "internationalization         strategies" aimed at reconciling "the achievement of competitive         advantage with sustainable development"5.10 and the       recent introduction of a form to register interest in a dossier with       recommendations from the project has seen 520 requests.
