     Impact 1: Educational (See Corroborating Statements 1, 2)             Increase in singing in schools: Musical Director, Matt Baker,         visited weekly to teach production songs (lyrics by Newall,         music by Baker), and encourage teachers to rehearse them months in         advance of formal rehearsals.
Cultural impact: scheduled singing in         schools.
Song lyrics were not production-specific, but thematic, so         schools `owned' them, continuing to use them in school concerts,         assemblies etc.
(see lyrics in REF2 Practice Portfolio).
Opportunities for students to perform: (singing and/or playing         instruments) as school groups but outside of school and with other         school students (A View from the Hill; Forgotten Fortress;         The Chester Giants: A Community Opera).
Impact 2: Local Communities, the general public and audiences Cultural         and economic impacts include:             A rise in community contact and audience numbers: 1.
Tours initially scheduled across the Cheshire circuit of the Rural         Touring Network (RTN) extended into the Lancashire Rural Touring         Network, Edge Hill University, and Showzam, Blackpool's annual         Festival.
Even in RTN venues with small capacities (often as small as 30         seats) occupancy was sometimes below capacity in the initial stages.
Year on year, audiences increased, with venues selling out on the night,         or in advance, leading to subsequent performances being scheduled for         two nights rather than one in certain venues.
This audience development         process made it possible to attract lost audiences back into Chester for         a new community adaptation of A Christmas Carol (2012), which         sold out before opening night.
Current production, The Snow Queen         is also demonstrating equally strong advance sales.

Be           the Best that You Can Be (commissioned by A Handbag of Harmonies,         for Across the World, BBC Music Nation Weekend: BBC/LOCOG         Festival, Cultural Olympiad 2012) was performed by over 700 people from         across Cheshire to 5000 people (3 March 2012).
Theatre in the Quarter         reprised it for Olympic Torch relay celebrations (Chester; Tatton Park),         and for the visit of HRH Queen Elizabeth II to Chester.
It was filmed to         show the process of making the work, as well as the final performance         (Other Source (OS) 2).
New audiences in difficult to reach places: the inclusion of         schools in less affluent and deprived areas of Chester brought in people         &#8212; parents, families &#8212; who might not usually visit the theatre and/or who         have never visited a theatre before.
Direct targeting facilitated         inclusion of schools such as Blacon Primary School, with matin&#233;es and         evening performances given at Blacon Community Centre, leading to these         communities having the opportunity to engage with cultural narratives         and histories (Corroborating Statements (CS) 3 and 4).
Increased community participation: community singers/players &#8212;         choirs were incorporated into narratives as a body of characters;         ghostly ancestors (Forgotten Fortress); 1940s radio station         audience (Home for Christmas) and were included in all         performances, but increasing demand for participation and stage design         economies required for small venues led to the creation of teams         performing in rotation.
Community participation rose from 20 choristers         (Silent Night, 2008) to 140 (A Christmas Carol, 2012) (CS         3).
Increased community awareness of their environment: the         Hillforts project in particular led to greater engagement with, and         appreciation of, the local environment and history by people in the         community (OS 1).
Expenditure in local economies: It was company policy, where         possible, to employ locally based artists, or those originally from the         area.
Impacts thus include `local spend' of company grants and artists'         income close to rehearsal location (Garden Lane Methodist Church:         rehearsal charges at &#163;500 per project); actors received Equity rates and         daily subsistence allowance (food, etc.
); actors and artists rented         rooms locally (CS 3).
Increased opportunities to see professional music theatre &#8212;         bringing musical theatre to a wider audience, either in Chester, or on         The Rural Touring Network circuit (CS 4).
Audience spend: venues in the Rural Touring scheme are         subsidised by the Network, but rely on additional audience spend:         capacity audiences mean that beverages sales and raffles can raise more         income.
Artist Employment (See CS 3, 5)     The critical success of CCITT projects led to commissions for Theatre in       the Quarter to create five new works (2011-14).
Further impact is claimed,       therefore, in terms of the company's ability to employ creative artists       with concomitant financial, cultural, and creative career benefits to       them.
In the census period, the company has employed over 50 artists &#8212;       actors, designers, writers, musicians, stage-managers &#8212; some of them       repeatedly, and all at Equity rates (CS 3, 5; OS 2).
Commissions include:             Forgotten Fortress (2011), commissioners: UK government         initiative, Habitats and Hillforts; Cheshire RTN (developing themes,         songs from A View from the Hill).
James (2011), commissioner: Frank Field MP; funders: The King         James Bible Trust; The Arts Council.
A Jacobean Christmas (2011), commissioner: Hampton Court Palace         (to develop James); funders: The King James Bible Trust; The         Arts Council.
It Will All Be Over by Christmas (January 2013, for production         in 2014): a short play for railway stations, commissioner: Cheshire West         and Chester, Cheshire East local authorities        Silent Night (January 2013, for production in 2014):         Cheshire-specific rewrite; commissioners: Cheshire West and Chester,         Cheshire East local authorities.
Apprenticeships: Theatre in the Quarter employs local       `apprentices', some of whom (e.g.
David Edwards) are now training or       working professionally as assistant directors or semi-professional       community actors (CS 3).
