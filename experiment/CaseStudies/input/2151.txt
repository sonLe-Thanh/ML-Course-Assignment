     The Newcastle research demonstrating the feasibility of preventing the       transmission of mitochondrial disease using PNT has led to a chain of       impacts in the spheres of public policy and public debate resulting in a       Government commitment to change the law in the UK.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (as amended in 2008),       only permits eggs and embryos that have not had their nuclear or       mitochondrial DNA altered to be used for treatment.
However, the Act       allows for regulations to be passed by Parliament that will legally allow       such alterations in order to prevent the transmission of serious       mitochondrial disease.
The sequence of events leading to the proposed       introduction of these regulations, on which Newcastle research and       researchers had an impact, is outlined below.
Impacts on public policy debates: the regulator.
In 2005 the regulator (the HFEA) licensed Newcastle researchers to       conduct research: Mitochondrial DNA Disorders: Is there a way to         prevent transmission?
(EV a) and in April 2010 the results of       research on pronuclear transfer were published online in Nature       [R2].
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, in a       2013 debate, noted, `In 2010, Newcastle researchers approached the         Department of Health and, in the light of their progress, requested that         we consider introducing regulations to allow mitochondria replacement in         treatment.'
(EV b).
As a consequence of this, the HFEA Scientific         and Clinical Advances Advisory Committee met in May 2010 to consider       developments and Newcastle researchers were invited to present evidence       (EV c).
In February 2011 The Secretary of State for Health asked the HFEA       to carry out a formal scientific review and in April 2011 they reported       (EV d).
Newcastle provided two of only seven experts who were invited to       give evidence.
The review recommended a minimum set of experiments that       were critical to a decision about the safety of the methods, including       work on PNT in both humans and non-human primates.
As a consequence of R2,       the human PNT research on normally-fertilised oocytes formed a substantial       part of the research plan for the Wellcome Trust Mitochondrial Research       Centre, established in Newcastle in April 2011.
This work and the analysis       in R2 were reported to the HFEA Scientific and Clinical Advances         Advisory Committee in 2013, Professors Turnbull, Herbert and Murdoch       having been invited to participate in the first core panel meeting (EV d).
As a result of this research and that of others showing a lack of success       of PNT in macaque monkeys, the Committee removed the requirement for       further work in non-human primates in 2013 (EV d contains both the 2011       and 2013 findings).
Meanwhile, in June 2011 the HFEA Ethics and Law Committee       considered the ethical and legal aspects of PNT and MST to combating       mitochondrial disease.
The result of this was a paper, published in 2012       and incorporating information derived from Newcastle research, which was       circulated to inform debate and discussion within the HFEA and more       broadly among external stakeholders (EV e).
Impact on society: Consultation exercises stimulate public debate         2012-13.
In January 2012 the Secretaries of State for Health and for Business,       Innovation and Skills jointly asked the HFEA to seek public views on new       techniques to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease.
The       public consultation ran from July - December 2012 and the final report       noted that 90 participants engaged in deliberative workshops and that       other activities, including schools events, engaged with at least 2,967       members of the public (EV f).
January 2012 also saw the Nuffield Council on Bioethics open a call for       evidence that ran through January and February 2012 for a report on the       ethics of novel techniques to prevent mitochondrial diseases.
In total, 92       organisations and individuals contributed evidence and several Newcastle       researchers are cited in the full report, published in June 2012 (EV g).
Impact on Parliamentary debate.
In March 2013 the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology       published a POSTNote (an accessible review for Parliamentarians) on new       techniques for preventing mitochondrial disease.
This referenced both the       Newcastle Nature paper (R2) and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics report       to which Newcastle researchers contributed (EV h).
The issues raised in the various sources of information and advice given       to parliamentarians were aired in a Westminster Hall adjournment debate in       June 2013, initiated by a Newcastle MP.
In the debate, the Parliamentary       Under-Secretary of State for Health said,     I pay great tribute to researchers at the International Centre for         Life in Newcastle [the building in which the PNT research takes       place] ... it is a fine institution.
They have been developing their         groundbreaking expertise for many years.
In anticipation of significant         advances in this field, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990         was amended in 2008 to introduce a regulation-making power that, if         implemented, would enable mitochondria replacement to take place in         treatment.
(EV b, col: 64.)
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health went on to make       clear that the Government would consider the issue, led by the Chief       Medical Officer.
The decision was announced in late June 2013 that draft       legislation that will be brought forward to permit the use of PNT in       treatment.
The Chief Medical Officer noted that about 10 families each       year could be affected and said,     Scientists have developed ground-breaking new procedures which could         stop these diseases being passed on, bringing hope to many families         seeking to prevent their future children inheriting them.
It's only         right that we look to introduce this life-saving treatment as soon as we         can.
(EV i)     Newcastle University researchers, as the only group in the UK licensed to       conduct PNT research have thus been at the heart of developments in public       policy and law in what remains a challenging and ethically sensitive       research area.
