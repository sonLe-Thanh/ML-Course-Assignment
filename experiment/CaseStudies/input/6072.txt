     Taras' research outputs have informed her own professional practice in       her teaching and research roles, and have also had considerable impact       within the University of Sunderland, through her University Teaching       fellowship.
Her work has had impact on debate and practice in HE and       schools, nationally and internationally.
The main beneficiaries of Taras' work have been academic staff in HEIs in       the UK and overseas, and their students.
Her work has also been applied in       a Swedish research study in improving practice in language learning in       secondary schools.
Taras' theoretical work and empirical research has been disseminated       through publication in prestigious refereed journals (eg Assessment and       Evaluation in HE, Teaching in HE, the British Journal of Education       Studies, Journal of Further and Higher Education).
presentations at c40 national and international conferences concerned         with student learning and assessment practices and theories since 2001,         including many invited presentations and keynotes, see:         http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/view/creators/Taras=3AMaddalena=3A=3A.html        Invitations to lead staff development activities at keynotes and         seminars on developing assessment practice at the University of         Sunderland and other universities (eg Buckingham New 2013 (Keynote),         Bolton 2012 (Keynote), Durham 2011, Liverpool Hope 2010,Wolverhampton         2005)          Specifically, the impact of her work can be seen in the following       interrelated areas;             Use of research findings in the conduct of professional work or           practice.
Educators have explored and applied aspects of Taras'         work in universities and schools within and beyond the UK.
Its use in accredited programmes for HE staff (e.g.
MA in Academic         Practice at the University of Northumbria; MA Education, PG Cert in         Teaching and Learning in HE, PGCE programmes at the University of         Sunderland; and on university Learning and Development websites (e.g.
Leeds Metropolitan University         (http://alt-resource.teams.leedsmet.ac.uk/formative-assessment/formative-assessment-publications)       An Assistant professor uses Taras' work in her work as a consultant in         HE in other provinces in Canada as well as in her current institution.
It informs the design of three workshops on course design, peer         assessment and self-assessment.
Her work and review of the concepts and         models is cited and used as a key reference in these professional         development workshops, which are offered to approximately 120         instructors and administrators every semester [Source 4].
Staff at the University of Gothenburg have applied Taras' model of         self-assessment (2001, 2002) in a research project with secondary school         pupils, and report positive outcomes (see https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/19783)         [Source 2].
Staff in UK universities and internationally report applying Taras'         research findings in their professional practice:          - A Professor reports that he and colleagues at the University of the       Highlands and Islands, have implemented delaying coursework grades until       students have digested and considered comments on their work as       recommended by Taras (2001, 2002) [Source 1].
- A Senior Lecturer in Physiotherapy (Northumbria University) reports       that she and colleagues on the MA in Academic Practice found Taras' work       valuable in critiquing and developing their assessment practice.
- An Associate Professor of the Teacher Education programme reports that       it has influenced her own practice, in university and school, and that of       her student teachers [Source 3].
- It has influenced the development of formative peer assessment at       Edinburgh Napier University Business Studies degree     - Taras (2005) is used as one of three key texts in two MA modules in       Singapore National Institute of Education.
"It is used as a conceptual       anchor for the role of summative assessment in formative assessment: it is       an important conceptual lightbulb for the students" [Source 6].
Development of resources to enhance professional practice.
Taras has made significant contribution in this area.
Her work is         frequently used in university staff development activities.
Many of her         papers have web links in different languages and countries worldwide,         several have been used in influential national initiatives       Taras (2002) was one of two key texts in a European-funded project         (2002-04) on Internet- based Assessment         http://www.onlineassessment.nu/onlineas_webb/materials/Work_bibl/Bibliography_2.htm        She was invited in 2009 to become a member of the `Osney Grange Group'         of `leading researchers and writers' to examine feedback practices in         the UK and to propose an Agenda for Change for stakeholders and policy         makers.
This group has run change academy style events, produced         resources, and published a book, which Taras is co- edited, section         edited and written a chapter (http://www.brookes.ac.uk/aske/OGG.html)http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415692359/        The State university of Ponta Grossa, Brazil commissioned an updated         version of Taras (2005) which was published in Portuguese and English by         Praxis Educativa in 2010.
It was reprinted in "Did&#225;tica e Forma&#231;&#227;o de         Professores", edited by Professor Claudio Pinto at the University of         Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia, Brazil (2012)          See also       http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?start=50&amp;q=%22maddalena+taras%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5             Practitioner debate has been informed or stimulated by research           findings.
As described above, Taras' work has stimulated debate         amongst HE practitioners.
It has challenged hegemonic assumptions         concerning the models of assessment and self-assessment routinely         employed in HE, and has questioned the validity and value of Assessment         for Learning as currently understood and applied in education settings.
In recognition of her impact Taras has been awarded a National Teaching       Fellowship 2013 (HEA).
