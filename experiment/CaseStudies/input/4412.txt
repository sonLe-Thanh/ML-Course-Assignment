     The project enhanced West Midlanders' perceptions of regional identity       and contributed to the cultural life of the region by engaging widely with       audiences through various media and public events.
The impact strategy put       the involvement of wider audiences at the heart of the processes of       discovery of and transmission of the past.
Several channels were used to       reach the public, to capture their knowledge and to enable them to become       co-creators of new knowledge and thus to acquire cultural capital.
Beneficiaries: A.
People of the West Midlands     Before the project, West Midlanders were unaware of the existence of the       manuscript.
The project has engaged regional audiences with the research       through live events and several media channels.
The aim was to make the       manuscript more usefully and fully accessible to its `source community'       (Peers and Brown, 2003), the peoples of the West Midlands.
The events       enhanced West Midlanders' perceptions of West Midlands English and       regional identity.
Also, by utilising West Midlanders' knowledge of the       dialect today, the project has involved them in the discovery processes of       the research, increasing cultural capital.
The regional events included:            A series of events Connecting West Midlands Communities with           Linguistic Heritage, marketed via the project website and a press         release, and held in museums and libraries in September 2011.
Members of         the public were invited to explore the edition and to consider         relationships between the language of the medieval West Midlands and the         dialect of the region today.
A similar experience engaged the public at         the University Community Day, 10 June 2012.
Discovering the Vernon Manuscript, an edition launch event on         15 May 2012 at The Studio, Birmingham, was also aimed at a regional         audience.
Brendan Hawthorne, a poet of the Black Country dialect, worked         with the PI and audience to discover how the manuscript may have sounded         when read aloud by its first readers.
The event captured the poet's and         audience's knowledge of Black Country dialect to add a further dimension         to understanding of the manuscript; the positive impact on West         Midlanders' valuation of their regional dialect was noted and discussed         by Hawthorne and TV historian Michael Wood in a roundtable and in         audience feedback.
A follow-up event is on the programme of the `Book to         the Future' public-facing literary festival, University of Birmingham,         25-26 October 2013.
Impact: Testimonies from participants in the Connecting       and Discovering events provide evidence for the significance of       the impact of the research on public perceptions in the West Midlands of       the language, history and culture of the region [see source 1 below].
The       191 participants shared several recurrent responses.
The manuscript was       completely unknown to many participants -- several compared the importance       of the manuscript in this respect to that of the Staffordshire Hoard (e.g.
`I've never heard of it and I'd love to see it.
It's like the       Staffordshire Hoard.
That interested people and this is the same thing.').
Participation in the project enhanced participants' sense of pride in       coming from the region and in its heritage (e.g.
`This gives us a chance       to celebrate our history, our heritage, but also what's current ... we can       be proud of who we are and where we're from'.)
Learning more about the       history of the regional (sometimes disesteemed) language was felt to be       personally meaningful and affecting (e.g.
`Personally, I have to say that       because people from the West Midlands are a bit ashamed of their accent...       you have something like that to show you 600 years ago people were talking       like this; it's not something that's grown up in the last hundred years').
Research on the manuscript was viewed as a way of sustaining important       local traditions (e.g.
`It [making the manuscript available to the public]       will benefit people because it will keep the thing [regional dialect]       alive.
It's like heritage, it's like history disappearing, you need to       preserve this thing to teach the kids ...it's important that we keep this       sort of thing.').
Participation in the research was seen as a chance to       learn more about an aspect of history they knew little about (e.g.
`I       think it's very important because it puts it into a perspective really ...       to have something that really is really local, I think is very important       to hear.')
Evidence of reach and increased interest in the West Midlands:       By 10 July 2013 the project had achieved an estimated potential reach of       over two million persons in the West Midlands alone:            154 members of the public took part in six Connecting events         held at five venues, Birmingham Cathedral, Birmingham Central Library,         Walsall Museum, Wolverhampton Art Gallery, and Wolverhampton Central         Library, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 18 September 2011.
37 people attended the Discovering         event.
These numbers are encouraging, taking into account that the         innovative nature of the events means that comparator figures are not         available.
The research achieved an estimated audience of 2,051,636 for combined         print and broadcast coverage in the week of the Connecting         events in September 2011.
[Source 3]       The Connecting events were featured by regional BBC radio and         television (Phil Upton at breakfast - BBC WM, 9 September 2011, 3         broadcasts each reaching an estimated 77,000 people; Midlands Today -         BBC TV, 9 September 2011, two broadcasts each reaching an estimated         458,000 people).
[Source 3]       Newspaper coverage included `Accent is on Origin of Regional Dialect'         in two key regional papers, the Walsall Express and Star, 10         September 2011, reaching an estimated audience of 18,365 and the         Wolverhampton Express and Star, 10 September 2011, estimated         audience 39,733; `You can help Boffins in bid to unlock Brummie Accent',         in the key regional paper the Birmingham Mail, 13 September         2011, estimated audience 48,660; and `Accent Placed on Tracing our         Regional Dialect' in the regional Stourbridge Chronicle, 15         September 2011, estimated audience 44,080.

National Audience     National audiences' awareness of the cultural heritage of the West       Midlands has been increased through engagement of publics beyond the       region with the research: Scase's presentation on The Vernon Manuscript         - An E-Reader on Parchment adapted the material for a national       audience at the Hay-on-Wye Festival of Literature and the Arts, 6 June       2012.
The event was disseminated online in a Hay Festival News       article: `Was         the kindle first conceived in the Middle Ages?'
http://news.hayfestival.org/post/24559425865/was-the-kindle-first-conceived-in-the-middle-ages.
Impact: Approx.
250 members of the public attended the       event.
An audience member tweeted `New obsession might be the Vernon       manuscript which I'd never even heard of before!'
(@booksanddance); and       another emailed Scase about how the presentation inspired her as a       teacher: `I was lucky enough to attend your session on the Vernon       manuscript at the Hay Festival...
I have a lovely Year 12 class ...       studying Language Change and the session I attended at Hay would certainly       bring the topic to life for them' (Lisa Farrell, Staffordshire).

[Source 5]          Through online and live engagement of non academic audiences with the       Vernon manuscript, the public's awareness of the rich linguistic and       literary heritage of the West Midlands has been heightened and West       Midlanders' perceptions of their individual and community identities have       been enhanced.
