     Nature of the impact: The impact is an effect on public         policy and services within South Wales Police (SWP) and associated       agencies.
It operates on the activity, attitude, awareness, behaviour,         capacity, process and understanding of police staff and legal       interpreters, with onward impact on attitudes and understanding in       the general public using police and interpreting services.
The reach       is targeted on SWP staff, a particular constituency with whom a sustained       relationship has been built, but it affects a broad range of people,       including victims, witnesses, suspects and complainants.
Furthermore, local innovations are often adopted more widely: Changes to       how detainees' rights are explained to them in police custody that were       made on the basis of Rock's research3-2 have been used across       England and Wales since 2006, continuing to impact on the 4000 people per       day who are arrested.
The revised letters to complainants (project 1       below) adopted by SWP were, at 31/07/13, under consideration by the       all-Wales IPCC Commissioner;5-1 and the interpreter memo       (project 6) created for practitioners in the SWP area was expected to be       adopted by Gwent Police, Dyfed Powys Police, and, via the National       Interview Advisor, across England and Wales.5-8 The significance       of the impact is its contribution to the effective management of         complex civic interactions, encompassing justice, protection, compliance         and community relations.
Rock's input has materially improved       the match between linguistic choices and communication practices.
The       significance is demonstrated by the testimonies and other evidence in       section 55-1,5-2,5-3,5-7,5-8 and also in the award to Rock of       &#163;5857 from the British Association of Applied Linguistics' Applying       Linguistics Activity Fund 2012.5-9     Context and process: Rock's research-to-impact portfolio       results from collaborations with SWP since 2005.
She has developed strong       relationships with key individuals, which have resulted in onward       recommendations to other units and agencies.
As a result she has pervasive       influence across the Force in shaping the many ways in which the police       and their associated staff interact with the public.
Typically, she is       approached to address a specific problem relating to language (see example       projects below).
She collaborates with those who generate the texts and       procedures, to help them learn new ways of reflecting on their practices,       through (a) awareness of choices in words and structures; (b)       consideration of the desired outcome and available linguistic means for       achieving it; (c) awareness of the needs and assumptions of those reading       or hearing a text, and of the author's own assumptions; (d) the role of       legal requirements in wording.
Her research-based interventions have       enabled writers to broaden their linguistic choices and accommodate the       needs of their readers/hearers more directly and effectively, e.g.
by       managing the level of formality and the use of difficult vocabulary.
Her       attention to capacity building in staff ensures that investments in one       context are transferable and adaptable to others.
Examples of projects and evidence of impact:     (1) Revising responses to complaints against the police (from           2011): The Professional Standards Department of SWP deals with       all complaints about the Force.
The Senior Manager, Dale Ponting,5-1       sought advice from Rock regarding the emotional impact on recipients of       the letters sent by the Force in response to complaints.
Rock interviewed       letter recipients to develop an understanding of the letters' strengths       and weaknesses in readers' eyes.
She also conducted focus group research       with impartial readers.
Based on her findings, she offered an intervention       resulting in the replacement of 12           `standard' letters central to the complaints process.
Research-informed mentoring of Mr Ponting and feedback on his practices       over many months created a sustainable dynamic resource for       the Department which has been used in a subsequent large-scale review of       letters and procedures triggered by the Police (Complaints and Conduct)       Act 2012.
Rock's work also triggered a review of wider           communicative practices in the SWP around complaints,       centring on greater awareness of spoken interaction.
In an email       (17/10/2011), Mr Ponting said of this work: "I think the new style is far       more user friendly from complainants' point of view and would engender       more trust in the complaints system.
This is a really useful exercise for       me.
I have viewed our letters from a completely different perspective."
(2) Victim Care Bureau - letters and telephone greeting (2012):       Rock was approached by the Central Communication Hub General Manager,       Ms Megan Hughes, who was setting up the Victim Care Bureau to help         witnesses through policing processes.
By means of collaboration       with three police staff, Rock evaluated letters sent to victims and the revised           versions are now used across South Wales       (1279 letters in the first month).
Satisfaction survey results before and       after the new letters showed increases of 9.3% (actions taken), 13.7%       (follow-up), 6.5% (treatment) and 7.3% (whole experience).5-2       Ms Hughes reported a thank you letter from a victim of crime for the work       of the SWP officers, referring to "your most reassuring letter".
Rock's advice was also sought on spoken communication in the Bureau and       her guidance on telephone and email messages is also now in           use across the Force.
As with (1), a legacy of changes           in workplace language skills and awareness has       inculcated a culture of attention to communication and a positive approach       towards making improvements.
(3) Teach-to-Talk (from 2011) Teach-to-Talk is an       interview method devised by police trainers at SWP to help witnesses       provide the evidence required for an effective police enquiry.
Rock       reviewed instances of police officers using the Teach-to-Talk       technique in training, comparing it with findings from her previous work       on witness' attention to facts and figures, and on collaboration in       police-witness interviews.
On this basis she undertook targeted           investigations of rapport and the provision of feedback       during the openings of police interviews, in close consultation with       interview trainers and a small research team.
The resulting       recommendations are being fed into police training through an iterative           process of intervention and further research.
The developments       are informing the training of over 100 police officers each year.
Interview trainer Kerry Marlow says: "The research at Cardiff University       has enriched our understanding of the technique and its potential.
"5-3       In an email 16/07/135-4 he described the new method as: "focus       on action detail (evidential) material rather than people, location or       time detail (investigative) and then giving them feedback [to] enhance[e]       a chronological story".
He added, "The collaboration with the University       on practitioner development in providing evidential information for the       court will if the hypothesis is significant be ground breaking in       investigative interviewing.
"5-4 By phone, 16/07/13 he said of Teach-to-Talk,       "We've been amazed with the results."
The work was "really significant"       and "ground-breaking from a training perspective and from a practice       perspective...
The training has ...been noticed by Monmouth Legal Services       who are also interested in finding out more.
"5-4     (4) Interpreters and meaning: FuzzyLaw (from 2011): The       multilingual population of South Wales requires the use of interpreters in       many police interviews as well as in the courts.
Interpreter trainers in       South Wales initiated this intervention, when they expressed to Rock their       concern about the challenges inherent in putting non-native           speakers on a `level footing' with their native speaker           counterparts.
The core issue was the capacity of interpreters       to navigate the different elements entailed in `correctly' translating a       legal term, including: (a) its technical meaning and the legally       equivalent term in another language, (b) its lay meaning for native       speakers, including connotations and cultural associations read into the       term by ordinary native speakers, and (c) other additional subtextual       meanings.
Rock recognised that the external stipulative definitions of       terms used in legal procedures need to be juxtaposed with lay people's       beliefs about their meanings, for an adequate path to understanding and,       hence, appropriate interpreting, to be possible.
To achieve this, Rock created       a two-way process of information gathering           and dissemination, FuzzyLaw,5-5 able to       inform both specialists and the general public about the hidden meanings       and associations of terms used in legal contexts.
The survey site,       http://flaw.cardiff.ac.uk       collects native speakers' explanations of legal terms.
The explanations       are disseminated to interpreters and police officers       through http://fuzzylaw.cardiff.ac.uk.
Learning is facilitated through reviewing and       comparing the explanations.
Discussion forums are also available for       interpreters and police officers, who might not otherwise interact, to       reflect on meaning.
In this way, not only can interpreters learn more       about the complex meanings of legal terms used by the police, but also the       police become more alert to the many ways in which a term can be       differently understood.
Further impact has been awareness raising       in lay people who provided explanations about legal terms and then could       read the official definitions:5-5 "Had no idea what violent       disorder really meant - think this is quite a misleading phrase."
"We       think we know the answers, but it's evident we are not all of us entirely       sure about the meanings of some of the jargon used."
"We hear these       phrases on TV all the time, but hard to put your finger on what they       exactly mean."
"I would not like to rely on my knowledge or description";       "[FuzzyLaw] has re-balanced my understanding of these words."
One       interpreter wrote two mini-articles on how FuzzyLaw changed her perception       of the interpreter's role (http://fuzzylaw.cardiff.ac.uk/commentaries       27/7 and 26/7).5-6      (5) Dialogue between interpreters and police (from 2011): As       a result of (3) and (4), Rock recognised connections between the interview       training required by police officers, and the training needed by       interpreters: both roles require a deep understanding about how       comprehension works in legal settings, and, when working together, each       needs to understand the tasks and constraints of the other.
She proposed       to the police interview trainers serving the South Wales Force, and to the       Public Service Interpreter Trainers, who train interpreters in a wide       range of languages, that dialogue would be beneficial to both parties.
She       organised a series of meetings between the two groups, and       led research-informed discussions of language issues and       of shared communication-related interests.
The outcome was a new           collaborative training initiative,5-3 with       the first, week-long joint training session in October 2012.
It was       attended by 24 police officers and 20 interpreters.
This is now a regular       fixture of the SWP Advanced Suspect Interview training programme which       equips senior investigators with skills for interviewing about serious       crimes such as murder.
A week of this three-week course is now dedicated       to interpreting, whereas no time was spent on this issue previously.
In       2013, 48 officers from SWP attended the training as well as 24 from Thames       Valley Police.
Interpreter Martha Edwards stated: "The training has       changed the way I work... my interventions seem to be more effective and       smoother, more confident ...
I've found myself spontaneously paraphrasing       terms which I didn't have an equivalent for in my language at the time       because I learned about them during the training.
"5-7 The       police training team presented the method at the 2013 Investigative       Interviewing Research Group Conference, Maastricht, an international event       for investigative interviewers (Rm 2, 9am http://bit.ly/1asFHzw).
(6) Revising preamble scripts for interpreted interviews (from           2013): In the light of her previous research on the       comprehensibility of the rights text, Rock instigated an           intervention focussed on the interview preamble (which       explains suspects' rights, outlines how the interview will proceed, and       sets the legal and practical ground-rules for interview) when it is       mediated by an interpreter.
For interpreted interviews, a crucial part of       the preamble is explaining the interpreter's role and responsibility.
Rock       worked with a small team of police interview trainers, practising       interpreters, and the S.Wales Police officer responsible for interview       policy (David Roberts), to examine the wording of the preamble.
The       outcome was a complete revision, captured on a `memo       card', which every individual arrested in South           Wales who does not wish to be interviewed in           English or Welsh will benefit from (c.480 per       year, rising annually).
Roberts said of this change: "your input ... has a       huge benefit.
The memo card is used for both voluntary attendees and       persons arrested and in custody.
