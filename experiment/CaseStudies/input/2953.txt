     Introduction     Research at the University of Manchester on the risk of wildfire has       altered government policy, influenced fire fighting practice at a local       level and built a community of practice which spans fire fighters,       countryside stakeholders and academics.
All the impacts described below       drew extensively on published interdisciplinary work relating to the risk       of wildfire in the Peak District.
This formed the knowledge base for       policy change and new management practices.
Pathways to Impact     Research findings were published in international journals, and       extensively discussed with stakeholders including landowners, fire       authorities, amenity bodies, fire operations groups and the Met Office.
The multidisciplinary FIRES seminar series funded by ESRC and NERC was the       first time fire authorities had engaged closely with the research       community on wildfires as an issue [3, 4].
The research was particularly appealing to Fire Services who have given       extensive guidance to follow-on work by the team outside the Peak       District, including an unpublished but widely reported case study on the       Swinley Forest Fire, a major incident on the Surrey-Berkshire border in       2011.
This research led directly to the approach in 2012 by the Department       for Communities and Local Government who were keen to assess the risk       posed by wildfire in the UK and successfully built a case to put to the       Cabinet Office.
Impacts on National Policy     Using the research, Aylen gave specific advice to the Resilience &amp;       Emergencies Division (RED) of the Department for Communities &amp; Local       Government (DCLG) in June 2012 as part of a submission to the Cabinet       Office advocating inclusion of wildfire in the Government's confidential       National Risk Assessment for 2012.
Evidence submitted to the Cabinet       Office drew extensively on Aylen's unpublished advice on the Swinley       wildfire incident in 2011 and his participation in discussions about       emergency planning for a major wildfire incident.
The wildfire lead of the       Chief Fire Officers Association [A] states: "The dedicated assistance         and information Jonathan provided last summer to members of the CFOA WG         who were involved in detailed discussions with central Government on         shaping national policy towards wildfire risk was of tremendous benefit.
Without a very robust and resilient evidence base across a number of         factors, of which the economic cost of wildfire was a principal focus, I         am convinced we would not have made the case to Government about the         threat and risk to UK Plc.
and our local communities from wildfires in         such an impressive and convincing way.
The outcome of those discussions         was the inclusion, for the first time, of wildfire as a risk within the         National Risk Register"     As a result, wildfires have been included in the National Risk Register       [F] for the first time and forms part of the forthcoming National Risk       Assessment due out in the summer of 2013.
This impact is confirmed in a       statement [D] from a technical adviser to the Forestry Commission: "Aylen         was able to draw on his extensive academic research on wildfire risks         and costing to help shape both local thinking and high level national         policy.
This work was vital in the successful inclusion of Wildfire         Incidents in the Government's National Risk Register."
Impacts on the Peak District National Park and the Fire Service     At a very practical level, the academic forecasting work on timing of       wildfires is used by the Peak District National Park to inform the       location of fire fighting ponds and deployment of fire watchers at high       risk times indicated by the research.
It has influenced the fire service's       approach to moorland fire fighting, including decisions on helicopter       response.
Aylen's work with Cavan on costing wildfires is described by the Research       Manager at `Moors for the Future' as: "an incredibly valuable body of         research and evidence to us on a number of levels" [C].
It helped       the Peak District National Park     a) "demonstrate the value of our moorland restoration";     b) "communicate the impacts of moorland wildfires to these         conservation organisations and major land owners, for example, the         wildfire costings and risk models have fed into Severn Trent Water         Limited's `catchment characterisation' report for the Derwent catchment         and informed the catchment action plan";     c) "communicate to Defra the `value' of the ranger service in their         role in delivering `fire &#8212; an early wildfire detection programmme         carried out by rangers at times of high fire risk".
The timings of       these fire watches were also suggested by this academic work on wildfire       forecasting.
These changes in practice have begun to diffuse nationally.
A research       briefing given to the Chief Fire Officers Association in 2012 led to their       national initiative on wildfires.
Among other events, there has been a       presentation to the Institute of Fire Engineers in 2012 and the work now       forms part of a training course for firefighters run by the Peak District       National Park.
Closer to hand, the work is being developed through       knowledge exchange with the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service       with a programme of knowledge sharing for 2013 relating to fire       prevention, costing and deployment of fire fighting resources.
A statement       from the Watch Manager at Greater Manchester and Fire Rescue Services [B]       confirms: "Mr Aylen continues to be an unceasing font of knowledge in         the realm of wildfire costing's, risk assessment and economic estimation         of fire suppression and has greatly assisted the Fire and Rescue         Services to implement changes to existing policy and procedures to deal         more effectively with Wildfires."
An educational computer based "wildfire forecasting game" is also being       commissioned at the Peak District Visitor Centre in Edale in 2013 based       explicitly on the forecasting equations estimated in Aylen's research [1].
Impacts on Raising Awareness of Wildfire Risk     Research on wildfires helped build a community of practice around       wildfire prevention, suppression and remediation.
A member of the team       wildfire team at Manchester &#8212; McMorrow was instrumental in convening the       ESRC/NERC seminar series FIRES (Fire Interdisciplinary Research on       Ecosystem Services) which brought together scientists, social scientists,       policy makers and firefighters.
The series resulted in a lively policy       brief [3], Fires Interdisciplinary Research on Ecosystem Services         (FIRES) Policy Brief (2010) which has become the widely circulated       standard source on the topic.
Its key messages, policy recommendations and       listing of knowledge gaps have set the policy agenda ever since.
The       Station Commander at Dorset Fire and Rescue Service represents the South       West of England on the Chief Fire Officers Association Wildfire Group and       confirms [E] the research has raised awareness: "Jonathan's work         helped to raise the profile of Wildfire in the run up to the 2012         Olympics particularly in respect of the potential costs and disruption         and this, again, led to a full risk assessment being undertaken to         minimise the potential impact."
