     The research was from the outset intertwined with questions of public       debate.
It arose from Evans being approached in 2006 to act as the       historical consultant for a BBC2 Wales documentary Wales and Slavery:         The Untold Story.
The broadcast of Wales and Slavery in 2007       led directly to Evans being commissioned by the University of Wales Press       to write a book-length study on the same theme.
This initiated a programme       of research designed to collect fresh data on the relationship between       Wales and slavery, and to construe that data in the light of new       theoretical approaches to the history of Atlantic slavery more widely.
The results were as far as was possible disseminated to a lay audience       via the press, through broadcast media and at events designed to expand       popular understanding of slavery and abolition in Wales and Britain more       widely.
Broadcast media appearances by Chris Evans:             Wales and Slavery: The Untold Story (2007) was first broadcast         on 22 March 2007 on BBC2 Wales (clip available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00kqzjh).
Evans made supporting appearance on BBC Radio Wales shows.
Evans was consulted by the production team ahead of Time Team         excavations at the White Rock copper works (July 2011, broadcast         February 2012:         http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team/episode-guide/series-19/episode-7).
The White Rock works supplied copper and brass wares for use in the         African slave trade and were established by one of Bristol's prominent         slave traders of the 1730s.

`Wales and Atlantic slavery', National Museum of Wales, Cardiff,         October 2007          Consultancy arising from this public profile:            Evans was engaged as a consultant to the Heritage Lottery Fund project         "Bittersweet", run by charity The Gateway Gardens Trust between         2007 and 2009.
"Bittersweet" was a programme aimed at disadvantaged         urban groups which sought to explain the impact of slavery on British         culture through New World plant species and foodstuffs that had made         their way into British gardens and the British diet.
Evans advised on         the touring exhibition produced by the project and the accompanying DVD:         Bittersweet: Sugar, Tea and Slavery.
A Story of Wales and Slavery         (The Gateway Gardens Trust, 2009).
Evans also advised on the drafting of another, this time unsuccessful,         bid for HLF funding by Learning Links International CIC, an educational         trust, and the North Wales Jamaica Society: "Atlantic Links &#8212; the North         Wales Connection" in 2012.
Evans was engaged by Green Bay Media, working on behalf of the Welsh         Government's Department of Education &amp; Skills to produce educational         materials as a spin-off from the 2012 BBC series The Story of Wales         (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00mlrq9).
The results are mounted on iTunes U and the Welsh Government's virtual         learning environment (the HWB).
Evans advised on and appeared in the         segment `Wales and Slavery' which can be found at iTunes U &gt; Addysg         Cymru-Education Wales &gt; The Story of Wales.
The script was based         directly, if not always accurately, on Evans 2010.
