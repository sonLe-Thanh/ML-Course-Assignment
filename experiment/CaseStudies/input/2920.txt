     Context     In the early 2000s there was much controversy regarding the role of the       MP and the possibility that it might prevent macular disease or minimise       its effects.
Much of the research at the time was based on small numbers       of participants and therefore largely speculative.
The main impediment to       progress was the inability to measure MP in large numbers of participants.
The early stages of the research had two primary aims:     i. to establish whether or not MP was linked with AMD, and     ii.
to develop a technique to measure MP in vivo in large       populations which could be used in epidemiological studies and,       ultimately, routinely under clinical conditions.
Pathways to impact            The early work was published in high quality clinically-focussed         journals such as Investigative Ophthalmology and Experimental Eye         Research [1,3].
The work attracted financial support from the NW         Regional Health Authority (1998-1999) and the Department of Health         (2000-2002).
It was presented at numerous scientific meetings in Europe         and, in particular, frequently in the US at a large annual ophthalmic         conference (ARVO, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology).
These activities, concerned with describing and testing the new device         and conducting measurements in patients and age-matched healthy         controls, gave rise to interest from industrial partners, notably         Tinsley Ophthalmic Instruments (UK), ZeaVision (US) and Cognis AG         (Germany).
Each of these organisations played a crucial role in the         route to market and subsequent impact of the research, as outlined         below.
Tinsley (now Elektron) manufactured a prototype device funded by the         DoH (2000-2002, [2,3]) and then funded and manufactured the final         instrument (2005-2007) ([4], [A]).
ZeaVision, who sell dietary supplements ("EyePromise Restore") to         increase MP, licence the MPS (called "QuantifEYE&#174;" in the US) to         optometrists (see http://www.zeavision.com/quantifeye.html)         and have developed a successful marketing route in the US.
Subsequently (2006-2009) Cognis funded a definitive,         placebo-controlled clinical trial to establish that MP has real benefits         for AMD patients.
The new device was integral to this study and has         resulted in the most recent paper [6].
A European patent application was filed in 2005 and published in         October 2010: Ocular Measurement Apparatus and Method "Macular           Pigment Screener"; UK Application number: 0507430.7; Applicants:         I. Murray and D. Carden; European Patent Number 1871217.
The MPS was CE marked by Tinsley in 2006.
The MPS instrument has also had extensive media exposure:            In 2006 the BBC funded (&#163;11k) a short intervention trial in Murray's         laboratory of the effects of a spinach-rich diet on MP in 12 AMD         patients.
The MPS was used to show substantial increases in MP and the         results were reported in a BBC2 series called The Truth About Food.
Spinach is rich in lutein and, although it is not an optimum way of         increasing MP, the main purpose of the programme was to increase         awareness of the importance of diet for the health of the eye.
The         programme was broadcast in 2007.
In 2007/8 the research was described and discussed in different BBC         radio programmes where Murray responded to questions from listeners: BBC         Radio Cambridge / Peterborough; KMFM Radio Kent; BBC Radio         Gloucestershire; BBC Coventry and Warwick; BBC Radio Kent; MFR Radio         Scotland.
In January 2012 Murray was invited to appear on BBC Radio Manchester         to discuss the current research concerned with the links between the         health of the normal older eye and diet, thus highlighting the         importance of measuring MP in clinics.
Reach and significance of the impact     Specific impacts based on the research can be summarised under the       following:     Patient benefits:            As more than 30% of older people have signs of early stage AMD, it is         important for all those aged over 60 to have their MP measured.
This         enables them to assess their level of risk of developing AMD and take         steps to increase their MP levels if these are found to be low.
This         particularly applies to those at high risk due to family history.
The         MPS is used in clinical trials (including [6]) to measure the effects of         interventions on progression of AMD.
ZeaVision estimate that currently around 1 million patients are         benefitting from routine MP screening in the US alone [B].
In all         patients, the device has one major benefit in that it highlights the         importance of diet and displays to the patients how improving diet can         increase MP and therefore reduce the risk of AMD.
ZeaVision state that a         report has "estimated US healthcare cost savings of $2.5 billion over 5         years if just 130,000 patients avoided transition to debilitating         blindness by being screened and taking MP supplementation" [B].
Practitioner benefits:            The MPS has allowed practitioners for the first time to assess whether         their patients' MP is low and advise on enhancement measures (e.g.
eating lutein-rich foods or taking dietary supplements).
They combine         the MP measurement with an assessment of risk according to heritance and         retinal photographs.
They can then advise patients on how to minimise         risk.
The measurement of MP has added an extra dimension to the care         offered by optometrists worldwide [C,D,E].
A UK Optometrist states:         "With the prevalence of ARMD [AMD] increasing in most parts of the world         the MPS11 allows us to be ready for the very large number of predicted         patients who will get ARMD.." [D].
A US Optometrist states that the MPS         is "currently the quickest..., most affordable, and most clinically         relevant device in the world" that "will revolutionize the practice of         eye care" [E].
Benefits to the ophthalmic community:            The measurement of MP in clinics has not previously been possible.
This allows the links between diet, inheritance and structural retinal         damage to be meaningfully explored in AMD patients and those at risk of         developing the disease.
Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer of         ZeaVision states: "The ability to screen applicants that are at high         risk for AMD and cataracts and introduce the patient to a dietary         supplement or counseling that can ultimately reduce the progression of         these debilitating eye diseases will forever change Eye Care practices         across the healthcare industry" [B].
As a result the ophthalmic community is now much more aware of the         importance of diet and lifestyle in preventing AMD, as described in the         Royal College of Ophthalmologists' guidelines on AMD Management [F].
These guidelines are a direct result of the body of research findings         now available on the rationale for controlling diet in the management of         MP.
The research conducted by Murray's research group, including the         introduction of the MPS, has made a substantial contribution to this         opinion.
Commercial impact:             Tinsley/Elektron (UK manufacturer) &#8212; Since its introduction in         2005, over 500 units have been sold in the USA and 250 in the rest of         the world.
The company directly employs 12 staff, 7 in manufacturing and         5 in sales and marketing, and has invested in a new manufacturing         facility and new software releases in Nov. 2012 and July 2013.
The MPS         "is of considerable commercial value" to Elektron and they "expect this         to continue as indicated by the future investment figures" [G].
ZeaVision (US distributor) &#8212; At present there are more than 500         devices in commercial settings in the US and the majority of US         Optometry Schools are introducing MP measurement (using QuantifEYE) to         their students.
The procedure also generates an income for the         practicing optometrist [B].
