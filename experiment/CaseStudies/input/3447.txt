     Road safety is continuously developing through the 3 E's (engineering,       education and       enforcement) and law enforcement is seen as one way in which road traffic       fatalities and serious       injuries can be reduced.
Cunningham's research has had the greatest impact       through her work       with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).
ACPO is the body       which leads and       coordinates the direction and development of the police service in       England, Wales and Northern       Ireland independently of the government.
ACPO, on behalf of all chief       officers, coordinates the       strategic policing response.
Alongside (but independent of) the       Government's development of its       Strategic Framework for Road Safety in May 2011, ACPO saw the need to       develop a strategy for       road policing.
Cunningham has acted as a `critical friend' to ACPO in       drafting the current five year       road policing strategy and she, alongside Sgt Alan Jones of ACPO Road       Policing, developed one       of the three strategic goals of the new strategy: "habitual compliance".
Sgt Jones states: "A key         requirement of the document was [a] request that the guidance should         exhibit academic weight         and merit... Dr. Cunningham was an integral member of the syndicate,         chaired by myself, which         developed the theme of habitual compliance.
In 2010, I [was] requested         to draft the new Road         Policing Strategy.
... Sally proved to be extremely helpful in [the peer         review] process and using         her specialist academic knowledge and insight was able to assist the         police service in the         development of the draft document."
(5.6)     The key to the strategy of habitual compliance can be seen on p.4 of the       document (5.1, 5.6):       "Roads policing needs to shift from a target driven approach to         performance, to one that enables         officers to use their discretion and professional judgement to deliver         safer roads and improved         driver behaviour.
Working with partners and stakeholders our ambition         must be to create a shift in         public attitude and behaviour to one of habitual compliance with the         laws and conventions of the         road."
Habitual compliance is a concept which aims to encourage drivers to abide       by the law of the roads       as a matter of course, through educating drivers about the need to do so.
It allows for the       employment of education of offending drivers through enforcement and       recognises that, in relation       to low-end offending, psychologists have found that what amounts to       careless driving can only be       tackled via education, whereas at the top-end violations require       deterrence through punishment.
The concept of habitual compliance is key to the new police approach in       road policing, referred to       by Chief Constable Phil Gormley, Head of ACPO Road Policing in his       introduction to the strategy.
In his Ministerial Forward to the Strategy, Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary       Undersecretary of       State for Transport, declared that "I expect [this new Road Policing         strategy] to make an important         contribution to reducing road casualties" (5.1).
Elsewhere Cunningham's work has been recognised by PACTS, who have       invited her to present       papers at two conferences.
PACTS is a registered charity and an associate       Parliamentary Group.
Its objective is "To protect human life through the promotion of transport       safety for the public       benefit".
It aims to advise and inform members of parliament on road       safety issues, and brings       together safety professionals and legislators to identify research-based       solutions to transport safety       problems.
One of Cunningham's papers (3.2) was published by PACTS       as an occasional research       report, to inform the development of the coming ten-year strategy for       enforcing traffic law.
This led       to Cunningham taking part in an Enforcement and Education Seminar at the       Department for       Transport in January 2011, at which discussions took place regarding       development of that       strategy.
Rob Gifford, Executive Director of PACTS until December 2012,       states: "The number of         academic researchers involved in assessment of car crime and the         contribution to road death and         injury is (surprisingly) very small and Sally's work on dangerous         driving has provided the road         safety community with key insights into how to tackle this issue.
I         first came across her work when         preparing the programme for a conference organized by PACTS in March         2008.
I am certain that         her conclusions helped in demonstrating to the government that, in         tackling road crime, we need to         focus both on low-level regular offending such as speeding and high-harm         offending such as death         by dangerous driving and dangerous driving itself."
(5.3)     Most recently, Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate       (HMCPSI) has used       Cunningham's final report to the CPS from her AHRC funded project to help       to formulate a scoping       document that will define the parameters of a joint review between HMCPSI       and Her Majesty's       Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) of criminal charges relating to road       traffic fatalities to be       undertaken in the final quarter of the 2013/14 business year.
The       assistant inspector in charge of       this review states in relation to Cunningham's report that: "A vital         aspect of this inspection will focus         on the decisions on prosecution and charge selection made by prosecutors         in the period since         2008 when the new offences created by the Road Safety Act 2006 came into         force.
It is therefore         instructive for me and my colleagues to see some of these decisions         analysed by professionals         from another discipline and more importantly from a source outside the         criminal justice fraternity."
(5.7)     Cunningham has been able to draw on her research to respond in detail to       consultations issued by       both ACPO, in relation to its new draft of the Road Death Investigation       Manual, and the CPS, on       their charging policy for offences relating to bad driving.
In relation to       the latter, she also took part       in a panel discussion organised by the victims' charity RoadPeace in       November 2012 on the       guidance provided by the CPS on charging in relation to road traffic       fatalities.
RoadPeace is an       organisation which has used Cunningham's monograph (3.1) to help       them understand the law       relating to causing death offences, feeding into their policies on       encouraging the authorities to treat       road crime as "real" crime.
Amy Aeron-Thomas, Executive Director of       RoadPeace comments: "The         importance of the research conducted by Dr Sally Cunningham should not         be underestimated...         RoadPeace has benefited from Dr Cunningham's presentations at our         previous conferences and         our Traffic Justice panel discussion last November, "You say Careless, I         say Dangerous".
... We         may not always agree with her but we do always learn from her" (5.5).
Cunningham also took part       in the Police Foundation Forum on Roads Policing in December 2012, at       which the discussion       revolved around impacting policy on roads policing, particularly through       the new Police and Crimes       Commissioners, and called for the introduction of a Roads Accident       Investigation Branch (5.4).
