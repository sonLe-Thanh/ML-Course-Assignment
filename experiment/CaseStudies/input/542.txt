     The authors' research has influenced and benefited key stakeholders at EU       level (the European       Commission, the Parliament, the EU Fundamental Rights Agency), bodies of       international law (the       Council of Europe), and the NGO sector (UNICEF, Save the Children,       Eurochild), with the ultimate       aim of rendering the EU more responsive to children's rights issues.
This       impact was achieved       through ongoing collaboration between the researchers and key       stakeholders, initially established       during the Children's Rights Indicators project for the Fundamental Rights       Agency, and       consolidated through a number of subsequent consultancies and KE events       (detailed below).
The research has yielded significant impact in two principal respects:            It has resulted in more direct engagement with children's rights by           the EU           institutions in their development of EU laws and policies.
This is evidenced particularly in the activities of the Commission and         the Parliament.
The insights         gained from the research detailed above directly influenced the         substantive content and scope of         the seminal `EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child', the         European Commission's inaugural plan         of action on children's rights: the recommendations put forward by         Stalford and Drywood in their         5,000 word formal response to the public consultation are reflected in         the published document         (2011); and Stalford was invited to participate in the Commission's         expert working group on         `Invisible Children' (an invitation which resulted from the research) to         identify how issues affecting         the most vulnerable and marginalised children in the EU could be         prioritised in the Agenda (2010).
More specifically, the Children's Rights Indicators study is         referred to in the EU Agenda for the         Rights of the Child as a means of supporting more evidenced-based         policy-making regarding         children.
The indicators are also referred to in the Council of           Europe's parallel Strategy for the           Rights of the Child (2011).
In the same vein, Save the           Children, in the context of its Child Rights         Governance campaign, has acknowledged that continued adherence to the         Children's Rights         Indicators is essential for the future development of European policy by         the Commission.
As far as the European Parliament is concerned, its 2012 report         consolidating the EU's legal         framework in relation to children's rights is heavily informed by the         authors' work, particularly that         published in the International Journal of Children's Rights (2011).
Stalford's (with Schuurman)         article shaped the report's conclusions on the Lisbon Treaty's impact in         the area; and the         Parliament's recommendations on how to integrate children's rights into         all stages of the EU law         and policy-making process draw extensively on Drywood's article on         `Child Proofing'.
Stalford's         project with UNICEF (published in chapter 8 of her monograph         referred to above) has also been the         key reference point in their work with DG Enlargement and         countries wishing to join the EU,         enabling children's rights to be mainstreamed into the accession         negotiations with Montenegro in         particular.
The European Parliament also refers to the Children's Rights Indicators         developed by the authors         in its annual review of the EU's broader fundamental rights agenda,         encouraging their use in         reviewing EU actions relating to children's rights.
It has been adopted as a framework for the development of           children's rights           monitoring at European level and beyond.
Achieving mechanisms for effective monitoring is, in itself, integral         to the development of effective         law and policy and the authors' work has been at the forefront of         efforts in this regard.
Within the         EU's own institutional framework, the European Commission (DG           Justice) has developed an         online database on the `EU acquis and policy documents on rights of the         child' which is informed by         the children's rights checklist developed by Stalford on behalf of UNICEF.
Furthermore, the EU           Fundamental Rights Agency has explicitly adopted the Children's         Rights Indicators as the         methodological basis for further international collaborative children's         rights projects, for example         relating to separated children and child trafficking.
More recently, Stalford was appointed by the Council of Europe           (CoE) to develop a self-         assessment tool to monitor implementation of the 2012 CoE Recommendation         on the Participation         of Children and Young People under the Age of 18.
The tool, which         comprises a series of indicators,         adopts the methodology developed by the authors' EU-related work.
Further afield, within the NGO sector, the rights-based         methodology established for the indicators         study has been endorsed and adopted by other international agencies and         NGOs to inform the         development of indicators on a range of children's rights issues, for         example, by Actionaid in         relation to children's right to education and by the European Federation         for Street Children.
The long term benefits of this work for children themselves are         inevitable insofar as it has         provided a framework within which EU law and policy are developed,         monitored and evaluated in a         manner that is more directly and explicitly responsive to children's         rights and interests.
