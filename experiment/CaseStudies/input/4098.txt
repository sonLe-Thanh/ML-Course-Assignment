            Shaping the content of public broadcasting       Extending and enhancing public understanding of issues of major           religious           significance          Stavrakopoulou's research has been brought to the attention of the       general public through two       high-profile TV documentary series, both of which caused widespread       discussions in the national       press and other media, especially concerning aspects of the research which       challenge traditional       Jewish and Christian beliefs.
Her research has also been used to inform       international policy and       legal decisions.
A document produced by the Supreme Court of the United       States in relation to the       high-profile case of the picketing of funerals of US soldiers by members       of the fundamentalist       Westboro Baptist Church (5.1) cites as evidence Stavrakopoulou's       2010 publication on corpse       abuse (3.5 above).
This publication discusses examples from       biblical texts of the dead being       "subjected to anti-ideal treatments," (p. 69), and is included in the       legal document to contextualise       the Westboro Baptist Church's biblically-based hostility towards the       veneration of corpses.
In 2009 Stavrakopoulou acted as an academic expert for Channel 4's The         Bible: A History - a       documentary series exploring the religious significance and impact of the       Bible.
She advised on the       content of and appeared in two episodes on Abraham and Moses, drawing       directly upon her       research into the religious significance of these cultural ancestors of       Israel (3.1 above).
The       episodes achieved viewing figures of 0.8 million and 1.0 million       respectively.
Stavrakopoulou also       wrote an accompanying article, entitled `Abraham's Inheritance', for       Channel 4's website.
Reviews       of the programmes, broadcast in February 2010, included one in The         Telegraph (5.2) which       highlighted Stavrakopoulou's contribution and her suggestion that Moses       was merely a mythical,       territorial ancestor of Israel (3.1 above, chapter 3).
Subsequently, Stavrakopoulou was invited to write and present three       hour-long documentary       programmes for BBC2 based on her academic research and expertise.
Bible's         Buried Secrets,       broadcast in March 2011, again raised questions about the biblical       portrayal of religion and history       which challenged beliefs central to Judaism and Christianity, such as       whether the empire of the       biblical King David ever existed (episode one; 3.4 above), and       whether the ancient Israelites       worshipped a goddess (episode two; 3.3 above, chapter 4).
Episode       three also drew on       Stavrakopoulou's research on the Garden of Eden (3.2 and 3.6 above).
Stavrakopoulou's writing       of the programmes in collaboration with BBC staff meant that her knowledge       and expertise directly       impacted upon their content, format and presentation, and during the       making of the series she       gave an in-house seminar for staff at BBC TV Centre about the research       used in the making of the       programmes.
A statement from the BBC's series' executive producer comments       that: "Francesca's       research expertise was crucial to the shaping of Bible's Buried Secrets.
First, she was able to       advise the BBC to drop certain programme ideas that were not credible       subject areas for the       series; second... she was able to find a focus that would make for an       original and compelling       documentary in what is after all a highly sensitive area."

The documentaries were screened in a primetime slot, achieving viewing       figures per episode of       1.95 million, 1.62 million and 1.56 million.
They have since been posted       on YouTube, attracting       audiences from the UK, the USA, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan,       Singapore and the       Solomon Islands, with the most popular extracts achieving over 488,000       views and 3,800       comments (5.4).
The programmes have also been franchised to BBC       Worldwide, and broadcast in       countries including Sweden and Australia.
The programmes were widely previewed in the national press, with the       idea, presented in episode       two, that the God of the ancient Israelites might have had a wife (3.3         above, chapter 4) attracting       particularly widespread coverage.
Reviews of the series appeared in the Telegraph,       the       Independent, the Daily Mail and the Times HE Supplement       as well as on Time website (5.5).
A       number of religious publications have commented on the controversial       content of the programmes,       with the Catholic Herald featuring an article (5.6)       discussing Stavrakopoulou's research findings,       shown in episode three, about the Garden of Eden (3.2 and 3.6 above),       and the Catholic website       Protect the Pope responding to episode one, which called into       question the existence of King       David (3.4 above).
The Mormon Dialogue discussion forum       demonstrates the further impact of the       third episode on religious communities (5.7), while the Guardian       has included comment on the       implications of Stavrakopoulou's research for the future of the Mormon       Church (5.8).
The Guardian       has also produced an edition of their `Passnotes' series featuring Asherah       (5.9) in response to       episode two of the documentaries.
The Spring 2011 broadcast of the BBC       TV's viewer reply       programme Points of View (Spring 2011) carried a main feature on       the series, and BBC Radio 3's       Night Waves (14th March 2011) has included a discussion       of it, while Stavrakopoulou's BBC TV       blog post about the programmes attracted 322 comments during the short       period in which readers       were able to post responses to the blog.
As a result of the content and impact of the documentaries,       Stavrakopoulou has appeared several       times as a panellist on BBC1's religion and ethics programme The Big         Questions, appeared as a       guest on BBC1's Sunday Morning Live, contributed to a televised       discussion programme on BBC4,       appeared on the US History Channel's documentary series Secrets of the         Bible, been interviewed       on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, and participated in Radio 4's panel       show, Museum of Curiosity.
One episode of The Big Questions to which Stavrakopoulou       contributed has since been posted on       YouTube, where it has received over 100,000 viewings and attracted nearly       3,500 comments       (5.10).
In July 2011, she presented her research on the suppression       of the Asherah tradition in       Hebrew Bible interpretation (3.3 above), which featured in episode       two of the documentary series,       at the Modern Church conference, an event mostly attended by non-academic       liberal Anglicans.
Also in 2011, her monograph (3.1 above) was discussed by a panel       at the annual conference of       the US Society of Biblical Literature, which exists to foster biblical       scholarship, but also make       resources available to the wider public.
