     The strong growth of interest in OOFDM following research initiated by       Tang in 2005 has led to       OOFDM being extensively explored world-wide by major telecommunication       equipment/system       vendors, service/network providers, telecommunication research institutes       and universities.
In view       of the large commercial potential of this technology, Bangor has       identified three principal means to       maximise the industrial and economic impact of its OOFDM research and       expertise: 1) promoting       OOFDM to standards bodies; 2) establishing the Bangor spin-off company       Smarterlight 3)       providing design services to international telecommunications vendors/       manufacturers.
Since 2008, Bangor has used its research-based expertise to actively       promote OOFDM technology       to various standards bodies by: working closely with major international       telecommunications       companies; participating in and co-ordinating FP7 projects; delivering       seminars at companies;       hosting industrial visitors and working with companies involved in       standards task groups.
Since       2010 the Full Service Access Network (FSAN) Next-Generation PON (NGPON)       task group       consisting of leading network providers and vendors worldwide considered       OOFDM as a strong       candidate for NG-PON2 (ITU-T G989.1) standards [5.1].
However in 07/2012       the FSAN adopted       time-wavelength division multiplexing (TWDM) as the primary technology for       NG-PON2.
In       addition, since 2012 the IEEE 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s Fibre Optic Task Force       group has also       considered OOFDM as a candidate technology for high-speed Ethernet systems       (IEEE802.3bm       standards) [5.2].
In a group meeting in 05/2013 no consensus was reached       concerning the       candidate technologies and thus a new IEEE 802.3 400Gb/s Ethernet Study       Group was       subsequently formed, which recommends OOFDM as a candidate technology       [5.2].
In order to further the impact of Bangor OOFDM research, the Bangor       University spin-off company,       Smarterlight Limited (07813373) was registered on 18 Oct 2011.
Smarterlight is dedicated to using       its protected OOFDM technology to develop portable, "future-proof",       cost-effective transceivers       offering end-users with &gt;20Gb/s symmetrical download/upload speeds with       guaranteed quality of       services at price levels currently applied to 20Mb/s services.
Smarterlight is in receipt of a total of       &#163;1.1M first phase funding: In 07/2012, Smarterlight secured a &#163;600k       commercialisation grant plus       a 5-year rental-free office space of 500m2 from Xiamen City       Council, China [5.3], which has       established a hi-tech incubation and innovation platform to promote       technology transfer to address       the central government strategy of "Broadband China and Optical City"       announced in 2011.
In       2013 Finance Wales agreed to make a first phase investment into       Smarterlight of approximately       &#163;500k [5.4].
In addition, Xiamen City Council has agreed to provide total       funding up to &#163;2.3m when       Smarterlight meets defined performance targets [5.3].
At present, 8 people       are working on       Smarterlight projects with a revenue stream of &#163;200k having been       identified in 2013 [5.5].
In 2012, Smartlight was engaged by Huawei (the biggest global       telecommunication equipment       vendor) 1) to develop OOFDM multiple access PON solutions for the Advanced       Technologies       Department of Access Optical Networks in Shenzhen, China [5.6], and 2) to       investigate the       feasibility of utilising OOFDM to upgrade installed 10Gb/s metropolitan       networks to 40Gb/s for the       Huawei's R&amp;D Centre in the US [5.7].
The successful completion of       these projects will lead Huawei       to develop corresponding commercial product lines.
Since September 2012 we       have impacted       technological advancement in respect of Fujitsu Labs (Atsugi, Japan) new       product lines addressing       400Gb/s data centre interconnections [5.8].
