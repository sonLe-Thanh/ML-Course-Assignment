     Much of the rural population of Inner Asia is directly reliant upon       livestock husbandry, with pastoralism supporting the livelihoods of over 5       million people; the conservation of grassland resources is therefore an       important issue.
For example, nearly 42% of China is natural grassland,       but 90% of usable grasslands are currently considered "degraded".
This       rural population is vulnerable; twice in ten years the 700,000 herders of       Mongolia, one-third of the population, have suffered the effects of       extreme winters (-45&#186;C), and this has resulted in some losing 100% of       their herds.
By examining and comparing the effects and outcomes of different policies       for the management of pastoralism, and providing empirically-based       recommendations, the research has benefited supranational agencies and         national policymakers in Inner Asia responsible for pastoral management         and reform, and has also led directly to the establishment in         2008 of the charity, CAMDA, which has provided direct aid to         pastoralists.
The research has been disseminated through reports and publications in       Mongolian, Russian, Chinese and English, and informed international policy       debates; it was cited, for example, by the Committee for the 2009 Nobel       Prize for Economic Governance.
(1) Dissemination has included       public lectures, debates with key stakeholders and involvement in       international governmental discussion (e.g.
Sneath was invited to address       the Intergovernmental UK-Mongolia Round Table 13 March 2008 in Mongolia).
Direct beneficiaries of the outcomes of Humphrey's and Sneath's research       on pastoralism in Inner Asia have been those supranational agencies which       aim to reduce poverty and support sustainable development, such as the       World Bank,(2) the United Nations Food and Agricultural       Organisation (FAO)(3) and Development Programme (UNDP).
(4)       All cite this research in their advisory reports on policy oriented       towards improving the sustainability of pastoralism in Inner Asia, in       particular cultural norms, livelihoods and land-use, and the role of       mobility respectively.
The significance of the research to such bodies is attested, for example,       by a senior World Bank official: "I can confidently say that [Sneath's]         work with Carrie Humphrey ... on Mongolian pastoralism over the last two         decades, has been influential in shaping the approach of the World Bank         and other donors (e.g.
SDC, IFAD, FAO, UNDP) in supporting pastoral         livelihoods, pasture land and risk management in contemporary Mongolia.
"(5)     The influence of the research on policy makers within the area has also       been confirmed by national stakeholders.
In Mongolia, for example, the       Chairman of the Governing Board of the Rural Investment Support Centre NGO       made specific reference to The End of Nomadism (1999) and Sneath's       1998 Science paper as being "highly influential and widely         cited in the literature that policy makers... have drawn upon when         developing policies towards pastoralists and environment in Mongolia".
(6)          The Chairman of the Mongolian Government's Animal Husbandry       Policy Implementation Regulation Office has stated that the The End of         Nomadism research "has directly influenced Pasture Land         Utilization Law to be discussed during the Mongolian Parliament Spring         session".
(7)     Direct evidence of impact in China, and to a lesser extent Russia, is       limited due to the nature of policy making in these countries.
Despite the       bias in published evidence, the advisor to the UNDP stated that "the         work has influenced thinking on grassland policy in Mongolia and China"       (Russia being outside his areas of expertise).
However, he added       that "In China the findings are used to support opposition to current         practices (see Ecology and Society paper [China's Grassland Contract         Policy and its Impacts on Herder Ability to Benefit in Inner Mongolia:         Tragic Feedbacks], 2011)".
(8)     Humphrey and Sneath's research has also helped to establish a research       methodology which has directly influenced international government policy.
The Director of the Analysis Centre of the Government of Buryatia (Russia)       stated in a letter of June 2012: "the use of the methods realised in         your project ...makes possible a proper evaluation of ongoing         socio-economic processes and enables the results of the project to be         taken up into practical actions."
(9) One practical       action being undertaken in Buryatia which reflects the recommendations       made by Humphrey and Sneath is the reintroduction of indigenous cattle       (from China) lost since collectivisation.
(10)     The research has also led to direct aid provided though an NGO, Cambridge       Mongolia Development Appeal (CAMDA).
CAMDA has provided over &#163;200,000 in       direct aid to Mongolian pastoral households since 2008.
In 2012 alone it       funded the refurbishment or digging of 42 shallow wells in 4 provinces.
