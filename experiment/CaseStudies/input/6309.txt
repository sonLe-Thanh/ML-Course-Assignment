     Expanding the audience for Hogg.
Research at Stirling introduced       Hogg to new audiences through the internet, and through the public       literary association, The James Hogg Society.
Both the James Hogg:         Research and Hogg Society's websites top Google's listings for Hogg.
Both are referenced by a range of online sources appealing to the general       public, including the New York-based Best of the Web, which aims       to provide `a comprehensive list of categorized, content-rich,       well-designed websites' and includes the Hogg Research site as among the       best in Britain and Ireland (Hogg Society was included until June 2013).
Websites devoted to Gothic, for example The Literary Gothic and The         Sickly Taper: A Bibliography of Gothic Scholarship, have links to       Stirling's Hogg sites.
They even feature on the highly specialist Border         Collie Museum site (Hogg, who was a shepherd from Ettrick for much       of his life, was a fan of these working dogs).
The Scots Language         Centre, which supplies general public information about Scots       dialects, observes, `A major research project about the early 19th century       Scottish writer James Hogg is culminating in the creation of a growing and       valuable online resource.
It currently contains articles and talks about       Hogg, along with a large collection of Hogg's songs &#8212; both in the format       of song sheets and as audio files'.
The James Hogg Society, founded at       Stirling, has promoted greater understanding of Hogg's work through its       general appeal; approximately half of its membership is non-academic.
It       has hosted biennial conferences (three of them at Stirling) attended by       people from all backgrounds, including Hogg's own descendants from New       Zealand; hosted a series of general-public lectures in the name of the       late Hugh McNaughtan, a Hogg enthusiast; produced a journal; and made       available information and educational material via a website, also based       at Stirling.
Members have engaged with the site and Hogg research, for       example by providing photographs and contributing notes for `A Walk in       Hogg's Footsteps' in the Borders, which traces the path of the fictional       character Robert Wringhim in Hogg's Confessions.
An article aimed       at general readers, `Hogg as Songwriter', was co-authored by Mack and       Gilbert; it was posted on the website and contributed to the       general-interest Association for Scottish Literary Studies' newsletter, ScotLit       26-37 (2009): 3-4.
The same association posted copies of the newsletter       and CD to its members, all Scottish libraries, and every secondary school       in Scotland; it also distributed 1,500 CDs at its `Scottish Writing       Exhibition' at the Modern Language Association annual convention, December       2008, which some attendees have incorporated into their teaching.
Researchers are frequently involved in public events related to Hogg; for       example, Gilbert gave an invited public talk attended by 100 people at an       ASLS conference, Sabhal M&#242;r Ostaig (Gaelic college, University of the       Highlands and Islands, Isle of Skye), speaking on Hogg as a Lowland       `mountain bard' in the Highlands (June 2012).
Engaging contemporary writers and artists.
James Robertson, an       award-winning, bestselling author known for his engagement with Hogg in       his own novels, The Fanatic and The Testament of Gideon Mack,       acknowledges that the S/SC Edition `is certainly where I would now first       go if looking for information about any Hogg text or for a definitive       version of such a text'.
Under the heading for `Sheena Wellington', the Scots         Language Centre notes, `Stirling University has a substantial       research department devoted to James Hogg.
Well known as a Scottish writer       of novels and stories, often with supernatural themes, Hogg also collected       and wrote songs in Scots'.
Wellington became more acquainted with Hogg as       a result of her connection with the Stirling project, and this busy       performer and educator has incorporated more of his songs into her       repertoire.
The centre also notes that the Scottish fiddler Lori Watson       `is also undertaking research about James Hogg'.
Watson, who has recorded       Hogg's song `Maggie' and has been granted permission to play a fiddle that       Hogg owned, developed a stronger interest in Hogg's songs following her       contribution to a Stirling symposium (May 2006).
Songs that were       introduced to Watson through the Hogg project mean that Hogg features       regularly in her performances, for example in one at the Davy Lamp Folk       club 25 February 2012 which may be found on YouTube.
Generating greater public appreciation of Scottish culture around the         world.
The CD `I'll sing ye a wee bit sang': Selected Songs by James Hogg,       reviewed as `instructive as well as eminently listenable' by Robert Calder       (Studies in Hogg and His World 18 (2007)), presents a selection of       Hogg's songs from miscellaneous song sheets and a variety of published       song collections.
It has appealed broadly to those seeking information       regarding Scottish literature, music, and culture.
International libraries       (e.g., the Johns Hopkins Libraries; the Sidney Cox Library of Music and       Dance, Cornell; York University Library) have catalogued the CD; and The       Royal Conservatoire of Scotland has a link to the website.
General-interest requests for copies of the CD have come, for example,       from members of the St Andrews Society in San Francisco and from an       individual seeking to play the songs as part of a presentation to the       Melrose Literary Society.
Folk singers from Oxford contacted Stirling       researchers to report their delight at discovering the CD at an English       folk festival.
In April 2013 the CD was requested through the website by       the president of the Mid-South Celtic Arts Alliance in Earle, Arkansas.
As       a result, songs from it are being played on Strands of the Celtic Knot,       a weekly programme which has run for 22 years on WEVL FM in Memphis,       Tennessee; this radio station also has an internet presence and is widely       extolled for its programming in folk and roots music.
Mudcat Caf&#233;,       the Pennsylvania-based folksong networking resource which hosts the       Digital Folk Song Database of 9,000-plus items, refers readers to the James         Hogg: Research website for information on Hogg's songs.
The CD has       been adopted by teachers who obtained copies at the MLA convention; for       instance, a professor of English at Trinity Western University, British       Columbia, reports `it has been invaluable for a number of lectures' and a       St Andrews Society talk.
The S/SC edition's reputation as a whole was       singled out for praise by MSP Michael Russell, Cabinet Secretary for       Education and Lifelong Learning, at the launch of Stirling University's       strategic plan at the Scottish Parliament (29 September 2011).
