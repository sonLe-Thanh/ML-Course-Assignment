     The work on application of MBPC algorithms in different industries has       continued in Kingston since 2006.
Several application areas have been       considered as described above.
In those application areas, the commercial       implementation of the algorithms is currently at a range of developmental       stages.
The most advanced application is in automotive power train       control.
In automotive power-train applications, the theoretical results       stimulated collaboration with MAN Truck &amp; Bus AG in Germany.
The       project started in 2007 and has now reached the stage when the       implementation of the algorithms has been successfully completed and the       fuel savings have been documented.
In extensive trials performed by MAN, the system achieved fuel savings of       between 6.5% and 8.3%.
Their estimate of the average fuel saving over       their total fleet of vehicles on the European motorway network is 4%.
Based on these test results, MAN began to introduce this system into       their trucks and buses in early 2013.
With yearly production of long       distance vehicles at MAN being around 30,000 vehicles, and average fuel       consumption of these vehicles being 38,700 litres/year, the estimated fuel       savings are approximately 1550 litres/year per long distance vehicle.
This       amounts to over 46 million litres per year for the long distance fleet.
Economic benefits include the reduction of the costs of public transport       and transportation of goods.
Environmental impacts are emission reductions of around 4%.
