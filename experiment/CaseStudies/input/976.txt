     The activities detailed below enriched the cultural life of the       population of Hardelot itself, of French       and international visitors to the town, and of the employees of Tata       Group.
They enabled public       exploration of a previously little-known connection between France and       India, including the first       case of an Indian company investing in France, prompting reflection on       issues related to the future       challenges of globalization in France.
Major public exhibition          The first and principal outcome of the collaboration was an exhibition       displayed on a         series of large-format all-weather panels (for confidentiality reasons this link is       password-protected - user       name: REF3b, password: Liverpool2014), and sited along the primary       pedestrian access route       from the town centre to Hardelot Beach at the height of the summer season       from 24 June to 24       September 2011.
Anticipating its importance for the town's prestige and       future heritage tourism       from India, the Mayor's office and the Hardelot Tourist Office allocated       US$ 21,000 to support the       events.
TG matched this funding, in the interests of its company profile       in France and Europe.
The       Tourist Office and the Mayor decided to make the exhibition the       centrepiece of Hardelot's cultural       offering throughout the summer of 2011, and all official events, from       public lectures and fashion       shows to hands-on art workshops for children aged 4 to 6, had an Indian       theme that year.
A full-colour       brochure publicising the exhibition and these events, and including       all dates and times, was       prepared by the Tourist Office.
The opening ceremony on 29 July 2011 was       attended by locals       from Hardelot (some of whom live in the properties once owned by the       Tatas), the Chief of Mission       at the Indian Embassy in Paris, the Mayor of Hardelot, the regional Head       of Tata Communications,       and a chief archivist from TCA, Pune, India.
In the event, some 14,000 visitors, both locals and tourists from other       parts of France, Belgium, the       Netherlands and the UK viewed the exhibition.
It was also covered       extensively in the media.
The       coverage included a feature on France 3 Television broadcast as part of       the evening news bulletin       on 29 July 2011.
This included a short interview with Magedera and with       locals expressing their       attachment to their town's connection with India.
Two locals testify to       the fact that before the       exhibition they did not know who the Tatas were, how many properties they       owned in the town, or       how important TG had become.
In India, through a copyright exchange       agreement, Tata Central       Archives - India's oldest company archive and a key beneficiary - has been       able to enhance its       collections with the material from the exhibition and make it available to       people in India.
Public outreach and capacity building          The research for this project also unearthed how, during the First World       War, the British Indian       Army set up a hospital in a Hardelot hotel to treat injured Indian       soldiers (panel 11 of the exhibition       was devoted to this period).
Archival research done under Magedera's       guidance in the UK by Dr       William Leigh (a mature undergraduate student in History at the University       of Liverpool), led to an       illustrated public lecture on " Les soldats indiens &#224; Hardelot pendant la       Grande Guerre &#187;, delivered       by Dr Leigh in Hardelot on 5 August 2011.
This event was hosted in a       municipal meeting room and       attended by twenty-five Hardelotois and by members of the Conseil des       sages, a group of senior       business and public sector figures.
A further demonstration of the       exhibition's successful capacity       building is that, through the involvement of local officials and news       media, it raised awareness of       the presence of First-World-War Indian war graves in the region during a       commemoration visit to       Hardelot by Commonwealth academics (from Australia, New Zealand, India and       Canada), 15-16       September 2011 (see Sources to corroborate the impact, below).
Legacy impact in 2012: permanent display of exhibition panels          In February 2012, Tata Communications (a multinational telecommunications       infrastructure       company with 7,700 staff and a revenue of US$ 2.6 billion in 2011)       requested permission to       reproduce fifteen of the exhibition panels for permanent display in the       staff offices of their       European headquarters in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris.
Fifty key       personnel are employed at this       site.
This represents acknowledgement of the potential of the exhibition       panels to support       corporate identity in a multinational environment.
Legacy impact in 2013: the exhibition contextualizes trade           relations between Europe and           India          Magedera's research and its dissemination have opened up new channels for       dialogue in       international business by raising awareness of the history of interchanges       between France and       India.
On 28 March 2013, the External Trade Commission of Brittany hosted       a conference on TG,       entitled Rencontre           entre Inde et Bretagne, which emphasized France's role in TG's       early       internationalization.
After viewing the exhibition panels in Hardelot,       External Trade Commissioner       Jean-Claude Breton chose the panels to form a physical centrepiece at the       conference venue.
Keynote speakers at the conference included Mr Anwar Hasan (the Head of       Tata UK) and Mr B.       Muthuraman (Vice Chairman of Tata Steel).
Impact from this research is       ongoing.
Although outside       the census period, it is important to note that the exhibition started a       nationwide tour on 14       September 2013 with a two-week display in Morlaix,       Brittany, followed by a one-week display in       Lorient,       Brittany.
It will subsequently visit Paris and Lille, and a number of       other major         centres to be       confirmed.
