     Research from the Bristol seismology group has led to a broad range of       software that has been incorporated into commercial code used for       geomechanical modelling, measuring shear-wave splitting, characterising       fractures, and assessing induced seismicity.
Consequently, the end users       (and thus beneficiaries) of this research are oil and gas companies       looking to decrease their risk, improve oil and gas exploratory efforts       and minimise exploration costs.
For example, commercial impact is broad in       that many (&gt; 50 worldwide) multinational companies are now using       Rockfield's coupled software to study the geomechanical behaviour and       seismic properties of producing reservoirs and understanding fracturing       and permeability effects; "the output from the IPEGG project has been         used regularly to address major challenges facing the petroleum         industry" [a].
Consequently, the IPEGG project has been       viewed as highly successful by both Rockfield Software and the project       sponsors (BG, BP, ENI, Statoil), with the resulting software being applied       to various projects, such as "predicting stress changes and subsidence         due to the production from major chalk fields in the North Sea;         assessing optimum position to place an oil platform in the North Sea;         assessing the optimal mud-weights to use when drilling deviated wells in         the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico.
In addition, we are currently using         the software to conduct a major (&#163;950,000) project to optimize hydraulic         fracturing within shale gas reservoirs"[a].
Rockfield has witnessed impressive software sales leading directly to an       expansion in their oil and gas business.
This increase in Rockfield's       capabilities has driven international business to a medium-sized UK based       company; "Since the completion of IPEGG we have witnessed significant         impact both in terms of sales of the software resulting from the project         and consultancy projects that we have undertaken using the         software/workflows.
In particular, ELFENTMand         the module to couple to production simulation models was purchased by BP         and ENI of the IPEGG sponsors at a cost of &#163;40,000 per license per year         over the past three years.
Additional licenses, which total &#163;80,000/year         have been sold to other companies.
In addition, Rockfield Software have         conducted around &#163;400,000 of consultancy work for the petroleum industry         using the software developed" [a].
There is then benefit for       the operators who are hiring Rockfield, in that the improved reservoir       models will enable them to maximise production while minimising the       environmental and operational cost of geomechanical issues like subsidence       (damage to be paid for), well-bore failure (cost of workovers and/or       drilling replacement wells) and caprock fracturing (loss of hydrocarbon       into overburden formations).
A novel aspect of the IPEGG project has been the development linking       geomechanical modelling with fluid flow [14].
For instance, Roxar       has led to the development of a very efficient memory- passing interface       (MPI) by coupling their software TempestTM with ELFENTM,       which "At a time when operators are looking to optimise production         from increasingly marginal assets and make effective decisions over the         allocation of capital and resources, the models and analytical processes         that define modern reservoir simulation have never been more important"       [c].
More recently, this software has been utilised to assess       potential leakage from CO2 storage sites and to assess the use       of seismic tools for monitoring CO2 movement in the subsurface       [15,17].
This research conducted at Bristol has "influenced BP         operations and future directions in a number of ways, specifically with         application to the Valhall oil field...The success of the project was         influential in BP's decision to use ELFEN for geomechanical modelling in         our North Sea reservoirs.
Notably, we are applying the software         extensively to better manage the giant Valhall oilfield which is the 5th       largest field in Norwegian waters" [d].
This has led to two       further JIPs, the GESER and FRACGAS project [a,1,4].
Consequently,       IPEGG and its underpinning research is viewed as a major success by the       Industry Technology Facilitator (ITF); "One of the things that ITF has         tried to encourage is the formation of consortia with world class         expertise to tackle fundamental industry issues.
This project is a good         example of how well this approach can work &#8212; it has brought together         people that not only have an excellent track record of rapidly applying         research findings to meet the needs of industry but also have experience         bringing software packages to the market place" [e].
At the inception of the BUMPS project "there was significant         scepticism in large parts of industry regarding the viability of the use         of surface seismic arrays for the monitoring of hydraulic fracturing"       [f].
However, the BUMPS project has demonstrated that surface       seismic monitoring was feasible and has helped to provide confidence to       the industry that surface monitoring was viable [f].
Indeed,       Bristol's research into ocean bottom sensors to monitor passive seismic       events in oil fields has influenced the establishment of the Life of Field       Seismic array at Valhall in 2003 at a cost of over $46 million [d].
This research has led to the formation of a small spin-out company, which       in 2012, was bought by Halliburton Energy Services and can be viewed as a       measure of the success of the project [d]; "The BUMPS research         on surface-microseismic imaging spawned a new company that was ripe for         acquisition given the dramatic rise in shale play activity worldwide.
Kit Chambers left Bristol and formed Reservoir RockTalk [sic in 2010], a         microseismic imaging start-up, which was subsequently bought out by         Halliburton Energy Services" [sic in 2012] [b].
The BUMPS consortium has grown from having 4 sponsors to 10 in a short       amount of time and is widely recognised as an industry-leading project       with Kendall providing advice on research quality and directions for       international companies such as Schlumberger.
As such, "Schlumberger         views the work of Professor Kendall's consortium as being of both a high         scientific quality and highly relevant to real world problems, setting         it apart from many other academic consortia" [f].
Research       conducted at Bristol has also been "key to defining the standard         magnitude measures used in the mitigation of risks due to induced         seismicity during hydraulic fracturing" and to "reduce location         uncertainties of microseismic events" [f].
It can be       concluded that "BUMPS is an important industry consortium providing         independent fundamental research into new capabilities and applications         of microseismic and other passive seismic monitoring under the advice of         industry service providers and operators.
Such research fills a critical         need in the industry due to limited research investments in the private         sector...and allows for quicker advancement and adoption of new         technology across industry improving commercial results and addressing         public interests" [b].
To summarise, "the work done at Bristol over the past decade in         microseismic research has made a significant contribution to the         development of microseismic technology through innovative research,         publication of ideas and case studies, and the training of young         geophysicists who currently work in this business.
The research carried         out at Bristol has had significant commercial impact in helping drive         the growth of this business" [g].
In addition, both the       IPEGG and BUMPS projects have trained numerous PhD students, many of whom       have gone on to successful careers in the oil industry as a direct result       of the training, reputation of research excellence, and academic-industry       collaborations of the UoA.
