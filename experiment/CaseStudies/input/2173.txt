     Impact on UK policy and practice       The impact of the Newcastle University-led research has been significant       in the UK.
First, as a matter of policy, almost all newly diagnosed CGD       patients are now listed for bone marrow transplant.
This is because       transplantation as soon as possible after diagnosis is preferred since       delay lengthens the period in which infections or inflammatory problems       can become established.
Such problems were shown by Newcastle research to       be major risk factors for serious complications around the time of the       transplant.
Second, transplantation with bone marrow from a matched       unrelated donor is now considered acceptable when matched sibling donors       are not available.
This means that many more transplants are possible than       was previously the case.
This approach to the treatment of new CGD cases       pioneered at Newcastle has been adopted by the other UK specialist centre       &#8212; Great Ormond Street Hospital.
The Director of the Bone Marrow       Transplantation Unit there has confirmed that practice at that hospital       has changed as a result of Newcastle University research, saying,     `Undoubtedly up to 2009 we had a different approach to BMT [bone       marrow transplantation] in CGD between the two NCG units       [Newcastle and Great Ormond Street] with a much more conservative         approach at GOS compared to Newcastle.
Also without doubt your         presentations at the NCG audit meetings and your publication of the         excellent outcome of the Newcastle single centre experience of MSD/MUD*         for CGD, convinced us to change our strategy to match yours.'
(Ev a)       [*matched sibling donor and matched unrelated donor transplantation]     The effect of the changes in policy and practice are demonstrated in the       number and type of bone marrow transplants carried out in the UK on       patients with CGD (Ev b) and shown in table 1.

What is also striking is the shift from       using bone marrow from matched sibling donors to using that from matched       unrelated donors.
The effect of this has been to increase the total number       of transplants carried out (a larger pool of available donors) and this is       particularly notable in the data from Great Ormond Street.
Of the 36       transplants between 2008 and 2013 32 children are alive and cured of the       disease.
It is thus clear that many children now have a significantly       better quality of life, than would otherwise have been the case.
Impact on international guidelines and practice       The European Society for Immunodeficiencies and European Group for Blood       and Marrow Transplantation published guidelines in 2011 on bone marrow       transplantation for treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, a class of       diseases that includes CGD.
The guidelines recommend a more conservative       approach (a default position of anti-microbial prophylaxis) than that       taken in the UK but they nonetheless incorporated Newcastle University       research findings, describing excellent outcomes after transplants with       matched unrelated donor material.
The guidelines state that either of the       inherited forms of CGD can be cured with transplants from matched sibling,       matched unrelated and mis-matched unrelated donors (Ev c, p19).
Two       Newcastle research papers (R1 &amp; R2) are listed among the five       supporting references in the chronic granulomatous disease section of the       guidelines document.
In the United States bone marrow transplantation is now increasingly       preferred as a treatment for children with CGD.
In a 2011 paper,       clinicians at the National Institutes of Health cited the European and UK       experience of transplantation (including R1 and R2) and concluded:     `allogeneic transplantation has improved dramatically over the last         decade....
It has become a successful and sensible option for many         patients with CGD that will likely treat and prevent both infectious and         inflammatory complications.'
(Ev d)     Engagement with patient group       With a base in London, the UK CGD Society attracts members from all over       the world (59% are from outside the UK).
Around 150 people are now       registering with the society each year.
Their website www.cgdsociety.org       is a source of information about the science of CGD, diagnosis, disease       management and treatment, and acts as a portal to facilitate access of       patients and their families to support services.
Gennery has contributed       significantly to material on the society website that explains bone marrow       transplantation, including presenting a video in which he sets out to       demystify bone marrow transplantation.
There have been over 1200 page       views on the bone marrow transplantation section of the society's website.
A representative from the society has described the impact of the       Newcastle University research on patients:     `More families with young children are now actively considering       [bone marrow transplant (BMT)] as a treatment option for CGD when their         child is well rather than when they become seriously ill.
This is a         significant step forward and has been made possible by the advances and         increased success of BMT for all primary immunodeficiencies, including         CGD.
Dr Gennery... has also added important knowledge about the impact         of CGD on the quality of life of those affected and demonstrated how         this and the growth and development of children returns to normal post         BMT.'
(Ev e)     The change in approach by clinicians in the UK towards treatment of the       disease is reflected in the information provided by the UK CGD Society to       patients and their families.
The society's An introduction to bone         marrow transplantation for parents, which was approved in July 2013       by the CGD Society and a Specialty Doctor in bone marrow transplant at       Great Ormond Street Hospital, states:     `A bone marrow transplant is now the recommended course of treatment         for any child diagnosed with CGD.
As with every medical procedure, there         is a level of risk associated with a BMT.
However, in most cases,         experts consider this risk to be manageable.'
(Ev f)     Although the numbers of patients being treated is small, the two centres       together have had a significant impact on CGD in the UK, reaching all       those in need and contributing to the improved health and wellbeing of not       only the children themselves, but also their wider families.
