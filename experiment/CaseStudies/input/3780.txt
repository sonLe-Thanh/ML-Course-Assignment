     The KTP, with its emphasis on knowledge transfer and use of       action-research methodology, proved an effective vehicle for influencing       the sector.
Research and analysis were quickly translated into       demonstration models, knowledge and skillsets for dissemination to       Creative Scotland staff and to approximately 20 small and medium       enterprises (SMEs) within the sector, each involving between two to six       people.
Working on site with the companies, the KTP Associate trained       staff and helped implement software to analyse social media marketing and       build pre-release demand for films, and trans-media release campaigns       involving mobile apps, digital games and digital comics.
The project reached beyond the KTP and Creative Scotland's' client base       by transferring skills and knowledge to other workers in the wider       cultural and creative industries and the general public, via presentations       at the following events, most conducted after the KTP finished in January       2012:            `Insights &amp; Ideas' panel discussion to 40 cultural and creative         industries workers, organised by Creative Scotland, 03/11/2011,         Edinburgh: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/2303991300        "Social Media Marketing", workshop for 80 creative industries         practitioners, organised by Moving Targets, 20/04/2012, Edinburgh: http://movingtargets.org.uk/news/name,9732,en.html.
"Film Festivals in the Digital Age", panel discussion to 50 producers,         development officers, funders, and festival participants, organised by         Edinburgh International Film Festival, 22/06/2012: http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/films/2012/film-festivals-in-the-digital-age        "Digital Distribution: Revolution or Confusion?"
seminar for 45         industry representatives, organised by Edinburgh International Film         Festival, 23/06/2012.
"Social Network Analysis" training for approx.
25 cultural and         creative industries SMEs, public organisations, and practitioners,         organised by AmbITion Scotland, 05/12/2012: Glasgow.

The KTP and underpinning research continue to impact the ability of       Scotland's film industry to capitalise on its intellectual property and       compete in national and international markets by improving film companies'       capacity to:             Secure improved revenue opportunities: Several companies         benefitted from the KTP Associate's modelling of innovative approaches         to recoupment revenue and financial plan- ning.
Since working with the         KTP in 2010-2012, Sigma Films has converted this into invest- ments         worth over &#163;350,000 for four internationally released films (S1),         two of which were selected for the prestigious Sundance 2011 and SXSW         2012 festivals (S6, S7).
"The new approach to revenue           sharing arrangements enabled Sigma Films to secure a recoupment           corridor...and benefit more directly from the exploitation of its           intellectual property" (S1).
Attract increased investment: The KTP Associate began working         with the Scottish Documentary Institute in 2011 to trial a new         distribution and audience engagement strategy, the Virtuous Circle (VC).
This effort has thus far leveraged &#163;100,000 in finance, won funding for         a full-time post of Producer of Marketing and Distribution, and sparked         development of a digital fundraising toolkit which has attracted more         than &#163;75,600 in further investments, with 3 of 5 films still to be         exploited (S2).
SDI is now an organisation, according to the         Cinema Research Institute at New York University, "doing very           interesting things in the world of independent film financing,           distribution, audience building, and campaigning" (S8).
Develop skillsets: The research also improved companies'         abilities to use innovative digital technologies for marketing, social         media, and data management: "The innovative work practices developed           [2011-ongoing] as part of VC have created great benefits by spreading           across our slate of films at SDI.
This means our digital data           management and viewer interaction capability has increased           dramatically, benefitting our film producers, subjects, students and           the company as well" (S2).
Conduct strategic marketing and distribution campaigns: The         research on digital tools, particularly for marketing and distribution         (M&amp;D), provided timely evidence for Distrify, a new digital         marketing company which the KTP supported from 2010 through business         planning which enabled transformation from a previous company,         Accidental Media.
Early success included new Creative Scotland funding         to support Distrify's research-informed digital campaign models, and         contracts to market the Sigma and SDI projects above (S3).
"As           a result of the public funder's new focus on digital marketing and           distribution a number of film projects have benefited from investment,           on a number of occasions choosing to use Distrify as a service" (S3).
Currently Distrify supplies online distribution for the British Film         Institute and The Guardian, and is a global provider of African and         Bollywood cinema.
The research also impacted on the industry support agency, Creative       Scotland, by enabling it to:             Reprioritise and enlarge industry funding programmes: KTP         analysis of past investment decisions along with improved data         management (below) influenced a significant shift in Creative Scotland         industry funding.
In the case of marketing and distribution projects         (M&amp;D), which received &#163;40K in 2009/10, the KTP demonstrated the need         to integrate digital M&amp;D concerns across all aspects of film-making,         leading Creative Scotland to award over &#163;600k for such purposes in         2011/12.
M&amp;D funding came largely from Creative Scotland's new &#163;1         million Film Investment Fund, which awarded &#163;850k to companies on the         strength of their research-informed trials of new financial models for         increasing film distribution (S9).
The models emphasise the role         of leveraging additional marketplace funding, and indeed one recipient,         the recently launched Mackendrick Film Fund, aims to attract additional         support totalling &#163;35 million for Scottish film-makers (S10),         compared to &#163;3m from public funds.
Improve capture and strategic use of data: During 2010-12, the         KTP contributed substantially to improving data management by         demonstrating need for a `customer relationship management programme'         and a `grants and investment management system' (S4, page 2),         which improve the agency's assessment of applications for funding and         returns on investment.
Prior to the KTP, Scottish Screen had no systems         to collect information about digital consumption or cross-value-chain         audience engagement.
Now Creative Scotland collects diverse data on         social and cultural returns from IP, including social media, prompting         the spread of digital marketing and distribution innovations.
Enhance staff skills: In addition to providing one-to-one         training with individual companies, the action research conducted         2010-12 provided knowledge exchange and training in situ to Creative         Scotland decision makers involved in film market development, film         investment, and development of other creative industry sectors.
"One           of the things that really struck me during the project was the advance           in software and data gathering tools in such a short time,           highlighting the importance of keeping up to speed in a constantly           evolving environment.
We learned a lot through the project and one key           area where we still have work to do is in effective data gathering and           analysis &#8212; to better understand the needs and opportunities not only           in film but across the creative industries" (S4, page 2).
In summary, the KT Partnership was assessed as `Very Good' by the       Technology Strategy Board's external review (S5).
The significance       for Scotland's film industry of the KTP and its underpinning research is       its influence in improving strategic decision-making and substantially       increasing industry funding by Creative Scotland.
For individual film       companies, the impacts include improved capacity to: capitalise on       creative content through new skills, access to technology and finance;       make returns on investments; and participate in national and international       film markets.
