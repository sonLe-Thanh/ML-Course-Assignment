     In November 2010, Drakeley presented the new findings regarding the       effectiveness of single dose       PQ-ACT combination in reducing P. falciparum gametocyte prevalence       for G6PD-deficient and       non-deficient populations to the WHO Joint Initiative for Vaccine       Research/Global Malaria       Programme Scientific Forum.
This led directly to the publication of       a new WHO guideline: `Addition       of a single dose of primaquine to ACT treatment for uncomplicated falciparum       malaria as an anti-gametocyte,       particularly as a component of pre-elimination or an elimination       programme, is       therefore recommended'.5.1 This recommendation marks an       important operational change in WHO       strategies &#8212; essentially, elimination requires a shift in focus from just       treating individuals showing       malaria symptoms to also treating asymptomatic carriers of the disease &#8212;       and has put the LSHTM       research at the forefront of activities to identify and attack foci of       clinical and asymptomatic       infections that perpetuate transmission.
These activities include the       following.
Development of medicines and vaccines     Among the 30-40 representatives from academia, industry, regulatory and       funding agencies who       attended a WHO meeting on measures of efficacy of antimalarial       interventions against malaria       transmission were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),       the Gates Foundation,       GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) of the       international non-profit       organisation, PATH.
LSHTM findings directly contributed to a refocusing of       strategies for       combating and eliminating malaria.5.2 The Medicines for Malaria       Venture (MMV) &#8212; a leading       product development partnership in the field of antimalarial drug research       and development &#8212;       changed its definition of the target candidate profile for a single       exposure radical cure for the       treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria in children and adults to include       killing gametocytes to       prevent transmission of the parasite to the mosquito.
They have since been       engaged in a series of       tests to determine which marketed and in-development antimalarials will       have gametocidal or       transmission-blocking capability.5.3     How malaria elimination strategies are targeted     LSHTM findings regarding the heterogeneity of transmission and the       existence of transmission       `hotspots' have impacted at individual country level where there is new       focus on identifying and       targeting geographic clusters of asymptomatic carriage.
One example of       this is Mexico, where the       Department of Health used data generated from passive case detection, case       investigations and       reactive screenings to map cases to identify risk factors for transmission       and then target malaria       control interventions in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.5.4       These strategies have contributed to       an 83% decrease in reported malaria cases between 2000-2010.
Swaziland's National Malaria Control Programme's (SNMCP) also made       strategic transition       towards malaria pre-elimination using LSHTM methodologies to identify       transmission hotspots.
All       people residing within 1km of an index case were screened for infection,       as were groups with       increased risk of infection and at ports of entry.
Through this process,       the government has been       able to reduce the disease burden to negligible levels and to save lives:       confirmed cases       decreased by 42% between January 2011 and June 2012, putting Swaziland on       course to become       the first mainland sub-Saharan African nation to eliminate malaria by       2015.5.5     Since May 2013, as a direct result of their extensive field experience       and their application of direct       membrane feeding assays to measure the impact of drug interventions,       Drakeley and Bousema       have been recruited to provide technical, operational and logistic advice       to the PATH MVI for       protocol development for African field trials of new vaccines.
There are       15,000 children currently       enrolled in PATH trials.
`Drs Drakeley and Bousema are important members       of MVI's technical       working groups on malaria transmission blocking vaccines given their       involvement in various       aspects of malaria control and elimination'.5.6     Impact on international malaria elimination programmes     As a direct result of the expertise gained through the research, Drakeley       has been called upon to       update national malaria programme managers on the use of serological       techniques in malaria       epidemiology and management at events including the Workshop for Horn of       Africa Network for       Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment (Egypt 2009).5.7     In September 2012, with inclusion of new field data contributed by LSHTM,       WHO published an       addendum to its 2010 recommendation proposing a new lower dose of       primaquine for wider use as       part of the control of the spread of drug resistance.5.8     Increased public awareness     LSHTM research has been made accessible to the public through interviews       with major media       organisations such as BBC News Online (January, May 2010) and the BBC       World Service's       flagship breakfast programme, Newsday (September 2012).
