     International economic integration is increasingly important and       TradeSift illuminates economic       effects and policy implications robustly and cheaply.
It is also an       effective tool for capacity-building       on trade policy and more than 400 policy makers from over 70 countries       have been trained since       2000.
The interactive nature of the programmes allows officials from       different countries to analyse       sensitive bilateral trade policy issues in an informal non-negotiating       context with open agendas.
How the research underpins the impact:     TradeSift was developed from having undertaken complex computer modelling       and in recognition       of the high financial and human cost to policy makers of such modelling       for the analysis of trade       performance, to help understand policy options, and to engage in trade       negotiations.
This is       particularly the case for developing countries.
It distils the results of       extensive theoretical and       empirical work undertaken in part by the Sussex team into robust usable       guidelines.
Impact on capacity of policy-makers:     The work has impacted on the UK, EU and many developing countries.
The       direct impact of this       process has been to provide a tool for policy-makers and government       ministries, and to build       capacity for trade policy decision-making and negotiation.
The feedback       from participants has been       invariably positive [see Section 5, C1]:     `... my Director is particularly pleased that I was able to use it         [TradeSift] to analyse trade data         and draw inferences on the implications of the GSTP and D8 preferential         trade agreements for         Nigeria' (Trade Official, Nigeria)     `Our WTO mission is already examining the possibility of incorporating         this scheme of data         analyses into our regular training courses for the Trade Officers prior         to their departure to         respective serving stations abroad' (Commercial Counsellor, WTO,         Pakistan)     `Thanks for the superb training, support and making economic modelling         appealing to a lawyer.
I shared my lessons with the Economic Diplomacy team here and as a first         step we've agreed         to test the software on an Aid for Trade job that we're involved in'         (South African Institute of         International Affairs)     `Without doubt, the knowledge and experience gained during the 5-day         course will be shared         with my colleagues in my home country.
The course will assist my country         a lot in analysing         trade policies as well as other developing countries' (Trade Official,         Botswana)     On average 78 per cent of course participants claimed that TradeSift was       useful to their daily work,       and over 86 per cent stated that their colleagues would benefit [C1].
Impact through improved trade policy:     Early recognition of the usefulness of the software came from the UK       government's Trade Policy       Unit (TPU) which provided initial funding in 2009, and a number of the       TPU's team have used       TradeSift and attended training:     `The original idea of the Sussex Framework was to correct a mismatch         in resources between         negotiators in developing countries and those in the developed world.
In         those countries with         some trade economics capability TradeSift has dramatically improved the         situation.
It has done         the same for the UK government.'
[C3]     `TradeSift was used regularly for manipulating and analysing large         trade and tariff datasets.
This information was combined with information from stakeholders to         identify UK and ultimately         EU priorities in current and future trade negotiations.'
[C4]     `TradeSift analytic outputs played a key role in forming European         Commission and UK         negotiating positions on the future of the GSP, the EU's principal trade         preference scheme [for       developing countries] in advance of the negotiations.'
[C5]     An initial contract in 2012 for training and capacity-building for the       Ministry of Commerce, India has       led to a 3-year joint programme of training and research for Indian and       Pakistani trade officials.
Even during the current political tensions, officials from both countries       have jointly participated in       TradeSift training in Delhi and Kathmandu and a workshop in Islamabad is       being planned.
The joint       workshop in Delhi was the first time Pakistani officials had visited the       Indian Institute of Foreign       Trade:     `TradeSift, indeed, can play a significant role in meaningful analysis         of India-Pakistan trade         flows and potential.
My reports will be very useful for policy decisions         on Pakistan-India trade         relations.'
(Trade Minister, Pakistan High Commission, New Delhi)     The department works closely with both the Indian and Pakistan Commerce       ministries and       increasingly with External Affairs in Delhi and believes it is one of the       few projects facilitating       contact between personnel of the two states and the UK [C7, C8, C9].
Under the Trade Advocacy Fund programme in 2013 Tradesift also provided       training and on-going       support to the East African Community (EAC): `The course is proving to         be very useful in assisting         the EAC in preparing negotiating positions on market integration' [C6].
They expect to be       delivering courses in Zambia and Laos, shortly, as part of this funding       framework.
In 2011-2013 three courses were provided for over 40 participants from       nine countries for the       Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which       wishes to       enhance the capacity of its staff and members, several of whom have       requested proposals for       further work.
Further examples of the use of TradeSift include its use to       analyse the Free Trade       Area options facing Bangladesh by their Ministry of Trade; identifying       future export opportunities for       the Tunisian Government; the analysis of competitiveness in key products       by the Dubai       government; and the Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment of the deep and       comprehensive free       trade area negotiated between the EU and Moldova.
