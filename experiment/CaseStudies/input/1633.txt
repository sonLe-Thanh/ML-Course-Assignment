     Arising from the Retrovirus Molecular Biology Group at Oxford University,       Oxford BioMedica is a pioneer in the emerging field of gene-therapy and       the production of gene therapy products.
In addition to the LentiVector&#174;       platform products, it has conducted trials of its TroVax&#174; product in       cancers of the kidney, colon and prostate.
It maintains a broad portfolio       of over 60 patent families; it employs over 81 people (December 2012); and       it has raised almost &#163;150M since its foundation.
This includes &#163;11.6M       raised in July 2012 via share pricing and open offer based on the promise       of gene-based medicines for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative       and ocular diseases.
Oxford BioMedica is currently valued at over &#163;30M7,         8.
The use of viral vectors to transform cells is a technology with very       wide application in biomedical research, and one holding promise for       clinical application in diseases including cancer and degenerative       diseases of the brain.
The lentiviral vector technology developed by the       Retrovirus Molecular Biology Group and registered by Oxford BioMedica       under the brand name LentiVector&#174;, has proven to be an extremely safe and       flexible method of delivering gene-based therapies.
Oxford BioMedica was       launched on the London Stock Exchange in 2001.
It continues to apply       genetic engineering to tackle difficult diseases, offering real       opportunities to large pharmaceutical companies that would not have done       this work without the academic lead.
Clinical applications of the Lentiviral&#174; technology are rapidly becoming       a reality.
A form of gene therapy was granted approval in Europe for the       first time in November 2012.
Trial results suggest that such therapies       will soon play a role in many hard-to-treat conditions.
Oxford BioMedica       and its LentiVector&#174; technology have established a prominent position in       the early development of this therapeutic strategy.
The vector can deliver       the therapeutic gene or genes of choice to the appropriate cell population       without provoking a destructive immune reaction, integrate them into the       host DNA without triggering changes in the expression of host genes that       might lead to cancer, and enable them to be appropriately controlled to       induce permanent expression of the desired proteins.
Oxford BioMedica has also established the safety and therapeutic benefit       of its products in clinical applications, with several products in       early-to-mid stage clinical trials.
In 2008, Oxford BioMedica began a       clinical trial of its ProSavin&#174; product, designed to treat patients with       Parkinson's disease who are experiencing decreasing benefits from the       standard drug therapy.
These trails were carried out in partnership with       neurologists at the Henri Mondor hospital in Paris, and at Addenbrooke's       Hospital in Cambridge.
Parkinson's disease is a progressive, incurable,       degenerative disease of the brain that causes difficulties with movement,       resulting from the death of cells in the substantia nigra that produce the       neurotransmitter dopamine.
It currently affects over four million people       worldwide.
Treatment with ProSavin&#174; involves direct injection into the       brain of a construct containing the genes encoding three enzymes essential       in the production of dopamine.
The construct is delivered using the       LentiVector&#174; technology.
The injection site is the striatum, an area that       does not normally produce dopamine, but which is dependent for its       function on a supply of dopamine produced in the substantia nigra.
To       date, 15 patients have received ProSavin&#174;.
The objective of the Phase I/II       trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the product at a range       of different doses.
It has proven to be extremely safe and well tolerated       at all doses.
Patients, especially those given the higher doses, have       shown significant improvements in motor function up to 12 months after       treatment, and their need for the standard L-dopa therapy has either       remained stable or been reduced.
The company is currently optimising the       product for further Phase II trials.
Should the results be replicated,       ProSavin&#174; could make a substantial contribution to limiting the economic       and social costs of this disabling disease9.
In 2009 Oxford BioMedica set up a partnership with Sanofi to develop       products based on the LentiVector&#174; platform for the treatment of eye       disorders10.
RetinoStat&#174;, currently in Phase I clinical trials,       is a treatment for `wet' age-related macular degeneration, a condition       that causes severe loss of vision in older people and affects millions of       people worldwide.
In a single administration, it delivers two genes that       prevent the development of new blood vessels in the retina11.
Further clinical trials are under way of two candidate treatments for less       common but equally disabling eye conditions: StarGen&#8482; for Stargardt       disease and UshStat&#174; for Usher Syndrome Type 1B.
These trials are the       first for which FDA approval has been given for direct administration of       lentiviral vector-based treatments in the US.
In 2010 the company entered a further collaboration, funded by the Motor       Neurone Disease Association, to develop a treatment for amyotrophic       lateral sclerosis, MoNuDin&#174;, using the LentiVector&#174; platform.
Since February 2011, Oxford BioMedica has operated its own manufacturing       facility, certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory       Agency to produce Investigational Medicinal Products.
As well as       supporting the company's clinical programmes, the facility is available to       other partners who wish to develop their own products using this       technology under licence.
Licencees of the LentiVector&#174; technology include       MolMed, an Italian biotechnology company that uses the vector to transform       haematopoietic stem cells from partially compatible donors to prevent       graft rejection in leukaemia patients, a therapy (called TK) currently in       Phase III trials12; and Immune Design, an American company       working on improved vectors for cancer therapy13.
In May 2013, Oxford BioMedica announced a contract with Novartis to       manufacture clinical-grade, personalised immunotherapies using the       LentiVector&#174; technology for trials in the treatment of leukaemia and       lymphoma14.
The contract signed is worth between &#163;2.5M and &#163;4M       over 12 months.
