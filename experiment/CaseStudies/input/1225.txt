     The beneficiaries of the VIEGO research have been local authorities,       NGOs, IT professionals and citizens who, as public sector users, have       benefited from enhanced service delivery.
Direct involvement in the       research process helped the public sector better utilise resources and       improve their position vis-&#224;-vis central Government targets.
The research       has been highly significant, helping to accelerate the implementation of       e-Government in the UK and with a nation-wide impact on public policy and       services.
The results of VIEGO have also attracted international interest       from aspirational Governments such as the Kingdom of Bahrain, Turkey and       Lebanon, leading to further research collaboration.
A key output from the research was a White Paper report `Project VIEGO         &#8212; Electronic Transformation of Government in the UK: A Research Agenda'         ISBN 978-1-902316-53-6 that has been printed and circulated to 500       UK local authorities and non-Government organisations.
This white paper       created interest among a collection of local authorities including London       Borough of Havering, London Borough of Hillingdon, Anglesey County       Council, Denbigshire County Council and Flintshire County Council.
Others included central and local government such as the Office of Deputy       Prime Minister, the Cabinet Office (e-Government Group), Society of IT       Managers, the British Computer Society (eDemocracy Group) and the       Chartered Institute of Public Finance.
The research led to 10 articles in practitioner trade journals including       PublicNet News, Public Servant Daily and Computing.
Senior Public Sector Managers     The organisational/managerial research themes identified by VIEGO       supported public sector senior managers in better understanding the       challenges of managing participation or, as it has subsequently become       known, `eParticipation'.
Senior managers were better able to identify drivers         of change and cope with potential resistance to change when       implementing e-Government.
Public Sector Employees     The social e-Government research themes were relevant to public       sector employees.
Most public sector employees are front-line staff, who       directly interact with citizens and other stakeholders.
These employees       also engage with Government in its numerous electronic forms.
As a result       issues of how to engage with stakeholders and manage social       interactions and communication covered by the social e-Government         research themes enabled public sector employees to recognize the       importance of building trust with citizens and other stakeholders.
This       has led to more positive citizen-Government interactions.
Mr Ashaye, team       manager from the Housing and Options Team in the London Borough of       Hillingdon has written:     "Research grants such as eGise, VIEGO and CEES have helped to move the         community towards technological advancement and to build citizen trust         in e-government".
Local Government Elected Representatives     The social e-Government research and organisational/managerial         e-Government research themes were relevant to the local Government       representatives.
Issues such as political and policy-making helped the       local Government elected representatives to realise how       e-inclusion and participation could influence the decision making process       and, the impact this has on e-Government.
Local Government Mangers     The organisational/managerial e-Government research themes were       particularly relevant to the local government managers.
These themes       enabled the local government managers to realise the challenges of       evaluating and measuring actual benefits arising from the application of       e-Government services and applying these measurements to improve the type       and level of services provided.
Several managers have provided letters of       evidence that articulate how the research has benefitted their       organisations in terms of service delivery.
For example, Dr. Stephen       Jones, Head of Information, Communications and Technology, CONWY County       Borough Council has this to say about the research:     "CONWY County Borough Council's association and involvement with the         research work undertaken by Brunel University has helped enormously with         attaining practical improvements to complex IT and eGovernment service         delivery.
A recent example is improvement to the Authority's website and         content management system, in which CONWY County Borough Council was         independently adjudged to be the best website in Wales and one of the         best websites in the UK (SOCITM, 2012).
This is a significant         achievement which has major internal and external impact, including         efficiencies, cost savings and citizen channel shift."
IT professionals     The technological e-Government themes were particularly relevant       to the IT professionals.
The main issues such as: (1) need for flexible       and scalable technology; (2) privacy and security; (3) shared services;       and (4) technical standards, enabled IT professionals to understand the       multiple facets of problems related to these issues which range from       purely technical to organisational.
As a result organisational/managerial         government research themes were also relevant to the IT       professionals.
These two themes permitted the IT professionals to realise       the complexities of e-Government implementation and look at the problems       associated with e-Government from technical as well as organisational       perspectives.
Barry Eaton, ICT service manager has written:     "Having knowledge and access to this academic and practitioner working         group has helped improve the way that Anglesey has deployed information         systems and e-Government initiatives"     This research led to two funded projects at the European level:     2010-2013: `Ubiquitous Participation Platform for Policy         Making'.
