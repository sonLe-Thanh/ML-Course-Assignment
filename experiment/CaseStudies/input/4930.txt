     Change in practice       Since 2008, our findings have informed clinical practice guidelines       nationally [a] and internationally [b].
Both sets of guidelines recommend       the use of once daily aminoglycosides.
The UK guidelines also advise that       intravenous gentamicin should not be used.
Our national survey, conducted       in the UK in 2002, showed that once daily aminoglycosides were used by       only 17% of UK CF centres [c].
By 2013, once daily aminoglycoside usage       had risen to 86% [d].
Out of 22 CF Centres reporting a change in       aminoglycoside dosing interval, 20 cited our work as a reason for changing       from three times daily to once daily, and 9 cited the 2009 UK guidelines       [d].
Similar studies in Australia have shown an increase in once daily       dosing from 54% in 1999 [e] to 88% in 2009 [f].
The Director of the Adult       CF Centre in Queensland (also a senior author on references [e] and [f]),       has stated that the majority of the increase seen in Australia is       attributable to our work [g].
There are no recent surveys from the US, but       a once daily regimen is recommended in US guidelines [b].
In 2006, 30% of       UK CF centres were still using gentamicin.
Following the publication of       our case control study in 2008, and the resulting recommendation in UK       guidelines against gentamicin in 2009, gentamicin is no longer used as a       first line aminoglycoside in any UK CF centre [d].
Of 12 centres who have       stopped using gentamicin, 10 have cited our work as the reason for       changing their practice [d].
Similarly, our work has been instrumental in       the switch from gentamicin to tobramycin in Australian CF Centres [g].
Beneficiaries     The beneficiaries of this impact are:            People with CF &#8212; who, because of the switch from gentamicin to         tobramycin, are now at reduced risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) &#8212; a         serious treatment related complication.
People with CF having lung transplantation &#8212; who may avoid chronic         kidney disease, which confers a much worse outcome from lung         transplantation and greater costs [h].
Clinicians who care for CF patients &#8212; who can deliver effective care         without compromising safety.
Those who commission health care &#8212; who can pay for an intervention         which is no more expensive but which has a lower risk of AKI.
This         complication requires expensive and resource intensive management         (dialysis).
The cost of dialysis for AKI in CF is around &#163;3,500 per         patient and over half of patients with AKI require dialysis.
The cost savings of preventing AKI with a simple strategy of once daily       aminoglycoside dosing and avoidance of gentamicin are therefore       considerable.
Dissemination       We have disseminated these findings beyond conventional pathways, such as       presentations at international conferences, publication in the peer       reviewed literature and incorporation into guidelines.
Our group have       pioneered an innovative approach of engaging with the patient community,       to share the findings of research in the CF field.
Dr Matt Hurley       (University of Nottingham, School of Medicine) has set up CF Unite [i] &#8212; a       web based public engagement programme (Wellcome Trust People Award 2012,       &#163;29,624).
CF Unite allows patients to have a dialogue with researchers.
This is achieved without the need for people with CF to meet in person       (with a risk of cross infection).
Dialogue is through:            lay summaries of research published on the website       webcasts (and archived recordings) of conventional scientific meetings       bespoke web conferences for patients and their families       real-time online dialogue between patients, scientists and clinicians.
Lay summaries of the research described in Section 2 have been uploaded       to the CF Unite website.
Feedback from users of CF Unite has been very       positive; for instance, `I am very grateful for the opportunity to         hear from these experts.
Something that would otherwise be unavailable         to me' [j].
Since set-up in 2012, CF Unite has had around 10,700       visits from over 6,500 individuals (one third using mobile devices) [j].
Through our research on aminoglycosides, and our drive to set up CF       Unite, we have changed clinical practice, improved the treatment of cystic       fibrosis and empowered the CF community to become more informed about       their condition.
We plan to use CF Unite to actively seek the advice of       patients in the design of clinical research and to encourage research       participation.
