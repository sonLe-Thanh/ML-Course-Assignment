     [Numbers in square brackets refer to evidence in Section 5].
Background: In 2005 the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco       Control (FCTC), the first global treaty developed under the auspices of       WHO, entered into force.
Developed to address the global tobacco epidemic,       this is one of the most widely embraced treaties in UN history, with 176       WHO Member States now Parties to the treaty.
There was overwhelming evidence &#8212; including the research from the       University of Bath &#8212; that the TI had negatively influenced public health       policies in numerous jurisdictions.
This prompted the inclusion, within       the FCTC, of Article 5.3, which specifically aims to reduce the influence       of TI on public policy, by stating that "in setting and implementing their       public health policies .... Parties shall act to protect these policies       from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry".
FCTC Articles are operationalised via Guidelines.
The Article 5.3       Guidelines were to be agreed at the November 2008 Conference of the       Parties (COP) in Uruguay.
The implementation of Article 5.3 was, however,       fraught with difficulty, given the power of the TI and its heavy lobbying       against this Article.
The success of Article 5.3 would depend both on the       strength of these guidelines and on their subsequent implementation.
Pathways to impact: Gilmore and her colleagues achieved impact for       their research through their work with beneficiaries including WHO and       public health NGOs such as The Smokefree Partnership, Cancer Research UK       and Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).
The diverse ways in which these       impacts were achieved included:            They press released the research, so as to secure widespread media         coverage in the UK and Europe; and when BAT wrote to the Guardian         to contest the research findings, they responded robustly, as did         Professors from the University of California San Francisco and the         University of Sydney [5.1].
They re-wrote the research findings in alternative formats, to ensure         they were accessible to a broad audience.
These included (i) a series of         briefings given to interested journalists and high level European         Commission staff [5.2]; (ii) a report "The Origin of EU             Better Regulation &#8212; the Disturbing Truth", which synthesised         the research findings and their relevance for contemporary EU policy,         published online by the Smokefree Partnership; (iii) a section in the         highly influential European Environmental Agency report Late lessons           from early warnings [5.3].
They helped others to use the research.
For example, ASH's 2010 report         A Smoke Filled Room was based on this research evidence ("ASH           would like to acknowledge the invaluable contribution made to this           report by research led by the University of Bath") and its 2011         report Tobacconomics stemmed from a conference workshop Gilmore         et al.
arranged on their research [5.4].
They developed a novel knowledge exchange platform, www.TobaccoTactics.org,         to disseminate policy-relevant research findings.
This has been         described as "a unique resource for advocacy organisations....
I am           aware of more than one high profile media debate where exposure of           tobacco industry links of a front organisation, thanks to evidence           provided by the TT wiki, has served to undermine industry arguments           against key tobacco control measures."
[5.5]        They worked with NGOs to ensure the work was disseminated to &#8212; and         understood by &#8212; a large number of key stakeholders, notably civil         servants and politicians [5.4].
In the UK, Gilmore presented research to a House of Lords meeting         (2009) [5.5] and gave oral and written evidence to All Party         Parliamentary Group enquiries (2010, 2012) [5.4; 5.6] and         meetings (2011) [5.4].
Gilmore also presented and debated the findings at a series of events         in the European Parliament (2008, 2010), European Commission (2010) and         the European Health Forum at Gastein ("the leading health policy event         in the EU"), attended by high level policy makers including the European         Health Commissioner [5.2].
Impact: Securing strong Article 5.3 Guidelines and enabling their         implementation.
In relation to the REF guidance (REF 01.2012, Main Panel C) we identify       four main types of impact.
1.
Improved public understanding of social issues     This research has helped in "turning the tide of opinion among both         politicians and the public.
[This] is a crucial part of the public         health fight against tobacco and Professor Gilmore`s group plays a         unique and internationally respected role in this."
[Cancer Research       UK: 5.5]     2.
Influencing or Shaping of Relevant Legislation     With this research having already informed the development of Article 5.3       of this global health treaty, Gilmore and her colleagues were well-placed       to influence the 5.3 Guidelines.
In the build-up to the November 2008 WHO       Conference of the Parties, it became evident that the TI was using the       `Better Regulation' commitments it had secured to lobby against the       Article 5.3 Guidelines.
Gilmore and colleagues prepared a confidential       policy briefing for members of the European Health Working Group, which       includes representatives of all EU Member States and was meeting to       finalise the European position on the Article 5.3 Guidelines.
This       briefing, which summarised the research and its relevance to Article 5.3,       "was instrumental in safeguarding enough support amongst European         countries for Strong Article 5.3 Guidelines, in turn ensuring that         strong guidelines were agreed at the November 2008 Conference of the         Parties.".
[5.2; 5.5].
The Public Health Advocacy Institute       stated online: "Her work has contributed to policy changes in Germany,         Russia and the EU and she has brought the documents and knowledge of the         tobacco industry conduct to the attention of a large and diverse         audience."
[5.7]     3.
Forms of regulation have been influenced     The WHO Article 5.3 Guidelines for Implementation encourage Parties to       introduce a range of measures aimed at limiting tobacco company access to       policymaking, and increasing surveillance of tobacco industry efforts to       exploit their information advantage and influence policy.
The research at       Bath was cited in the Guidelines [5.8] and contributed directly to       a WHO report specifically developed to assist Parties with implementing       the Guidelines.
Gilmore was a member of the Committee of Experts whose       meeting led to this report, which cites nine of her papers [5.9].
The 2008 WHO Europe World No Tobacco Day Medal was given "in         recognition of outstanding contribution to tobacco control" [5.10].
4.
Improved health and welfare outcomes globally     Strong Article 5.3 Guidelines have global benefits because they enable       all 176 Parties to the FCTC to protect their policies from TI influence.
Implementation of a strong Article 5.3 has also increased the likelihood       of effective public health policies at UK and EU levels and the curbing of       TI intrusion.
Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable mortality       globally accounting for almost 6 million deaths annually; a figure       predicted to increase to over 8 million by 2030 if current trends       continue.
The potential for health gain is therefore very significant.
Gilmore received the 2009 Public Health Advocacy Institute International       Award for Outstanding Use of Tobacco Industry Documents: this was "presented         in recognition of your significant contribution to public health ... to         improve the health of people around the world."
