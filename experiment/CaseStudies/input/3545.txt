     Impact 1: Public Understanding     The primary vehicle for the dissemination of the research cited in       section 2 was a major exhibition in three leading European museums       (totalling 183,000 visitors &#8212; V&amp;A statistics available on request).
The selection of the London exhibition by two other venues is testimony of       significant impact in its own right.
It was selected by the Ministry of       Culture in Lithuania &#8212; via its delivery agency, Vilnius: Europos kulturos       sostine &#8212; as the centrepiece of its European Capital of Culture programme       in 2009.
As the chief curator of the National Gallery of Lithuania writes,       `The V&amp;A exhibition was very well received both by professional and       general audience and not only in Lithuania but also in the neighboring       Baltic countries &#8212; Latvia and Estonia.
It had...one of the highest museum       visiting rates in Lithuania in the course of the past 20 years...The       educational impact of the project should also be mentioned...Above all the       exhibition stimulated an interest in local art, architecture and design of       the 2nd half of the 20th c. that remained unexplored and almost unknown to       the public till quite recently' [s5.1].
The CWM research project set itself the challenge of bringing new       knowledge to different audiences.
In addition to the deeply researched       book accompanying the exhibition, Crowley and Pavitt wrote short books for       general audiences and school children.
Fear and Fashion in the Cold War       was written by Pavitt (V&amp;A Publications, 2010, 128 pp.)
and Crowley       wrote Cold War Posters (V&amp;A Publications, 2010, 96 pp.).
The curators       were invited to write a dozen articles to share the insights generated       through research with different communities.
These included articles in       popular history titles such as `History Today' and professional art and       design magazines such as `Creative Review' [s5.2].
A rich programme of public events accompanied the exhibition in London,       including film screenings, designers' talks and public workshops.
Public       events &#8212; oriented to members of the general public as well as       professionals, including secondary school teachers &#8212; at the V&amp;A       included a two-day international conference organised by Crowley and       Pavitt with expert speakers from nine countries (21-22/11/08) and `The       Last Utopians' a day-long event with architects and designers who relayed       their experiences of the 1960s (28/11/08), part-funded by the Austrian       Embassy.
The two-day conference also received &#163;10,000 funding from the       Council of Europe, which staged an accompanying meeting of their advisory       board to discuss East-West European collaborative exhibitions.
General       Coordinator of Council of Europe Exhibitions writes that `CWM convinced       us, more than ever, that there were different narratives to be told, as an       alternative to the linear account of (western) modernism' [s5.3].
We are claiming an impact on the media itself.
CWM provided new       frameworks for understanding design and culture in the period.
Alongside       extensive coverage in the arts sections of the press/broadcast media and       scholarly press (c.171 press reviews and reports plus radio/television       reports around the world), it is notable that the exhibition featured in       the news, politics and business sections of newspapers and magazines such       as Newsweek (USA 03/10/08), as well as national news broadcasts (such as       BBC Radio 4 `The Today Programme', BBC World Service `European News', BBC1       One O'Clock News, Deutsche Welle TV, NTV (Russia), ITV London News &#8212; all       September 2008).
Sectors of the media that rarely give attention to the       history of design engaged in discussion of the capacity of designs to       perform as political instruments.
To give two typical examples: `Design is       too often presented as a succession of iconic chairs: here it is exposed       for what it is, the most faithful encapsulation of the politics, economics       and fears and desires of a moment' (`The Financial Times', 21/09/08)       [s5.4]: `For the curators [the exhibition] is not about canonization but a       great thesis.
The title "Cold War Modern" highlights the confrontation of       systems and expands the concept of the era of modernity well into the       postwar period' (`Tagesspiegel', 04/10/08) [s5.5].
Impact 2: Curatorial and collecting activity     CWM has clearly had significant impact on the work of museums and       curators within design, architecture and art.
The Senior Curator and       Keeper of Furniture, Textiles and Fashion department of the V&amp;A,       summarises the shift in understanding achieved by this research in the       museum sector when he writes that CWM `fundamentally altered the way in       which curators working in former Eastern bloc countries, as well as a       wider world of collectors and the interested public, viewed post-war       design.
No one looking at this era through its (mainly elite) material       culture can do so without reference to CWM and, with the publication of       its accompanying catalogue, many former overviews of post-war design have       been rendered significantly less useful or credible' [s5.6].
Director of       the Wende Museum, Los Angeles, writes `Up until CWM, Cold War history       continued to be viewed through the lens of the conflict in which east and       west were not allowed to be treated together' [s5.7].
As evidence of this       fact, the V&amp;A and other museums, including the State Tretyakov gallery       in Moscow and the Olomouc Museum of Art, have extended their collections       of post-1945 design by acquiring exhibits first shown in CWM [s5.8].
Commentators have identified its innovative approach to combing political       and design/art history and a number of exhibitions abroad have adopted its       concepts and themes [see s5.9].
For instance, the National Gallery in       Vilnius &#8212; in conjunction with Tallinn City Art Gallery &#8212; established a       major research project to record the history of modernism in the Baltic       states in the 1960s and 1970s directly and explicitly under the influence       and inspiration of CWM.
This resulted in a major exhibition       `Modernisation.
Baltic Art, Architecture, and Design.
1960-70s' in both       venues in 2012 and a book, Our Metamorphic Futures.
Design, Technical       Aesthetics and Experimental Architecture in the Soviet Union, 1960-1980       (forthcoming).
The Ex-Post Evaluation of 2009 European Capitals of Culture       Final Report (European Commission) &#8212; a formal impact assessment &#8212;       identified this impact as one of the most significant achievements of CWM       in the region [s5.10, p. 61].
The General Coordinator Council of Europe       Exhibitions also corroborates the impact of CWM on the thinking and       curation of the Council of Europe exhibition `The Desire for Freedom.
Art       in Europe since 1945' exhibited in Berlin, Milan, Tallinn and Cracow, with       related projects in Prague, Sarajevo, Budapest and Thessaloniki, 2012-15       [s5.3].
