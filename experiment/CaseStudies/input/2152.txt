     Multidisciplinary care     The guidelines for care of DMD-affected individuals produced in 2010 by       the group led by Bushby       and published in Lancet Neurology (hereafter the Guidelines), describe       best practice for       multidisciplinary care that has become the expected standard for these       patients globally.
Since DMD affects a number of body systems, coordination of clinical care       is a crucial component       of best practice for the management of DMD.
This is best provided in a       multidisciplinary care       setting in which the DMD-affected individual and their family can access       the range of expertise       needed for the multisystem management of DMD.
The expertise required falls       into eight       categories and the focus of the system is the patient.
Diagnostics.
Including Genetic testing and muscle biopsy and         interventions such as         genetic counselling and family support.
Rehabilitation management.
Assessments of strength, posture etc and         interventions such         as providing adaptive equipment and physiotherapy.
Orthopaedic management.
Various assessments are conducted and         interventions such as         tendon surgery and posterior spinal fusion offered.
Psychosocial management.
Assessments of speech and language and how         the patient         and family are coping are made and interventions can include         psychotherapy and other         supportive care.
Cardiac management.
Monitoring the heart is important and standard         medical interventions         are offered as appropriate.
Pulmonary management.
Monitoring lung function is another key tool in         multisystem         management and interventions such as home nocturnal ventilation have         been shown to         have significant benefit.
Gastrointestinal, speech/swallowing, nutrition.
Upper and lower GI         investigations are         conducted and medical or surgical interventions offered as necessary.
Corticosteroid management.
The patient's age, stage of disease and         risk factors for side-         effects are considered and affect the choice of drug regimen.

Influencing public debate, policy and practice     In 2009, while the DMD Care Considerations Working Group research was       ongoing, Newcastle       researchers gave evidence to the UK All Party Parliamentary Group for       Muscular Dystrophy.
The       subsequent Walton Report stated: `We praise the work of the         Newcastle Muscle Centre, which well         deserves its international reputation for excellence in all aspects of         research, diagnosis, care and         support for children and adults with neuromuscular conditions' (Ev       a, p48).
The report also notes;     `...the clinical audit data from the South West region which show the         mean age of death at         19 years of age for patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy compares         starkly with         published survival data showing the average of death for similar         patients in the North East         region has reached 30 years of age ...
In any decent, civilised society         these variances are         unacceptable and we cite them here as evidence of service failures that         must be addressed         with the utmost urgency.'
(Ev a, p11).
In evidence to the All Party Parliamentary Group, representatives from a       number of health       authorities, including the South West of England, noted that they were       conducting reviews of their       services (Ev a, p47-51).
In 2011, the robustness of the guidelines on multidisciplinary care was       accredited for the NHS by       NICE (Ev b), resulting in the first such accredited guidelines for       neuromuscular diseases and,       indeed, for rare diseases in general.
The guidelines are thus established       in the UK, until at least       2016, as the standard of care required for patients with DMD.
National and international implementation of care guidelines     UK regions outside the North East of England are implementing the       multidisciplinary care       approach, following reviews of services.
In Northern Ireland the       Guidelines have been       implemented through the combined efforts of a parent-activist and a       paediatric consultant following       visits to Newcastle.
The Guidelines formed the basis of a case made to the       Northern Irish       Assembly seeking improved investment in care for patients with       neuromuscular disease.
The       parent-activist has stated that the Guidelines `greatly strengthened         the case we presented'.
The       care network in Northern Ireland has subsequently grown to a       multidisciplinary team (Ev c).
The wider reach of the guidelines is under active examination.
The       European Commission       Executive Agency for Health and Consumers funded a large multinational       project, CARE-NMD, to       study the implementation of the Guidelines throughout the UK and in       Denmark, Germany, Czech       Republic, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary.
Interim findings from CARE-NMD       show that boys       attending the centres of expertise in each nation, (i) have greater access       to services due to the       implementation of the Guidelines within the centres and (ii) report       greater satisfaction with their       treatment (Ev d).
The Guidelines have been summarised and made available       to American       clinicians via the National Guideline Clearinghouse of the US       Department for Health and Human       Services (Ev e).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       have recently funded a study,       led by the University of Rochester Medical Center, New York State, to       examine the implementation       of the Guidelines in the USA and will begin data collection in late 2013.
In Southern India, a service based on the Guidelines was established in       2011, with Bushby's help.
The Director of the Molecular Diagnostics, Counseling, Care &amp; Research       Centre, Coimbatore has       described how the Newcastle approach to multidisciplinary care was       implemented, saying; `The         Lancet Guidelines have stood as the basic framework on which we have         based our assessments         and recommendations... and the confidence we give [parents] that         whatever is available         internationally we offer our kids is a great sense of relief [for       them]' (Ev f).
The implementation of       DMD care in Australia is also based on the Guidelines (Ev g).
Helping professionals, patients and their carers     The CARE-NMD website includes open access to a `training toolkit',       developed in 2011 from the       Guidelines by the Newcastle team, and colleagues, for the benefit of the       neuromuscular       community and wider public (Ev e).
The EU-funded Network of Excellence projects, TREAT-NMD (Chair:       Lochmuller) and CARE-       NMD, within which the Newcastle Muscle Group lead implementation in the       UK, in 2011 produced       an English language family-friendly version of the Guidelines entitled `A         Guide for Families' in       collaboration with patient groups.
The source file has been distributed to       organisations around the       world, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for       further dissemination and       translations have been produced by recipients.
By 2013 it had been       translated into 26 other       languages covering developed and developing nations (Ev h).
These are       available on the TREAT-NMD       and CARE-NMD websites and have been downloaded over 3000 times (Ev i).
Physical       copies are printed locally where required and so there is scant data on       distribution, though it has       been reported that around 5,000 Japanese language guides have been printed       and distributed       throughout Japan (Ev i).
The guide has also been disseminated by national       and international       patient groups.
The Vice President of the American organization Parent       Project Muscular       Dystrophy has provided evidence that the guide has been viewed or       downloaded 4865 times since       2011.
They have also mailed 869 copies to individuals and have provided       750 copies of the       document to clinics since 2010 (Ev j).
