     Impacts include: health and welfare, commercial, production,       international development, public policy and services       Main beneficiaries include: national/international guideline committees,       World Health Organisation (WHO), regulatory bodies [US Food and Drugs       Administration (FDA)], European Medicines Agency [EMA], and industry (ALK,       Merck and Torii pharmaceuticals).
Allergic rhinitis ("hayfever") affects 1 in 4 in the UK and has a major       impact on work/school performance and quality of life.
Community surveys       in primary care show that at least 40% of sufferers remain uncontrolled       despite use of antihistamines and intranasal steroids.
Research from       Imperial has had an impact on this unmet need as allergen immunotherapy is       highly effective in patients who fail to respond to usual anti-allergic       drugs.
The sublingual tablet approach is novel, more convenient and safer       than the subcutaneous route and has disease modifying properties that       result in long-term disease remission.
The UK and Europe-wide regulatory approval of Grazax&#174; sublingual tablets       represents the first registration of an allergy vaccine in Europe for 35       years.
The EMA (2013) quotes Imperial's study as evidence of long-term       efficacy of sublingual tablet immunotherapy in adults [1; see page 3] and       have stated that in future all paediatric investigational plans for       immunotherapy products should include a study to demonstrate long-term       efficacy in children [1; see page 4].
Imperial's long-term study of Grazax       resulted in the German regulatory authorities accepting alteration of the       Grazax&#174; product label to include an indication for long-term efficacy and       disease modifying effect.
Imperial's research is frequently quoted in international guidelines as       primary evidence for efficacy and long-term benefits of allergen       immunotherapy.
The WHO position paper on sublingual immunotherapy (2009)       quotes Professor Durham's work on the long-term benefits of immunotherapy       and recommends the earlier introduction of immunotherapy in the treatment       paradigm for allergic rhinitis [2; see page 269].
Similarly Professor       Durham's work is quoted in the British Society (BSACI) position paper on       allergen Immunotherapy (2011), the European Allergic Rhinitis and its       Impact on Asthma (ARIA) revised guideline (2010) and in the British       Thoracic Society and Scottish `Sign' Asthma Guideline (2012) [3; see page       33].
Imperial's work has been showcased by the charity Asthma UK as a key       impact of their research funding strategy over the past 15 years (2012)       [4].
An independent budget impact analysis (2013) showed that Grazax&#174; was cost       saving compared to subcutaneous immunotherapy, saving approximately &#8364;1291       per patient per treatment course.
This also implies that an additional 40%       of patients could be treated sublingually without influencing the current       cost for the subcutaneous treatment [5].
Another analysis concluded that       sublingual immunotherapy with Grazax was cost-effective compared with       standard pharmacologic management of patients with rhinoconjunctivitis and       co-existing asthma [6].
The estimated cost per QALY (Quality of Life Year)       gained with Grazax&#174; was &#163;4319, which is highly cost-effective.
The       long-term benefits after withdrawal of treatment have stimulated another       major pharmaceutical company (Stallergenes, France) to independently       research and corroborate these findings using an alternative grass       allergen tablet (Oralair&#174;) thereby expanding the availability of effective       alternatives [7].
On the basis of Imperial's research, ALK Denmark have changed their       strategy in Europe to focus on sublingual rather than subcutaneous       immunotherapy.
For example, ALK have initiated a 5 year clinical trial of       Grazax&#174; in Europe to study the prevention of asthma in childhood (GAP       study 2010- 2015).
They have extended the technology of sublingual       allergen tablet immunotherapy to house dust mite allergy; a recent 2013       press release confirmed efficacy in two phase III studies in perennial       allergic rhinitis and, importantly, in mite-sensitive adults with asthma       [8].
ALK have successfully partnered with Torii pharmaceuticals in Japan       to develop a fast-dissolving tablet for Japanese cedar allergy.
Immunotherapy is widely practiced in the USA where there is considerable       interest in sublingual immunotherapy (Professor Durham's work is quoted in       the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology [AAAAI] Practice       Parameters, JACI 2010).
ALK have successfully partnered with Merck who       have the franchise for sublingual tablet immunotherapy within the USA [9].
Merck have completed a pivotal study in adults that has replicated the       European data for Grazax&#174; and extended fast-dissolving tablet technology       to sublingual immunotherapy for autumnal ragweed pollen allergy.
Professor Durham has increased public awareness of severe hayfever and       the research of his group on immunotherapy within the UK, having been       interviewed on BBC breakfast television (July 1st 2009) [10] and he       recently presented his research on the BBC `Trust me I'm a Doctor' series       (October 24th 2013) [10].
His work on immunotherapy was       showcased at the MRC Public Science day held at the Science Museum June       15th 2013.
