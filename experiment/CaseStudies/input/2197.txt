     As a result of research led by Newcastle University, the UK National         Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has adopted: (i)       methods by which the world's leading valid clinical practice guidelines       are produced; and (ii) processes that offer the best opportunity for       implementation by those responsible.
This maximises the opportunities for       health gains for patients and predictable costs for the NHS.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence     NICE was established in 1999, and over time it has expanded its remit to       provide guidance and advice to improve health and social care.
NICE       guidance supports healthcare professionals and others in England to ensure       that the care they provide is of the highest quality, and that it offers       the best value for money.
NICE is internationally recognised for the way       in which recommendations are developed, using the best available evidence       (Ev a).
NICE guidelines: the ongoing impact of Newcastle research     The first guideline adopted by NICE was one developed by Eccles' research       group concerning secondary prophylaxis following myocardial infarction (Ev       b).
NICE also adopted the approach by which the guideline (and those on       asthma (R1) and another on angina) was produced.
Six research publications       (led by the Newcastle group) on guideline development (including R3, R5       and R6 above) were later cited in the first edition of the NICE         Guideline Development Manual (2004).
These publications continue to       underpin the method for preparing guidelines, as can be observed most       recently in the November 2012 edition of the NICE Guideline         Development Manual (Ev c).
A total of 174 NICE guidelines had been produced using the approved       methods as of July 2013, the majority of which were after 2007.
In the       seven years 2001-7, a total of 65 guidelines were published.
In the       following five years 109 guidelines were published (Ev d).
Of all       guidelines produced, 169 remain in force: 142 of which are in their       original form and 27 have been updated.
A significant development has been the introduction of the requirement to       review guidelines and, if necessary, update them.
This process has largely       taken place since 2008 (see Figure 1).
NICE policy, which is based on       Newcastle-led work on the lifespan of guidelines, is: "A formal review         of the need to update a guideline is usually undertaken by NICE 3 years         after its publication" (Ev c, p189).
This three-year recommendation       is based on advice presented in the 2001 Journal of the American         Medical Association paper (R4).
Since 2008, 22 guidelines have been       re-written, and 67 other guidelines have been subjected to the review       process.
Five guidelines have been withdrawn as a result of the review       process.

(Data obtained from www.nice.org.uk/guidance, Ev d)      Advising on development and implementation     The Deputy Chief Executive of NICE has said of Professor Eccles and his       research that:     "...your work on the effectiveness of strategies to implement evidence         based guidelines [... has] informed NICE's understanding of the         evidence base for implementation and led to the decision to form NICE's         Implementation Strategy Group."
(Ev e)     Eccles chaired the Implementation Strategy Group from 2008 until retiring       from it in 2012 (Ev f).
Consequently, Newcastle-led research on strategies       for promoting the uptake of research findings was incorporated into the       processes and activities of NICE.
Examples:     (i) Encouraging engagement in promoting implementation.
Guidelines       are, and have always been, written and reviewed by external committees       convened for that purpose, rather than NICE staff.
The Implementation       Strategy Group scrutinised the processes by which guideline development       committee members were recruited.
As a result of Newcastle-led research on       behaviour change amongst professionals (R6), a recommendation was made       regarding the importance of appointing the appropriate people to promote       guideline implementation.
As a result, since Autumn 2009, the NICE       Implementation Team has advised management on potential gaps in guideline       development committee membership in order to encourage the recruitment of       individuals who could be expected to champion the implementation of a       guideline.
(ii) Web-based practical advice on implementation.
In 2009, the       Implementation Strategy Group gave advice (based on research such as that       described in R6) on promoting engagement with primary care services and       supported the production of web pages designed to aid general       practitioners with the implementation of guidelines.
The Implementation       Programme Director of NICE has said:     "This is still a well used part of the site.
... A cross Institute         group on general practice was formed and still active in 2013.
[The       number of page] views within the first weeks of its launch were         equivalent to that of our most viewed guideline which is unusually high         for a support product, rather than a guidance product."
