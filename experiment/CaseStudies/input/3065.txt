     Shaping Public and Political Debate about Religious Education       As part of the Religion and Society Programme, in which Does RE Work?
was integral, a series of Westminster Faith Debates was launched in       February 2012.
These debates were designed to bring the best research and       thinking on religion into public debate.
Professor Conroy discussed the       project findings at the debate which addressed the question of `What's         the Place of Faith in Schools?'
held on 22 February 2012 in       Whitehall.
Other participants included high-profile public figures Richard       Dawkins and John Pritchard, Bishop of Oxford and Chair of the Church of       England's Board of Education.
To date, the YouTube         video of the debate has received approximately 18,600 views.
Dawkins and Pritchard responded to the research findings discussed in       open debate with a large audience which included politicians, members of       religious and secular organisations, and the general public.
Conroy drew       on the research findings to argue that RE in Britain is drastically       under-resourced, intellectually conflicted, torn between competing aims,       and rapidly becoming the dumping ground of the curriculum.
Conroy pointed       out that schools spend less money and less time on RE than on any other       examination subject.
The findings from the research that many schools       spend less than &#163;1 per pupil a year, as well as the conceptual confusions       around delivery figured prominently in the discussion and coverage of the       debate.
The Westminster Faith Debate received extensive coverage in the       media and in this way the research findings from the project were used to       influence the public and political debate around RE in schools.
The research significantly contributed to public understandings about the       state of RE in British schools at a time when the place of religion in       society was being debated.
It was featured by numerous media outlets,       including The Daily Mail, The Guardian, The Metro, The Guardian         Teacher Network, The Tablet, The Scottish Catholic Observer, and BBC         News Online.
The ESRC featured the research on 2 occasions in its         Britain In series, in 2009 and 2011.
Additionally, The         Times Education Supplement, the market-leading education publication       in Scotland, featured the research twice (11 March 2011; 2 March 2012) in       its main publication and also on TES Connect (8 October 2010),       which provides free online resources to teaching professionals.
In       February 2012, it also featured on the website       of the European Wergeland Centre, a resource centre on education for       intercultural understanding, human rights and democratic citizenship based       in Oslo.
Conroy gave live news interviews and participated in debates on       the research for BBC Radio 4 (26 February 2012) and BBC Radio 5 Live (22       February 2012).
Providing Evidence to Parliamentary Inquiry and Human Rights Bodies           on RE       Baumfield and Conroy gave evidence to the Religious Education Council's       for England and Wales (REC) on-going review of RE, which it carried out       with the support of Culham St Gabriel's Trust and the All-Party       Parliamentary Group (APPG) on RE in 2012.
Baumfield presented the research       to the Expert Panel of REC's Phase 1 Subject Review of Religious         Education in England in late 2012.
The final Phase 1 Report       published on 16 January 2013 cites Baumfield's contribution and findings       from the Does RE Work?
project when drawing conclusions and making       recommendations about the appropriate aims of RE in English schools.
The REC RE Review Project Manager responsible for drafting the report       noted that the impact of the research was strongest in this early part of       the study where `the Expert Panel considered the findings of the         project...and called Vivienne Baumfield to speak at the second meeting         of the panel (in Birmingham) in person'.
The Project Manager also       met with Conroy in September 2012 and noted that the report was helpful         `specifically on the importance of subject knowledge; the danger of RE         spreading itself too thinly when, on insufficient curriculum time,         teachers tried to make too many claims for the impact of the subject on         pupils'.
These observations, she states helped `to triangulate         with other sources of evidence used in the Review'.
The Chair of the Expert Panel also notes the usefulness of the emergent       research findings from the Does RE Work?
Project at the Birmingham       meeting, going on further to highlight that the research `was         particularly useful in giving the REC review expert panel a broader         perspective, ... in that the Glasgow team had partly based its evidence         on visiting a range of schools...in England as well as Scotland.
One of         the findings that was noted and discussed by the expert panel was that         there has been a tendency for the RE community to spread justifications         for the value of RE in schools too wide &#8212; contributing to values         education, citizenship, spiritual/moral/social/cultural education,         thinking skills etc'.
The resultant REC report made an important contribution to the evidence       base for the APPG's Inquiry on Religious Education.
Additionally, the RE       lead officer at Ofsted has commented robustly on the influence of the       project on his own recent work and the field more generally.
Equality and Human Rights Commission       As part of a project to assist the Equality and Human Rights Commission       (the Commission) in thinking about its mandate for `religion or belief'       and in setting priorities for research, Conroy presented the research to       the Commission at a Glasgow-based Expert Seminar on 7 May 2009 (c.60).
The       Commission held three Expert Seminars in London, Lancaster and Glasgow,       bringing together academics, practitioners, policy-makers and members of       the Commission.
Conroy was able to draw from the emerging research findings to contribute       to the discussion of RE and religious literacy as it related to the work       and remit of the Commission.
The final report by the Commission on `Religion         or belief': Identifying issues and priorities', uses the research       and Conroy's representations of it to highlight the need for new       approaches to RE provision and research.
Professional Development on the Research Findings       Conroy and Baumfield used the research findings to design and organise       workshops and professional training for teachers and educational       professionals in the UK, in particular in Scotland and Cornwall.
Scotland : Conroy and Baumfield were invited to present the annual       lecture for the Association         of Religious Education Teachers in Scotland in May (11-12) 2010 and       May (8-9) 2013.
Additionally, Conroy used the research findings in a       keynote presentation to the 2009 Religious Education in Roman Catholic       Schools conference organised by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education       (HMIE) for approximately 150 teachers and education professionals.
The       conference was designed to explore good practice of how effective,       innovative practitioners in pre-school, primary, secondary and special       schools were working together to implement RE.
Conroy's presentation of       the emerging findings from the Does RE Work?
project provided a       stimulus upon which teachers were subsequently required to reflect in       further CPD sessions.
Cornwall: As well as designing and facilitating several day-long       workshops on the research in Salford (c.150) and 2-day workshops to all       the Head Teachers and senior staff of Catholic schools in Newcastle       (c.300), Conroy shared the research with Cornwall Standing Advisory       Committee for RE (SACRE) who then circulated the research report to all 32       Cornish Secondary Schools in July 2011 to use as a base for their       self-evaluation in the coming academic year.
The research was subsequently       used as a basis for discussion with secondary Heads of RE at their       Conference in the autumn of 2011.
Additionally, as the SACRE County       Advisor for RE in Cornwall notes: `the research paper influenced the         SACRE Agreed Syllabus for RE in a number of ways, including:            The clarification of the aims and purposes of RE in terms of the           syllabus;       A closer attention to the content of RE and its relationship to the           programmes of study for RE, based on the National Framework for RE           (QCA 2004);       The content of the implementation training which looked           specifically at the liminal nature of RE in many schools as it sought           to justify itself in relation to other curriculum areas and the           emerging demands on schools in relation RE as a tool for social           melioration.'
Cornwall County Council's use of the research culminated in Conroy       delivering the 2012 Annual SACRE Lecture (c.100) in Truro on 19 October       2012.
