     a) Educational     In recent years the black freedom struggle in the United States has had       increasing prominence on `A' level courses and enjoyed growing popularity       as a subject option with sixth formers.
Verney regularly receives requests       from schools to speak about his research.
From 1 January 2008-31 July 2013       he gave lectures at 12 events for schools.
This included a one day schools       conference on the Obama Presidency at the British Library, London, in       March 2013 for which Verney was co-organizer and a chair for two panels.
All schools work was related to topics on `A' level courses.
The Heads of       History in section 5 (Factual Statements 1-3) have confirmed that       the visits had a direct impact in improving student performance.
The Head       of History at Winstanley College (Factual Statement 3) wrote `your       lecture...inspired the students to research a range of sources and to       engage with historiography on King in their studies.
In addition, by       mentioning alternative leaders to King...this prompted some to further       research their impact on the movement.
Therefore a number of students       achieved full marks in this module'.
The student secretary of the       Winstanley History Society noted Verney's contribution was `exceptionally       valuable to students writing their coursework and provided a brilliant       explanation of the different historical viewpoints on the civil rights       movement'.
Verney has published two student texts that are widely used in schools       (Other Source 1):             Black Civil Rights in America (Routledge, 2000), sales 1.1         2008-31.7.2013, 5,217        African Americans and U.S. Popular Culture (Routledge, 2003),         sales, 1,527          Although a monograph 3ii is used in schools and undergraduate       courses because of its historiographical focus.
All three books have been       continuously in print since their initial publication.
Black Civil         Rights In America alone earned &#163;2,322.91 in royalties from       photocopying in schools during the census period (Other Sources 2, 3).
Verney's works are used as recommended texts on a range of undergraduate       courses at other HEIs, for example, the Universities of East Anglia,       Heidelberg (as one example, Other Source 4) Liverpool, Manchester and       Northumbria.
In recommending his text on popular culture Donna Gilton, Professor of       Library Science at the University of Rhode Island, wrote: `Any student of       African American history or cultural studies will find this a fascinating       and highly useful book' (Other Source 5).

These include New Perspective, 14,       No.1 (September 2008); History Teaching Review, The Yearbook         of the Scottish Association of Teachers of History (2010); and the       online resource Milestones Documents in African American History       (2010) available at:     www.schlagergroup.com/mdaah.php          Verney receives regular invitations to contribute to book/journal       publications as a direct result of his research, for example from Jonathan       Este, Politics Editor of the Conversation, resulting in the two       articles listed in b.     b) The General Public     The Obama Research Network, for which Verney is       Co-Organizer/Investigator, is committed to public engagement and dialogue       between scholarly researchers and the wider community.
The Network       Steering Committee includes representatives from the International Slavery       Museum (ISM) Liverpool, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as well       as a schools representative.
Commenting on 3vi Stephen Burman from       the FCO stated:     `It is rich in interdisciplinary perspectives that bring together diverse       issues into the most coherent and comprehensive analysis yet of the Obama       story so far'.
(Other Source 6)     The Network was funded by a &#163;31,320 award over three years from the AHRC       which specifically uses impact criteria in the allocation of Network       awards.
