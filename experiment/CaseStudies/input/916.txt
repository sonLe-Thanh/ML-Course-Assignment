     Through our `Pathway to Impact &#8212; No.1 (Bespoke research projects)',       this impact case       demonstrates impact on the environment, and economic,         commercial and organisational         impacts by influencing codes of practice that effect resource       management practices which       contribute to environmental sustainability.
In more recent projects, working with UK Government (Defra) [S5]       and the Waste &amp; Resources       Action Programme (WRAP), Cranfield has influenced the development of Phase       2 of the Courtauld       Commitment, a sector wide voluntary agreement funded by Westminster,       Scottish, Welsh and       Northern Ireland Governments and delivered by WRAP [S7].
The       commitment, launched in 2005,       is "aimed at improving resource efficiency and reducing the carbon and       wider environmental       impact of the UK grocery retail sector" [S1], by providing more       sophisticated measures and targets       for the sustainable use of resources over the lifecycle of products.
The       agreement has more than       50 signatories including major retailers (e.g.
Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury, WM       Morrison and Waitrose)       and Brands and Suppliers (e.g.
Unilever, Mars, HJ Heinz, Nestle and       Coca-Cola).
In Phase 1 of the commitment from 2005 to 2009, the food industry avoided       670,000 tonnes of       food waste and 520,000 tonnes of packaging waste was avoided [S2].
The second phase       completed at the end of 2012, claimed further reductions of 8.8% product       waste and 8.2%       packaging waste against a 2009 baseline.
A third phase of the commitment       was launched in May       2013, and aims to deliver savings of &#163;1.6 billion to consumers, food and       drink sector and local       authorities.
The two projects funded by WRAP [S3, S4] based on more than 45       interviews with retailers and       suppliers in each product sector and secondary data allowed Cranfield to       estimate the losses from       specific products and extrapolate this to the whole sector.
Recommendations by Cranfield in these       studies contributed to the Courtauld Commitment.
When implemented these       recommendations       would save companies in the fresh fruit and vegetable chain an estimated       &#163;400 to &#163;500 million       annually, and a further &#163;110 million in the meat supply chain.
These built on the earlier Cereals Supply Chain project which had       provided a series of best       practice case studies of how organisations like Coors Brewers [S6],       Bernard Matthews and       Warburton's had identified and managed sources of waste in their business       processes.
The prior       EPSRC study had secured quantifiable benefits of over &#163;2 million for the       industrial collaborators       during the life of that project.
