     We now provide details of the 7 aforementioned impacts and their link to       underpinning research:     I1) Influence Government Policies [E1]: The research in [R1] and       the results in [R2] form the basis of evidence supplied by Strbac to the       House of Common's Energy and Climate Change Committee.
This was included       in their report to Parliament entitled "The future of Britain's       electricity networks" (10th Feb 2010) [E1].
In this report       Strbac or his evidence were referenced 38 times.
One section extracted       from the report states [E1]:     "... Strbac argued that the (existing) SQSS (Supply Quality and         Security Standards) ... present a barrier to a range of other solutions         ... these include ... advanced network control and innovative         decision-making tools.
....
This is important because these alternative         approaches could not only ...facilitate the connection of greater         amounts of wind ... but also ... play a key role in the development of a         smart grid."
I2) Support development of two standards [E2]: Recommendations       from [E1] led to the "Fundamental Review" of SQSS chaired by Andy Hiorns,       Electricity Network Development Manager from National Grid, to develop a       set of standards on supply quality and security.
Hiorns provided       corroboration evidence to the impact of our research in a letter stating       that the Imperial team "... provided the analytical basis for the         design of emerging low-carbon electricity transmission networks"       [E2].
Since 2008 Imperial's cost-benefit methodology [R1-2] was used for       the development of the first Offshore Network Design Standards, and for       the support of the Fundamental Review of SQSS.
Imperial's research       demonstrates that offshore networks will be over-invested if built to       onshore design standards.
Hiorns stated that [E2]:     "The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) undertaken by Strbac (and his         team)... demonstrated ... no case for redundancy given the high cost of         offshore cables ... balanced against the low load factor (&lt;40%) of         offshore wind farm generation, the low security value of offshore wind         and the absence of demand offshore."
I3) Assist National Grid in planning network investment [E2]: As       a result of the SQSS review and the new Offshore Network Design Standards,       National Grid developed a "Smart Transmission Zone" to experiment with new       solutions.
Furthermore, National Grid now uses Strbac's transmission       investment model (known as DTIM) to perform cost-benefit analysis of       transmission investment.
According to Hiorns, based on this analysis they       were able to demonstrate the case for reinforcing Great Britain's network       through a new investment plan worth more than &#163;3bn.
This plan was       subsequently approved by the Regulator, Ofgem [E2].
I4) New standard leading to savings by National Grid [E2]:       According to Ofgem, there are 20 offshore wind farms with network       connections worth an estimated &#163;2.5bn.
Hiorns stated in [E2] that:     "....
I [Hiorns] estimate that the design with the new standard, based         on the methodology developed by Prof Strbac and his team, made savings         of more than &#163;500m ...
It is presently envisaged that some 11GW of         Round-3 windfarms will be required, with potential further savings of         &#163;1-2bn."
I5) New approach to HVDC with Alstom [E3-4]: Imperial's work on       analysing design trade-offs in multi-level converters in 1996-2002 [R3],       and particularly in the new Alternate Arm Converter 2007-2012 [R4],       demonstrated to Alstom how excellent fault management capabilities could       be achieved alongside high efficiency and low volume.
The impact of our       work on Alstom's high voltage DC (HVDC) business is corroborated by the       testimonial from Colin Davidson, Chief Technology Officer (HVDC) of Alstom       Grid [E3].
Key control innovations on cell balancing, fault blocking and       active filtering have been jointly patented with Alstom [E4a-c].
The       analytical approach to design trade-offs has enabled Alstom to refine its       "second generation" Voltage Source Converters (VSC) to minimise footprint       for offshore HVDC use.
Our team's role in advancing Alstom's second       generation VSC from a concept (at TRL-1) to key plank of Alstom's strategy       at TRL-4 is evidenced by the 3 joint patents through which, as Davidson       states in [E3], the Imperial team:     ".... have provided Alstom with the detailed technical analysis,         creative novel solutions and with commercial considerations that we hold         in the highest regard.
The research undertaken has strengthened Alstom's         IP portfolio supporting our exploitation plan with technical         publications and progressed a new technology for HVDC from investigatory         to likely commercialisation.
... We consider this technology to now be         at TRL 4".
I6) Assist UK Power Networks in their network investment programme       [E5]: Extending the principles of [R1, R2] to future power electronics       options has created novel long-term distribution network investment       planning tools as reported in [R3].
In [E5], Barry Hatton, UK Power       Network's Director of Asset Management, says:     "... given the unique modelling capability developed by Imperial         College team led by Professor Strbac, in 2011 UK Power Networks and         Imperial commenced a joint project.
... [to] apply a novel Load Related         Expenditure Network Model ... We have employed this innovative Imperial         model to develop our network investment programmes,...with the total         asset value of &#163;1.18bn quantified by the model.
... We have         estimated that more than &#163;130m could be saved through the application of         demand side response, dynamic rating technologies and various active         network management techniques, and we have included this in our business         plan."
I7) Provide societal benefits in Africa [E6]: Through the Vessel       project (2006-2009) [EPSRC EP/E007198/1] and the Bboxx start-up company       [E6], Imperial has exploited its expertise in photo-voltaic integration       and techno-economic analysis [R6] to promote the "Energy Kiosk" model over       conventional grid electrification.
Vessel pursued the       photo-voltaic energy option to support IT in Kenyan villages and Bboxx has       rolled out Energy Kiosks with portable lighting in rural Africa and India.
There are clear developmental advantages in providing electric lighting       for children doing homework and families running a business and health       benefits from avoiding paraffin smoke.
The impact of the research is seen       in the success of Bboxx in creating a sustainable business model of       charging portable lamps in kiosks that could be rolled out as a business       without subsidy.
