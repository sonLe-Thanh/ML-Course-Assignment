     Mitra's research in entrepreneurship education has produced a framework       for best practice in       entrepreneurship teaching.
This framework has been developed in       collaboration with policy       makers, academics, students, and university managers.
This collaborative       research has allowed       him to develop guidelines for entrepreneurship education that are informed       by the practical       concerns of those who train and teach potential entrepreneurs.
Nigerian and African Entrepreneurship Education     Collaborating particularly with members of relevant community groups in       Nigeria, Mitra and his       research team in the Education Partnership in Africa (EPA) programme       developed principles for       entrepreneurship education particularly suited to the concerns of       developing countries in sub-       Saharan Africa.
The resulting framework was tailored for application       specifically in African       universities, responding to the needs identified by the EPA's partner HEI       institutions in Nigeria (the       National Universities Commission (NUC), Bayero University (BUK), the       University of Abuja, and       Covenant University).
The EPA project influenced the teaching of entrepreneurship in Africa by       two means.
First, The       research into entrepreneurship education involved a series of discussion       and training events for       university managers, administrators, and academics from British and       African universities.
The       purpose of these events was to learn about the needs of these       universities, to train attendees in       how to teach entrepreneurship, and to develop better methods for training       by learning from these       pilot training events.
The EPA held a total of 9 events from 2009 - 2010,       and in that time trained       over 200 delegates from the UK and from Africa, including members of       Nigeria's National       Universities Commission and Ministry of Education, senior managers from       African universities, and       academics who specialise in the teaching and research of entrepreneurship       [numbers taken from       corroborating source 1].
Second, the EPA project produced a series of directives for cultivating       Nigerian research and       education in entrepreneurship.
These directives were followed by the       partner institutions from       Nigeria that collaborated in the EPA project:            In 2010 Bayero University (in Kano, Nigeria) established the Centre         for African         Entrepreneurship Research and Training (CAERT), in accordance with the         EPA conclusions.
The Centre has facilitated collaborative research involving 4         universities in Nigeria and the         Philippines.
Bayero University has also followed EPA recommendations by         developing two new         course curricula in entrepreneurship, one of which is now compulsory for         all Nigerian         undergraduates [as corroborated by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Bayero,         source 2].
Both the         Director of CAERT and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Bayero University         have confirmed that         Mitra `has been the key influence [on] the creation of [the] Centre' and         that CAERT intends `to         continue work with Professor Mitra on many researches and capacity         building projects'         [corroborating sources 2 and 3].
The EPA project led to the NUC designing `some robust entrepreneurship         courses in Nigerian         universities' and setting up `Entrepreneurship Development Centres in         Nigerian universities'.
As attested by their Director of Student Support Services, Mitra has an         on-going consultation         position with the NUC: `The Commission will continue to count on the         support and leadership of         Mitra in future so as to help move entrepreneurship education programmes         forward'         [corroborating source 4].
Following EPA recommendations for knowledge exchange programmes,         Covenant University         (Ota, Nigeria) started KE workshops in 2011 to communicate its         entrepreneurship research to         non-academic businesses.
Thus far Covenant University have held 4 KE         workshops for a total         of 200 delegates [source 5].
In order to follow EPA recommendations for encouraging student         entrepreneurs, Kaduna State         University (Kaduna, Nigeria) established the Network for African         Students of Entrepreneurship.
The Network offers mentoring and advice for student entrepreneurs and         encourages exchange         of information between students from universities nationwide.
The NUC         has directed all         universities to establish branches of the network on their campuses         [source 5].
Mitra's research has also influenced the development of an       entrepreneurship curriculum and the       establishment of the first Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University       of the Western Cape in       Cape Town, South Africa.
The Acting Director of their Business School has       noted that `Professor       Jay Mitra's work on entrepreneurship, innovation and economic development       has had an important       impact on the development of strategy for now and in the future'.
The       Acting Director cites Mitra       (2011) as particularly influential, and notes that `the particular need to       develop a holistic       perspective for entrepreneurship education and research...is an original       concept which resonates       very well in the context of our work here in South Africa' [source 6].
OECD     In addition to the impact in Africa, Mitra's work has been used on       numerous occasions by the       OECD's Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) Programme to       inform its internal       policy forums, ministerial meetings, and member country deliberations.
His       work has informed their       discussions of entrepreneurship education, universities and policy       development, innovation and       economic development, small and medium enterprise (SME) strategy and       financing, and the       training and skills needs of SMEs.
Mitra has also influenced the OECD in       his role of scientific       advisor and head of the scientific committee on entrepreneurship for the       OECD Trento Centre on       Entrepreneurship and Regional Development [all OECD impact corroborated by       the Director of       LEED, source 7].
According to LEED's Director, Mitra's publications in this area have       `provided solid empirical       evidence of the value of entrepreneurship, innovation and SMEs to economic       and social policy       making' [source 7].
His publications on entrepreneurship education       (particularly 2009 and 2011)       `have had a direct impact on the shaping and formulation of [LEED's]       strategy, plans and       recommendations to member countries'.
Mitra has contributed to the `CDRi,       the major research       and development institution in Taiwan, the UAE, regional economic       development policy       development in Andalucia in Spain, and all member country policy meetings       in Paris'.
Specifically,       his concept of a holistic approach to entrepreneurship education (2011)       has had a substantial       influence on LEED's activity.
Mitra's direct and on-going influence on the OECD is also attested by       LEED's Director:     We will continue to take an interest in his research and consider ways in       which his research in       entrepreneurship can have further impact on our work.
I confirm that       Professor Mitra's       work...has had a direct influence on the development of entrepreneurship       policy and strategy       papers and advice that we offer to member countries of the OECD     Director of OECD's Local Economic and Employment Development Programme
