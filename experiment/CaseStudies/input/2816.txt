     The research has raised awareness and reshaped policy agendas of       governments and       international organisations so as to reduce or prevent the risk of harm       that could arise from       previous understandings of so-called `climate migration' as a narrowly       defined security issue.
The       research has reached a wide array of inter-connected governmental and       non-governmental       communities, many acting as multipliers on one another.
The depth of the       change of understanding       has been significant, with a consequently substantial shift in approaches       to governance.
Impacts       on four groups of user communities can now be specified:     UK Government: The Health and Wellbeing section of the Climate       Change Risk Assessment       Evidence Report (CCRA) for the Department for Environment, Food and         Rural Affairs draws       implications for the UK government and uses the MGEC report in its       analysis of risks around       climate change and migration.
The CCRA is the UK's first assessment of       potential climate change       impacts and is a statutory assessment laid before Parliament in January       2012.
The CCRA reflects       on the implications for the UK of future migration linked to environmental       change if large overseas       areas were to be severely affected by climate change.
The CCRA gives       direction to the National       Adaptation Programme laid before Parliament in 2013.
The CCRA Evidence       report draws directly       from the MGEC report to note that if immigration to the UK is affected,       especially in the event of       `catastrophic' climate change rendering large overseas areas       uninhabitable, then the influx of new       immigrants might change the proportion and composition of ethnic groups in       Britain with       implications for UK demographics and for health needs (p. 189).
The Department         for         International Development (DFID) Adaptation Team used the MGEC       framework related to       migration as a form of adaptation to environmental risk to change       awareness and reshape policy       agendas on the impact of cash transfers for poor people in vulnerable       environments (S1, p.5).
DFID used the report as the basis for a workshop (March 2012) in Ghana       with the Foresight team       and the National Development Planning Commission of Ghana to consider the       Report's       implications for the Government of Ghana and to assess approaches to       migration as an adaptation       strategy.
The MGEC report's analytical framework was used to initiate       research in Ghana on the       impact of cash transfers.
European Union: EU-level approaches previously had a narrow       security focus with, for example,       the Commission's former High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Javier       Solana, delivering a paper       to the Council in March 2008 entitled Climate Change and International         Security focused on       `environmentally triggered additional migratory stress' (page 10) with       potential for exacerbation of       existing conflicts, creation of new conflicts (e.g.
over resources),       triggering of border tensions and       scope for large-scale displacement.
The MGEC report challenged this       `securitised' conception of       the issues.
Geddes presented the MGEC findings to the Joint Research         Committee of the         European Commission (December 2011) and participated in a bilateral       meeting between the       Director General of the European Commission Home Affairs Unit, Mr       Stefano Manservisi, and       the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir John Beddington, in       which specific implications       of the report's findings for the EU were discussed, particularly migration       as an adaptation strategy.
Following this meeting and workshops with the Foresight team, in April       2013, the European         Commission produced a Staff Working Document (SWD) on Climate         Change, Environmental         Degradation, and Migration accompanying the EU Strategy on Adaptation to         Climate         Change (S2).
The SWD referred extensively to the MGEC report       (on 19 occasions).
For example,       on p.8, the SWD identified the change in awareness stimulated by the MGEC       report when noting       that: `Early analyses of the impact of climate change and migration were       based on an overly       deterministic understanding of the relationship between the risk of       environmental degradation       faced by populations and the likelihood that they would migrate.
In       contrast, more recent research       such as the UK government's Foresight study has taken a more sophisticated       approach, paying       greater attention to both the adaptive capacity of persons in low income       countries, and the factors       behind decisions to migrate'.
The SWD then referred directly by name (S2,       p.12) to a policy brief       prepared by Geddes that applied the MGEC report to 10 South Mediterranean       Partner Countries       and explored implications of environmental change for issues such as urban       governance,       vulnerability and `trapped populations'.
Directly using Geddes' policy       brief, the SWD noted that       contrary to previous assumptions about potential mass migration and       displacement the `options for       longer-distance and international migration within the Southern       Mediterranean countries and       beyond are likely to be reduced by the effect of environmental change and       its interaction with other       migration drivers, in particular for the poorest groups in society.
Therefore, persons migrating may       not be the most vulnerable or the most affected by environmental change'       (p.12).
Thus the       European Commission took forward MGEC findings that challenged simplistic       notions of mass       flight and developed a more sophisticated understanding of the policy       challenges.
The SWD then       fed directly into the Commission's Communication of May 2013 on Maximising         the Development         Impact of Migration: The EU contribution for the UN High-level Dialogue         and next steps         towards broadening the development-migration nexus, p. 3 of which       referred explicitly to the       SWD to note a key MGEC conclusion that `climate change and environmental       degradation are       already exerting an increasing influence on migration and mobility, with       current evidence       suggesting that in the future most movements will occur either within or       between developing       countries'.
International organisations (UN system, World Bank): Geddes       presented the MGEC report to the       UN Inter-Agency meeting on International Migration at UN Headquarters in       February 2012.
The       MGEC report has significantly influenced the United Nations High         Commissioner for Refugees         (UNHCR) thinking and work in seeking to place migration issues       higher on the international       agenda.
For example, the Foresight project contributed to the launch of       the Nansen Initiative       (launched by the Swiss and German governments at the UNHCR's Executive       Committee on       October 2 2012) by preparing a report entitled The Nansen Initiative,         UNHCR and the Foresight         Report on MGEC.
The Population Division of the United Nations         Department for Economic and         Social Affairs (UNDESA) has cited the report to support discussions       in the inter-agency Global       Migration Group.
The MGEC report served as the basis for a discussion of       migration and       environmental change in the report of the United Nations Secretary-General       on International       Migration and Development prepared for the sixty-seventh session of the       General Assembly in       Autumn 2012.
The Secretary-General's report made specific reference to the       MGEC report when it       noted that: `Environmental change is seldom the sole reason for people to       move, but is often one       of the reasons to migrate, alongside political, social, economic and       demographic factors' (S3, p.8).
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recognised that       the MGEC report       contributed to new and emerging understandings of linkages between       poverty, the environment,       and migration as well as building synergies between global processes such       as the Global Forum         for Migration and Development (GFMD) and the United Nations         Framework Convention on         Climate Change (UNFCCC) process (S1, p.2).
The United Nations         Environment Programme         (UNEP) used the Report for the in-depth analysis to inform its own       regional study and to serve as       an important reference point (S1, p.2).
Geddes co-authored a report       applying the MGEC report to       the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia region.
The MGEC report       has contributed to debate,       policy and practice regarding regional migration issues, and has been used       to brief senior World       Bank policy makers and a wider audience.
The World Bank are using the MGEC       report and policy       briefing paper co-authored by Geddes to set empirical background       conditions for policy at regional       and country level and to foster discussion within relevant sector units       within the World Bank, and in       turn with client countries.
It is also using the MGEC report in the       development of its corporate       strategy and global advocacy (S1, p.2)     Public engagement: The MGEC report was covered extensively in the       national and international       media to reshape debate about links between migration and environmental       change.
For example,       The Guardian newspaper had previously published articles such as       the following in 2008 that       noted potential for `mass migration arising from climate change with       climate change as one of the       major drivers of this phenomenon ... Europe must expect substantially       increased migratory       pressure' (cited in R4).
Immediately following the launch of the MGEC       report, The Guardian       reported the issues very differently when noting that: `Hundreds of       millions of people may be       trapped in inhospitable environments as they attempt to flee from the       effects of global warming,       worsening the likely death toll from severe changes to the climate'.
The       article referred directly to       Geddes, as follows: `Trying to stop migration from global warming may be       the wrong approach, the       scientists warned.
Andrew Geddes, professor of politics at the University       of Sheffield, said:       "Policies that just seek to prevent migration are risky."
Instead,       governments should attempt to       anticipate movement and find ways to improve conditions, both in the       places people are likely to       move to, and those they are likely to move from' (S4).
In addition, the       MGEC report and its key       findings were covered in articles in major international news outlets for       example by the New York           Times (S5), Reuters (S6), Financial           Times (S7), and BBC News (S8) website.
The MGEC       report       also reshaped debate amongst NGOs about links between climate change and       migration.
For       example, the report Communicating Climate and Migration by the UK         Climate Change and         Migration Coalition (S9) noted that: 'Several factors appear to have       brought it to public attention       over the past year, most notably the famine and drought in Somalia, the       Durban climate summit       and the UK Government Foresight report' (p.6).
