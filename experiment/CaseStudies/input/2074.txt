     Mandler's books on this subject &#8212; a short, more popular book on the place       of history in national life       History and National Life) and the longer, more academic work (The         English National Character) &#8212; sold       well and were widely noticed in the press on publication for bringing a       new level of       sophistication to the conceptualization and delineation of national       identity.
On the day of       publication Simon Jenkins celebrated History and National Life in       a Times column for establishing       a more honest and rigorous relationship between history and national       identity in the face of a flood       of `distorted, biased, glamorised and perverted' accounts: `his instinct       is not to slink back to his       study.
It is to raise the professional flag and check it out.
He wants to       argue with movie-makers       and reporters, with analysts and background writers.'
The English National Character then quickly established itself as       the definitive work on its subject &#8212; `a       work of high quality, insightful, enlightening' (Dublin Review of Books);       `a superb example of       how to write...the history of an idea' (New York Sun); `the best recent       survey I have seen on the       subject' (Jeremy Paxman in BBC History Magazine); `an absorbing       study of both the meaning of       Englishness and the whole idea of national identity (George Walden on       Bloomberg.com);       `tremendously rewarding and instructive' (Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily         Telegraph); `a lively       understanding of where a lot of stereotypes about "the English national       character" have come from'       (Independent).
Nearly all reviews recognized that this was a book       that brought academic virtues of       deep learning and sophisticated analysis to a subject that was normally       treated lightly, anecdotally.
The impact of the book in the survey period has been precisely this &#8212; it       is used as a counterpoint to       the more familiar &#8212; light-hearted and populist &#8212; presentations of ideas       about the English national       character.
A 2008 BBC radio documentary, `Ideas &#8212; The British Version: The       Middle Way', used       Mandler's book as the background for its discussion of the `muddling       through' stereotype and       recorded an interview between Mandler and Tristram Hunt [ref 5A].
(First broadcast on Radio 3 at       9.10pm, 6 July 2008.)
A 2011 BBC radio documentary, `Make Me a National       Treasure', used       Mandler's work to raise the intellectual level of broadcasts otherwise       oriented around celebrities.
In putting together the programme, presented by Gyles Brandreth, the       producer wrote to Mandler       stating that, `It's aiming to be a light-hearted programme but I would       like to include some       intellectual substance and I thought it might be interesting to talk to       you about the differences       between our appreciation of national treasures and heroes and what this       tells us about our national       character' [5B].
The resulting broadcast alternated celebrity       panellists nominating their national       treasures with Mandler's recorded commentary on how these choices       reflected a longer history of       ideas about national character.
(First broadcast on Radio 4 at 11am on 28       December 2011.)
Another celebrity-led BBC TV programme, `Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip &#8212; An       Emotional History of       Britain', also used Mandler's book as background to orchestrate a more       serious discussion of       changing emotional norms in British national life [5C].
(This was       a three-part series on BBC2 in       October 2012.)
Most recently, leading film blogs (The Quietus, Guardian       Film Blog) have drawn       on Mandler's research to contextualize their understandings of peculiarly       `English'       characterizations in British film [5H, 5I].
The English         National Character is now often       recommended reading for those wishing to understand concepts of English       identity, for example on       the ESL website UsingEnglish.com [5E] and in adult education at       the Marlborough Summer School       [5F], and has served as a benchmark for subsequent popular writing       on Englishness [5G].
In addition, Mandler's expertise is now regularly drawn on when domestic       and foreign media seek       analysis of alleged surges of English national feeling (as often happens       around royal events,       international football tournaments, or political initiatives).
Thus       Mandler was interviewed       extensively about English national identity by Tokyo Shinbun in       July 2008; appeared on Irish       Radio NewsTalk's `Talking History' programme in May 2009; was quoted twice       in the Times in       October 2009 around debates on national iconography (Stephen Poliakoff's       films and the `fourth       plinth' in Trafalgar Square); was interviewed by Bayerischer Rundfunk, El         Pais, Wall Street       Journal, Semana (Colombia), Epoca (Brazil), and       LBC/Heart Radio (UK), in 2011 on the       significance of the royal wedding; was interviewed by the Guardian,       May 2011 on the view of       Britain from abroad and by Henri&#235;tte Lakmaker of the Dutch newspaper Trouw       on British attitudes       as reflected in the media in July 2011 [5D]; was interviewed by       TVN Poland (television) and       Sanlian Life Weekly Magazine (Beijing) (circulation 200,000) on the       Diamond Jubilee, February       2012; was interviewed for another programme on the `stiff upper lip' by       CTVC for Radio 4, May       2012 (for which the producer described Mandler's book as `hugely useful       and influential in the       development of this programme idea' [5J]); and was interviewed for       a globally syndicated TV       programme on the royal birth by Associated Press TV in July 2013.
