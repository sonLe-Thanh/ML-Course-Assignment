     Impact on practitioners and professional services     CIRIA's Guidance on Water Cycle Management for New Developments:       The 2010 guide [a] was produced as an outcome of the WaND project       [i].
It summarises and distils extensive research from CWS [1], to meet       the urgent challenge of how to provide water services for new housing       developments in water-stressed areas.
The report was guided by a steering       group with representatives from government bodies (e.g.
Environment       Agency), consultants (e.g.
Arup) and water companies (e.g.
Thames Water).
It is widely used by practitioners in construction and the built       environment, a sector with a gross value added of &#163;89.5bn amounting to       6.7% of the British economy in 2011.
BRE's Designing Resilient Cities.
A Guide to Good Practice: The 2012       Guide [b] sets out a framework for implementing robust, future-proofed       solutions for urban regeneration.
It was the key outcome of the       industry-guided Urban Futures project [ii] and four of the case studies       included are specifically derived from CWS research [2].
The guide is       unique in supporting city planners, councillors, architects and their       consultants to redesign cities to be sustainable whatever the future       holds.
For example, multinational construction and engineering firm CH2M       HILL is using the future scenario framework for "key future projects", and       is influencing the sustainability planning of cities across the world [c].
Spon's Urban Drainage: This book [d] was originally conceived as a       text for students which may also be of use to practitioners.
However, it       has also been widely taken up and used by professionals.
For example,       unsolicited Amazon customer comments include: "Essential reading for any       drainage engineer (or those aspiring to become one).
The best text       for UK drainage design and practice"; "A good value for money book       that should be on the shelf in every consultant's office"; "I have       just bought the book as the office copy is frequently borrowed"       [e].
In the third edition (2011) the chapter, `Towards sustainable       water management' draws on research from completed projects [i], best       practice [a] and CWS's published research findings [1, 3].
The book has       sold 5000+ copies worldwide, considered to be `very good' for a specialist       text [f].
Economic impact: enhancing business performance by uptake and adoption         of CWS hydroinformatic software       Asset management: The Centre's EPR sewer deterioration model [6]       has been data validated by an industry funded research project [g] and       subsequently widely used to model water asset deterioration and to develop       infrastructure risk models for the water industry price review process       PR09 (2009 - 2014).
Users include Anglian Water, South West Water       (in collaboration with Mouchel), Severn Trent Water (in collaboration with       RPS Water) and Wessex Water.
In 2002, the Universities of Exeter and       Sheffield span out the company SEAMS.
Today (2013) the company has       an annual turnover of &#163;3.4m and is the industry leader in software and       analytic services for asset investment planning decisions [h], still using       the WiLCO software [5] developed by the Centre.
For example, SEAMS used       WiLCO extensively to support Scottish Water's &#163;1.1bn strategic       infrastructure investment decisions for their PR09 business plan [i].
Benefits were not only the transparency of the decisions made under strict       audit conditions but also that the approach identified significant       efficiencies of up to 15% over the utility's own investment plans.
Infrastructure operation: The Neptune project [vi]       decision-support system developed by CWS improves real-time fault       management of water distribution networks.
The system takes advantage of       intelligent computational methods and tools applied to real-time logger       data providing pressures, flows and tank levels at key locations to allow       managers to assess and respond to service provision risk.
The prototype       was tested on networks in Yorkshire Water (2009-2010) and was so       successful, it is now (2013) being customised for United Utilities       via a TSB Knowledge Transfer Partnership.
This methodology has been       granted a 2009 patent [j] and this was subsequently sold to       project partner ABB Technology.
Optimisation software &amp; studies: The optimisation software       GANetXL [4] has been developed and perfected by the Centre since 2008       and has over 400 users worldwide including consultants (e.g.
Mouchel),       financial institutions (e.g.
JP Morgan) and industrial research       organisations (e.g.
SCION Research).
The software provides easy access to       evolutionary, multi-objective optimisation algorithms for non-specialists.
It has recently (2012) been used by consultants AECOM for South       West Water to optimize successfully sewer rehabilitation planning       considering costs, structural improvements and critical risk of failure.
Cost reductions of almost 50% have been demonstrated compared with       original estimates of &#163;4-5m per annum spend [k].
