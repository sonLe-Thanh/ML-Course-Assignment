     4a: Reducing uncertainty in the field.
Prior to these systematic       reviews, effectiveness estimates for the various fluoride treatments were       based on selected published literature of variable quality, reported in       broad ranges, and there was no general agreement on the causes of       differences in effectiveness.
Estimates fell considerably short of a       definitive recommendation for topical fluoride as a safe and effective       treatment, hence policymakers and practitioners were unsure of the best       course of action.
On the basis of this work, estimates of TFT efficacy       became considerably more precise (narrower confidence intervals), and       causes of differences in effectiveness among treatments could be formally       indicated [1-7].
4b: Changing the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicines         List.
In 2004 the team was invited to produce a summary report based       on the results of the Cochrane Fluoride reviews, and this prompted the       first major impact of this research.
The document directly influenced the       WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines at       its 2005 meeting in Geneva [8].
It recommended that sodium fluoride be       retained on the Model List of Essential Medicines, but that the       description should be changed to "in any appropriate topical formulation".
This recommendation is still current, the latest versions are the 17th WHO       Essential Medicines List and the 3rd WHO Essential Medicines List for       Children updated in March 2011.
4c: Informing and developing clinical practice and dental health         policy &#8212; nationally and internationally.
Findings from this research       rapidly influenced policy and practice from professional bodies and health       services in UK and internationally.
For example, the Queen Mary research       underpins numerous recommendations in:            The influential document 'Delivering Better Oral Health: An         Evidence-Based Toolkit' from the UK Department of Health (DH 2009) 1st         (2007) and 2nd (2009) editions, which support PCTs and dental teams         across the UK in the delivery of preventive approaches in oral health         based on the best available research evidence [9];       The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) 2005 Guide for         the Prevention and Management of Dental Decay in the Pre-school Child         [10], and The American Dental Association (ADA) 2007 Evidence-Based         Clinical Recommendations on Professionally Applied Topical Fluorides         (both still current and in the process of being updated) [11];       The Guidelines from the Irish Public Dental Service Evidence-based         Guidance on the use of Topical Fluorides for Caries Prevention in         Children and Adolescents (IPDS 2008) [12], and The European Academy of         Paediatric Dentistry Guidelines on the use of Fluorides in Children         (EAPD 2009) [13].
Marinho has contributed directly as a consultant and         external reviewer in the former and as a presenter, committee member and         author in the latter; and       The Guide to Recommendations for the Use of Fluoride in Brazil:         (Ministry of Health 2009) [14], to which Marinho has contributed         directly as a consultant/committee member.
The impact of this research on national and cross-national guidelines has       been investigated in a recent MSc project [15].
The student looked at the       total number of recommendations per type of topical fluoride featuring in       the guidelines and at the proportion of Cochrane reviews, non-Cochrane       reviews and other types of evidence permeating the guidelines'       recommendations.
Of 70 recommendations in the guidelines, this research       was cited in 57%.
Various recommendations based on the evidence from this research were       developed in three jointly organized international meetings (Marinho guest       speaker) by the WHO, International Association for Dental Research (IADR),       and International Dental Federation (FDI): a Global Consultation on Oral       Health through Fluoride in 2006 ((Geneva (Switzerland)/Ferney-Voltaire       (France)), a Conference on Oral Health Through Fluoride for China and       Southeast Asia in 2007 (Beijing), and the Workshop on Effective Use of       Fluoride in Asia in March 2011 (Phan-Nga, Thailand).
In particular, the       results of the fluoride toothpaste Cochrane reviews played a crucial role       in the evidence-based emphasis towards the worldwide promotion of this       treatment by these three major international organizations, as       demonstrated in their 2007 Beijing Declaration [16] (which followed the       2007 Call to Action to Promote Oral Health meeting); it states that       promoting dental health using fluoride, especially in the form of       toothpaste, will "improve quality of life and enhance achievement of         the WHO Millennium Development Goals by reducing the high dental disease         burden of entire populations, especially children in disadvantaged         areas."
4d: Informing/prompting further research.
Following       recommendations for further research from our work, many new RCTs,       especially fluoride varnish trials, are being or have been carried out in       numerous countries, and have been incorporated in a recently published       major update of the relevant Cochrane review, which provides even more       precise estimates of treatment effects [18].
4e: Advancing research methodology.
The methodological work by       this team has directly impacted on the development of statistical advances       in Cochrane reviews and others, as demonstrated by their use in the main       methodological guides in the field, considered the best resources for       conducting systematic reviews: the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews       of Interventions (updated in March 2011) [19], and Marinho's contribution       is acknowledged in The Cochrane Collaboration Glossary.
The research is       also listed within the main publications by the Cochrane Statistical       Methods Group [19], not least because the rich data set involving trials       for preventing caries in this series of Cochrane fluoride reviews has       motivated the development of new methods for network (or "multiple       treatment") meta-analysis, particularly around adjusting for bias and       accounting for heterogeneity.
Also, a new Cochrane Methods group was       established in 2010 to take these developments forward Collaboration-wide       &#8212; the Cochrane Comparing Multiple Interventions Methods Group [19].
