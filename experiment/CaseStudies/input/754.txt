     The beneficiaries of the research are both national and international.
The benefits are two-fold: (i) contributions to the development of       educational materials and programs in anti doping for UKAD and WADA; and       (ii) wide-reaching policy influence on national and leading global actors       of anti doping, arising from frequent high profile invitations to address       key stakeholders in anti doping at WADA, the European Commission, UK Sport       and UK Anti Doping, and the Federation International de Medicin du Sport       (FIMS) and the International Cycling Union (UCI).
National Impact     G1 and G2 enabled UK Sport to help build bridges between the anti doping       and sports medical authorities and led to an invitation only seminar with       leading sports physicians and anti doping personnel in 2009 organised by       Prof McNamee, which raised the issue of professional conflicts of       confidentiality arising from obligations to the General Medical Council       and Health Professions Council and the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA)       Code (R3).
R1 and R2 provided a basis for the development of stronger stakeholder       relations between UKAD and national sports federations leading to the       development of a policy tool to assist anti doping prevention.
UKAD Chief       Executive Andy Parkinson writes "This research assisted UKAD in       understanding the tolerance to doping activity and how this changed as       athletes sporting careers progressed, providing a useful insight into the       psychology and mind sets of the next generation of athletes."
He also       noted how the research was "essential in developing our understanding,       cumulating in the development of a `Doping Signature' model."
This model       can be used to help identify particularly vulnerable athletes prior to       their making decisions to dope.
Parkinson writes that the model arose from       the research and was utilized as a tool they use with sports stakeholders       (e.g.
national sports federations) to "communicate these risks to the       sporting landscape.
At the recent industry conference, the Clean Sport       Forum (November 2012), this model was presented and unanimously accepted       by the audience of over 80 representatives from a wide range of UK       sporting organisations and Universities".
International Impact     In recognition of McNamee's corpus of published research he was invited       to prepare peer- reviewed educational materials, and give presentations to       international congresses for anti doping personnel in Seoul (November,       2010).
Among delegates were 60 heads/representatives of anti doping from       30 NADOs.
His invitation to talk to key Asian stakeholders at the Chinese       National Anti Doping Organization (CHINADA)/WADA Gene and Cell Doping       Symposium focused on social aspects of Anti Doping policy, with particular       reference to the Spirit of Sport (R5 and R6).
The Vice President, WADA /       President of the IOC Medical Commission, writes that he requested R6,       having heard it presented in Doha, at an international Anti Doping       conference and that he used it to "help prepare for the Executive Board       meeting of WADA, which agreed the final revisions of the WADA Code to be       ratified at the November 2013 meeting in South Africa".
He also writes: "Professor McNamee's article clearly laid out the logic       for maintaining WADAs 2 from 3 stance (performance enhancement or harm to       health or against the spirit of sport) on anti- doping substances and       methods.
His arguments were a significant foil against the move to       downgrade the spirit of sport criterion, and therefore to underwriting the       logic of anti- doping policy."
The re-instatement of three equal criteria       for Anti Doping Rule Violations is evidenced in the 3rd and       final WADA Code Review Version at (http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-The-Code/Code_Review/Code%20Review%202015/WADC-2015-draft-version-3.0.pdf)       Equally the Science Director at WADA writes of the invited presentations       noted above that: "in the context of gene therapy and gene doping and the       relevance of Prof McNamee's comments and perspectives were highly       appreciated by the audiences, in particular from the anti-doping experts       attending these two meetings.
In addition, in the current context of the       revision of the World Anti-Doping Code, Prof McNamee's reflections on the       importance of the spirit of sport criterion in the overall considerations       regarding identification of substances or methods prohibited in sport was       of significance.
He contributed to strengthen the debate and ultimately to       maintain the current balanced position between the three existing criteria       (performance enhancement, protection of health and spirit of sport).
Generally speaking, in the symposia referred to above, as well as in his       recent publications on this specific subject, Prof McNamee significantly       contributed to placing ethical considerations as one of the key elements       in the reflections supporting anti-doping policy making a practical impact       in the applications of anti-doping rules under the auspices of the World       Anti-Doping Code."
Moreover, based on R5 and R6, McNamee was solicited to write an       accessible article for the WADA magazine, Play True, on the subject of the       "Spirit of Sport" that was distributed to all National Anti Doping       organizations worldwide.
The Medical Director of WADA, writes about this       article: "Professor McNamee's discussions on ethics and the spirit of       sport have been particularly timely as this Code is being reviewed and we       wrestle with such crucial dilemmas such as inclusion criteria for List of       Prohibited Substances and Methods."
He continues: "Professor Mike McNamee       has been involved in numerous projects with WADA.
His writings, whether       from published articles or work specifically commissioned by WADA       education purposes (the WADA Physician Toolkit) have been of great value       in our efforts to educate athletes and physicians."
(see http://library.wada-ama.org/results.php#/item/000000011019098/view)     Given his work for the G3, McNamee was invited to present findings       (January, 2011) to the 6th Annual EU Anti Doping Working Group comprising       all heads of NADOs in Europe.
He subsequently became a member of the newly       formed European Commission Expert Group on Recreational Doping, which       submitted recommendations for an EC declaration.
The Head of the EC       Education and Sport Unit writes: "the impact of the research directed by       Professor McNamee on EU-level policy development has been consistent and       considerable" and that "the Sport Unit has been in close contact with       Professor McNamee and found him to be a valuable source of information and       inspiration."
Finally, in the wake of the Lance Armstrong scandal, UCI commissioned       McNamee to address all Directors of the Professional Tours (December,       2012) in their annual meeting.
This meeting is normally restricted to       heads of professional teams and their representatives that comprise the       elite level of world cycling.
In this arena McNamee raised key ethical       issues that UCI and Professional teams needed to address regarding the       cultures of anti doping in professional cycling.
He was invited to the       subsequent (March, 2103) stakeholder meeting - Anti Doping Working Group -       including representatives from professional cyclists, professional teams,       TV sport media, International Tour Event Organisers.
This group was formed       as to discuss the future of anti doping policy and practice for the future       health of the sport.
