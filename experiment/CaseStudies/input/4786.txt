     The Unit's researchers, including Hancox, Vella-Burrows and Shipton,       have sought to maximise       the impact of their research through the creation, support and (in several       instances) direction of a       number of specific, health-related choirs.
Through the implementation and       ongoing refinement of       the insights gained through their research, these choirs have led to       substantive health and       wellbeing benefits to individuals with long-term conditions, their       families and communities, as well       as further promoting and evidencing the health and wellbeing benefits of       singing.
These choirs include Skylarks, a network of Singing for       Parkinson's singing groups established in       2010 by Hancox in collaboration with local Parkinson's Society       support groups.
There are currently       choirs in Canterbury, Folkestone and Whitfield, with over 80 people with       Parkinson's and carers       participating in a fortnightly programme of singing designed to help       maintain and improve voice       quality, and sense of wellbeing.
The choirs have performed at two       international conferences and       were featured in a BBC breakfast news report.
Data establishing the health       and wellbeing impacts       has been captured through reflective blogs, video media, and carers'       testimony (eg "My Mum was         diagnosed with Parkinson's eight years ago and suffers from acute         anxiety, especially in public         situations.
To say the singing group was a triumph would be an ENORMOUS         understatement.
It         was the first time she has felt comfortable enough to stay for an entire         group event in a very long         time.
She was literally buzzing on the way home, as was I").
A       protocol for a controlled research       study has been designed and funding is being pursued.
The East Kent         Singing for Mental Health         Network of singing groups was established in 2009 by Vella-Burrows       and others in collaboration       with Eastern and Coastal Kent PCT and Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care       Partnership Trust       to provide opportunities for singing and support for over 100 people with       mental health needs.
A       clinically significant improvement in mental wellbeing was found using a       validated clinical measure       (CORE).
Findings from the evaluation have shown statistically significant       improvements,       suggesting that regular group singing promotes wellbeing (Clift and       Morrison 2011).
Qualitative       data from participants (and professionals' testimonies 5 and 6       below) point to marked       improvements in mental wellbeing for people with a range of enduring       mental health issues.
The       network has featured on BBC World Service (September 2011), and been       awarded &#163;140k further       NHS funding to extend into West Kent and Medway.
The East Kent Singing and COPD Network of singing groups was       established by Vella-Burrows       and others for research purposes in September 2011 with funding from the       Dunhill Medical Trust,       and in collaboration with Eastern and Coastal Kent Community Health Trust       and the British Lung       Foundation.
Over 100 people with COPD were recruited into the study and       met weekly to       participate in a programme of singing designed to promote better       breathing.
Six of the singing       groups have continued, are self supporting, and attended by over 100       people following the end of       the research phase.
The research has demonstrated evidence of significant       improvement in       measures of lung function (FVC improved from 2430ml to 2540 ml over the       ten months of the       study) and health-related quality of life for participants in the singing       groups, as well as social,       psychological and physical health benefits from taking part.
Testimonies       from participants include       "This group has been extremely helpful in many ways, physically and         psychologically.
I just don't         have to worry about breathing any more.
I am much calmer now and my         sleep has improved" and       "I go to the group with a tight chest, and leave feeling I can breathe         again.
The nurse measured my         lung capacity: it improved through the singing classes!"
Vella-Burrows       has also created a number       of Singing for Health clubs for people and family carers living with the       effects of dementia, for       example Seaview Singers, which was established in 2008 and still       has approximately 30       participants.
Partners of dementia patients have spoken of the profound       impact these groups have       on the patients' alertness, posture and ability to engage with others.
As a direct result of their engagement with the work of the Unit's       researchers, a number of external       organisations have themselves established singing groups in order to       implement the outcomes of       this research.
Brighton and Hove PCT, for example, now provide       singing groups for people with       dementia as a direct consequence of research on singing and dementia       conducted by Vella-Burrows       and other SDHRC staff.
Connors House care home established a       partnership with the       SDHRC in 2006 to provide inter-generational musical and singing activity       for elderly residents, and       to date over 150 residents and care staff have participated.
The independent charity Sing For Your Life was established in       2005 by Hancox and Vella-Burrows       (and others) specifically to transfer the research findings of the SDHRC       into practice.
Sing For Your Life runs over 40 singing groups for older people across the       South East of England       and elsewhere in the country reaching over 1,000 older people in community       and care settings       every month.
Singing groups have also been established in Canada, Finland       and Italy following the       same model, and building directly on the Unit's research.
Qualitative       evaluation, surveys and a       pragmatic community based RCT funded by NIHR (the project ran in 2010-11       with findings       published in 2012) have provided clear evidence of significant effects of       regular group singing       facilitated through Sing For Your Life on the mental wellbeing of older       people.
Sing For Your Life       are now focusing on delivering singing in residential care settings, thus       widening the reach and       impact of the singing for health model (www.singforyourlife.org.uk).
The Unit's researchers have also sought to maximise the impact of their       research into singing and       health through disseminating their findings at conferences and seminars       attended by practitioners       and policy makers, thereby encouraging and supporting the adoption and       application of their       findings elsewhere.
These include three international conferences       organised by Shipton for       SDHRC: Music and Health: Current Developments in Research and Practice       (9-10/9/08; 110       delegates); SEMPRE Conference on Music Health and Wellbeing: 'Striking         a Chord' (9-10/9/11;       125 delegates); SEMPRE Conference 'Setting the Tempo' : The need for a         progressive research         programme on Music Health and Wellbeing (19-20/4/13; 80 delegates).
Practitioners from across       the UK and beyond have taken up these interventions.
For example, Pauline       Waugh, a Lead       Practice Nurse in Edinburgh writes: "I have been trying to emulate         your success with your singing         groups for patients with COPD [...] We now have both ethics approval and         funding for our project         called `Singing for COPD &#8212; Take a Breath' and we officially start this         Monday (7th Oct) [...] We are         running a study similar to your original one in order to determine if         this type of singing group could         be rolled out across Edinburgh in the first instance".
The Unit's researchers have also made a particularly distinctive       contribution to maximising the       impact of their research through offering training to those interested in       developing skills and       careers in leading singing groups for those with long-term health       conditions.
Staff carers have been       trained at Connors House (a residential care home), at six care homes run       by Abbeyfield, Kent,       and at others including Avanti Care Homes.
Training has been provided to       Kent County Council,       both in schools and in older people's services.
Partnerships have been       formed with arts venues       (e.g.
Turner Contemporary), and support provided to other professionals       (e.g.
the Ladder to the       Moon Theatre Company).
The most significant output from the Unit's       training work built around its       research has been the publication in 2012 of four Singing for Health         Guides, focusing on Dementia       (Vella-Burrows), Mental Health (Clift, Morrison), Parkinson's (Hancox,         Vella-Burrows) and       COPD (Clift, Morrison), and an associated programme of training.
To date,       80 health professionals       and volunteers have attended these training days led by SDHRC since       September 2012, making a       substantial contribution to the development of a singing for health       network.
In addition, an       International Journal for Arts and Health (published by Taylor and       Francis) was launched in 2009       as a direct result of the work of the Sidney De Haan Research Centre.
