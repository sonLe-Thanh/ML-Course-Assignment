     The research undertaken at York underpins NICE technology appraisal       methods.
NICE's 2008 "Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal" (source         1) describes the key principles of appraisal methodology which must       be adhered to by all organisations submitting evidence to the technology       appraisal programme.
The guidance was shaped by the York research and York       researchers involved in: the NICE Decision Support Unit (Palmer); the       Methodology Working Party (Sculpher); the Methods Guide Review Workshops       (Sculpher, Griffin); producing 3 briefing papers (source 2).
The       Guide drew on York research showing the need to consider the uncertainty       and limitations of the evidence base and a requirement for rigorous       methods "to assess the implications of uncertainty, including the         uncertainty around the appropriate structure of the economic model, the         choice of sources and analyses to inform the estimates of costs and         health effects, and the precision with which these are known."
(para       5.1.11).
This Guide (and the 2013 version) has governed the methods used to       generate each of the 161 pieces of Technology Guidance issued by NICE       since 2008.
These are relevant to clinical practice in conditions that are       major causes of mortality and morbidity which also place significant       demands on NHS resources.
Over half of NICE guidance has been in the areas       of cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory heath, which, in 2008, were       responsible for almost 350,000 deaths (associated with over 2m years of       life lost) and accounted for over &#163;16bn of NHS spending.
York research on       methods for evidence synthesis was cited extensively in four NICE Decision       Support Unit Technical guidance documents in 2011 (source 3).
NICE       has reviewed the Methods Guide (2013) and York staff have been heavily       involved as members and facilitators of the Methods Guide Review Workshops       (Griffin, McKenna, Palmer, Sculpher, Spackman, Walker) and have produced a       briefing paper on the appropriate cost perspective for NICE appraisals to       adopt (ie, whether evaluation of healthcare interventions should include       costs that fall on non-health sectors) (source 4).
Sculpher       participated in the decision-making meetings on perspective and the       revised Guide follows York recommendations in terms of limiting the       perspective to the NHS and personal social services, unless NICE       specifically requests a broader scope (source 5).
The Department of Health's consultation document on value based pricing       referred to the need to establish the evidence base for an appropriate       cost-effectiveness threshold, saying that "Work is already in hand with         external experts to achieve this", citing Sculpher's research as the       source of that evidence (source 6).
The value and appropriateness       of NICE processes were reviewed by the House of Commons Health Select       Committee.
Oral and written evidence was presented by York on the cost       effectiveness threshold used by NICE and expenditure decisions by Primary       Care Trusts.
The Select Committee advocated that further research -       similar to that undertaken by York - takes place on the cost effectiveness       thresholds used by NICE.
The Government endorsed the Committee's       expression of support for NICE's programmes and commended the processes by       which it discharges its responsibilities (source 7).
The York contribution to economic evaluation methods used by NICE is       internationally influential.
Countries that have developed/are developing       decision-making institutions like NICE are listed by NICE International       and the methods adopted are based on those developed by York (source         8).
York researchers have been involved in directly advising other       health systems about their methods and processes of technology assessment,       for example, in Ireland: "The guidelines for evaluating clinical         effectiveness have been developed in consultation with the Scientific         Advisory Group of the Authority... this group includes methodological         experts from the field of HTA."
Drummond and Sculpher are listed in       the Scientific Group as the only non-Irish members (source 9).
The       Belgian Guidelines external expert group lists York's Claxton and Gravelle       as the only UK experts (source 10) and Sculpher is the only       non-North American on the USA Cost-effectiveness Panel (source 11).
The establishment and/or development of approaches to technology appraisal       in countries such as Brazil, USA, China, Colombia, Estonia, Serbia,       Thailand and Turkey are influenced by the methods and processes developed       by York and employed by NICE: eg, the Brazilian guidelines: "The entire         methodology pointed out in the following topics is based on         internationally published methodological guidelines" &#8212; and cites       NICE as one of the sources (source 12); the US Wellpoint HTA       Guidelines: "The US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness and the latest NICE         Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal argue for the pivotal role         of a reference case in driving resource allocation decisions within         health care systems.
This position is also taken by WP ..." (source         13).
Our research has impacted on major NHS policy initiatives and has had a       wider impact on the health care system.
York research on the Quality and       Outcomes Framework (QOF), whereby GPs are paid for achieving quality, has       informed the approach taken by NICE.
Since 2009 NICE has been responsible       for producing an annual `menu' of new, evidence-based cost-effective       clinical and health improvement indicators.
The methods used by NICE to       assess the value for money of potential QOF indicators are taken directly       from York's research: "this appendix presents the underpinning         assumptions and data requirements that will be used to determine cost         effectiveness by the York Health Economics Consortium.
The work has been         informed by research undertaken by York University and University of         East Anglia ..." (source 14).
By ensuring that QOF payments       reflect the value of the indicators in terms of the health benefit       produced, our research helps to ensure maximum health gain is achieved for       money spent on rewarding high quality care.
The QOF indicators cover a       range of conditions and activities for the population of 54 million       registered patients in England served by over 8,000 GP practices, thus the       impact on quality is considerable.
Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of NICE until 2012, supporting our       successful application for a Queen's Anniversary Prize, described York's       impact: "The centre [CHE, Uni of York] has made extraordinary         contributions both nationally and internationally to the development of         health economics.
It has done so from both a theoretical and practical         standpoint.
In particular, its contributions to the work of NICE have         been so very important that I doubt if we would have achieved anything         without the rigour and expertise provided by the Centre and many of its         staff."
