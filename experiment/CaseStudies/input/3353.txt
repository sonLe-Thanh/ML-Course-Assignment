     CMMB established and has utilised a number of distinct mechanisms to       increase the visibility and uptake of mathematical and statistical methods       in medical and biological problems.
These include:     Industrial skills development through training courses and Study         Groups: The BBSRC Modular Training for Industry course `Introduction       to Mathematical Modelling for Life Scientists' from 2008, the `Noise in       Life' conference in 2009 and the `Introduction to Biological Modelling'       summer schools led by Owen have all been well received by industry.
Ian       Barrett (Astra Zeneca): "...I am actually currently leading a project         using modelling to support one of our drug projects... and also line         manage a mathematical modeller.
I would say your course was an important         factor in enabling that progression, and I came away from it feeling         inspired to learn more."
[B1].
Owen was further consulted by Roche       regarding the implementation of multiscale modelling for oncology (from       molecular targets right up to patient health and survival).
CMMB members established Study Groups for Mathematics in Medicine (MMSG)       in 2000, for Plant Sciences in 2007 and for the Virtual Physiological       Human in 2009.
These engendered new industrial collaborations (e.g.
AstraZeneca, Health and Safety Laboratory, Pfizer, Syngenta, Unilever) and       changed company procedures.
Unilever ran an internal Study Group       (Facilitator: King), with Brendan O'Malley (ex-Systems Biology Project       Leader, Unilever) stating: "Critically the Study Group also         offered an opportunity to familiarise both mathematicians and biologists         with the different approaches and ways of working of their respective         disciplines".
[B2]     This and other activity (CASE, MSc project, consulting) contributed to       Unilever's Framework Partnership with the University (tinyurl.com/d8dypj8),       one of only three in the UK, to carry out research in certain strategic       areas exclusively at UoN.
Postgraduate and postdoctoral training: Through extensive       mathematical biology MSc and PhD programmes (the latter with support from       European funding [A6, A8]), internships of students with industry (via       e.g.
CASE or [A8]) and tailored training in both scientific and       professional development skills, individuals trained within CMMB have made       significant contributions to the adoption of UoN's mathematical and       statistical methods by industry and other end users:     Robert Jenkins (CRUK), the first theoretician recruited by CRUK with a       background purely in mathematics, stated that: "...the expertise I         developed there [CMMB] was crucial to my being awarded a permanent         contract as a Senior Scientific Officer at the London Research         Institute, which reflects the growing profile and impact of mechanistic         modelling approaches within CRUK's research and the increasing         confidence in their value for improving our understanding of a wide         range of cancers."
[B3];     Greg Lemon (Fellow at Harvard Bioscience, PDRA in CMMB until 2011 and       recent collaborator) applies mathematical modelling frameworks and skills       he developed while in CMMB in work with Harvard Apparatus (USA), Novalung       (Germany) and others to (for example) optimise performance of a membrane       oxygenator for paracorporeal lung support, and to quantify cell coverage       of tissue engineering scaffolds in a patent for a novel colorimetric       assay;     Susan Franks (Health and Safety Laboratory) also benefitted: "My own         training as a PhD student and postdoctoral student within CMMB         (1997-2004) was instrumental in the formulation, and in establishing the         direction, of a significant (c. &#163;900K) programme of work (of which I was         lead Investigator) funded by HSL to enhance their capabilities in using         mathematical modelling..." [B4].
Public engagement and widening dissemination: CMMB engages       extensively with a wider public audience, including through: YouTube 2009       `Meet the Mathematicians' (tinyurl.com/db2q72),       77k visitors with 97% positive feedback, `Biology Meets Mathematics' (tinyurl.com/ox28q26),       31k visitors with 95% positive feedback; outreach activities with CPIB in       local primary schools to stimulate interest from an early age; and the       annual UoN `MayFest' community open day where CMMB and CPIB ran a       multicellular image competition judged by the public.
A drive by CMMB and the School more broadly to publish in prestigious and       highly visible outlets, such as Nature and PNAS, has raised the profile       and coverage of our research.
CMMB papers have been cited by numerous       clinical groups, such as Bart's in London, Mt.
Sinai Hospital in Toronto       and Shanghai Peoples Hospital in areas such as allergy, cardiology, gene       therapy, microbiology, oncology and wound repair, as well as industry,       e.g.
AstraZeneca, GSK, Pfizer, Roche and Unilever.
In particular, [A2] has       been cited by cardiac surgeons, epidemiologists and infectious disease       units in hospitals, microbiologists, the Health Protection Agency (now       Public Health England) and the Health Policy Research Institute in       California: this publication in a BMC journal read by clinicians and       policy-makers has led to impact on public health policy (see below).
Two specific examples detailed below further illustrate the scope of the       impact of CMMB's work:     Software development for clinical and industrial use: UoN work in       the late 1990s on tumour growth (e.g.
[A1]) inspired a topic at the first       MMSG in 2000, on the effects of a new anti-tumour drug.
This was taken       further with Sheffield Medical School and led to a patent filed in 2007       and published in 2009 (tinyurl.com/kdnhb3d).
Following this and similar successes, CMMB members made founding       contributions to the open source C++ library for computational biology       `Chaste' (Cancer Heart and Soft Tissue Environment), UoN leading the       cancer strand on the EPSRC grant eScience Pilot Project in Integrative         Biology, GR/S72023/01, 2004-2008 that funded UoN researchers Inge       van Leeuwen, Gary Mirams and Alex Walter.
Mirams, now at Oxford, continued       to work on Chaste with academic and industrial partners, participating in       producing the first public release in 2009.
A 2013 review prepared in collaboration with partners such as Microsoft       Research UK and Fujitsu Laboratories of Europe Ltd stated: "A number         of other groups are using Chaste for a large variety of simulations...         the effects of radiation on tissue (Shaowen Hu, NASA); ...cardiac         electrophysiological modelling (US Food and Drug Administration);         drug-induced changes to cardiac rhythm (Safety Pharmacology,         GlaxoSmithKline)..." [B5].
Mirams adds that: "A Chaste         simulation tool is now in use by GlaxoSmithKline Safety Pharmacology         teams in the UK and USA.
... A recent paper [B7] evaluates how well this         tool predicts the results of later animal-based safety tests that are         performed at GlaxoSmithKline with a view to 3Rs benefits."
and       further that: "This work has led directly to the US drug regulators         (Food &amp; Drug Administration, FDA) including a simulation aspect in         their proposed replacement for an expensive ... human trial for         pro-arrhythmic side effects ..." [B6]     Influence on public health policy: Work undertaken by O'Neill and       Kypraios on MRSA stimulated UK Government policy debate and led to a       review of the current screening policy.
Dr Julie Robotham (Public Health       England) stated: "...your [Kypraios'] work directly informed the         model-based evaluation of MRSA control policies, undertaken for the         Department of Health (DoH), England" and "... [A2] was critical in that         it represented the only study able to provide direct estimates of the         effectiveness of contact precautions in reducing MRSA transmission...it         enables the national policy of MRSA screening to be evaluated with more         realistic estimates of how much benefit MRSA screening can actually         provide."
[B8].
The research suggested that the current national MRSA screening policy in       England was unlikely to be cost-effective [B9].
Whilst a change in policy       itself is still under discussion with the DoH, Robotham stated that this       finding: "generated discussions both nationally ... and         internationally ..." and moreover caused the DoH to commission "...         a direct follow on to this work such that a cost-effectiveness         evaluation at a national level, including a national MRSA audit, could         be conducted.
This follow on project, whilst using previous estimates,         also used more up-to-date estimates, including estimates taken directly         from your study Estimating the effectiveness of isolation and         decolonization measures in reducing transmission of         methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospital general wards.

Again, these estimates represented the best         available evidence, and directly informed the cost-effectiveness model."
In addition, Kypraios presented his work on avian influenza (to model and       predict in real-time spread of a potential epidemic in the UK poultry       industry) to Professor Sir John Beddington as UK Government Chief       Scientific Adviser 2008-2013.
