     "I am delighted to confirm the essential role of Chemistry research in         the formation and growth of Atlas Genetics.
Atlas is building a world         class diagnostics company based on technology for the electrochemical         detection of specific sequences of DNA.
The underpinning research was         carried out in collaboration with Professor Frost [and team] in the         Chemistry Department at Bath" [A]     Impacts from this work: company, investment, people and a new         technology            A spin-out or new business has generated revenue or profits (Atlas           Genetics; &gt;&#163;18M new investment in REF period)       Highly skilled people having taken up specialist roles that draw on         their research (Atlas staff expansion from 12 to 36, largely in           technical scientific roles, including three recruited from Bath at         doctoral level)       A new diagnostic or medical technology has been developed (the io&#8482;         platform &amp;trade trialled in the USA and EU; successful clinical           trialling)          Economic, Wealth and Opportunity Creation       The research carried out in Bath Chemistry, and the development of the key       technology of the electrochemical sensor [B], resulted in the formation         of Atlas Genetics in 2005, to exploit commercially the technology       originating from the University of Bath.
Atlas was launched with &#163;500k       initial funding, 50% of which came from the Sulis Seedcorn Fund,       established by the University of Bath to provide support for new       businesses.
Prior to the REF period, in 2007 Atlas completed Series A       financing of &#163;2 million and the company relocated from the University to a       2,500 sq.
ft. site on a business park close to Bath (Trowbridge,       Wiltshire).
The number of full time staff increased to 12 and a commercial       programme to develop the Atlas system io&#8482; was initiated.
Atlas [C] is currently venture capital funded and to date has           raised ca.
&#163;22m, including a &#163;16.9M investment in July         2011, specifically to develop the io&#8482; system and a       molecular Chlamydia test.
Atlas investors include YFM, South West Ventures       Fund, Finance South West Growth Fund, Braveheart Ventures, Sulis       Investment Management Fund, GEIF Ventures, Consort Medical plc, Novartis       Venture Funds, Life Sciences Partners, BB Biotech Ventures and Johnson       &amp; Johnson Development Corporation and private investors [D].
Atlas has       recently expanded its office and laboratory provision to 9,500 sq.
ft. and       currently employs a total of 36 permanent staff, representing an increase         of 24 in the REF period, the majority of whom have higher education       qualifications in science (MSc/PhD), engineering (BEng/MEng) or business       (MBA).
The company has continued to invest in the research and development of       new reagents and electrochemistry technology with the establishment of a       new post for a senior chemist, who spends 3 days/week at Bath and 2       days/week at Atlas.
Professors Frost and Marken are both engaged as       consultants by Atlas Genetics.
The Route to Clinical Implementation       Atlas' proprietary io&#8482; system enables the sensitivity and       accuracy of laboratory testing to be achieved in a point-of-care       environment.
The io&#8482; system will initially be launched for the       testing of Chlamydia [E], allowing clinicians to test and treat patients       in a single appointment.
Around 40 million tests are carried out for this       and related diseases in Europe and the US every year.
According to the       European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health       Organisation [F], Chlamydia is the most frequently reported bacterial       sexually transmitted infection (STI), causing an estimated 92 million new       cases of genital Chlamydia infection annually and prevalence rates in       young people between 5-10% [F].
Rapid diagnosis is key to preventing       disease spread.
The electrochemical technology at the core of the Atlas io&#8482;       tests offer a time-to-result turnaround of less than 30 minutes, which is       within the acceptable waiting period for a point-of-care diagnostic test       result.
The "test and treat" approach offers significant benefits to the       wider population and could include a decrease of onward transmission and       new infections.
To establish the validity of the prototype assays, Atlas       have collaborated with Professor Charlotte Gaydos of the Johns Hopkins       University Medical School (Baltimore, USA; [G]) to evaluate the io&#8482;       system technology for Chlamydia detection on 306 patient samples,       showing a sensitivity of 98.1% and specificity of 98.0% using the       prototype io&#8482; Chlamydia trachomatis assay.
This is       comparable with that of existing commercial nucleic acid amplification       tests (the slower, lab-based and non-point of care, tests Gen-Probe Aptima       Combo 2&#8482; and the Roche Cobas Amplicor&#8482; were used as       comparator tests).
[H, I].
These impressive clinical test results         support the adoption of the Atlas io&#8482; tests in clinical         environments.
Clinical trials with Public Health England (PHE) for the Atlas io&#8482;       platform and Chlamydia detection product commence in late 2013 with final       formal clinical evaluation in March 2014.
The platform launches in Europe       with CE certification in 2014, followed by roll-out in the US.
Technology for Widening Diagnostic Reach: The in vitro       diagnostics (IVD) market is $42 billion and growing at 6% annum, the most       rapidly growing areas are molecular diagnostics (valued at $3b and growing       at 15% pa) and the point-of-care market (valued at $2.5b and growing at       12% pa); the WHO estimates that 499 milliion new STI infections occur each       year [J].
Due to the platform nature of the io&#8482; system,       Atlas have developed the technology (by commissioning of new bespoke       Chemistry from Bath [A]) for a panel of other tests in development to       expand their STI test portfolio, including, a duplex test for       Chlamydia/Gonorrhoea (anticipated clinical trials in 2014) and Trichomonas       (the most prevalent curable STI in the world, causing an estimated 248       million new cases annually of genital T. vaginalis infection).
The       Atlas io&#8482; Trichomonas vaginalis prototype test has been       evaluated at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School.
In this       published study [G], clinical sample testing demonstrated a sensitivity of       95.5% and specificity of 95.7%; these are comparable with that of existing       central laboratory nucleic acid amplification tests used for screening       patients for T. vaginalis.
In 2010 Atlas started work on an       immunoassay programme to expand the capabilities of the electrochemical       detection platform with a Regional Development Agency grant for the       development of a Syphilis assay.
The development of redox-active       substrates for electrochemical immunoassays and a novel method for signal       amplification are being carried out by a directly-funded PhD student in       the Frost group at Bath.
Atlas is also developing a rapid test cartridge       for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) for       near-patient testing in high dependency and intensive care units, and       other targeted clinical settings.
This test further expands the scope for       the Atlas electrochemical detection method by employing the technology in       a quantitative PCR (qPCR) based system.
