     Museum practice: Embryos in Wax has stimulated many       medical, anatomical, zoological, and embryological museums and institutes       internationally to catalogue and effectively display permanent collections       of Ziegler models that previously languished unlabelled in store       cupboards.
By providing an accessible illustrated history, photographs of       almost all models, tabulated information and extensive documentation, it       has enabled curators to label and contextualize once-nondescript objects.
As a result many institutes engage with their own histories by exhibiting       the oldest objects routinely to have survived on their premises.
The       initial impact was between 2002 and 2008, but has continued strongly as       new institutions make use.
Recent examples include Oxford University       Museum of Natural History (2008), Birmingham Medical School (2011), the       Alfred Denny Museum, Sheffield (2011) and a major new database of German       university collections (2010-12) [1].
At Oxford, Hopwood's work       was `absolutely crucial' to stimulating and justifying the expense of a       project to catalogue, conserve and properly house about 90 models that       were `forgotten' and now have `scientific specimen status' [2].
At       Birmingham and Sheffield, Embryos in Wax also enabled the models       to be displayed in a wider context to students and the general public.
At       the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Washington, D.C., one of the       world's premier collections with some 50,000 visitors a year, Embryos         in Wax and Making Visible Embryos have regularly provided       curators, interns and their clients with information to aid identification       and contextualization.
Making Visible Embryos directly informed       the choice of several images and their interpretation in the new permanent       display (2012) [3].
The research further shaped such major       temporary exhibitions as `Exquisite Bodies' at Wellcome Collection, London       (July-October 2009), for which Hopwood acted as a consultant [4].
Embryos in Wax was read by the lead curator, directed the choice of       exhibits, informed the loan of Ziegler models and was made available in a       reading area, bibliography and bookshop to the 52,667 visitors [5].
Embryos in Wax is also used in auction catalogues [6].
Public engagement and debate: Making Visible Embryos has       stimulated discussion and use of historic embryo images.
Google analytics       counted approximately 36,000 (29,000 unique) visitors between October 2008       and October 2012, 13,500 from USA and 6,500 from Britain, with interest       sustained through 2011 and 2012 [7].
Specific impacts include: a       review at jezebel.com, the major postfeminist critique site (1.5M visits       per month in 2010) that generated several pages of comments on uses of       embryo images in abortion debates [8]; bloggers, other writers and       academics copying selected images and adding their own comments or       histories; schoolchildren using the site for projects; and use by       embryologists, sonographers and others to provide a historical perspective       on their work.
Hopwood's Isis article intervened authoritatively       in the international controversy in evolutionary developmental biology,       and especially in the United States between creationists and evolutionists       over Haeckel's embryos, to improve the quality of evidence and argument.
E.g., it has been cited since 2008 on the website of the leading       anticreationist organization, the National Center for Science Education,       as a `comprehensive' investigation that rebuts claims of fraud [9].
Teaching: The research has enriched undergraduate and postgraduate       teaching at other HEIs by opening up new topics and approaches in HPSM and       neighbouring fields.
Since 2009, for example, the `Visualising Science'       module of the University of Kent Science communication MSc has included a       session on embryo images, using Making Visible Embryos as the main       resource and Embryos in Wax and other work by Hopwood as key       readings [10].
Innovatively, Embryos in Wax and Models       have not only brought the history of 3-D models as a topic into the       higher-education curriculum&#8212;chapters from Models feature on many       reading lists internationally (e.g., a history of medicine survey,       University of Toronto)&#8212;they have also inspired collections-based       pedagogical projects.
At the HPS Centre at Leeds, for example, Embryos         in Wax has since 2007 `been central to our ways of thinking about       our collection', which in 2012 was built up into a Museum of the History       of Science, Technology and Medicine [11].
Thanks to Embryos in         Wax, Ziegler models&#8212;previously all but unknown to       non-specialists&#8212;have become `the flagship objects' in this teaching       collection, and the book `has typically been the first port of call for       students conducting collections research and has greatly informed their       thinking' [12].
Through student projects the book `involved       students in new kinds of learning about conservation, display [and]       research'.
Hopwood's research inspired a regular third-year philosophy of       biology seminar at Leeds, in which undergraduates have been shown Ziegler       models and asked to `consider [their] relations to evidence, theory,       medical education and practice ... [and] the craft and business of       model-making.'
It is `unusual for [such a] course to incorporate the       material heritage of science'; at Leeds, `it had never happened before ...       it happened ... thanks to [Hopwood's] work' [13, 14].
