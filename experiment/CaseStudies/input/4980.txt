     Statins are the preferred lipid-lowering drugs to prevent CVD     Current estimates suggest that more than 7,000 European and US adults die       of CVD each day.
Internationally recognised clinical trials conducted by       the University of Glasgow have provided the cornerstone of the evidence       base supporting lipid lowering as a strategy to reduce CVD risk.
This       landmark research drove the global adoption of statins as the first-line       medical option for prevention of CVD and continues to shape modern day       lipid-lowering guidance and practice worldwide, with associated benefits       for patients and healthcare systems.
Statins offer major benefits for       patient outcomes, including reduction in mortality and major CVD events.
Clinical guidelines support prevention strategies with statins     The University of Glasgow led/steering committee involvement in RCTs on       lipid lowering1,2,3,5,6 dominate the evidence base in current,       high profile clinical guidelines on lipid lowering including the joint       European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society       (EAS ) and the American Association of Clinical       Endocrinologists (AACE).
These guidelines recommend statins as the       cholesterol-lowering drug of choice.
2011 ESC/EAS guideline on the management of dyslipidaemiasa     These state that `not only should those at high risk be identified and         managed; those at moderate risk should also receive professional advice         regarding lifestyle changes, and in some cases drug therapy will be         needed to control their plasma lipids.'
The guidelines also       underscore the need to promote primary prevention efforts.
Recommendations for the use of statins among patients who have been         stratified according to CVD risk (via assessment with the ESC         Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE] algorithm) and LDL-C level &#8212;         WOSCOPS1, PROSPER3, ASCOT-LLA5, JUPITER6         and TNT are cited in the evidence base; Table 3 (p1780).
In summary the         ESC/EAS recommends immediate lipid-lowering intervention for all         individuals at high risk (SCORE &gt;5 but &lt;10) with LDL-C levels &#8805;2.5         mmol/L or at very high risk (SCORE &#8805;10; LDL-C &#8805;1.8 mmol/L).
Lipid-lowering may be considered in both groups at lower LDL-C levels         and among low-risk and moderate-risk individuals with LDL-C levels         uncontrolled by lifestyle intervention.
ASCOT-LLA5 and JUPITER6 are two of three papers         cited to support the following recommendation on primary prevention "statin           therapy should be considered for reducing the risk of ischaemic stroke           and other CV events in accordance with the recommendations given in           Table 3."
2012 AACE guideline on the management of dyslipidaemia and prevention         of atherosclerosisb            `Lipid goals recommended for patients at risk of coronary artery         disease' &#8212; PROSPER and ASCOT-LLA underpin five of these seven key         recommendations including lowering LDL-C to less than 100 mg/dL (2.6         mmol/L) for all adults and below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) for patients at         very high risk (Grade A recommendation); p13-14 and Table 12.
Taken together, the ESC/EAS and AACE lipid management guidelines advise       that adults with a 20% chance of developing CVD within a 10-year timespan       should be offered a statin for primary prevention.
Furthermore, statins       are unequivocally recommended for individuals considered to be at very       high risk; namely, patients with diabetes (if aged over 40 years), chronic       kidney disease or peripheral arterial disease, as well as those who have       previously experienced a CVD event.
These recommendations on lipid       lowering are also aligned in the major European and American guidelines on       CVD prevention reinforcing the value of lipid lowering in disease       prevention.
Cochrane Systematic Review       Despite the fact that there have been many subsequent clinical trials       investigating statin use, the validity and profile of the seminal       University of Glasgow studies in driving best practice for patient care       remain undiminished.
These trials are regularly included in meta-analyses,       such as the Cochrane Systematic Reviews, which evaluate primary clinical       research and are recognised as the gold standard for providing an evidence       base for changing clinical practice.
For example, a meta-analysis       conducted by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaboration,       which was published in 2010 and utilised the University of Glasgow       studies, was instrumental in changing the recommendations of the Cochrane       Systematic Review on the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD       (2013).c The 2013 evidence review stated: "our previous         conclusion urging caution in the use of statins in people at low risk of         CV events is no longer tenable in light of the CTT Collaboration         findings ... these new findings counter earlier opinion that the         evidence is insufficient to support use of statins in primary prevention         for women or in older men."
The 2013 Cochrane Systematic Review also       cited WOSCOPS1 and JUPITER6 in the evidence base       supporting this conclusion, with JUPITER6 identified as one of       four new studies included in the analysis.c     Primary prevention with statins provides benefits for patients     Reduced mortality       The WOSCOPS follow-up study2 showed that primary prevention       with statins exerted durable, long-term reduction in death rates.
US       estimates revealed that deaths as a result of CVD declined by       approximately 33% from 1999 to 2009.d The 2013 American Heart       Association heart disease and stroke statistics reportd cites       evidence that lipid lowering prevents or postpones around 24% of all       deaths from CHD, equivalent to an 8.2% drop in deaths during the period       1999-2009 in the US.
Indicators of quality care       The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is an incentive scheme for GP       practices in England providing financial rewards for patient care across       multiple disease domains.
Several of these QOFs focus on primary and       secondary prevention with statins.
For example, 74% of diabetes patients,       73% of patients with CHD and 68% of stroke patients received a statin to       achieve total cholesterol levels at or below 5 mmol/L (April 2011-March       2012).e The fact that cholesterol levels are one of the best       adhered to targets is testament to the community acceptance of the       benefits of this approach.
Health checks       University of Glasgow research demonstrated that lipid lowering prevention       strategies are valid tools for public health and initiatives are now in       place worldwide to promote heart health.
For example, the US Million       Hearts programme (launched September 2011) has a stated goal to ensure       effective implementation of lipid-lowering treatment on a population       basis, from a baseline of 33% in 2011 to 65% by 2017.f Since       March 2009, vascular risk assessment has been implemented in England       through NHS Health Check.
All adults aged 40-74 years without diagnosed       CVD are invited for a health check once every 5 years for assessment of       risk factors including cholesterol level.
Personalised primary prevention       advice based on the risk assessment is provided.
In the period 2012-2013,       around 1.3 million eligible adults attended assessments.f     Emergence of generic statins drives down cost of primary prevention     The detailed extension of the WOSCOPS follow-up4 demonstrated       that CVD prevention with statins had saved money for healthcare providers       even at levels below the 20% risk of CVD listed in current clinical       guidelines.
The economic viability of statin use shown by this analysis       attracted extensive media coverage, raising public awareness of this       strategy.g More than 60 million statin prescriptions were       dispensed in England alone in 2012, and the global statin market was       valued at $20.5 billion in 2011.
However, the increasing availability of       generic formulations of statins is predicted to eat into this market.h       Consequently, use of statins will become even more prevalent and cost       effective for healthcare organisations.4
