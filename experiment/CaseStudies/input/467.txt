     Impacts derive from a long term concerted molecular and classical       research programme led by the UoL which has directly led to improved       protection of poultry against serious disease, thus improving the       efficiency of meat and egg production.
The beneficiaries are the protected       animals in terms of animal welfare, poultry farmers globally in terms of       economic efficiency and the general public in terms of economic high       quality protein availability from meat and eggs, i.e.
food security.
Economic and health impacts     The Liverpool vaccine has been important in global AMPV control.
It is       one of only two subtype A live vaccines used globally.
Its profile is       summarised in the DEFRA 2012 summary sheet [7].The continued use of the       vaccine is enhanced by the Liverpool team's on-going research into its       applications and usage, thus helping ensure the product's safety and       efficacious use.
It is only the effective application AMPV vaccine in       hatcheries and on farms that prevents the severe disease and losses seen       prior to vaccine introduction.
UoL researchers have been key to       maintaining this major impact on disease protection in a major food       species.
Eight million doses of the vaccine were sold in Europe, Africa       and the Middle East in the last financial year, much comprising UK turkeys       (production approx 17 million per year) and to a lesser extent in France.
This is a 20% sales increase over the previous year, an indication of both       the importance of the disease and the performance of the vaccine.
The       figure does not include Asia/Pacific and South America (particularly       Brazil) which are the biggest markets for the vaccine.
The Liverpool team's on-going research has allowed for the development of       improved guidelines allowing the poultry industry to protect essential       food production and maximise profit.
[9,10,12,13]     Vaccine developments arising from the UoL research that have had an       impact on the industry primarily by increasing effectiveness of the use of       the vaccine since 2008 have included:            Demonstration of reversion to virulence on farms of the Zoetis clone K         vaccine in 2006 led to the UoL demonstrating in 2011 that such reverted         virus could circulate in the environment and in 2012 to the UoL's         demonstration that a Merial subtype B vaccine could also revert to         virulence on farms.
The Liverpool group now advises at national (British         Veterinary Poultry Association) and international (World Veterinary         Poultry Association) poultry veterinary meetings that all AMPV vaccines         should be administered more effectively so as to avoid unvaccinated         birds becoming infected with potentially reverting shed vaccine virus.
Changes of farming practice resulted, especially in Europe.
More careful         vaccine application became the standard, so as to avoid residual         unvaccinated birds being infected with vaccine shed from littermates.
Furthermore, multi-age-site-farms have fallen out of usage because of         the greater level of susceptibility of young birds to any vaccine virus         passaged in the environment.
As a result, the current MSD product advice         relating to their AMPV Nobilis TRT live vaccine, states "The vaccine           virus spreads and shows some reversion to virulence on bird to bird           passage.
For these reasons its use is not recommended on multi-age           sites.
Correct administration is important ..." [8,9,10,12,13].
The UoL discovered that maternal antibody did not block vaccination.
This led to adoption of one-day-old hatchery vaccination where         previously, administration had been later on the farm.
This is         formalised in the DEFRA summary sheet for the Liverpool developed clone         K vaccine (Zoetis, Poulvac TRT) [7 (page 1),9].
The question of matching AMPV vaccine subtype (A or B) to the         prevalent field subtype has been debated since the discovery of subtypes         in 1993.
Some parties, especially vaccine manufacturers, downplayed the         issue, even though introduction of subtype B vaccine to the UK in 1995         to combat the first UK incidences of subtype B, led to a large         improvement in disease control (based on research by Naylor while at IAH         Compton).
More influentially, from 2008 to 2010 Liverpool/Bologna         studies (published 2010) conclusively proved that even small differences         within a subtype had large effects on induced protection [2].
Currently         AMPV vaccines of the correct subtype are favoured where the dominating         field subtype is known [11].
The UoL showed in 2010 that the continuous use of a single AMPV         vaccine (Merial Aviffa/Rhinovax) in Italy had led to evolution of field         viruses in circulation which avoided previously protective immunity.
This showed that exclusive use of a single vaccine type should be         avoided and work has been presented to Italian veterinarians advising         avoiding this practice who now avoid this practice where possible [9].
For some time it had been noticed that following vaccination the AMPV         antibody might be absent, even though field survey evidence suggested         that the birds were protected.
Without the UoL's discovery that an AMPV         induced antibody responses was irrelevant to protection and frequently         absent, the use of AMPV vaccines might have much reduced, thus reducing         disease control [13].
In ovo vaccination proved effective in producing an earlier         onset of immunity.
At the present time commercial restrictions have         limited this to approach to small scale use [9].
