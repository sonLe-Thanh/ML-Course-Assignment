             Reach: Benefits veterinarians, dog owners and companion dogs in         the UK and Europe;         animal drug development industry R&amp;D.        Significance: Offers the first set of validated tools for vets         and dog owners to assess acute         and chronic pain, allowing more timely, appropriate and compassionate         treatment.
Pain assessment in animals presents a challenge for clinicians because of       the inherent       communication difficulties but also because different animals and species       respond differently to       pain.
The CMPS was the first statistically constructed and validated acute       pain scale for dogs in       surgical and clinical settings, incorporating a structured and objective       approach to pain       assessment.
It has been used in clinical trials, was subsequently       streamlined into the CMPS Short       Form (CMPS-SF), and includes an intervention level for the administration       of analgesic relief.
The       CMPS was first circulated through a comprehensive programme of CPD       conducted by Reid and       Nolan, but was later made available as an online tool.
The CMPS acute pain       scale is available for       open-access download from the University of Glasgow website [a].
Since       2008, the CMPS has       been downloaded by 3266 non-academic users worldwide.
Once downloaded the       CMPS can be       copied (thus download data are likely to underestimate usage by this       route).
It has been translated       into Italian (2010) for use in clinical trials, as validated pain       measurement methods are required for       the development and licensing of new animal analgesic drugs.
The unique means by which the CMPS can define an intervention threshold       for administering pain       relief has resulted in its inclusion in a number of textbooks,       establishing it as a standard reference       for measuring pain for both teaching and veterinary practice.
It has also       featured in key pain       management handbooks for practitioners such as the Handbook of         Veterinary Pain Management       (2008) and Anaesthesia for Veterinary Technicians (2010) [b].
In       2009, the Glasgow Pain and       Welfare Research Group (Scott, Nolan and Reid) won the Universities       Federation for Animal       Welfare inaugural Companion Animal Welfare Award [c], which recognises       `significant innovations       or advances for the welfare of companion animals'.
The CMPS acute pain scale has been used by many of the market-leading       veterinary healthcare       companies in clinical trials and regulatory application for novel       analgesics.
This included Merial,       Novartis Animal Health Inc., Vetoquinol, Dechra and Animalcare.
The       following applications have       gained regulatory approval based on data obtained with the CMPS:            2008, Merial Ltd.&#8212; approval from the US Food and Drug Administration         (FDA) for `previcox' in         dogs following orthopaedic surgery.
2011 &#8212; approval from the European Medicines Agency for `Recuvyra' in         dogs following         orthopaedic surgery.
2011 Novartis Animal Health US Inc. &#8212; approval from the FDA for         `DERAMAXX' in dogs         following dental surgery.
2012, Nexcyon Pharmaceuticals Inc. &#8212; approval from the FDA for         `Recuvyra' in dogs following         general surgery.

Vetoquinol is the 10th largest veterinary pharmaceutical       company in the world.
Since mid-2012, its       UK subsidiary has been using the CMPS acute pain scale as marketing       support for their range of       pain medications, including Cimalgex&#174;.
Vetoquinol specifically       chose the CMPS acute pain scale       because:     it is scientifically validated and well known in the UK whilst being         simple to use....it was         recommended to us by various veterinary surgeons throughout the UK.
The Vetoquinol CMPS acute pain scale marketing support materials were a       major focus of their       Cimalgex&#174; promotional activities at the London Vet Show (November       2012) and British Small       Animal Veterinary Association Congress exhibition (April 2013).
The success of CMPS is reflected in its use as a standard tool in wider       developments.
CMPS itself       is now being used in a wider range of disease conditions, including       obesity [A] and cancer       (publication in preparation).
It has now also led to the creation of       similar practical tools for welfare       assessment in farm animals (cows and pigs), for use by owners or stockmen       [B].
New research,       funded by Pfizer, has also created an acute pain instrument for cats       which, for the first time in this       species, includes facial shape and expression, based on an in-depth       landmark study of cats' faces.
The GUVQuest tool for the assessment of chronic pain in dogs can be used       by non-clinicians such       as animal owners and is informing decisions on euthanasia, treatment or       cancer therapy.
It has       been exploited commercially by Newmetrica Ltd, through a University of       Glasgow Easy Access IP       agreement, for provision as an online tool which provides users with       automated output.
This online       version of the tool has been licensed to a number of individuals and       companies for use in obesity,       cancer and arthritis clinical trials.
