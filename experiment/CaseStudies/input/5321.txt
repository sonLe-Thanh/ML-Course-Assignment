     Impacts include: commercial       Main beneficiaries include: industrial partners     Since 2008, Circassia has raised &#163;98 million to establish its viability       as a spin-out company.
Circassia employs 25 highly skilled people in house       and an estimated 200 others through its outsourced business model.
Established the viability of spin-out company:       Circassia's pipeline platform technology is applicable to all       immunological disorders involving a recognised antigen and products have       been given the trademark "ToleroMune".
Due to good progress in early Phase       II clinical trials developing a cat allergy vaccine (ToleroMune Cat),       Circassia Ltd was able to announce in January 2008 that it had       successfully raised &#163;11 million ($21.8 million) in an oversubscribed       second round funding [1], having completed an initial investment round of       &#163;6 million ($11.8 million) the previous year.
The investment syndicate was       led by Imperial Innovations and included Landsdowne Partners, Tudor       Capital, Goldman Sachs and Invesco Perpetual.
Further successful Phase II       cat studies were completed during 2009 and a ragweed allergy vaccine       (ToleroMune Ragweed) Phase II study initiated.
These positive results led       to a third investment round of &#163;15 million ($25 million) in December 2009       [2].
By 2010 Circassia had initiated clinical trials in house dust mite       allergy [3] and achieved a positive result in Phase II studies with the       ragweed allergy vaccine.
Shortly after Circassia announced that it had       been granted European Composition of Matter Patents for three of the       company's lead allergy T-Cell vaccines (cat, house dust mite and grass)       [4].
They extended the period of patent protection for cat and house dust       mite allergies until 2028 and for grass allergy treatment until 2022 [6].
In 2010 Circassia completed a &#163;60 million ($98 million) fourth round       fundraising for final-stage development of its lead allergy products.
The       investment, scheduled in two tranches over the following two years, was       the second largest fundraising by a privately-held European       biopharmaceutical company that year, and the third largest in more than 15       years [5].
The award, to Circassia, of European patents for key peptides       in grass and ragweed allergy therapies was granted in 2011 [6] and       extended the products' period of protection to 2022 and 2029 respectively.
By April 2012 Circassia was able to draw on &#163;35 million ($56 million) from       investors after meeting key developmental milestones and also completed an       additional &#163;12 million ($19 million) fundraising for late-stage       development of its allergy product pipeline [7].
By 2011 the company had data to show that the treatment effect of its cat       allergy vaccine not only persists but increases 24 months after       commencement of treatment and 21 months after the last dose [8].
Thus, the       treatment effect achieved by ToleroMune Cat technology is unparalleled by       any other form of treatment for perennial allergic rhinitis and the safety       and tolerability are indistinguishable from placebo.
In October 2012 a phase III study was initiated involving 85 clinical       sites across the USA, Canada and Europe enrolling 1186 patients in the       largest single field study ever undertaken in immunotherapy [9].
This       followed an "end of Phase II meeting" with the US Food and Drug       Administration, Scientific Advice from the European Medicines Agency and       regulatory guidance from Health Canada, informing the path to registration       in each territory.
Employment creation       Circassia Holdings Limited is currently based at The Science Park, Oxford.
It is managed by a strong team of life science entrepreneurs and       scientists, and from 2007-2013 was chaired by Sir Richard Sykes, the       former Chairman of GlaxoSmithKline and former Rector of Imperial College.
The company currently employs 25 highly skilled people in-house and has an       outsourced business model.
This outsourced business model enables the       company to benefit from the best skilled people in the world and in 2012       alone &#163;23.6 million was spent on R&amp;D organisations supporting the       employment of an estimated 200 people [10].
