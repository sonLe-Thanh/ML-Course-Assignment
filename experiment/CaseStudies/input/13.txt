     Our research has made a significant impact and influenced the innovation       decision-making process across Europe in a number of tangible ways,       including new policy programmes affecting EC innovation funding for HTSFs       in Horizon 2020 and EU member states, as well as contributing to the       European-wide adoption of novel high-tech innovations.
A wide range of       beneficiaries have been affected, including SMEs, SME support agencies,       innovation development agencies, European Commission, European Parliament       and international business alliances, as evidenced by factual statements       from influential national and European stakeholders (1 - 5 &#8212;       numbers in bold refer to evidence in Section 5).
The international reach of European-wide HTSF policy       recommendations has extended to the highest echelons of EC       decision-making, including the European Commission (1,2,6,7) and       European Parliament (1,8).
Policy developments targeting HTSF       innovation adoption covered all EU member states.
SMEs were extensively       engaged through the creation of a 100-member European SME Experts Panel       with the support of influential MEPs (7 &#8212; p7), EC officials and EU       innovation bodies such as Enterprise Europe Network, Eureka, Nessi (7         &#8212; p22) and the European Network of Living Labs (5).
A       summary of the evidence of impacts and indicators is provided in Table 1.

(4)                          The 15 major EC policy recommendations on the design, implementation of       HTSF funding programmes and exploitation of innovation outputs (7       &#8212; pp.73-85), directly impacted beneficiaries such as the European       Parliament, economic ministries in all EU member states, a range of HTSF       clusters, associations and networks (1,6).
In addition, our HTSF       innovation policy findings were fed into the development of Horizon 2020 (1,2)       and the EC Green Paper &#8212; Common Strategic Framework (http://mapeer-sme.eu/news-and-events/news/2011/05/the-european-experts-panel-         on-smes-and-research-contributed-to-the-green-paper-on-future-eu).
The key issues that were addressed in the HTSF innovation policy       recommendations were how to remove barriers for HTSFs when designing and       implementing HTSF funding programmes and practical ways to support HTSFs       commercialise and exploit their results after the project lifecycle has       expired.
A senior EC official (DG Research European Commission) endorsed       our policy recommendations, stating that they `will greatly contribute         to SME's special attention in FP8' (8).
The adoption of our       policy recommendations (7 &#8212; p82) contributed to the       inclusion of new financial instruments benefitting SMEs proposed in early       drafts of Horizon 2020 (see COSME in Table 1) that offers equity and loan       guarantee facilities for SMEs (1).
Another senior official at the       EC (DG Research and Innovation) concluded that the research "produced         a number of significant and scientific reports that have benefit for EU         and national policy makers, programme managers, SME organisations and         associations, and SMEs (6).
The EC further singled out the `unique         impact' (6) of the large-scale research reports on barriers       which SMEs experience in getting involved in R&amp;D and innovation       funding initiatives at national and EU level and identified best practice       elements amongst programme clusters, stating: "This is a significant         achievement as it is the first time that this information has been         collected and analysed, allowing comparisons to be made between member         states, and each country can compare its position with the EU average"       (6).
For example, there have been considerable entry barriers for       HTSFs in public procurement, and in our best practice reports we       identified exemplar SME-focused HTSF funding policy programmes, such as       the SBIR programme in Holland and the UK, that offer policy makers in       depth instructions on how to replicate these programmes for widespread       adoption (7 &#8212; p80).
We also addressed this adoption barrier       for HTSFs in public procurement in a practical way, by developing bespoke       methodologies for healthcare procurement bodies to make the procurement       process, particularly for HTSFs less cumbersome (4).
The lowering of innovation barriers for HTSFs has greatly enhanced the       international impact of this multidisciplinary high-tech       innovation adoption research &#8212; leading to endorsement from the EC as a       European exemplar of high-tech adoption, through its publication as a case       study on the ECs prestigious 114,000 member ePractice website (9).
A spinout of this multidisciplinary research collaboration that also       involved the Institution's School of Computing and Mathematics and School       of Health Sciences was the development of the `Engage' innovation       eParticipation software tool (10).
This innovation was pivotal to       ensuring eParticipation adoption in the UK market and was validated by end       user acceptance of over 94% of 380 end users in eight consultation events,       including an Open Data consultation for the UK Cabinet Office (9).
The `Engage' invention was released on an open source licence on       the EC's Joinup open source website, which has dramatically       increased the reach and benefits as the Engage       software is free for everyone to use.
The release of Engage under an open       source licence has paved the way for wider adoption of the innovation in       Europe, as Engage was used as the primary eParticipation technology in a       winning tender by an Italian HTSF to conduct eight consultations for a       regional government in Italy (3).
