     Imperial spinout EMcision Ltd licensed the Habib 4X to RITA Medical [A],       which was then acquired by AngioDynamics, a global, NASDAQ-listed public       company employing 1,400 people in the USA, Europe and Asia; it is the       market leader in RF ablation.
The terms of the 2005 agreement, which has       remained in place throughout the 2008-2013 assessment period, included an       upfront payment of $50,000, a payment of $200,000 upon 510(k) regulatory       approval by the FDA, and royalty payments based upon specific revenue       targets.
RITA also issued EMcision 150,000 unregistered shares of RITA       common stock at the signing of the agreement and paid EMcision $500,000 on       the first anniversary of the agreement.
As part of the licensing deal, the       Habib 4X will be made available to developing countries in Africa at cost       price.
Between April 1st 2007 and June 30th 2013,       AngioDynamics sold 23,723 Habib 4X units with a total value of US$48M       throughout Europe, the USA and Canada, widely in Latin America, in Asia       and the Pacific (China, Russia India, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Japan,       Saudi Arabia, Gulf States and Israel), and in some African countries [B].
Pro rata, approximately 20,000 units (US$40M value) will have been       sold during the REF period.
Since it is a single use device, this means       that the reach of this part of the impact is 20,000 patients,       equivalent to roughly half of all liver resections in the USA.
(Resections       are used in 20% of liver cancer operations.)
The clinical significance is apparent from the following table       (derived from references C-F):                                           Conventional liver 		   resection             n=80 [C], [D]           Habib 4X             Initial studyM             n=62 [E]           Habib 4X             Later study             n=311 [F]                             Total mortality           7.5%           0%           3.4%                             Complications           43%           18%           21%                             ICU/HDU admission           85%           0%           4%                             Blood transfusion           49%           2%           5%                             Post op stay           19 days           8 days           12 days                             Pringle or TVE*           76%           0%           0%                             Bile leak           9%           0%           2%                          *Pringle or TVE are procedures to isolate the liver from its blood supply     For example, the reduction in mortality from 7.5% to 3.4% equates to 820       lives saved.
(The difference between the figures for total mortality in       columns 2 and 3 is thought to represent the involvement of less senior       surgeons as the technique became more routine.)
At least 4,416 fewer       patients suffered complications.
The reduction in the cost of blood       transfusions derives not only from the smaller number of patients       requiring one but also the reduced volume of blood needed for those who       do.
Similarly, the reduction in cost of the postoperative stay derives not       only from the shorter stay (12 vs 19 days on average) but also from the       fact that it is 81% less likely to involve the Intensive Care Unit or       Higher Dependency Unit &#8212; that is, 16,200 fewer patients required such       care.
The device has thus had a large clinical impact.
When the first 100       patients were followed up over a period of between 2 and 20 months,       tumours had not returned in any of them [G].
Furthermore, the device has       enabled surgeons to remove smaller parts of the liver than would otherwise       have been practicable [F].
Additional evidence of clinical benefit for       liver and renal procedures is provided in reference [H].
The reach of the research is increased because other types of       cancer can also benefit.
The device is used not only in liver resection       but also in resection of kidney, lung, pancreas, spleen and uterine       fibroids.
In a recent study [I], for example, 90 patients underwent open       nephron sparing surgery, during which the surgeon resected sections of the       kidney with tumors but other portions of the treated kidney were       preserved; half were treated with the Habib 4X and half had blood flow       controlled with foam bolsters, suture ligation and Bovie electrocautery.
Significance       was substantial: 68% less blood was lost when using the Habib 4X device,       and there were 91% fewer adverse events and a 16% shorter operating time.
The other devices developed by Dickinson and colleagues have also had       significant impact.
EMcision itself markets EndoHPB, Hexablade and       VesCoag, rather than licensing them to AngioDynamics.
We consider VesCoag       as an example.
As well as reducing blood supply to tumours, it can also be       used to arrest hemorrhage following trauma or biopsy, stop bleeding in       benign disease, and occlude vessels for indications such as arterio-venous       fistulae and varicocele.
It was proven in clinical studies to be effective       in treating liver cancer when used in combination with chemo-embolisation;       it reduces the risk of embolic material complications seen in current       techniques and allows for precise occlusion of a vessel.
VesCoag had a       very high level of patient acceptability in clinical studies.
