     Pathways to Impact: Sustained and productive relationships with       research users have been cultivated at the highest levels.
Gains and       Richardson have a long-standing record of consultation and research       delivery with Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) [1]       and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) [2] around equality       and diversity.
Annesley was the national expert (UK) for the EU `Expert       Group on Gender Equality and Social Inclusion, Health and Long-Term Care       Issues' (EGGSI), producing eight reports (2008-2012) [3].
Annesley is also       on the management committee of the Women's Budget Group (WBG) "assist[ing]       the WBG in ensuring that gender equality impact analysis is applied to         fiscal policy, and that the gender dimensions of austerity policies are         addressed in public debate" [4].
Together, these engagements, at the       interface of research, advocacy and policy, have ensured broad       participation across the social scale (Opposition MPs, the media,       grassroots feminist groups and vulnerable citizens).
Critically, those       most at risk have been aided &#8212; through targeted interventions &#8212; to       apprehend and recognise the injurious nature of austerity measures, and       afforded tools to campaign against them.
Impact 1: UoM research has shaped proposals on how to improve         political diversity.
Recommendations on how local authorities can support efforts to increase       representative diversity in local government were taken up by the Roberts           Commission (the `Councillors Commission') and informed the key       recommendation that all local authorities should have a statutory duty to       promote democracy &#8212; a recommendation translated into a commitment within       the White Paper `Communities in Control Real People, Real Power' (2008).
The ensuing `Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act'       (2009) included this provision as a new `duty to promote democracy'.
The       Chair confirms this chain of events: "The Commission utilised         recommendations from the ELG report that suggested local authorities         should support efforts to increase representative diversity in local         government...
Although this duty was subsequently repealed by the         Coalition Government, it is notable that ELG research still informs         policy debate on this issue.
For example, University of Manchester         research was cited at a recent Communities and Local Government Select         Committee enquiry into `Councillors and the Community' (2012) where         evidence from the University of Manchester's Liz Richardson... cited         both ELG research, and the work of the Roberts Commission, in support of         measures to encourage renewed local authority involvement in improving         the diversity of councillor representation ...
The subsequent CLG Select         Committee report included recommendations on how councils could promote         local democracy which flowed from this...
In my view, robust research         and evidence of this nature is crucial in order to inform the policy         debate on local government and democracy more widely" [5].
This research agenda was taken forward by Gains and Richardson in work       for the EHRC, which followed the final report of the       `Speakers Conference on Parliamentary Representation' (2010) &#8212; with       research findings fed back to committee members [D].
This is confirmed by       the EHRC's Research Manager, who also adds that the research was later       cited in EHRC publications, utilised in evidence to the Office for       Disability Issues, and "knowledge of the issues raised in the report         helped inform the focus of the section of `Women in public life' in the         recent EHRC treaty submissions to the UN Committee on the Elimination of         all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)... the report has been         of value.
Overall it has contributed to both policy and research".
The report has also been utilised by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty       Commission (an NDPB chaired by Alan Milburn) and the Government Equalities       Office.
Latterly, it was cited in the influential 2013 `Sex and Power'       report, produced by a coalition of NGOs, with the report picked up by the       Observer, with Annesley quoted directly [2].
Impact 2: UoM research has contributed to ongoing work by the Women's           Budget Group (WBG) concerning the gendered impact of the         Government's austerity programme.
The scope of the research has thus       widened to consider, concomitantly, the gendered implications of public       policy.
Under the auspices of the WBG, Annesley took the lead in       formulating and writing the WBG response to the `Comprehensive Spending       Reviews' (2010, 2013) and the `Autumn Financial Statement' (2011);       contributing to several other outputs.
Likewise, Annesley contributed to       an Observer editorial which argued that "According to campaigning         groups the Fawcett Society and the Women's Budget Group, more than 70%         of the &#163;18bn cuts to social security and welfare will fall on women....         For all its failings, Labour understood the way in which targeted         support &#8212; tax credits, child benefit, childcare subsidy and jobs growth         in the public sector &#8212; benefited women, helped to reduce child poverty         and stimulated the economy".
As the WBG chair confirms: "these         contributions have been important in keeping the gender equality impacts         of fiscal policy on the agenda of government departments, public bodies         and women's organizations...
The analysis of the 2010 spending review         was submitted in evidence to the formal investigation of this Review...         and positive reference was made to this evidence in the report that the       [Equalities and Human Rights] Commission issued in May 2012.
As a         result the government accepted that Budgets and Spending Reviews must be         accompanied by an Equalities Impact Assessment".
Following this       breakthrough, Annesley continues to assist the WBG in monitoring and       suggesting refinements to these impact assessments, working closely with       the EHRC.
This impact has also been bolstered through ongoing engagement       with the media; Annesley co-writing a policy briefing on the gendered       impact of Universal Credit for the WBG, which was published as an LSE       blog.
Significantly, this was picked up (and linked to) by Observer       journalist Nick Cohen whose article states: "The benefit changes have         been designed to `reinforce the traditional male breadwinner model', in         the words of the Women's Budget Group, an alliance of academics and         trade unionists, which fights a determined, if often hopeless, battle to         defend poor and working-class women.
Reinforce the patriarchal male and,         inevitably, you restrict women's independence" [4].
Impact 3: UoM research has informed the policy of Her           Majesty's Opposition.
As awareness has grown regarding the       gendered impact of austerity policies on women, increased traction has       emerged within policy circles.
Annesley has twice been invited to present       research to the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party (WPLP) (22nd       November 2011 &amp; 12th March 2013) and to a group convened by       Yvette Cooper MP (Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities) and Kate Green       MP (Chair, WPLP).
Green also sought Annesley's advice on a one-to-one       basis, confirming that: "these presentations have proved very valuable         in enabling women politicians to make an evidenced case for more         gender-sensitive policy, and to mount an informed challenge to Coalition         policies...
The Parliamentary Labour Party has also made extensive and         ongoing use of Professor Annesley's research, as it continues to:         challenge ministers, via parliamentary questions; evaluate spending         announcements; and highlight the gender blindness of government...
I         hope she will also be able to assist in assessing the gender impact of         Labour's own policy proposals as we develop our election manifesto".
This was confirmed, as following the second WPLP presentation Annesley was       contacted by Yvette Cooper's office, requesting additional information on       the gendered aspects of underemployment and casualisation, as they were "putting         together some briefings for Women and Equalities Questions in the         chamber after Easter and [...] these figures could provide an         interesting basis."
This ongoing dialogue has also led to UoM       research on the topic of women's representation being publicly revisited,       most notably within two North West Young Labour (NWYL) policy forums       (Manchester, December 2012 &amp; Warrington, January 2013).
The policy       document produced (with a foreword by Kate Green,) will inform the Labour       Party's National Policy Review.
Annesley's contribution is cited directly,       noting that she "made a forceful case for increased female         representation in government.
With a stark lack of women in the vital         departments like the Treasury, Work &amp; Pensions or `The Quad'... we         agreed that Labour should have the courage to commit to at least 50% of         the Cabinet and Government Ministers being women.
We should also take         similar steps in Council executives" [6].
Impact 4: UoM research has empowered people affected by Coalition cuts         through knowledge transfer.
Ongoing engagement has been carefully       targeted in order to uphold the key messages emerging from UoM research.
For instance, Annesley was invited to present analysis on the gendered       impact of the Coalition's economic policies to the `All Party       Parliamentary Group for Sex Equality' (26th October 2010), and       was invited by BBC Radio 4 `Woman's Hour' to lead a discussion on the       impact of coalition cuts on women (11th May 2011) [7].
Other       forms of outreach have been similarly tailored, and as Kate Green MP &#8212; who       has shared a platform with Annesley at numerous events &#8212; notes, her       contributions "helped to inform, politicise and empower the women,         many of whom have gone on to speak out in their own communities,         workplaces and in the media" [6].
Specific examples include the       presentation of research to: WomenMATTA (Manchester and Trafford Taking       Action) (20th July 2010); Independent Choices &#8212; a Manchester       advocacy group for victims of domestic abuse (1st December       2010); the `Hard Times' conference to 170 grassroots women in Sheffield       (18th April 2011); an LSE public event on austerity (11th       May 2011) [8]; a Unison fringe meeting in Manchester (19th June       2011) [22]; and the TUC women's conference in Liverpool (18th       November 2011).
One of the co-organisers of the Hard Times           Conference, noted shortly afterwards that Annesley's "presentation         topped the 'star' stakes in the sense of the number of people who         expressed special appreciation of her talk in the 'feedback' sheets...."       She later commented that: "Annesley spoke in the plenary debate with         great clarity and authority about the impact the austerity measures         recently announced might have on the middle to lower earnings population         and particularly on women...
The conference with its wide audience was         important in strengthening a commitment to the importance of better         gender analysis of the impact of new policies, and the significant role         universities can play in ensuring the gender duty placed on public         authorities by the Equalities legislation is well grounded in evidence"       [9].
On the back of these engagements, Annesley has recently undertaken       similar dissemination in both a Scottish context, and at a `UN Women       workshop of local civil society groups' held in in Macedonia (October       2012) where her contribution "inspired CSO discussion on national and         regional networking through the production of joint policy/budget         watchdog reports" [10].
