     Funnell and Jupe have stimulated international public, professional and       policy debates on government accountability and the provision of public       services.
Two accessible, research-based publications provided new       findings about the limits of effective privatisation, which were used by       political pressure groups and media commentators, as well as providing       evidence for policymakers and professional communities concerned about the       direction of public service reform.
A key argument of both In Government We Trust (5.1) and Public         Sector Accounting and Accountability in Australia (5.2) is       that services should not be privatised if government must step in to       protect the public when the privatised organisation fails.
Both works       contain original research but are written in an accessible style and       targeted at a general and professional readership.
The significance of       their contribution can be found in the way it informed policymakers,       influenced media commentary and provided evidence for concerned       stakeholders in the privatisation process.
4.1 Informing policy on privatisation     In Government We Trust provided evidence for the UK Labour Party's     Policy Review Co-ordinator and pressure group, Compass, as they campaigned     for change to government policy on privatisation.
Compass is       the UK's `most influential ideas and action based pressure group' for the       democratic left and has 40,000 members.
It used the research findings of In         Government We Trust as the basis of a discussion on privatisation at       the Houses of Parliament in January 2009.
The objective of the event was       "to move the privatisation debate forward" (5.3) and "debate the       role of government and the public realm in the 21st Century" (5.4).
The evening was chaired by Jon         Cruddas MP, Labour's Policy Review Coordinator and the 100 attendees       included: Neal Lawson, the Chair of Compass; Baroness Helena Kennedy, and       Sue Goss, local government strategy specialist at public sector       consultancy, OPM.
Issues raised in the discussion included the need for       balance between public, private and third sector providers; the dangers of       over-simplifying the relationship between state and market, and the       importance of modernising, rather than `marketising', services.
Cruddas later stated that the authors of In Government We Trust       "have done public policy makers a great service...As Labour's Policy       Review Co-ordinator, this sort of research proves very helpful in       providing an evidence base that we can incorporate in our policy review       process."
(5.3)     4.2 Influencing public opinion on privatisation     In Government We Trust made an influential contribution to debates       by political pressure groups and media commentators concerned about the       effects of privatisation.
Jupe `s previous research was used by Compass       (see Compass         Thinkpiece 2), which championed the launch of In Government We         Trust.
Compass distributed information about the book, and points       raised by speakers at the House of Commons event, to the group's 40,000       members (5.5) through its news bulletin service.
The book       also stimulated debate on public service reform and enhanced public       understanding of the risks of privatisation in range of national media       outlets, including:            `The Case for Big Government' in The Australian newspaper on         11/4/2009 (circulation: 50,000) (5.6).
This article discussed         the swing away from `blind faith' in privatisation following the global         financial collapse and high profile privatisation failures.
The author         welcomes the publication on the grounds that it challenges "conservative         orthodoxies that deify the God Market."
Commentary in the Irish Times (circulation: 90,000) on         16/9/2009 on privatisation in Ireland by Paul Sweeny, the Irish Congress         of Trade Unions' economic advisor.
Using the publication of In           Government We Trust as a starting point, Sweeney concluded with a         call for policymakers to "develop a new public/private paradigm which         advances the economy and society" (5.7).

Jupe         briefed the show's producers on his research in advance of the recording         (1.1 million listeners) (5.8).
Both books were also reviewed in publications with significant         activist and professional readership including the Australian Journal of         Public Administration the British Accounting Review and the Morning Star         (25,000) (5.9).
In summary, Funnell and Jupe's arguments about the limits of effective       privatisation reached 1.3 million individuals, involving them in debates       on how far public services should be privatised through the two       publications themselves and associated public debates or commentary.
4.3 Providing evidence for stakeholders     The research findings presented in both In Government We Trust       and Public Sector Accounting and Accountability in Australia were       welcomed and used by those stakeholders in the privatisation process who       are concerned about the direction of public service reform.
The most significant example of this was the exceptional endorsement       provided by Australia's Auditor General, Ian McPhee.
The Australian National Audit Office provides       the Australian Parliament with an independent assessment of selected areas       of public administration, and assurance about public sector financial       reporting, administration, and accountability.
McPhee contributed a Foreword to the second edition of Public Sector         Accounting and Accountability in Australia and hosted its launch in       the National Audit Office on January 2010.
In the Foreword, McPhee       described the book as "a comprehensive resource on public sector       accountability for those who work in the public service, elected       representatives and students of the public sector" and went on to       emphasise that "as the authors point out, placing undue reliance on       economic factors alone can exclude value considerations relevant to       citizenship"(5.2).
McPhee's launch speech further stated that it was "the bringing together       of the insights into accountability and the fundamentals of our system of       government, in such a considered way, that makes this book quite       special...I found myself very much on side with this discourse."
(5.10).
Funnell was invited to follow-up the launch with a seminar for 40 staff       of the Australian National Audit Office, held at the Australian National       University, 9 January 2012.
The seminar was attended by audit office       professionals with the objective of debating the progress and challenges       of performance audit since the 1970s and defining best practice in this       field (see corroborating contact No.
4).
In Government We Trust also proved influential amongst Australian     trade union activists.
Funnell was an invited speaker at the conference Privatisation:       The Way Ahead in Sydney (June 2009).
The conference was took place at     a time of great public concern about privatisation in Australia and was     organised by Unions       New South Wales, which represents 67 Australian unions and 600,000     affiliated members.
Several hundred activists attended the conference and     Funnell led a debate for 80 delegates on the principles that should underlie     the privatisation of public services.
