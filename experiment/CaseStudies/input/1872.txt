     Claim 1: Engaging new audiences with a previously lost           aspect of Birmingham's cultural           history from the 1970s and 80s (Corroboration: Factual Statements 1-2;           Other Sources 1)       Through his research into the BFVW and its engagement with socio-political       themes of the period,       Shannon stimulated wider interest and engagement in this largely       neglected aspect of UK film       history, but especially the overlooked role played by the Birmingham film       collective and their       influence (on Channel 4 and Independents such as Maverick TV, founded by       BFVW member       Jonnie Turpie MBE).
Shannon's research thus led to an invitation       from the director of Vivid Gallery       in Birmingham to participate in a roundtable debate in 2008 about the Film       Workshop Movement,       including director Alan Lovell (Traces Left; 1983).
One key outcome of this discussion was the curation of a public       exhibition titled Participation       at the Vivid Gallery (2 July &#8212; 1 August 2009), comprising the five-week       exhibition, six screening       programmes and four talks.
Shannon was the principal consultant       and adviser for this exhibition,       curated the discrete film programmes, which documented films from BFVW and       other workshops       across the UK as a whole, including films from Belfast, Bradford, Cardiff,       Gateshead, London,       Newcastle and Sheffield, and gave the opening address.
At the exhibition's       core was the newly       digitised body of film and video work from the BFVW that had been       completely overlooked up to       that point (see Claim 2 below).
The exhibition made the work of       the Birmingham Workshop far       more widely available publicly than before, showcasing for a whole new       audience the newly       available BVFW films, including the 1983 BFVW Helen Biggar documentary Traces         Left.
471       visitors were recorded at the gallery, with one remarking: `The visit was       great.
I took my husband       to see it afterwards.
It made me think about the tradition of film, in       aesthetic terms and in terms of       representation of a specific time' (Factual Statement 1).
Another       said: `It was a perfect       introduction to learning about the artistic heritage of the region, and as       an aspiring curator it has       really inspired me to think about exhibitions that draw on the region's       past'.
The attendees were       young and old, and their experiences were evaluated by Vivid (Factual         Statement 1).
Selected       films from the exhibition were toured to the Foyle Film Festival (2010),       with Shannon attending a       discussion panel; screenings were held at the MAC (2012), which `brought       images of youth       cultures [...] to the attention of newer audiences, prompting a       wide-ranging discussion' (Factual         Statement 2); IPS, Bournville (2013); and Glasgow Film Theatre       (2013).
20 young people took       part in a workshop prior to Participation, which drew parallels       between the `do-it-yourself'       aesthetics evident in the 1980s underground and the 2000s.
Screen West       Midlands nominated       Participation for a Digital Social Responsibility Award (2009) (Factual         Statement 1).
The       exhibition programme, which included an essay commissioned from Shannon,       was published       online and had 9875 hits (Factual Statement 1; Other Source 1).
The Vivid director attests to       the impact of Shannon's research `in showing us the significance       of archives' and `public       engagement has demonstrated the ongoing hunger for events which tell the       story and history of       our city' (Factual Statement 1).
Claim 2: Rediscovery and digitisation of old BFVW film and           video material, now archived           at Vivid, for new audiences (Corroboration: Factual Statement 1)       Shannon played a role in Vivid's successful application for funding       to the UK Film Council's Digital       Archive Fund to digitise the BFVW materials, which had been recorded       either on 16mm film or       low-band UMATIC video, and thus inaccessible to a wider public audience       for a number of years       and vulnerable to degradation.
The films now reside in Vivid's digital       archive, where they are       available for DVD copying and for future presentations, tours and       screenings at arts centres,       galleries and festivals (e.g.
Hell Unltd screening/tour package; Claim         3 below).
A showreel DVD       was distributed to 30 schools, colleges, regional screens, museums and       galleries in the       Birmingham region.
Using this newly accessible material, a thematic package for       schools/FE/HE groups was       produced by Vivid with contextual material commissioned from the original       BFVW filmmakers and       producers, enhanced by social and historical commentaries commissioned       from academics,       including Shannon.
In 2011, Vivid also developed a community       partnership scheme, `Home       Movies', on the theme of `home', drawing on films from the new archive.
This programme was       produced by Birmingham-based company Reel Access in collaboration with       residents from Hodge       Hill.
Selections were screened at community venues in two areas of the       city (Jan-Mar 2011) as       part of a Birmingham Cultural Partnership initiative to support activity       in local sites, which led to a       group of people participating in a learning programme, developing basic       programming and       interpretation skills in order to produce a series of screenings in the       Pump Centre (Hodge Hill) and       Vivid (Digbeth).
As part of this initiative, the group also facilitated a       discussion evening, attended       by 50 people, at which Shannon was a speaker.
As one participant       remarked: `I liked the       democratic feel to [the project] and the opportunity to work with a wider       range of people from my       usual circle of acquaintances.
I am interested in film and also the       culture of ordinary people'.
Reel       Access commented that access to the Vivid archive inspired them to       `[build] on the ideas of using       archive footage to create exhibitions and new work [...] and it is       exciting to see how they shape       new work whether that be in the form of a new exhibition or a new piece of       filmmaking'.
The       Flatpack Film Festival in Birmingham will screen Property Rites,       in March 2014.
Claim 3: Rediscovery of the life and work of Helen Biggar           (Corroboration: Factual           Statements 3-5; Other Sources 2)       With the digital availability of the films, outlined in Claim 2 above, and       a growing audience for film       and documentary work made in the UK from the 1930s onwards, Shannon       devised and curated       a screening of Hell Unltd, Biggar's film with Norman McLaren,       alongside Shannon's Traces Left       at the Glasgow Film Theatre on 9 March 2013 to celebrate International       Women's Day and the       contribution of women artists in Glasgow to protest movements.
A close       relative of Biggar's has       welcomed the impact of Shannon's research for `reactivat[ing]       interest' in her aunt's career,       especially in her hometown of Glasgow (Factual Statement 3).
Head       film archivist at the Norman       McLaren archive (collection GB 0559 GAA / 31) concurred, adding that Shannon's       research has       `had the additional benefit for the University of Stirling of bringing to       light papers relating to the       making of Hell Unltd held in private hands.
This material has now       been transferred to the University       of Stirling Public Archives where it is available for the public to       consult alongside the rest of our       extensive Norman McLaren Archive' (Factual Statement 4).
In addition to devising the event in conjunction with the GFT, Shannon       worked closely with       the composer and musician Kim Moore, advising her on Biggar's life and       work, and especially the       anti-war sentiments inflecting it, to facilitate her composition of a       soundtrack and performance       accompaniment to the silent Hell Unltd for the live performance at       the screening.
Moore has       spoken of how her involvement in the project has affected her attitude to       her practice, as well as       making her more aware both of the impact politically engaged art and       culture can have on society,       and her own place in Glasgow's tradition of female artists.
In particular,       the two films in question       have inspired her to start a project around what has historically happened       to creative women.
Shannon introduced the screening and chaired a concluding question       and answer session.
As a consequence of the success of the event, a tour package has been       assembled for theatres       and arts centres, taking both films, Hell Unltd and Traces         Left, and composer/musician Kim Moore       across the country.
By virtue of Shannon's ongoing work on Biggar       and independent film of the       1930s, a Montreal-based writer and independent film researcher, who is       working on a book and       radio documentary on McLaren, `discovered the truth behind this creative       woman who was such       an overlooked force in McLaren's young life and the Glasgow       artistic-political scene of the period'       (Factual Statement 5).
As a consequence of Shannon's       research there will now be a chapter       about Biggar and her collaboration with Norman McLaren in her forthcoming       book.
