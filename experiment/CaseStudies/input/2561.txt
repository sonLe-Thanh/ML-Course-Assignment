     4.1 Impacts on creativity, culture and society     Building on her research that demonstrated the importance of       interdisciplinary collaborations in synthetic biology (Calvert and       Fujimura 2011, Frow and Calvert 2013b) and the potentially profound       significance of designing living things (Calvert 2010), Calvert initiated       and led a project to bring together six synthetic biologists with six       professional artists and designers from Europe, the US, Japan and       Australia in paired exchanges.
This EPSRC/NSF project, called `Synthetic       Aesthetics', was developed in collaboration with two engineers at a       `Sandpit' event held in Washington DC (30th March &#8212; 3rd April 2009).
The project has led to the production of cultural artefacts that would       not have existed otherwise, such as: human cheese made from bacteria       collected from body parts including feet, noses and armpits (winner of the       UdK Award for Interdisciplinary Art and Science from the Universit&#228;t der       K&#252;nste, Berlin in 2012: see Figure 1); a `design fiction' future packaging       that creates a probiotic drink with the addition of water (recipient of a       notable mention in the Core77 2012 Design Awards: see 5.3 and Figure 2);       and cyanobacteria that digest computer circuit boards (see Figure 3).
Such       unconventional uses of synthetic biology have stimulated debate among       stakeholders and publics, building on arguments we make in our       underpinning research about the importance of increasing the diversity of       voices that are able to contribute effectively to discussions of synthetic       biology.
Figure 1      	     Figure 2              Figure 3        The project has reached a broad range of international audiences, and the       artefacts have been exhibited in France, Austria, the Republic of Ireland,       the USA and Japan.
The Synthetic Aesthetics website has attracted over       28,000 unique visitors, and the project has over 1500 Twitter followers.
The work has been discussed in journals with wide readership such as Science       (see item 5.6), Nature (5.5) and Cell (5.2), and       newspapers such as the Toronto Standard (5.4) and Der         Tagesspiegel (5.1).
The project team members have given over 50       talks on the project across the world, including a dedicated event at the       Edinburgh International Science Festival in 2012, with an audience of 66.
Additionally, a popular book with over 100 images is in production with       MIT Press, and it will be launched at an event at the Museum of Modern Art       in New York in early 2014.
Most significantly, in the book the artists and       designers co-authored chapters with their paired scientists and engineers.
This was something none of project's participants had done before, and it       required them all to modify their practices and re-think their       assumptions.
In 2010, Calvert and colleagues received follow-on funding from the       Wellcome Trust and the Royal Academy of Engineering to collaborate with       the Arts Catalyst, a not-for-profit arts/science organisation.
Together       they organised a week-long art/science workshop with 28 participants, a       film night with 70 attendees and a public debate with 52 attendees.
Evaluation interviews were carried out with participants after the       workshop, and they noted how the art/science work stimulated creativity       and promoted mutual understanding across disciplines.
For example, one       artist participant commented: "it was really enlightening and somewhat         revealing of the way that we talk about each other's disciplines and the         way we do our work.
I definitely left feeling like everybody's         inadequately educated".
In sum, the unusual interdisciplinary collaborations instigated by the       Synthetic Aesthetics project have given rise to new cultural artefacts and       to new opportunities for public discussion about synthetic biology and the       hopes and concerns provoked by attempts to design living things.
4.2 Impacts on public policy     Calvert and Frow's published research on (and close engagement with) the       synthetic biology community has led to invitations to join national and       international policy advisory committees including: the Royal Academy of       Engineering Working Party on Synthetic Biology, the BBSRC Bioscience for       Society Strategy Panel, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on       Emerging Biotechnologies, the EU-US Task Force on Biotechnology Working       Party on Synthetic Biology, and the Hastings Center Working Group on       Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology, US.
In addition, Frow has been       working with the British Standards Institute and the US National Institute       of Standards and Technology to inform national standards development       initiatives in synthetic biology.
For this case study, however, we focus       on one key example of policy impact: the UK's Synthetic Biology Roadmap       (item 5.10).
In early 2012, Calvert (along with Claire Marris and Nikolas Rose) was       invited to join the Synthetic Biology Roadmap Coordination Group (RCG),       established by David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and       Science, and chaired by Lionel Clarke of Shell.
Calvert's, Marris's and       Rose's research findings on the importance of the involvement of the       social sciences in synthetic biology, specifically in respect to       `responsible innovation', were taken up in the Roadmap, which has as one       of its recommendations that "Public sector investment in synthetic biology       should take into account social, ethical and regulatory issues and       increase awareness of responsible innovation" (item 5.10, p.31).
Calvert's, Marris's and Rose's arguments for widening disciplinary       engagement in scientific governance also contributed to the recommendation       that social scientists should be members of a Synthetic Biology Leadership       Council (p.32), and that one meeting per year should be held in public.
This recommendation aims to facilitate democratic participation in the       field, and it differentiates the work of the Synthetic Biology Leadership       Council from all existing leadership councils.
As a direct result of these       recommendations, in late 2012 the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council       (jointly chaired by Willetts and Clarke) appointed a social science member       (Prof Joyce Tait: see Case Study 4, Life Sciences Innovation).
The significance of the involvement of Calvert, Marris and Rose in the       Roadmap Coordination Group was demonstrated in a symposium on synthetic       biology in Washington, DC (jointly organised by the National Academies of       the US, the UK and China), where a senior representative from the       Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills publicly stated how the       involvement of social scientists (Calvert, Marris and Rose) in the       roadmapping exercise had challenged and reshaped thinking within the UK       government:     "something we've done that is perhaps slightly different from what         we've done in the past is to be more involved with social scientists in         the process right from the outset.
That's made a real difference to         actually how we're thinking as a group, and how we've begun to think         within government itself, and that's been, for me, as part of the         journey we've gone on, a real revelation actually" (item 5.9).
The impact of social scientific involvement in this work has reached       beyond the Synthetic Biology Roadmap.
This is shown in an email from the       Technology Strategy Board's representative on the RCG on its &#163;6.5 million       funding competition for Feasibility Studies in synthetic biology:     "You will note that `responsible innovation' figures large in the         competition, and that we plan to carry out an ethical, societal and         regulatory assessment on every project funded through it before awarding         the grants.
The work of the RCG [Roadmap Coordination Group], with input         from the workshops, has been highly influential in shaping this &#8212; the         first time that any Technology Strategy Board competition has taken this         approach.
Many thanks, especially to social science colleagues, for         helping to shape the thinking" (email from Head of Development,       Technology Strategy Board, 10th May 2012, on file at the University of       Edinburgh).
Since the publication of the Roadmap, the idea of `Embedding Responsible       Research and Innovation' has been taken up by a &#163;10M call for an       Innovation and Knowledge Centre by the EPSRC, the Technology Strategy       Board and the BBSRC (5.8), and an &#163;80M call for six Synthetic Biology       Research Centres by the BBSRC and the EPSRC, demonstrating the       significance of this work for ongoing policy initiatives (5.7).
Calvert       and Frow have also been invited to contribute to the development of the       Technology Strategy Board's `Responsible Innovation Framework', which will       be used in future decisions about funding in the area of synthetic       biology.
Note re testimony: other than the artist quoted (who was a       participant in the workshop), none of those quoted were participants in       the process of impact delivery.
