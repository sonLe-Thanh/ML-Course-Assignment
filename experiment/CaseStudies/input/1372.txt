     As the research showed, one in ten people who die at some point make a       request for an assisted death, translating to about 60,000 such requests       annually.
Research from countries where euthanasia is legal show that       approximately 2% of deaths are by euthanasia, which would translate to       about 12,000 deaths annually.
In January 2012 the Daily Telegraph       reported that up until that date 182 British people had travelled to       Dignitas in Switzerland for an assisted suicide.
British Social Attitudes       surveys have, for some years, shown UK public support for permissive       legislation on assisted dying to stand at approximately 80%.
The Nexis       newspaper database of all national newspapers showed that in the five       years to March 2013 there were 1816 newspaper articles containing three or       more mentions of terms describing assisted dying.
This is therefore an       issue of considerable public significance, where research relevant to       debates about the topic has considerable reach.
Attempts to change the law to allow assisted dying are periodically made       in the UK, the most recent of these being a Bill in the House of Lords       sponsored by Lord Joffe and accompanied by a select committee report,       which was defeated (or talked out) in 2006.
Evidence given to the Select       Committee by the National Council of Palliative Care indicated the need       for better information about, for example, the extent to which assisted       dying was currently being practiced in the UK, and the state of medical       opinion about the desirability of legislation.
The surveys reported in       this impact case study have subsequently provided this information, and       this has fed into debates in a variety of forums involving legislators,       policy makers and lobby groups associated with renewed attempts (and       opposing efforts) to get permissive legislation passed.
At the time of the Joffe Bill, the British Medical Association briefly       changed its stance on the desirability of legalising assisted dying from       one of opposition to one of neutrality.
This has now changed back to       opposition, but it prompted a great deal of debate about the true state of       medical opinion.
The select committee commissioned a report into the       evidence about medical opinion and this revealed a collection of rather       poorly conducted studies, with uncertain response rates and question       wordings that did not allow trends over time, or comparisons with surveys       of general public opinion, to be reliably made.
The second 2008 survey, by       remedying the methodological problems of earlier surveys, established this       conclusively so that it is now well understood that the UK medical       profession and the UK general public differ markedly in their levels of       support for such legislation, with doctors being largely opposed.
This is       an important finding, as UK parliamentarians have, historically, been       highly influenced by medical opinions on this matter.
Further to this, the relevance of the research for guidelines issued by       the Director of Public Prosecutions following the Diane Pretty case and       the ongoing experience of UK citizens travelling to Switzerland to avail       themselves of the services of Dignitas, concerning the conditions under       which a prosecution would and would not be pursued against a person for       assisting in a suicide, have been brought out in the pages of the British       Medical Journal and subsequent correspondence, and in evidence given in       2010 to the Commission on Assisted Dying, chaired by Lord Falconer at       Demos, where Seale gave evidence in a session to which the Director of       Public Prosecutions also contributed evidence.
In addition, some of the results, particularly those concerning the high       rate at which sedative drugs are used in UK end-of-life care and the role       played by doctors' personal religious beliefs, have excited the attention       of journalists, professional regulatory bodies, and professional groups.
On sedation, the Daily Telegraph in 2010 ran a number of stories,       influenced by the study results, expressing concern about the over-use of       sedation said to be associated with the roll-out of the Liverpool Care       Pathway (LCP), a scheme or checklist aimed at guiding the professional       practice of health care providers in end-of-life care.
A BBC Radio 4       report involving an interview with Seale also fuelled this concern, and       Seale has been invited to discuss his findings on sedation at meetings of       professional groups concerned with the Liverpool Care Pathway and the use       of sedatives.
Recently, the LCP has been disbanded because of public       concerns about its use in health care settings.
Further qualitative and       observational research on the use of sedation involving Seale in       collaboration with researchers in Nottingham (UK), Rotterdam (Netherlands)       and Ghent (Belgium) is continuing into this subject, and this will       elucidate the complex relationship between the use of continuous deep       sedation until death, and euthanasia, as this applies in different       legislative environments.
On religious beliefs, mass media coverage of the research has highlighted       the implications of the findings for debates about the place of doctors'       personal religious beliefs in their clinical practice.
This has       implications for General Medical Council guidance to doctors.
Again, this       element of the findings has received coverage in national and       international mass media (for example, participation in a debate on BBC       World Service).
Evidence of impact from 2008 onwards includes the following:             UK newspaper coverage: Express (leader), Sunday Express         (leader), Times, Guardian, Glasgow Herald, Daily Telegraph, Sunday         Herald, Daily Mail.
UK broadcast media coverage: Interviews on BBC4 Today         programme, BBC World Service, BBC local radio; reports on BBC News         website.
Internet coverage: The research findings have been reported and         their implications discussed on many websites.
Some of the more         significant include:                 Help the Hospices http://www.helpthehospices.org.uk/media-centre/latest-news/doctors-against-assisted-dying/        Living and Dying Well         http://www.livinganddyingwell.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article           &amp;id=67:what-do-doctors-think-about-assisted-dying&amp;catid=45:medicine&amp;Itemid=64        Dignity in Dying http://www.dignityindying.org.uk/research/research-from-the-uk.html           The media impact was so extensive that it prompted Seale to carry out a       study of the media coverage, reported in a 2010 journal article :     Seale C.
