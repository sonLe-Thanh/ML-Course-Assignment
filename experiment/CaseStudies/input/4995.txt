     Impact on public policy &#8212; a change in the guidelines: The current       thinking on peanut allergy and the appropriate timing and route of       exposure of peanuts to infants has been directly influenced by the KCL       research.
The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee and the UK       Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the       Environment (COT) incorporated the KCL research into a change in the       recommendations.
In a COT report published in 2008 (7), the work on the       association of PA with the use of peanut oil-based skin products and high       household environmental exposure to peanut was extensively quoted as       evidence that the route of relevant exposure in developing PA was not       likely to be oral.
Overall, the KCL findings provided supporting evidence       to change the recommendations and no longer restrict maternal consumption       during pregnancy or breast feeding or restrict peanut consumption in       infancy.
COT stated: "The shift in the balance of evidence since 1998         is such that the Committee believes that the previous precautionary         advice to avoid peanut consumption during pregnancy, breast feeding and         infancy, where there is atopy or atopic disease in family members, is no         longer appropriate."
(7)     In parallel, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also reversed its       policy in 2008 (8), citing Professor Lack's research on the association of       low incidence of PA with infant peanut consumption as contributing       evidence.
This report concluded that: "although solid foods should not         be introduced before 4-6 months of age, there is no current convincing         evidence that delaying their introduction beyond this period has a         significant protective effect on the development of atopic disease,         regardless of whether infants are fed cow milk protein formula or human         milk.
This includes the introduction of foods that are considered to be         highly allergic, such as fish, eggs and foods containing peanut         protein".
(8)     Furthermore, the KCL work on the prevalence of PA in the UK and Israel       was recognised in the 2009 Government Office for Science review of this       work (9): "The findings call into serious question the 1998 DH advice         to mothers....The reviewers were impressed by the whole approach and         commented that the commissioning, execution and follow-up to this work         were of the highest standard....
The ideas underpinning this work were         innovative and at the forefront of the field".
Furthermore, one       reviewer commented that the "recommendations and conclusions illustrate         reflection by the research team about the meanings of their findings for         policy/practice."
(9)     The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Food       Allergy and Anaphylaxis Guidelines of March 2013 cite the KCL UK-Israel       study (ref 1) and state that "...the present evidence does not justify       recommendations about either withholding or encouraging exposure to       potentially allergenic foods after the age of 4 months" (10).
The       International Collaboration in Asthma &amp; Allergy with the American       Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology, European Academy of Allergy       and Clinical Immunology, World Allergy Organization, and American College       of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology also cites our work supporting the       concept that early dietary introduction of allergenic foods such as peanut       in infants' diet may prevent the development of food allergies (11).
Exposure in the scientific and medical press: Scientists have also       been influenced by the findings of the KCL research.
An expert panel       review on the diagnosis and management of allergy in the USA highlighted       the KCL research showing that early sensitisation to foods such as peanuts       is independently associated with inflamed skin (dermatitis) and household       consumption of peanut (12).
The attention of many scientists and       clinicians is focused on the role of the first definitive clinical trials,       such as KCL's LEAP and EAT, in defining the critical timing of oral       exposure to allergens such as peanut (13).
Specialist organisations take the new advice on board:       Organisations that support people with severe allergies have been       proactive in spreading the word.
For example, websites such as that of the       Anaphylaxis Campaign provide clear explanations of the various findings       from KCL's scientific papers on peanut allergy (14).
Similarly, Food       Allergy Research &amp; Education (FARE) which works on behalf of the 15       million Americans with food allergies has detailed the KCL research on its       website (15).
Influence on clinical practice: The influence of the new       guidelines is clear, with examples ranging from the Food Standards       Agency's testing of the impact of the new advice (16) to clinicians       changing their practice (17).
Another consequence of the KCL research was       the creation of the KCL Allergy Academy in 2008.
This runs multiple study       days annually, in various areas of allergy, often involving other partners       such as the Academy for Paediatric Gastroenterology at Great Ormond       Street.
More than 1000 healthcare professionals participate each year, and       the KCL Allergy Academy attracts income of &#163;286,000 per year from industry       (18).
Dissemination to the general public through the UK and American press:       The implications of the KCL research has been extensively reported and       well received in the UK press and media.
At least ten newspaper reports       and the BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour have positively covered the KCL       research and the LEAP trial, a selection of which is referenced here (19).
Similarly, the American press have also highlighted the worldwide impact       of the KCL findings (e.g.
20).
