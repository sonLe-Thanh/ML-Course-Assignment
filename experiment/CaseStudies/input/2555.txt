     Impact on individual practice     Much of the immediate impact from the work came from the active         dissemination and brokerage roles undertaken by the practitioner       researchers who formed the focus of the project activities.
In formal       feedback, all participants reported changes in their own practice, e.g.
supporting service users to approach risk more positively; being more       pro-active in encouraging service users to participate in meetings;       increasing the amount of time spent with service users; being more       pro-active in informing service users about decisions affecting them; and       changing style of report writing to be more accessible for service users.
Impacts have included positive developments in relationships with service       users and decisions by practitioner researchers to, in one case, undertake       a PhD and in another to write a book.
(5.1)     Influencing social work education     Working with involuntary service users is a challenging element of social       work practice and thus of social work education across the UK.
Impact from       this project focuses on improving direct practice at a number of levels       within and across social work departments in Scotland and increasingly       more internationally.
This often occurs by influencing those who educate       social work practitioners.
This project has achieved this goal, as the       following extract from an email illustrates:     "Just a quick note to say how much I have enjoyed and learned from         your/and colleagues recent paper in the BJSW.
I am doing quite a bit of         work in the area of user engagement in Northern Ireland.
I could really         identify with so many of the points and arguments which are asserted in         your paper.
This really adds to the literature and broadens         understanding in an important area of social policy and social work.
I         have asked our Masters students to read this paper ahead of our teaching         tomorrow on our Personal and Public Involvement Module.
Many thanks         again" (Joe Duffy, Queen's University, Belfast).
(5.2)     Impact on local authority practice     Contribution analysis, an approach to assessing the performance of       policies and programmes, was used to capture activities and the outcome of       these at local authority level.
Scottish Borders has incorporated a       Practitioner Research Project report into a service review.
Their leaflets       have been re-designed and methods of gathering service user feedback       routinely have been explored.
In Midlothian a training course for       employees on participation in child protection is being developed.
In       Edinburgh a Practitioner Research Project (PRP) report has been included       in the induction pack for new social workers, and in post-induction       training.
(5.3) The PRP has also helped one of the       practitioner-researchers to design a course for staff on working with       `resistant and involuntary' service users.
This ran in 2010 and was well       evaluated by practitioners who attended.
Usefulness of project outputs     Outputs from the project have proved to be particularly useful and       relevant to practitioners, as the following exchanges indicate:     "Last week I came across the wee leaflet [Good Practice Guide] you put         together from your work around engaging with involuntary clients....
I         think the content is really excellent.
..." (Stuart Allardyce,       Practice Development Worker, Centre for Youth and Criminal Justice,       (Practice and KE remit, University of Strathclyde).
(5.2)     "I was at the workshop you delivered at the youth justice conference         where you gave out the good practice guides.
I have found these a really         useful basic guide for staff and would like to distribute them among our         workforce.
Is it possible to purchase copies of this guide?"
(Iain       Macaulay, North Lanarkshire Council).
(5.5)     Ongoing impact on practice cultures     M. Smith accepted the invitation to become involved in a Practice Panel       for the City of Edinburgh Council where he advises on practice development       and practice models with a view to shifting the culture of the local       authority children's services from a compliance based to a learning       culture (see http://edinburghbrightfutures.com/2013/07/31/creating-a-learning-culture-in-childrens-social-work-2/       or http://tinyurl.com/q5rq8og)       The Panel arranged six events between November 2011 and May 2013 for       practitioners and managers.
These events have been over-subscribed and       delivered to over 180 practitioners.
M. Smith led the input on four of the       sessions and Whyte and Cree on another.
These events were very well       received (evaluations are available).
The work of the Practice Panel was       `Highly Commended' in the City of Edinburgh Children and Families       Achievement Awards and was entered for a Care Accolade with the Scottish       Social Services Council (5.3)     The Council's lead officer for children and families practice teams       presented on the Practice Model at the Association of Directors of Social       Work (ADSW) conference, where the model was highlighted by delegates as an       exemplar of how local authorities and universities should be working       together on topical issues.
He and M. Smith subsequently presented at a       further ADSW conference (2013).
(5.4)     The ongoing involvement between the UoE and City of Edinburgh Council       (and also involving East Lothian Council) resulted in a further successful       bid to the ESRC under the KE Opportunities fund (&#163;49k, started Jan 2013).
The aim of this project is to help the two participating local authorities       to shift their cultures away from primarily procedural to more relational       ways of working, in line with the recent Munro Review of Child Protection.
M. Smith is PI on this project and Wilkinson and Cree are Co-Is.
The       project involves three strands: reflective learning groups for       practitioners, seven supported pieces of practitioner research around       strengths-based practices, and three training days for managers to support       the work of practitioners to achieve change.
This project is a direct       follow-on from the ESLA project.
