     Upon learning of Northumbria History's specialisation on migration       research through contacts with       the British and Irish Worlds Research Group (B&amp;IW) in history, the       Discovery Museum, a science       and local history museum and the largest component organisation of the       Tyne and Wear Archives       and Museum Group (TWAM), decided to work with us on a new exhibition in       April 2012 (Source 1).
The project manager for the development of a &#163;400,000 new permanent       exhibition space &#8212; which       opened in July 2013 &#8212; needed research expertise to ensure the historical       accuracy of the planned       content for the exhibition on `The Making of Modern Tyneside'.
The purpose       of the exhibition is to       demonstrate to the wider public that migration has been a constant feature       of life on Tyneside       since 1840.
In particular, Little recognised that this intervention helped       her `understand the         significance of the Orange Order in the region [which] has also informed         the character selection         [for the six planned life narratives] and the curatorial process more         broadly'.
Of the six life       narratives that had originally been selected to frame the exhibition three       were changed as a result       of this early dialogue to reflect the occupational, gender and ethnic       realties of nineteenth-century       migration to the North East (Source 1).
One of these life narratives is       derived in whole from       McRaild's research (`Mrs Montgomery'), whilst a further two are also       substantially based on it.
Thus, over 50% of the exhibition content has been shaped by       Northumbria-based research.
The       research has also supported the production of a script (translated from       academic outputs with a       popular audience in mind) for an actor playing the local Orangewoman,       Eliza Montgomery (Source 3).
In addition, research derived from the `Isonymy' project provides the       material for an interactive       `hub' area in the exhibition.
The museum staff reported that the       narratives had provided `invaluable         historical research in a format that has been tailored in order to allow         museum staff to access key         information in the most efficient way and then to feed that into the         curatorial process.'
(Source 1).
This work has not only informed the display content and shape of the       exhibition, but it has also       enabled the museum to develop durable partnerships with Northumbria       academics.
Gleeson has       been organising training sessions for Archive and Museum Staff at       Northumbria around       transforming public history into academic research as well has helping       museum and archive staff       develop professional academic development plans (Source 5).
The former       Director of TWAM       notes: `As a result of academic involvement, staff have been exposed         to new academic thought         which has encouraged them to engage in further research themselves.
Newly acquired knowledge         and skills have then been applied to museum practice, for example,         gallery text writing, guidebook         publication or delivery of a conference paper.
Museum staff involved in         the planning of our new         gallery, Destination Tyneside, benefited hugely from the breadth and         depth of academic subject         knowledge and the advice and guidance offered as to how to break down         the information to fit         gallery themes and audiences.'
(Source 5).
Northumbria staff also supported the Discovery Museum's successful       Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF)       bid in 2012 (Source 2).
This has enabled a two-year activity programme,       starting in July 2013 when       the exhibition opened, that is directly associated with the content of the       permanent exhibition.
The       programme is designed to engage local communities and to give expression       to their own `tales of         migration and belonging.'
In terms of more direct impact on the public in the North East and       beyond, the AHRC-funded       `Locating the Hidden Diaspora' team, led by Co-I and impact coordinator       Gleeson, held a series of       public lectures entitled `Icons of Englishness' linked to research for the       English Diaspora project on       the global images of Englishness, at the Literary and Philosophical       Society of Newcastle in April       2013, culminating on St. George's Day with an examination of the Global       St. George (based on the       Bueltmann and MacRaild article).
Over 120 people came to the series and 86       completed surveys       with 85% agreeing that the lecture they attended had `increased their         knowledge of a symbol of         Englishness' and 79% agreed that their `knowledge of the         connections between English symbols         and English identity' had `increased.'
One wrote that the       discussion of the Global St. George       `brought my attention to symbols of Englishness about which I had not         previously thought.'
Another       learned that `people away from England celebrate Englishness more than         those remaining.'
At the       session on Morris dancing one respondent noted the talk made him/her think       more about `the         selective ways which aspects of Englishness are embraced and manipulated         at home and abroad'       (Source 4).
Gleeson, Bueltmann and MacRaild organised and opened an exhibition at the       College of       Charleston library in Charleston, South Carolina, in May 2013 entitled       `England the English and       English Culture in North America', to run through the major arts festival       week in Charleston       (Piccolo/SpoletoUSA), and helped bring the Hexham Morris Group to       participate in the Piccolo       festival and perform a concert on the history of Morris to an American       audience linked to grant       research on English culture in North America.
Charleston is a city with       strong English connections       and has the oldest St. George's Society in North America.
These activities       resulted in a request by       the Lowcountry Digital Library, a major open source archive on American       history, to establish a       permanent digital exhibit on its website with links to primary sources       used in the project research.
This digital exhibition will become a role model on its site for how       physical exhibitions can become       permanent digital ones, thus expanding the scope and purpose of the       Library (Source 6).
