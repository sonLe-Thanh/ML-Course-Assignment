     The impacts from this research include direct influence on renewable       energy policy and practice in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and       internationally, involving public, NGO and private sectors.
This is       reflected in the demand for Ellis as a speaker, having made over 40       presentations to national, international, academic and practitioner       audiences.
The impact having greatest reach is Ellis' role as the Irish National       Expert for IEA Task28 Working Group on Social Acceptance of Wind Energy       Projects.
The IEA has 28 member countries and is one of the world's       leading energy authorities.
Ellis's work on Task28 has included       participation in a series of high-level international meetings and       development of good-practice guidance, including co-authoring the Task28's       Final Report (2012) and its Recommended Practices for Social         Acceptance of Wind Energy Projects (2013).
These were disseminated       at a global level, setting international standards for wind-energy       development and have been promoted by the European Wind Energy Association       among others.
A corroborating statement confirms that Ellis:     `.... had an active and influential role in the Group's activities,         including helping to draft the Group's Final Report in 2012 and its         Recommended Practices Report in 2013.
The expertise developed through       [Ellis'] peer-reviewed research provided a crucial input to the         development of these reports, which are being disseminated to         Governments, regulators, industry interests and other stakeholders         throughout the world.'
More specifically, this research has had a direct impact in Ireland, one       of the world's most wind-rich countries, via Ellis' work for the SEAI (the       national energy authority).
This included authoring best-practice       principles for fostering social acceptance of wind energy projects.
A       corroborating statement notes Ellis' expert contribution:     "... on a number of initiatives aimed at helping [SEAI] understand         and formulate guidance for improving social acceptance of renewable         developments ... which reflects our view that [Ellis is] the         leading authority on social acceptance on the island of Ireland and we         welcome the advice [provided] in this capacity."
Ellis has also acted as an independent expert witness to the NI Assembly       Environment Committee's enquiry into wind energy.
Although it is difficult to provide evidence for a direct impact in other       jurisdictions, many issues raised in Ellis' research are being addressed       throughout the UK, such as the emphasis on community energy and       awareness-raising activities of organisations such as the Joseph Rowntree       Foundation.
For example the Fermanagh Trust, drew on Ellis' work in its       report on community energy in NI, which itself has stimulated government       policy in this area.
Their corroborating statement notes:     "... this research and policy advice has played a very important role         in developing our position on these issues and that [Ellis']         expertise in this area has had an influential role on a number of         stakeholders throughout Northern Ireland and beyond."
In addition to policy influence, the research has had impact on the       practice of wind developers, with Ellis being asked to address the 2013 UK       staff training day of RES (a leading developer) and the 2013 Wind Energy       Developers Congress in Berlin.
More widely, many developers now employ       community-liaison officers informed by Ellis' work, while the Irish Wind       Energy Association and the NI Renewable Industry Group have adopted       protocols for securing community benefits, as called for in Ellis' 2012       SEAI report.
A corroborating statement from one developer, notes:     "...exposure to [Ellis'] work has certainly been useful for us to         reflect on the social and policy environment in which we work and the         nature of our approach to community engagement as followed in our         projects."
Finally, Ellis' et al recent work on devolution and renewables were       presented at Welsh and NI Assembly committees, the Westminster       Parliamentary Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group and at events in       Aberdeen, Belfast, Cardiff and Dublin.
These had more than 250 high-level       participants, findings reported by more than 60 UK newspapers (A, below)       and cited by the Scottish First Minister (B).
A subsequent paper published       in the Political Quarterly was also covered by the press,       influencing the debate on Scottish independence (C).
Recent work for       Ireland's National Economic and Social Council will also directly advise       Ireland's Prime Minister.
This work has piloted the research on the social interaction with       renewable energy and how it can be integrated into policy and practice.
Combined with high level dissemination, press coverage and agenda-setting       academic papers makes a persuasive case for claiming international impact.
While it is possible to provide examples of impact from the last six       years, the increasingly deployment of renewables and the need to rapidly       decarbonise, will ensure that its relevance will continue into the       foreseeable future.
