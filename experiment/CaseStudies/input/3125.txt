     This research arose out of the urgent need to address the worldwide       decline in fertility of dairy cows, as outlined in Section 2, which was       attributed to a combination of genetic and nutrition-related factors.
Fertility had been in decline for 40 years, so a quick fix was not       expected.
Dissemination and uptake of any innovation takes time and it can be many       years before benefits can be quantified.
In the dairy industry,       reproductive performance is measured only once per year, the generation       interval is 5 years and cows stay in the herd for up to 10 years.
Nevertheless, the latest statistics indicate that fertility is improving,       both genetically and phenotypically, and will continue to improve for       generations to come.
Bull proofs for fertility were first made available to the breeding       companies involved in the project in December 2003.
Although originally       made publicly available through the Milk Development Council website in       2005, the Fertility Index has become firmly established and increasingly       important in the 2008-2013 period (Sources 1-3).
The Index       provided producers, for the first time, with the facility to select bulls       on the basis of daughter fertility.
The production of the Fertility Index       is managed through DairyCo (DairyCo is the levy board which utilises dairy       farmer levy payments in Great Britain), with a spin-out company based at       Scottish Rural College (eGenes) established to collect and analyse the       relevant data from the industry.
Analysis of national artificial insemination records shows fertility       trends in bulls and cows (Figure 1; Source 1).
Genetic merit of AI       bulls for calving interval flattened off after release of the Index to       breeding companies, indicating an early effect upon fertility trends.
When       farmers started using the Fertility Index to select bulls, the fertility       trend was reversed.
The rate of reduction from 2008 to 2012 was 20% faster       than the rate of increase from 1990 to 2000, showing an accelerated rate       of improvement in fertility.
In cows there was a slowing in the rate of       increase genetic merit for calving interval and a reversal from 2008       onwards, showing that choices of bulls were feeding through into their       daughters' performance.
Daughter performance is reported by year of birth;       hence the latest data are for cows born in 2010.
Figure 1: The increasing Calving Interval from 1990-2007         indicates declining fertility.
The Fertility Index and use of new         dietary formulations has contributed to the rapid improvement in calving         interval since 2008.
The Fertility Index has become firmly incorporated into international       genetic evaluations through Interbull (a subcommittee of the International       Committee for Animal Recording) (Source 1) - see Interbull (2012)       (Source 2).
It is also widely used by international breeding       companies to promote superior bulls (e.g.
WorldWide Sires [Source 3]).
The main deliverable of the UoN nutritional research was a new way of       thinking when evaluating dairy cow nutrition in relation to milk yield and       fertility - the industry now considers not only nutrient supply, but also       the effect of diet on metabolic hormones, and their influence on the       reproductive system.
The three commercial partners in UoN LINK programmes       (LK0646 [e]) are well known for their innovative approaches to       dairy cow nutrition.
BOCM PAULS is market leader in UK dairy compound       feed; AB Agri is the leading UK supplier of blended feeds for dairy       cattle; Provimi is a world leader in animal nutrition with plants in 27       countries.
BOCM PAULS and Provimi incorporated UoN predictive equations       into their ration formulation programmes to provide nutritional indexes       for insulin and progesterone as aids to fertility.
The Head of Ruminant Development at BOCM PAULS stated: "Our goal is         to improve fertility and longevity by focusing on extending the         productive life of the cow and reducing the costs associated with         infertility and high replacement rates.
The Nottingham fertility         research provides a central feature of our approach, by predicting the         likely influence of nutrition on metabolic hormones, particularly         insulin, and consequences for fertility.
To this end, we incorporated         fertility indexes for insulin and progesterone into our ration         formulation packages.
Every dairy cow ration that we have designed since         2008 incorporates an assessment of potential effects on fertility.
Using         this approach, we have seen significant improvements in fertility on         many dairy farms.
In 2012, BOCM PAULS became part of the ForFarmers         Group, the largest feed company in Europe with a turnover of &#8364; 6.6         billion.
As part of the integration process, we have shared technical         information and ideas with partner companies in the Group.
Thus, the         concepts generated by the Nottingham fertility research are being         implemented in dairy nutrition programmes throughout Northern Europe"       (Source 4).
Feed companies not associated with the project have       also incorporated concepts generated by UoN into marketing material, e.g.
Volac (Source 5).
The findings are incorporated into advice to       farmers from DairyCo on feeding for fertility (Source 6).
Data confirm that practical application of genetic, nutritional and       management tools reversed the decline in fertility among cows.
Between       2000 and 2008, average calving interval of UK Holstein cows increased       at the rate of 4 days per year; between 2009 and 2010, the interval decreased       by 4 days (Source 7).
This rapid trend reversal is highly       significant.
If maintained, rate of restoration of fertility will be 5       times the rate of genetic progress.
As the genetic gain in fertility       occurs year on year, it is therefore cumulative over time.
In 2012 DairyCo estimated that the typical UK herd was losing       &#163;250/cow/year through poor fertility.
A shorter calving interval would       save &#163;2/cow per day of interval reduction.
On this basis the savings       associated with improving fertility amounted to &#163;16m nationally in       2009-2010.
Genetic trends suggest that improvement will continue so, by       2020, annual savings will approach &#163;100m.
Approximately half of this can       be attributed to the Fertility Index and half to better nutrition and       management (Source 8).
