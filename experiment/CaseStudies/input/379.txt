     Cardiff research on this issue has had significant global impact on       public policy and services.
Both the content and tone of global discourse,       policy and public and professional education have changed substantially as       a direct result of Zammit's research.
As the only clearly modifiable risk factor in the prevention of       schizophrenia, elimination of cannabis is particularly significant.
The       greatest reduction in risk will be in those who are at highest risk by       virtue, for example, of having a parent or sibling with schizophrenia.
Nationwide elimination offers the potential to prevent approximately 15%       of cases in the UK.
Situation before the underpinning research     Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are major worldwide causes of       morbidity and mortality and are associated with a major burden on       societies through high usage of health services and lost productivity.
Identifying modifiable risk factors is an essential strategy for improving       global public health.
Before the underpinning research carried out by Cardiff, cannabis was       known to cause acute, short-term psychotic states but there was       insufficient evidence supporting a causal relationship between cannabis       and chronic psychotic disorders.
For example, the 1998 UK House of Lords       Select Committee Report (Cannabis: the Scientific and Medical Evidence)       concluded, "...cannabis is neither poisonous nor highly addictive, and         we do not believe that it can cause schizophrenia in a previously well         user with no predisposition to develop the disease."
Textbooks for psychiatrists made little or no mention of cannabis as a       potential aetiological agent for schizophrenia.
Similarly, information       books/leaflets for sufferers, carers and the public did not link cannabis       use and psychosis risk.
Transformative effect of the underpinning research     Since their publication in 20023.1 and 20043.2 Cardiff       research findings have informed global policy debate through both       traditional academic routes (&gt;500 citations of refs3.1, 3.2)       and global media interest and coverage.
During the REF assessment period       Cardiff research findings have influenced populations, groups and       governments across the world, as described below.
Impacting government policy and guidelines across the globe     UK: In its 2008 Submission to the Advisory Council on the       Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) Cannabis Classification Review, "Bringing evidence       and analysis together to inform UK drug policy," the UK Drug Policy       Commission cited Cardiff research results and concluded that; "the         risks [of a long-term psychotic illness resulting from cannabis use] are         real and the consequences can be serious for individuals and their         families" (p.4).
(http://www.ukdpc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Briefing-SubmissiontotheACMDcannabisclassificationreview.pdf).
As a result, the 2008 ACMD advice to UK government regarding legal       classification of cannabis5.1 requests further studies to       assess the links between cannabis and psychosis, and notes that "Only         one study [Zammit et al., 2002] has had the statistical power to assess         whether cannabis use precedes the onset of an illness that meets the         full diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia" (p.17; recommendation       16).
US: In 2010, the White House Office of National Drug       Control Policy (ONDCP) contribution to the debate5.2 on       legalization of cannabis referred to a systematic review, based on Cardiff       work, to support the statement; "Studies have shown an association         between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety,         depression, suicidal thoughts, and schizophrenia."
Since then, the       impact of Zammit's work can be seen repeatedly supporting state-level and       nationwide policy and guidelines:     "Research indicates an association exists between early marijuana use         and the development and worsening of symptoms of schizophrenia" (p.       6).

American Society of Addiction Medicine http://www.asam.org/docs/publicy-policy-statements/state-level-proposals-to-legalize-marijuana-final2773DD668C2D.pdf?sfvrsn=2       "Although the mechanism is unknown, repeated studies have shown that         cannabis use is correlated with an increase in the risk of manifesting         schizophrenia, an illness that affects approximately 1% of the global         population" (p. 3).
2011 Guidelines of the Council on Scientific       Affairs Subcommittee on Medical Marijuana Practice Advisory: California       Medical Association, Government of California, http://www.mbc.ca.gov/medical_marijuana_cma-recommend.pdf       "...adolescent marijuana users are more likely than adult users to         develop marijuana dependence, and their heavy use is associated with         increased incidence and worsened course of psychotic, mood, and anxiety         disorders."
AACAP Medical Marijuana Policy Statement.5.7     EU: In both 2010 and 2011, The European Monitoring Centre       for Drugs and Drug Addiction also cited Zammit's work when advising the       European Union in The State of the Drugs Problem in Europe: "Regular         cannabis use in adolescence might adversely affect mental health in         young adults, with evidence of an increased risk of psychotic symptoms         and disorders that increase with frequency of use."
http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/online/annual-report/2010/boxes/p47       http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/online/annual-report/2011/boxes/p47     Australia: In 2008, Australia's Cannabis and Mental Health       National Drug Strategy (NDS)5.3 also noted that Zammit's (2002)       study is the only one to find a relationship between cannabis and       hospitalisation for schizophrenia: "Those who had used cannabis at         least 50 times by age 18 were about three times more likely to be         hospitalised for schizophrenia by the age of 45 than those who had not         used cannabis.
Overall, these studies showed that cannabis use during         adolescence was associated with an increased risk of being hospitalised         for schizophrenia over the next 27 years."
Impacting educational material and patient information sheets across         the globe Cardiff findings are also commonly referred to in       educational material about cannabis and mental health by: Government         bodies in the UK (Cannabis: A Handbook.

Home Office, UK Government (www.talktofrank.com)       2012) and other countries (Marijuana Abuse.
National Institute of       Drug Abuse, NIH, USA, http://www.drugabuse.gov       2010).
Professional bodies in the UK5.4, 5.5 (e.g., Cannabis         use and abuse.
Patient.co.uk http://www.patient.co.uk       2011) and in other countries.5.6     Mental health charities and numerous drug information and young       people websites worldwide: In contrast to information disseminated       before this research was undertaken, educational leaflets about       schizophrenia published during the REF assessment period now consistently       warn about the risk of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia related       to cannabis use both in the UK (e.g., RETHINK5.8; MIND, http://www.mind.org.uk;       DRUGSCOPE www.drugscope.org.uk;       KNOW CANNABIS www.knowcannabis.org.uk;       HIT www.hit.org.uk; Know the Score www.knowthescore.info; Talking       about cannabis www.talkingaboutcannabis.com)       and other countries worldwide (e.g., Prevent Teen Drug Use www.preventteendruguse.org;       DrugInfo www.druginfo.adf.org.au).
Professional training: Textbooks and other educational material       for psychiatrists published during the REF assessment period typically       include information, based on this work, on the role of cannabis in the       aetiology of schizophrenia.
See, for example, the latest editions of Companion         to Psychiatric Studies,5.9 and the Shorter Oxford         Textbook of Psychiatry, p. 275.
