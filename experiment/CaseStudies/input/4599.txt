     Education     Angry Planet`s impact on shaping the educational and cultural       experiences of the children involved has been significant, because all       came from state primary schools that have about 80% of pupils speaking       English as a second language and entitled to free school meals.
Consequently, it was the 200 young performers from primary schools in       Westminster, Harrow, Kensington and Chelsea (5.1), who were most       profoundly affected by the opportunity to participate in the project's       innovative pedagogic practice, and to work alongside vocalists from The       BBC Singers, The Bach Choir and The National Youth Choir.
Singing in Angry         Planet was an important opportunity for breaking down cultural       barriers, raising the young singers' confidence and introducing classical       music to new audiences.
A Bach Choir collation of responses attests to its       educational impact.
One child commented, "A once in a lifetime         experience.
Not everyone can say they have sung in the Albert Hall"       (5.1); a parent enthused, "It was really exciting.
She's been dreaming         about this for weeks."
(5.1); and a teacher involved in Angry         Planet noted that many students, "felt very proud of their part         in it" (5.1).
From a survey conducted in July 2013 of 18 children at       Our Lady Dolours Primary School, Harrow, all 18 agreed with the       questionnaire statement that participating in the BBC Prom "was really         special and I will always remember it" and 14 agreed that they do       more singing and musical activities now because of their participation       (5.2).
Angry Planet was also educationally and creatively path-breaking       in including a signing choir from Great Baddow High School, which the Bach       Choir Report states, "was the first appearance of a signing choir at         the Proms."
(5.1).
Its educational impact has been enhanced       by public events about the project for adult learners, and audio       recordings, blog posts and commemorative booklets, all facilitated by UN       (5.3).
Demonstrating sustainable impact beyond the REF census date, the       UN's audio-blog post about Worcester (31 July 2013) has been referenced by       OUP's Choral Music website and a newsletter (September 2013), which was       distributed to over 3000 people globally (5.3).
Culture     The BBC Prom, Angry Planet, impacted on the public discourse of       cultural commentators and the choral music canon.
It was broadcast live on       Radio 3 from the Royal Albert Hall and was available to listen back to on       BBC Radio 3 I-Player for one week.
Articles preceding its World Premier       were published in Choir &amp; Organ and the Independent,       while, as evidence of Bennett, Chilcott and Hill's stellar reputations, Angry         Planet was a Time Out `Critics Choice' and featured in Metro's       `What's on Today' (5.4).
The Proms performance received positive reviews       in the Guardian, The Times, the Oxford Times (5.4),       and on websites such as Classicalsource.com (5 August 2012) and       larkreviews.com (6 August 2012).
A YouTube video posted by Bennett       and Chilcott two days after the BBC Prom and in association with OUP       (5.5), in which they discuss Angry Planet, was viewed by 728       people globally by 31 July 2013.
Angry Planet's large acapella       composition and green agenda impressed reviewers and spectators and made a       significant contribution to the choral canon (See The Times and       the Guardian in 5.4).
One audience member described its scale as, "breath-taking."
(5.1) Since the Prom and indicative of the growing international cultural       reputations of Angry Planet's creators, Hill has been       appointed Professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music (1 July 2013),       and Bennett's poem, `The Drowned Radio', will be read on Australian       Broadcasting Radio in 2014.
Angry Planet's cultural and economic impact has also been       manifested in the facilitation of further Bennett and Chilcott       composer/librettist collaborations that have developed its new forms of       artistic expression; these include Signum recordings and performances       (5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9).
The performance of another collaboration, My Lady         Poverty (Leeds Town Hall, 25 August 2012), like Angry Planet       embraced a diverse demographic of choral singers including York's Chapter       House Choir, The Lindley Junior School Choir, and Vocado (Swedish Choir of       the Year 2011).
However, it was Five Days That Changed the World       at the Worcester International Festival for Young Singers (Worcester       Cathedral, 26 July 2013) that most significantly increased the global       reach and creative significance of Chilcott and Bennett's collaborations       with young people (see reports in 5.3 and 5.8).
Internationalising Angry         Planet's use of youth choirs (5.3), Five Days was primarily       performed by four choirs from Russia, Austria, Spain and the UK to an       audience that the Worcester International Festival for Young Singers has       estimated consisted of 350 participants and 350 spectators.
