     Leeder's work has been disseminated to a wide variety of audiences       through symposia, public events, broadcasts, podcasts, close work with       writers and translation work in UK and abroad.
Impact can be gauged by       increased public interest, positive audience feedback and also by the fact       that events have generated sustained support from external public bodies.
The 20 year anniversary of German Unification offered a unique opportunity       for mediation of a major political and cultural event which brought       notable dissemination of Leeder's work in national media and repeated       invitations to work with organisations such as the BBC and Goethe       Institute (GI).
Leeder's research on GDR poets (&#167;3:1) is now a standard on university       reading lists in UK, USA and Germany, and is positively reviewed on trade       blogs (e.g.
`Very well written and very well informed', Shearsman[i]).
Her work has led to a longstanding engagement to bring these authors to       the attention of an English-speaking audience and to air the continued       legacy of German socialism with a lay public.
She has introduced many East       German writers to UK audiences at a wide variety of venues over the years       (South Bank, Edinburgh Festival, etc.
), creating awareness of the issues       involved and the contextual background, and helping to create a market for       their work (e.g.
Volker Braun in Oxford in 2008 to an audience of 85).
Leeder's translations of these writers (often the first publications of       their work in English) have also served to reach new English audiences       outside the academy[1].
She has undertaken translation       commissions of GDR writers for commercial publishers e.g.
of Volker Braun,       for International Poetry Review (USA April 2012), the Goethe       Institute- sponsored volume Kalendergeschichten (New Zealand,       2012) and for the prestigious UK poetry magazine Poetry Review       (June 2013).
Her translations of Uwe Kolbe were presented at a public       event for school teachers, students, poets and cultural workers, `Poetry       under pressure' with GDR poets Richard Pietra&#223; and Uwe Kolbe, Cardiff,       June 2012 [ii].
Feedback demonstrated that the event had       helped people to better understand the context behind GDR poetry,       heightening their appreciation and interest in the history and poetry in       this area.
Her translation of Durs Gr&#252;nbein's `Childhood in the Diorama'       (on his GDR childhood) won The Times Stephen Spender Trust Prize       2013[iii].
From Stasiland to Ostalgie (&#167;3:2) emerged from a seminar series in       2009 organized by Leeder, with international speakers, including Timothy       Garton Ash.
All events were in English, open to the public and attracted       wide public participation (audiences of 40-85) from outside the academy,       especially among the expatriate community[iv].
Uniquely for       such a venture, the German Embassy chose to promote it in their public       anniversary programme for 2009 and the series was visited by the German       Cultural Attach&#233;.
The high quality, timeliness and public impact of the       whole led to an invitation from the Embassy to launch the volume at the       Embassy-sponsored arts festival `Divided Skies 60 40 20', in January 2010       at The Soho Theatre, London, and to advise on and participate in a       specially commissioned panel discussion with GDR writer Anne Rabe, the       German Ambassador to London, David Tushingham (theatre practitioner), and       Hans Kundnani (journalist) among others (ticket sales of 60)[v].
The organizer of the festival commented: `I am very grateful to       [...] you for your valuable advice and help along the way.
And thank you &#8212;       combining the performative arts with intellectual thought was exactly my       aim'[2].
Such impact was not confined to UK.
The publicity for       the Stasiland volume led to an invitation to speak on the legacy       of the East German past in the cultural landscape at `The Changing Face of       Berlin', with Don Markwell, Peter Millar and Hartmut Meyer, Berlin, 7       November 2009 (to a public audience of 200) and a unique invitation to       take part in BBC Night Waves `Berlin Wall Twentieth Anniversary       Debate', live from Berlin on 9 November 2009 with Philip Dodd, Stefan       Aust, and Ingo Schulze (2.1 million listeners).
The BBC commissioning       editor commented `She has been a vivid, informed and passionate speaker in       many of my programmes including a live special broadcast from Berlin to       mark the 20th anniversary of the Wall coming down.
Her advice       and expert knowledge of the literature of the GDR was invaluable in our       preparations.
'[3]     `Re-reading East Germany' (&#167;3:3) involved a public symposium organized by       Leeder on 24-25 March 2011, with twelve international speakers[vi].
The symposium included a bi-lingual public reading with Durs Gr&#252;nbein       (&#167;3:4) and Michael Eskin chaired by Leeder to launch the trade book       Gr&#252;nbein, The Vocation of Poetry, trans.
Michael Eskin (New York,       2011) and to showcase the premiere (outside Germany) of Oktoberfilm       (2009) with a libretto by Gr&#252;nbein (audience of 70 - c. 50 from outside       the academy).
Feedback questionnaires on this event were uniformly       positive underlining the `exceptional quality' of the events citing       Leeder's paper and Gr&#252;nbein's reading as highpoints that caused attendees       to change their views.
Impact can be gauged from the fact that the South       Bank and GI organized a repeat performance of the reading at the Royal       Festival Hall on 29 March (ticket sales of c. 200).
The Spectres of the GDR project (&#167;3:6 and 7) has already       generated numerous opportunities for Leeder to collaborate in different       ways with artists, writers and thinkers interested in haunting: including       the Berlin avant-garde music and arts festival `CTM:12 - Spectrality' in       February 2012, a public conversation with philosopher John Gray at the       Purcell Room, London (audience of 700) on the way contemporary thought is       haunted by the legacy of Nazism and German totalitarianism [vii]       and the `Readers and Writers Festival' of New Zealand for a GI-sponsored       public event with GDR author Jenny Erpenbeck, discussing `Europe's Ghosts'       (March 13, 2012)[viii] which generated ticket sales of 200.
Leeder's event was one of a handful of the 50 festival events written up       for the local media and led directly to a radio spot on NZ radio (`Buried       Secrets' 28 March).
Leeder's work on spectres was further exploited in       interdisciplinary public event `Giving up the Ghost: The Haunting of       Modern Culture', which took place in Oxford in March 2012 and included       talks by high profile public figures from outside the academy (e.g.
the       artist Sarah Sparkes, the cultural commentator `k-punk', aka Mark Fisher,       and the UK poet David Constantine), and at which Leeder gave a talk on the       haunting of the Berlin Republic in theatre, performance, and photography       of the GDR.
Attendance included schoolteachers, photographers, artists,       curators.
Her GDR expertise means that Leeder is the `go to' person for BBC radio       and television on aspects of GDR and contemporary German culture (`a       brilliant reviewer, a reliable source of advice and inspiration [...] her       advocacy of German writers has brought neglected and new works to the       attention of me and my colleagues at BBC Radio Arts' &#8212; statement by BBC       radio editor).
[3] She is regularly invited to comment in the       national print media (e.g.
her research is cited by name in Boyd Tonkin,       `The Art Of Memory', in the Independent, 2 January 2009, pp.
18-19,       and she was also commissioned by the Independent to write an       obituary of controversial GDR writer Christa Wolf (7 December 2011) [ix]       and in person (e.g.
on the cold war and poetry and on the end of the GDR       at The Rest is Noise Southbank Centre), she was `In conversation'       with Anne McElvoy on the Stasi, Night Waves 10 February 2010 (1.9       million listeners); gave an interview for a BBC News Channel on `the end       of German war payments', 3 October 2010; and her Spectres project       led to an invitation to appear on Start the Week, 26 November 2012       with Andrew Marr (2.4 million listeners) [x].
