     With estimates of a 70% increase in the number of people in the EU aged       65 or over by 2050, the needs and challenges of an ageing population are       of increasing importance to all tiers of government and the private and       charity sectors.
Inclusive Design for Getting Outdoors (I'DGO) has engaged       and impacted on a diverse range of users across all these sectors,       primarily through its pool of non-academic partners totalling 37       organisations and two independent consultants.
One partner, a transport       planner, has said "the project has been very useful in opening up         dialogue [and] encouraging debate in a wide range of policy areas;         planning, design, transport and health and [engendering] a better         understanding of how they all fit together".
One example is Ward       Thompson's contribution, by invitation, to a Public Health Workshop on       Physical Activity by the Department of Health's Chief Medical Officer in       2012 during which she briefed multiple policy teams in Westminster on       I'DGO research findings.
In its guide to age-friendly placemaking, Lifetime Neighbourhoods       (2011; see 5.1, below), the Department for Communities and Local       Government (DCLG) describes I'DGO as "a very significant source of         research and guidance".
It suggests that local government and       resident-led groups should regularly check the I'DGO website for new       evidence and describes the Alliance work on green space, in particular, as       a "seminal" part of an evidence base which "has led to valuable         developments in terms of links between health commissioning and planning".
The free I'DGO guidance it cites, on open space and street design, is one       of only two such sources referenced in the World Health Organization's Global         Age-Friendly Cities: A Guide (2007; see 5.2).
Impact arising from       this includes in-depth collaboration with strategists developing the WHO       age-friendly cities of Edinburgh and Manchester, the provision of advice       to the Cabinet Office of Japan on its FutureCity initiative       (2012-2013; see 5.3) and work with the EU-funded SaMERU &#8212; Safer Mobility       for Elderly Road Users project (including citation in its Final Technical       Report).
Like DCLG, the Scottish Government has been a highly proactive partner in       I'DGO research.
In the last three years, it has asked for, and reflected,       I'DGO evidence and opinion in two policies in particular.
In Designing         Streets: A Policy Statement for Scotland (2010; see 5.4), we       specifically asked that the Government make clear that streets are of       benefit as destinations in their own right.
The published policy states       that "Scotland's best streets provide some of the most valuable social         spaces that we possess" and asks for planners to recognise that "Pedestrians         may be walking with purpose or engaging in other activities such as         play, socialising, shopping or just sitting".
When preparing its new policy on architecture and placemaking for       Scotland, the Government again invited I'DGO to contribute.
In our       response, we stressed that inclusive design could promote integration and       coordination between polices covering the built environment, health and       social care and economic growth (see 5.5).
This is emphasised in the final       Policy, published in June 2013 as Creating Places, where the       Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs writes, "In a         challenging economic climate, we should not question whether we can         afford to deliver good design.
Instead, we should ask, can we afford not         to?
Whether it is by supporting active, healthy lifestyles, or reducing         our carbon footprint, or being the critical factor which attracts         visitors and inward investment, the value of place cannot be         underestimated or ignored".
In addition, Ward Thompson was invited       to share I'DGO research during a targeted consultation on inclusive access       as part of this Policy's development phase and has since been invited to       join the group developing the Government's Scottish National Walking       Strategy (2013).
In October 2009, I'DGO was invited to participate in the pan-European       AENEAS (Attaining Energy-Efficient Mobility in an Ageing Society) project,       established under the Intelligent Energy Europe programme.
Given at a       training workshop on Walking and Traffic Safety in an Ageing Society       in Donostia-San Sebasti&#225;n, Spain, Ward Thompson's I'DGO presentation was       rated the "best and most useful" of 41 presentations given over       five CPD events for public and private sector stakeholders in urban       mobility across Europe (see 5.6).
Worldwide, I'DGO findings have been used       in training for over 1,000 professionals and, in the UK alone, for over       500 planners and highways engineers in six British cities as part of the       2010 national and regional roll-out of Manual for Streets 2: Wider         Application of the Principles by the Chartered Institution of       Highways &amp; Transportation (CIHT) and the UK Department for Transport       (DfT).
The consortium has since been approached by CIHT to review Transport         in the Urban Environment, its comprehensive guide to the design and       management of urban road networks.
At grassroots level, I'DGO's approach has always been to empower and       enable older people to create impact on their own terms.
The consortium       has been proactive in the Age Scotland campaign Walk in our Shoes; Act         on our Issues and promoted by Age UK in its Pride of Place       campaign, targeting local authority councillors and officers.
Engagement       with the City of Edinburgh's Council's City for All Ages Advisory       Group has included an I'DGO-hosted public event opened by the Lord Provost       of Aberdeen at the British Science Festival in September 2012, when an       82-year old Edinburgh resident debated age-friendly placemaking with       speakers from Age Scotland, Anderson Bell Christie Architects and a former       MSP.
The work has also helped to highlight older people's issues in the       media, including in The Herald newspaper, May 2012.
I'DGO is a case study in Making the Case for the Social Sciences:         Ageing (see 5.7), published by the British Society of Gerontology,       the Academy of Social Sciences and AgeUK.
The report was launched in       Westminster in July 2010 at a ministerial Q&amp;A led by [text removed for       publication], who, two years later, gave the opening address at the       presentation of the I'DGO TOO findings in the Headquarters of the European       Commission in the UK (see 5.8).
Seven elected members across the four UK       governments have publically supported I'DGO's work, with the Scottish       [text removed for publication] for Health, Wellbeing and Cities saying "The         findings are an important touchstone for those of us in policy         development, bringing real benefits to Scotland's growing number of         people aged 65+" (see 5.9).
In 2013, the consortium hosted fringe       receptions and panel events at both the Plaid Cymru Spring Conference in       Wales and the Local Government Association annual conference in       Manchester, blogging by invitation on the LGA conference website and in       its FirstOnline magazine.
I'DGO was a runner up in the International Design for all Foundation       Awards 2013, with one judge commenting "...there is a lot that others         can learn from their approach".
Our findings were used during the       development of FUTURAGE, Europe's new road map for ageing research; [text       removed for publication] Age UK [text removed for publication] described       them as part of an evidence base on mobility, access and the design of the       external environment which was "crucial to the development of the         research questions formulated in Chapter Two, Ageing Well at Home and in         Community Environments".
After Ward Thompson was invited to present       I'DGO findings at the Toward an age-friendly EU by 2020 conference       in Brussels (May 2013), [text removed for publication] AGE Platform Europe       wrote "Your visions and innovative solutions will help us to draw         recommendations on how to create/ adapt spatial environments to the         specific needs of our ageing populations [and] ... pursue our campaign         to create age-friendly environments across the EU" (see 5.10).
Drawing on I'DGO, and its promotion through KT-EQUAL, Ward Thompson has       also advised on the environmental implications of research funded by the       Canadian Institute for Health Research as part of the City of Vancouver's       Walk the Talk initiative.
