     The research has positively impacted the way in which public, private and       third sectors view and interact with their natural environment at the       following levels:                                Impact                 level 1:            Economic,               commercial and organisational &#8212; particularly in the             organisational context.
Impact                 level 2:            Public policy             &#8212; for example, through confirmation by the Environment Minister of             State [Lord de Mauley] (see Section 5).
Impact                 level 3:            Environment             &#8212; via a more positive disposition to the natural environment of the             public, scientists and other stakeholders.
Impact                 level 4:            Practitioners               and Professional services &#8212; through resultant changes in             practice of relevant groups such as teachers, lecturers and             scientists.
4.1 Evidence     The above four levels of impact are verified in the following six       evidence descriptors.
In order to aid clarity, each descriptor is       cross-referenced with `sources to corroborate each impact' (Section 5);       along with their associated `impact levels' as defined above.
This       correlation is presented in parentheses form at the end of each       descriptor.
1) Economic, commercial and organisational: over half a million people       have actively participated in the OPAL programme, including 100,000 people       in hard to reach communities.
The project engaged over 1,000 organisations       from the voluntary (53%), community (38%) and statutory (9%) sectors in       designing and delivering natural environment activities.
(Impact           levels 1, 3 and 4; Corroborative sources 1, 2, 6 and 8).
2) Public policy: has been positively impacted by the project and as a       result, so has society at large.
This was evidenced for instance, by Lord       de Mauley's presentation at the OPAL report event, which took place at the       House of Lords on 22nd January 2013.
(Impact level 2;           Corroborative sources 1, 2 and 7).
3) Societal impact: evidenced in that almost half of OPAL's participants       when questioned, said that taking part had changed the way they thought       about the environment.
Over one third of participants said that they would       improve their behaviour towards the environment &#8212; confirming more positive       environmental attitudes among society as a direct result of this project's       impact.
(Impact levels 2 and 3; Corroborative sources 3, 4, 6, 7           and 8).
4) Engagement and outreach: it was found that: i) being able to       contribute to a national research programme was a key motivating factor       for many participants; ii) for half of participants this was the first       time they had engaged in a scientific initiative; and iii) OPAL was       broadening peoples' natural environment knowledge and skills (90% of       participants said they had learnt something new).
(Impact           levels 1, 2 and 4; Corroborative sources 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).
5) Environment: findings identified that individuals' appreciation of       (and care for) the environment was essential for environmental       sustainability.
OPAL has extended the ways people can achieve this in the       following ways: i) more than 25,000 sites across England have been studied       by local people; ii) 230,000 field packs were distributed to schools and       community groups; iii) over 1,000 training courses were delivered; iv) the       public surveyed over 25,000 sites across England and entered the       information into the OPAL national database; v) communities contributed       data to local research studies; vi) scientists developed strong links with       local communities, helping the public gain greater understanding of what       scientists do and the relevance of science to their everyday lives; vii)       scientists found that working with the public was rewarding and can bring       real benefits to their research; viii) public involvement created a       greater sense of connection and ownership of local spaces; and ix) the       majority of scientists involved wanted to continue to engage the public in       their research.
(Impact levels 2 and 3; Corroborative sources 1, 3,           4, 5, 6, and 7).
6) Practitioners and professional services: have benefited in a variety       of different ways.
For example: i) OPAL's high quality science programme       has given confidence to both teachers and students to carry out more       fieldwork; ii) OPAL resources are stimulating, straightforward and       informative &#8212; over 800 primary and more than 1,000 secondary schools have       registered for OPAL materials; iii) over 2,000 people have taken part in       OPAL training sessions; iv) by involving people in their research,       scientists have made their work more relevant to everyday life; and v)       OPAL has developed new ways of bringing societies and communities together       to raise awareness of their work.
Nearly half of OPAL grant-funded       societies have increased their membership by more than 10% (Impact           levels 1 and 4; Corroborative sources 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9).
