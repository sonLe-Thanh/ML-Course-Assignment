     (a) Providing a rationale for investment (immediate users)       Jane Ellison, the Minister for Public Health, noted in November 2013 (5)       that SPEAR's research       on Change4Life Clubs "demonstrates the value of these clubs", and used SPEAR's       data on       physical activity increases as a rationale for existing and continued       investment in 13,500 school       Change4Life Clubs.
Although this speech took place after the end of the       impact period, the impact       described (that the research provided the rationale for existing and       continuing investment) falls       clearly within the impact period, as the investment commenced in 2010 and       the research has been       reported to government from July 2011.
In fact, similar comments were made       a year earlier by       Anne Sourby (6), the previous Minister for Public Health, who noted that       the SPEAR research       demonstrated that Change4Life Clubs were "an effective way of making sport       and physical activity       a lifelong habit", and used this to support the &#163;8.4m government       investment in the programme.
Finally, the Department of Health's submission to the House of Commons       Select Committee on       School Sport (7) used SPEAR's Change4Life research findings as       part of the case for their       investment of &#163;120m in school sport targeting children who are disengaged       from sport.
Similarly, LloydsTSB specifically note that "the reach of the programme       into 89% of schools"       (data provided by SPEAR's research) was why "we wanted to extend       this opportunity in the year       after London 2012" (8).
In addition, the rationale for a LloydsTSB pledge       in 2012 as part of the       Department of Health's Public Health Responsibility Deal to "inspire young       people in schools       across the UK to take part in more sport...through National School Sport       Week" is provided by       SPEAR research data on engagement in previous years, with the       evidence that the pledge has       been achieved to be provided by SPEAR's research in 2012 (9).
Finally, SPEAR data on       participation levels across the life of the NSSW programme was used as       part of a narrative about       LloydsTSB's role in The Journey to 2012 in its TV advertising campaign in       the summer of 2012.
(b) Contributing to the wider evidence-base used by policy-makers           (intermediate users)     Despite being undertaken in 2004, the work on girls participation has       continuing contemporary       currency in contributing to international, national and regional       policy-making evidence.
For       example, in 2012 alone UNESCO cite the work as part of their advocacy       brief for empowering girls       and women through sport (10), Canadian Sport for Life use the work in       their strategy for Actively       Engaging Women and Girls (11) and Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation       Association use it as       evidence for their Physical Activity Recreation Engagement Strategy (12).
In the UK, SPEAR's research on the first year of Change4Life       clubs, which demonstrated the       efficacy of a club model delivered in schools, was part of the evidence       base that informed Sport       England's &#163;41m commitment in its 2012-17 strategy, Creating a Sporting       Habit for Life (13), to       ensure that every secondary school in England will be offered a community       sport club on its site.
SPEAR's Change4Life research is also included in the Department of       Health report on the       evidence base for physical education and sport in schools (14) and the       Sport and Recreation       Alliance's report on the evidence base for the wider impact of sport (15),       noting specifically that       initiatives often fail to reach the least active as a result of poor       targeting and recruitment, and that       the engagement of the least active is dependent on creating an environment       were people both feel       respected and respect others regardless of their ability.
The Department       of Health's submission of       findings from the SPEAR Change4Life research to the House of       Commons Select Committee on       School Sport (7) is also a contribution to the wider evidence-base for       policy to engage the least       active young people in sport.
Press releases generated by LloydsTSB focus, of course, on what SPEAR's       research says about       the positive impact of NSSW.
However, in 2012/13 the releases also       included SPEAR's insights on       the importance of stronger club links, particularly the awareness of such       links among pupils, who       are important in promoting the clubs through word of mouth to their       friends, and noting that less       than a quarter of NSSW participants who joined new clubs were able to join       a club directly linked to       their school (8).
These releases generated 280 pieces of press coverage in       2012/13, with a PR       value of &#163;1.8m (16) and thus will have considerably raised awareness of       these issues among       policy-makers, practitioners and the wider public.
(c) Contributing to programme improvement (immediate users)       At the end of the school year in July each year a summary of the SPEAR       Change4Life research       and the way in which the Youth Sport Trust and other stakeholders will       address SPEAR's       recommendations is developed by the Youth Sport Trust (YST) and circulated       to its network of 450       School Games Organisers and the 8,000+ schools engaged in the programme to       date.
These       summaries provide clear evidence of the impact of SPEAR's research       in programme improvement       and investment which, specifically, has led to improvements in:             Leadership opportunities: YST advice to schools to create an         internal delivery team including         young people (17: 2012); YST developed a leadership pathway from years         5/6-13, "providing         opportunities to lead and volunteer on healthy active lifestyles within         and beyond Change4Life         Sport Clubs" (17: 2013); &#163;575,000 was invested, via County Sport         Partnerships, to deliver         coaching bursaries and courses to offer new leadership opportunities to         young people (17: 2011).
Participation pathways: the &#163;575,000 County Sport Partnerships         investment also created         pathways to "help young people participating in school-based Change4Life         Clubs take the next         step into community club sport participation" (17: 2011); development of         secondary Change4Life         Clubs has been integrated into sport national governing body whole sport         plans (17: 2013).
Targeting less active: YST developed guidance on defining less         active young people and directed         SGOs and schools to prioritise targeting less active young people (17:         2011), and this clearer         targeting advice in the first year of the primary programme resulted in         an 85% recruitment rate of         the less active (17: 2012).
Enhancing processes: YST re-wrote training packages to focus on         the key processes shown by         the SPEAR research to enhance physical activity outcomes (17:         2013); YST re-wrote resources         to present the club as a 24 week rather than a 12 week initiative         because attitude changes that         sustain physical activity changes had been shown to take longer to         develop (17: 2012; 2013).
LloydsTSB have noted that "through annual SPEAR research we also       understand the impact that       [NSSW] is having on young people, parents and teachers which enables us to       refresh the       programme for the following year, as required" (18).
Two major programme       improvements have       been, firstly, an increased focus on the recruitment and retention of       schools in the programme       each year, including the use of SPEAR's findings demonstrating       positive impacts on schools and       pupils in press releases (8), direct communications to schools (19) and on       the NSSW website to       highlight to schools the benefits of taking part.
Secondly, following SPEAR       recommendations       relating to the positive impact of novelty on less active pupils in 2010,       the "try something new"       programme theme, which was due to be changed after 2010, was retained as       part of the       programme for 2011 and 2012 (19).
(d) Impacts on young people's engagement and physical activity           levels (end users)       There is emerging evidence that the changes above, and particularly the       programme       improvements outlined in (c), are impacting positively upon the young       people themselves.
Improvements in programme targeting appear to have followed from YST       guidance and advice       developed based on SPEAR's findings in 2011, with the result that       the clubs reached a further       125,000 of the least active young people in 2012 and 2013 (17: 2013),       representing a doubling of       the proportion of less active young people joining clubs.
Similarly, the       &#163;575,000 investment in the       County Sport Partnership activity, developed following SPEAR's       recommendations on leadership       opportunities and participation pathways in 2011, has led to a further       8,000 young leaders being       trained and an additional 787 community clubs now linking to schools (3).
Following enhanced recruitment and retention activity developed as a       result of SPEAR's       recommendations in 2010 and 2011 that an increased emphasis was needed on       retaining schools       in the NSSW programme, 9,079 schools were retained in 2012 (2), an       increase in the proportion of       retained schools from 55% to 79%, an increase which represents over 1       million additional pupils       who benefitted from successive years participation in the programme.
