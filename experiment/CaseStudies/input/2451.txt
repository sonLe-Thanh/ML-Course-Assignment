     Pathways to impact       Walsh lead-authored a high-impact open-access clinical review (BMJ       341:doi:10.1136/bmj.c4408) authored/co-authored eight chapters/book       contributions from 2001-12 and has spoken on this topic at &gt;30 national       and international meetings from 2003-12.
He organised and hosted national       educational meetings on blood transfusion in 2004 and 2009.
Impact on public policy       Walsh has worked closely with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion       Service [5.1, 5.2] and Better Blood Transfusion Programmes (acting as       expert advisor from 2003, a member of the National Transfusion Committee       from 2005-12, and acting as Lothian Regional Lead 2004-8).
He played key       advisory roles (2005-10) in the development and implementation of the       Scottish Transfusion Epidemiology Project that links national databases to       report on blood use at regional, hospital and individual clinician level,       and in national audit initiatives around major haemorrhage management       (2008-9).
Walsh chaired a British Committee for Safety in Haematology/UK Intensive       Care Society evidence- based guideline group (2011-12), which completed       the first evidence-based UK guideline for RBC transfusion practice in       critical care [5.3].
Moreover, six of Walsh's papers are cited as part of       the underpinning evidence for US/international guidelines on transfusion       in critical care [5.4].
Walsh co-initiated the development of a National       Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guideline for Transfusion and was       selected as the UK critical care representative (first meeting 2013).
Impact on clinical practice and the economy       Impact on UK critical care: Walsh showed in 2001 that 40% of ICU       patients were transfused, each receiving on average 1.9 RBC units.
In       comparison, his 2010 analysis [5.5] of 2006 data from 29 ICUs showed that       transfusion rates had decreased to 33% of ICU admissions.
Data calculated       on the reduction in transfusion per admission over this period indicate       that of the &gt;100,000 patients treated annually in UK general ICUs,       around 7000 fewer patients receive RBCs compared with in 2001, saving       &gt;40,000 RBCs/year.
There have been substantial changes in practice       among clinicians, and a major saving in precious blood supplies as donor       numbers fall and production costs rise.
Impact on surgical practice: Evidence from critical care has been       widely implemented in surgical and perioperative practice.
The recognition       that RBC transfusions should be avoided wherever possible has led to an       increase in the use of blood conservation technologies, especially       perioperative cell salvage.
Walsh's study of cell salvage in orthopaedic       surgery supported the widespread introduction of this technology, and       Walsh initiated the Scotland-wide cell salvage programme, wrote the model       business cases, and secured ongoing funding from 2005 for a Scottish       coordinator to lead education, safety, and data management.
Red cell       salvage use has increased from 90 cases/million population (2005) to 650       cases/million population (2010), and the technology has been adopted       across all health boards in Scotland undertaking major surgery.
Overall and economic impact: Data from the Scottish Transfusion       Epidemiology Project indicate a reduction in annual RBC transfusions from       45.9 to 34.0 per 1000 population (2001 to 2012).
Trends in England       indicate similar reductions [5.6].
In Scotland, this represents a 50,000       units/year (22%) reduction in RBC use, at a cost reduction of       approximately &#163;6.5M/year (extrapolated to approximately &#163;100M annually       across the UK).
In intensive care, around 7000 fewer patients are exposed       to RBCs annually, saving 40,000 RBCs/year (annual cost saving       approximately &#163;5M).
Impact on health and welfare       Existing evidence suggests that restricting exposure to RBC transfusions       improves patient outcome, so practice change is likely to have directly       translated into saving lives.
In critical care, reducing RBC use is       associated with improved outcomes in many patient sub-groups [3.5].
A       reasonable but conservative estimate of 1-2% mortality reduction in the UK       over 10 years would indicate approximately 500 lives saved per year.
Although attribution of direct causality is difficult in critical care       populations, these changes are consistent with the progressive improvement       in Standardised Mortality Ratios in Scottish ICUs over the past decade       from 1.06 (2001) to 0.86 (2010) [5.7].
