     Cooper's collaborative research raises awareness about the relationship       between complex urban design decision-making and the creation of       sustainable cities where inhabitants can enjoy wellbeing and quality of       life.
This has had significant impact on government, local authorities,       planners, architects and developers:     1) Organisation Impact: The Urban Futures Toolkit and Methods       was used by Lancaster City Council (LCC) to assess planning for Lancaster       Luneside East.
The Senior Planner for Regeneration, Lancaster City       Council, stated `the method produced a `eureka' moment' and provided a       framework for the sustainable development of the site.
LCC used the Urban       Futures Method to instigate and inform public consultation, (January 2011)       and in the formulation, with the site developer, of a plan for commercial       development.
Moreover, it `invigorated the debate about this site       following a two-year period of stagnation, provided the catalyst for new       thinking, and the inspiration for those originally involved in site       discussions to engage actively again.'
The head of sustainability at CH2MHill, a multinational construction and       engineering company, adapted the Urban Futures Scenario tool and method       for use in CH2M Hill's `International Cities' project.
DSRS Universit&#224;       degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, and representatives from the Milan's nine       Zonas used Urban Futures Method to inform their policy of       decentralisation and address a prevalence of unused, council-owned       properties.
The Urban Futures Method has been adopted by BRE (formerly       Building Research Establishment) for consultancy, training and in       preparation of national and international standards and building         codes.
In 2012 The Royal Town Planning Institute introduced the urban         futures method to its network across England and the Isle of Man.
Work on density was reported in the Australian professional journal Urban         Design News and 130 planners, architects and urban professionals and       have taken up the findings through online downloads of The Little Book of       Density.
2) Policy Impact: The model of dimensions of the physical         environment that affect wellbeing was reported by Foresight in       October 2008.
Its launch was attended by over 300 policymakers and       journalists, and the Chief Scientific Advisor.
As part of the Foresight       Programme it impacted across government (Foresight Project Mental Capital       and Wellbeing One-Year Review, 2009): The Foresight Project and       Government Office for Science informed policy on mental health: New       Horizons: Towards a shared vision of mental health (July 2009).
Key points       were incorporated into the Public Mental Health Evidence Review and the       Dementia Strategy (in particular to support Objective 16, which called for       clear research evidence and needs); and No Health Without Mental Health: a       cross-government mental health outcomes strategy for people of all ages       (2011).
In 2009 John Denham the Secretary of State for Communities at the       Department for Communities and Local Government commented on the       importance of this research in informing policy: `the Department has         become much more aware of the ways by which we try and promote wellbeing         and positive mental health.
For example, we recognise the impact that         the local environment can have on people's wellbeing.
Through our         planning and regeneration policies, we are working to improve the         quality of neighbourhoods throughout the country'.
3) Wider policy impact: Cooper's research improves understanding       of the central role of design and the interconnectedness with disciplines       in addressing the complex challenges of creating sustainable urban       environments.
A key way of disseminating these impacts has been her       involvement with high-profile committees and external organisations:            i) in InfrastructureUK's Engineering Interdependency Expert Group, her         workshop leadership of 25 leading experts from IT, water, waste,         transport and energy industries contributed to recommendations to the         National Infrastructure plan 2011 (`EIEG has contributed to the         Government's work in this area' p.90);       ii) a special issue of the Journal of Health Communication         launched at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) Summit on Prevention and         Control of NCDs (September 2011).
A member WEF on Global Agenda Council         on Well-being and Mental Health reported that there was `a great deal of         interest in that paper as it gave new insights into the role of design';       iii) her presentation at a Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team         Roundtable (13 June 2012); noted as `a new initiative... looking at the         role of design and engineering in influencing human behaviour outcomes         involving behavioural researchers, designers and engineers.
';       iv) her membership of the European Innovation Leadership Board where         she has spoken about the contribution of design to innovation, with         recommendations to the EU Commission to invest in design.
This has been         adopted by the Action Plan for Design-Driven Innovation and EU funding         Call `European Design Innovation Platform' April 2013.
