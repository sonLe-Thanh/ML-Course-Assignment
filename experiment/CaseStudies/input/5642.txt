     Background to the impact     This research has had impact on both policy and industry practice within       the UK through the various editions of the Code of Practice, each       incarnation being shaped as a direct result of Reading research.
This       stands alongside the development of industry guidance notes and       consultation papers on lease pricing, directly impacting on professional       practice and industry change.
This impact is long term, commenced before       the REF period and continues throughout this period.
Specifically, before the current REF period, the changing policy agenda       was directly related to the findings of the Code Monitoring reports [3:1       and 3:2].
Evidence includes specific mentions by Raynesford, Cooper and       Chancellor Brown in Ministerial Statements (2000, 2005) and the 2005       Budget Speech (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407010852/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/bud05_chap03_229.pdf       Para 3.119, Page 76).
New policy strands which emerged following identification within the       Reading research were dissemination of the Code and small business tenants       (a major theme of the current REF period), Code revisions and assignment       and sub-letting.
The latter policy initiative led, a month after the       Ministerial Statement in 2005, to the British Property Federation       initiative, recommending members not to impose onerous alienation clauses       within existing leases, an initiative that has lasted throughout the REF       period.
Industry funded research also impacted on the policy agenda.
For       example, Reading contributed to the industry response to the 1993       Government consultation which resulted in Government opting for a       voluntary rather than a legislative solution and later research for the       RICS identified occupier concerns with the leasing environment.
These       findings informed the research questions for the second Code Monitoring       Report [3:2].
REF period impact     Research continues to impact on self-regulation of the industry     In the present REF period the research programme continued to impact on       policy and industry change.
First, "research published by Reading         ...... went some considerable way in informing the members of the lease         code working group as to its task" [5:5] of redrafting the current       Lease Code.
It is still in place and a "continuingly influential         guidance note to the property industry" [5:1].
The findings of       Reading's 2009 report [3.5] on dissemination provided government with the       evidence to maintain pressure on the industry, so playing a clear and       continuing role on the government's approach to self-regulation of       commercial property leasing.
This can be seen in the ministerial response       to the report: "This [Reading] report about dissemination and use of         the 2007 Code paints a very disappointing picture.
It suggests that         small business tenants are not receiving any substantive information on         the code from any source" which led to the policy statement to call       on the property industry " to redouble efforts to disseminate and use         the code" and "In particular, the professions-surveyors and         solicitors-have a special responsibility for making it available."
(http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090703/wmstext/90703m0001.h         tm).
It gave "additional impetus to those involved in industry to         ensure that small business tenants have access to the advice they need"       [5:5].
The Government response to the Portas review in 2012 illustrates       that the findings on dissemination continue to influence Government policy       on small business tenant awareness [5:5] and that the Government is aware       of the role played by the professional institutions, a role highlighted by       the findings of the 2009 Reading research report [3:5].
"We are         currently working on various options for disseminating the Code,         targeting small businesses and landlords who could benefit most from the         guidance offered by the Code.
We have written to key industry players         such as the British Property Federation, Royal Institute of Chartered         Surveyors and the Law Society, to urge greater promotion of the Code.
We         are already discussing a dedicated awareness-raising event with the         British Property Federation and The Royal Institute of Chartered         Surveyors.
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors will also         undertake a campaign to communicate the Code, and the need to abide by         it, to its 60,000 members."

Research is catalyst for new retail lease     A joint RICS and British Retail Consortium (BRC) new retail lease for       small businesses was launched in 2012.
This lease is short, is written in       plain English and provides flexible terms for a lease of up to five years       with no rent review.
It is to be read in conjunction with the current Code       for Leasing Business Premises.
This lease is a direct result of the       government policy focus on small businesses in leasing, which came about       because of the Reading research findings in 2002 and 2005, reinforced by       the 2009 research findings on the vulnerability of small business tenants       in the leasing process.
The Government (BIS) has linked this development       directly to the 2007 Code.
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-lease-to-make-life-simpler-for-small-businesses).
The role of Reading research in that process is confirmed by the chair of       the BRC Property Advisory Group (It "would not have happened without         the resultant debate and negotiation within the industry following the         publication of [Reading's] commercial lease research") and the chair       of the working party which produced the standard lease stated that the       2009 Monitoring Report (3:5) helped "to ensure that the form of lease         such tenants are expected to sign is more reasonable" [5:5].
Commercial lease pricing and the treatment of leasing incentives     The third and fourth major REF period impacts arising from this extended       research programme are on commercial lease pricing.
The PI, through       membership of the RICS Red Book editorial board and Property Valuation       Forum in the 1990s and, more latterly, in his current dual roles on the       RICS Valuation Standards Board and IPD Industry Consultative Committee,       has been at the centre of industry discussions surrounding leasing       incentives including their impact on rental valuation and on index       construction.
First, having drafted the RICS VIP in 2006 on leasing       incentives, the content of the RICS VIP has remained the main guidance to       UK valuers throughout this REF period and has been upgraded into an RICS       Red Book Guidance Note.
The Red Book and associated papers are the major       source of valuation guidance for all Chartered Surveyors operating in the       UK and overseas.
Its practice statements are mandatory on all surveyors       [5:4].
Second, the PI identified issues with the application of the leasing       incentives at the 2000 IPD industry conference, (3:3), and, as stated by       the Founding Director of Investment Property Databank, has been "heavily         involved along with us at IPD and the RICS in a 12 year debate         concerning the most appropriate industry response" to these issues       [5:2].
This culminated in the IPF funded consultation paper [3:6] setting       out the solution to the identified problem.
Following industry wide       circulation of the paper, written responses and a series of follow-up       seminars with the Reading research team, the changes to the indices have       been agreed.
This agreement accepts the Reading format for new rental       value and equivalent yield series covering 21,000 commercial properties       worth &#163;140 billion.
The claims for impact of the Reading research on this       process are supported by IPD, RICS [5:4] and IPF [5:3].
For example, "Not         only have Crosby and Devaney identified and investigated the problems         .., they have also worked hard to identify the most pragmatic and         implementable solution" [5:3].
