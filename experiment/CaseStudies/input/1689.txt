     Cranfield's research has enabled Chemring, a world leader in munitions,       pyrotechnics, countermeasures and counter-technologies against improvised       explosive devices (C-IEDs), to formulate future products across their       portfolio helping to ensure a viable future in this important       manufacturing and development area of UK business.
In particular in the       countermeasures area Chemring have succeeded in capturing &#163;184 million of       the global &#163;360 million market [C3].
Specific examples of Cranfield's research impact are as follows:            Contributions to improving the Chemring software "CounterSim" for the         modelling of Man- Portable Air-Defence (ManPAD) missile threats while         gaining insights into pre-emptive decoys.
This has permitted the company         to enhance its delivery of training on modelling to overseas customers         by enabling seeker launch sequences to be analysed by Chemring customers         and enabled comparisons of existing products with potential future         products.
It has also resulted in a product improvement plan for         Chemring's computer modelling software CounterSim [C1, C2].
The         work on advanced Man-Portable Air-Defence (ManPAD) modelling was able to         demonstrate some advanced features that are employed in early generation         missile seekers which represent a significant threat to current         in-service aircraft and thus enabled Chemring engineers to develop         improved models for the licensing of the CounterSim model [C1,         C2].
Following successful implementation of the product improvement plan         referred to above the enhanced CounterSim model delivers much         improved support for studying countermeasure applications for UK and         overseas customers in both the military and civilian markets [C1, C2].
Improvements to CounterSim with regard to infrared (IR)         imaging has provided the incentive to link CounterSim directly         to Matlab.
This enables rapid testing of new ideas and delivers the         capability of running advanced image processing techniques using the         Matlab tools.
This work has been most useful with regard to the         "Centurion" launcher programme and has helped in the development of the         algorithms used for protection against IR guided missiles by confirming         the need for low launch angles and control of a wide range of azimuth         angles [C1, C2].
The Centurion launcher product is now a commercial success as         evidenced by recent international interest and mentions in the press and         on the Internet of collaboration between Chemring and Raytheon [C4, C5,         C6].
