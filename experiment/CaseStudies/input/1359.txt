     The results of the research described in Section 2 indicate a pressing       need to support disadvantaged pupils throughout the school years and       beyond.
As a result of our follow-up of disadvantaged adults who had       attended an ICAN school, more support is given now to 16 year olds moving       from school to work; workshops are available for their parents; and       specific teaching on the theory driving test is offered [S1]       However, the task of supporting language and literacy development in       mainstream settings needs to be from nursery through to adulthood and is       of such a scale that it cannot be addressed by speech and language       therapists alone.
It is crucial that school staff are trained to enhance       children's language, communication, and literacy skills.
In collaboration       with the local education authority, Stackhouse, with HCS colleagues Clegg       and Trott, has overseen the development and roll-out of training       programmes for teachers and support workers in schools and nurseries in       the most socially deprived areas of Sheffield.
The result has been a step       change in the knowledge base of teaching staff in the schools involved, in       relation to language and literacy, as feedback such as the following       attests: "This is the first course I have attended for a while where I         have learnt new information" (Nursery nurse); "It made me think         about how children actually `pick up' and use vocabulary" (Primary       teacher).
The development of the training programmes delivered in the census period       has built on an initiative dating from 2005, when sponsorship money from a       University Tall Ship voyage (&#163;32,000) was secured by Stackhouse for HCS's       work on supporting socially disadvantaged children in Sheffield in       collaboration with the then Education Action Zone (EAZ).
In 2005-07 we       piloted the development of training materials with staff in 24 mainstream       schools.
In the school year 2007-08, when the EAZ was replaced by `The       Learning Year' (LY) in Sheffield, our area of work in Language and       Communication was the only project retained.
In 2008 the LY funded       teaching cover for 28 staff in 14 schools so that these staff could take       part in our training programme.
Promoting children's vocabulary,       conversation, listening and attention skills, the programme was delivered       through talks, workshops, and supervised practice of structured small       group teaching within the schools.
In addition, a senior part-time project       worker within the school service was funded by the LY to act as a link       between HCS and the schools.
In 2009, additional materials were requested       to help teachers to support children's early literacy development; these       became part of the schools' `Every Child A Writer' initiative.
The       training was extended to ten more schools and included nursery staff and       also staff in a special school, reaching around 1,440 children in 2008-10.
[S2]     The impact of the training was felt by all stakeholders:     a) the staff involved, for instance one teacher reported that "it         has given me different strategies to use when teaching vocabulary";     b) the pupils, as teachers observed an improvement in their       listening, attention and vocabulary skills following targeted small group       work.
One teacher reported that "it has given a group of children         confidence and more abilities to learn in a class environment";     c) the Learning Year itself: the project was a means of       developing the role and responsibilities of the Teaching Assistants and "something         to be proud of &#8212; something professional".
The training handbook       developed from these training courses was officially launched in November       2008 and is now in all the nurseries and primary schools that took part,       also elsewhere by request e.g.
Leicester Education Authority.
Evidence for       its impact is the take-up by city-wide children's services, e.g.
Every         Sheffield Child Articulate and Literate (ESCAL) in Sheffield.
These       services have incorporated principles and components from the handbook in       order to improve the learning potential of their socially disadvantaged       children.
The national Communication Champion [S3], in her `Two       Years On &#8212; Final Report' "praises the work of community-wide strategies         to promote improved communication skills for all children such as         Sheffield's `Every Sheffield Child Articulate and Literate by 11' and         the Stoke Speaks Out early years campaign [based on the original       work in Sheffield by Ann Locke] that has reduced the percentage of 3-4         year olds with delayed language from 64% in 2004 to 39% in 2010".
ESCAL also received a Communication Strategy Award in 2011as part of the       Communication Trust's national `Shine a Light Awards'.
In 2010 the reach of this work was extended to include children from       Roma, Gypsy and Traveller backgrounds, their teachers and their parents.
In 2011 an early career knowledge transfer grant (&#163;38k) awarded to Fricke       allowed HCS research staff to work in collaboration with the Ethnic       Minority and Traveller Achievement Services (EMTAS) of Sheffield City       Council (now covered by Targeted Intervention Services for Children and       Young People) [S4].
Teaching assistants have been trained to       develop the vocabulary and language skills of 96 children, attending 12       nurseries or children's centres in Sheffield.
These children had performed       poorly on language screening measures.
As a result, there was a       significant improvement in the children's confidence, attention and       vocabulary development [S5].
Furthermore, the Teaching Assistants       (TA) increased their own knowledge and skills and were more aware of how       children learn language and how to improve their own communication skills       when working with them: "A fantastic programme"; "I would like         to continue working with EAL children and have asked for further         training at work".
One parent of an EAL child spontaneously       commented: "I can see a big improvement in his ability naming things,         counting and speaking English.
So big thanks for supporting my child".
When EMTAS nominated a Teaching Assistant from this project to present at       an EAL Champion Event in Sheffield, she concluded by saying `I'm         totally behind this product!'
The Tall Ship project is maintained in both nurseries and primary schools       in Sheffield in collaboration with the LY and is integrated into student       training placements.
In 2012 support was extended to include adolescent       pupils at a secondary school in the same disadvantaged area of Sheffield [S6].
This support builds directly on our research (reference 3 above) by       developing pupils' understanding of specific curriculum vocabulary in       order to enhance access to the curriculum.
Our intervention not only       improved pupils' comprehension of curriculum words ("I learned words         like discriminate &#8212; I didn't have a clue, now I do"; "I learned         loads - interpret, or sustain, ...
I heard of them but         never really understood what it meant ..."), but also had a wider       impact: "I learned not to swear, and not to bully"; "I'm more         confident speaking to different people".
The experience of developing a range of school-based programmes has       enabled HCS researchers to support practitioners to evaluate their own       programmes.
Through publication in key practitioner- focused journals, and       training days /forums, HCS staff have increased the number of       practitioners trained to do this.
For example, we organised two national       conferences specifically on `Evaluating Intervention and Service Provision       in Schools' (200 participants) and four papers on this topic were       published by HCS researchers in a special issue of Child Language         Teaching and Therapy in 2011.
Further, an article on how to evaluate       a multidisciplinary training programme (Wright, Stackhouse and Wood) was       the most downloaded article published by that journal in 2010-11.
HCS's expertise in this area has led to our researchers working with the       charity ICAN to evaluate its own programmes, which are designed to support       the development of speech and language skills in all children, including       those children with impoverished language Through competitive tender and       then by invitation, HCS staff were chosen to evaluate two of ICAN's       national training and support packages.
ICAN reports on its website the       impact of these programmes with reference to our evaluations.
For Primary         Talk, the work was carried out in primary schools in Bradford.
With       reference to Secondary Talk, ICAN report:"...Secondary Talk was         piloted in 14 secondary schools nationwide, rigorously evaluated by         Sheffield University and has been shown to improve both behaviour and         engagement in learning."
[S1]     The work begun at Sheffield by Anne Locke on social disadvantage and       language continues to be cited in key documents such as in the Save         the Children Report on Early Language Delays in the UK (2013), and       the All Party Parliamentary Group Report on the link between       speech and language difficulties and social disadvantage (2013).
Thus, HCS       staff have had an impact on policy makers and children's charities, as       well as on school staff, pupils and families.
