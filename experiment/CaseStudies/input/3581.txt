     Karpf's research on the human voice has generated considerable debate       about its important role in diverse settings.
The beneficiaries of her       work have been both professional voice-users and the general public (her       book was discussed by a wide range of websites, phone-in callers and       reviewers).
The impact of her research is indicated in four ways:     Firstly, the four foreign editions of The Human Voice and its       recent publication as an ebook demonstrate the international interest       generated by her study.
She drew on extensive scholarly research and made       it accessible, reaching wide and varied readerships and stimulating lively       online debate from a diversity of bodies, including the European Institute       of Brand Management (www.eurib.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/PDF/Personal_branding_ENGELS/w_-_The_human_voice__EN_.pdf),       the British Voice Association (www.britishvoiceassociation.org.uk/books_TheHumanVoice_AnneKarpf.htm),       a Huffington Post blog (www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-g-goldberg-phd/importance-of-mothers-voice_b_899514.html)       and Polish television.
Secondly, the book was serialised in the Guardian, and was       reviewed in the Independent, the Sunday Telegraph, the Guardian,       and the Sunday Times, as well as many foreign newspapers and       magazines, including The New Yorker.
Thirdly, Karpf's many broadcasts dealing with her research generated       discussion about the role and importance of the human voice among many       different constituent groups.
She appeared on `BBC Breakfast' on BBC1 (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/5359618.stm),       and in 'The Voice', a BBC Four documentary (broadcast four times in 2008)       on why the synthesised voice sounds unnatural, as well as in an Australian       documentary on the human voice broadcast on the European arts and culture       channel, Arte, in 2013.
On radio she discussed her research on BBC Radio       4's 'Start The Week', Radio 3's `Night Waves' and over a dozen phone-in       programmes in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
In 2012 a half-hour       interview with her about the voice was broadcast on the Australian network       ABC's national radio programme `Lingua Franca', and she discussed       intonation with Stephen Fry on his BBC Radio 4 programme 'Fry's English       Delight' (www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01m182n).
In 2013 she talked about women and radio on the South African radio       network SA FM, while she also wrote and presented an the hour-long BBC       Radio 4 programme on the history of women's voices on radio and television       &#8212; 'Archive on 4: Spoken Like a Woman' &#8212; which was listed in the Radio         Times' `Top Tip of the Week' and its `Critics' Choice' (www.radiotimes.com/episode/twhbv/spoken-like-a-woman).
The Controller of BBC Radio 4 chose it as `Documentary of the Week' for a       Radio 4 podcast and it was also selected for permanent presence on       iPlayer.
Finally, Karpf developed her ideas about the voice in many different       symposia and events.
These included 'La Voca Humana', a seminar held at       Roma 3 University, Rome (October 2006); the seminar series 'Our Speaking       Selves' held at the ICA (2009) (www.ica.org.uk/19587.twl);       a lecture (now a podcast), `Bellowed Endearments and Echoes of Resistance:       How the Voice Bonds and Unbinds in Smadar Dreyfus's "Mother's Day"',       delivered at Magasin 3 Gallery, Stockholm (2009); and `The Right to       Silence' symposium (chaired by Karpf) organised by Electra (a London-based       art organisation) at The Showroom gallery (2012)       (www.electraproductions.com/email/RightToSilence_II.html).
Testimonials from the Artistic Director of the Norwegian organisation       nyMusikk and from a well known writer, broadcaster and Professor have       corroborated the impact of Karpf's research on the gendered voice on radio       professionals, arts practitioners and broadcasting policy; her work       prompting a redress of discrimination against the female voice.
The       Artistic Director of nyMusikk reported that Karpf's `Her Noise' symposium       in Oslo `gathered much attention and Anne's talk was especially well       received' and, following the event, `a number of organisations approached       the Norwegian Arts Council and the Cultural Department to highlight the       discrepancy of female to male composers and songwriters.
After many       meetings, funding was awarded for projects aimed at redressing the       imbalance' (Testimonial from Artistic Director of nyMusikk, 2013).
According to the writer, broadcaster and Professor, `Anne's work       certainly had a sociological impact (it is now difficult, if not       impossible, to debate the voice as a communicative medium without hearing       her work invoked), but [it also had considerable impact] in awakening       radio professionals to the relationship between gender and voice ...
In       recent years the debate about the role of women in the media has come, in       one form or another, to dominate the headlines.
Anne's work not only       informs this important debate, but has directly influenced the behaviour       of media decision-makers.
It has had a very real and very productive       impact upon the nature of radio talk' (Testimonial from writer,       broadcaster and Professor, 2013).
Karpf's research on the human voice led to a &#163;7,000 grant by the       Winnicott Trust to research Donald Winnicott's BBC broadcasts, 1943-62.
This resulted in an Institute of Historical Research seminar (2013), and a       BBC Radio 4 'Archive on 4' programme &#8212; 'From Donald Winnicott to the       Naughty Step' &#8212; which Karpf researched and presented.
