     An assessment of the impact of his research involves three aspects &#8212;       impact in relation to current practice and procedures, reform of the law,       and international developments.
The impact has been in relation to       defining the debate; changing attitudes; developing policies practices and       procedures; and reforming the law.
The impact of his research is partly based in Wales, but extends beyond       including to the other nations of the UK and the international community.
Within Wales, there is a strong movement in favour of reform.
Professor       Williams continues to make a significant impact on the development of       policy and the content of legislation which has direct consequences for       health and welfare, social care practitioners, and the public policy and       the law.
This is demonstrated by the following examples of his engagement       outside of academia:            Legislative advisor to the Health and Social Care Committee of the         National Assembly for Wales on the Stage One Report of the Social Care         and Wellbeing Bill 2013 (SSW(W)B 2013) (5.e);       He is one of five members of the Welsh Government's Safeguarding         Advisory Panel charged with implementing the new safeguarding powers in         the SSW(W)B 2013;       Membership of the Expert Group on Human Rights of Older Persons United         Nations, New York 29-31 May 2012;       Membership of the Older People's Commissioner's Advisory Panel as part         of her statutory review of care homes in Wales;       Membership of the Wales Advisory Committee of the Law Commission for         England and Wales (5.j).
His article in the Statute Law Review (3.i) was         acknowledged by the Chair of the Law Commission as one of the factors         leading to the setting up on the Welsh Advisory Group;       Member of the Welsh Government advisory group on drafting a         Declaration of Rights of Older People in Wales.
The draft declaration is         now out for consultation;       Active involvement with Age International and Help Age International         on the need for an international convention.
The award in 2012 (with Clarke and Wydall) of a grant from the Welsh         Government to evaluate the Access to Justice Pilot Project on protecting         victims of elder abuse and the resulting report (3.h) is now being         considered by the Government and will contribute to new practitioner         guidance following the passage of the (SSW(W)B 2013.
As legislative advisor to the National Assembly's Health and Social         Care Committee he made a significant contribution to the Committee's         report on Stage 1 of the SSW(W)B 2013.
His contributions are referred to         in the report and in particular his draft statutory principles and         definition of well-being are incorporated as part of the specific         recommendations (5.e).
As a member of the Welsh Government's         Safeguarding Advisory Panel he is directly responsible for drafting the         policy framework for the statutory regulations and code of guidance         around safeguarding and protection.
This involves extensive consultation         of stakeholders in the public and third sectors (5.f).
His work with the panel of twelve international experts on human rights         and older people set up by the United Nations Office of the High         Commissioner for Human Rights is recognition of the reach and impact of         his research and contribution to the debate on the human rights of older         people.
Williams was the only academic member of the group.
Its         deliberations formed the basis of the report to the General Assembly         Open Ended Working Group set up to strengthen the protection of human         rights of older people.
The expert panel considered, inter alia, the         international aspects of elder abuse and access to justice.
Professor         Williams presented papers to the group on each of these subjects.
His         contributions were included in the final report to the Open Ended         Working Group.
In recognition of his expertise, Professor Williams was appointed as a         Trustee of Help the Aged and, following its merger with Age Concern, is         now a trustee of Age UK and Age Scotland.
As a trustee, he actively         contributes to the development.
As a trustee of Help the Aged, Williams         played a key role in the merger between it and Age Concern.
He was a         member of small joint panel charged with the task of bringing the two         organisations together.
As well as the complex mechanics of the merger,         he provided significant input into the identification of the mission of         the new charity, namely to eradicate ageism and to promotion of the         rights of older people.
Age UK is recognised as being the voice         of older people (5.b).
In addition to his papers at academic conferences, Professor Williams         has spoken at many professional and practitioner conferences on the law         and the human rights of older people including presentations to many         voluntary organisation and others campaigning against elder abuse (for         example, the Royal College of Nursing Cymru, and the Dignified         Revolution).
Other non-academic presentations include political party         fringe events, Speaking up for Age Conferences, the British         Psychological Society, Age Cymru, the International Academy of Law and         Mental Health, the Older People and Ageing Network, and the         International Congress of Psychology and Law.
These contributions have         raised awareness of older people's rights within different professions         and at a political level, as well as the third sector.
Following         publication of its Working Paper on Social Care Law, Professor Williams         participated in a Law Commission consultation conference in         Cardiff(5.g).
He presented a paper before members of the Commission and         consultees, on the case for reforming the law on elder abuse and the         possibility of doing this on a Wales only basis.
Whereas the Law         Commission's Working Paper advocated a combined England and Wales         approach, the final Report recognised the possibility of a Wales only         approach, particularly since the National Assembly acquired primary law         making power.
The impact on practitioners and professionals has been achieved through         informing them of the legal framework and shaping policy.
As his         research with Clarke and Wydall demonstrates, current criminal and civil         justice seeking options are underused mainly because practitioners are         unaware of what is available.
The impact of his research is evidenced by         the Protection of Older People in Wales: A guide to the law -         Professor Williams was invited by the Older People's Commissioner (as         part of her legal duty to raise awareness amongst practitioners of the         law and older people in Wales), to write this Guide (5.a).
It is written         in accessible language, available online (5.d) and in hard copy and         provides a definitive guide for the social care, health and voluntary         sector workforce.
It features on the websites of many organisations         including the Welsh Local Government Association (5.h) and the NHS Wales         website (5.i).
It is widely used in social care, health, voluntary         sector and by disability and other third sector groups.
It provides         advice for practitioners on the existing legal framework to protect         older people.
The key purpose of the Guidance is to ensure that law is         used, and that it is use effectively by practitioners to improve the         lives of older people experiencing abuse &#8212; the welfareist response to         abuse is not, on its own, sufficient and may deny older people access to         justice.
For practitioners, the Guidance provides essential information         on the range of options available.
For those experiencing abuse, it is         empowering and assists them to make informed decisions.
The         International Federation on Ageing has identified the Guide as evidence         of good practice for other jurisdictions both in the United Kingdom and         beyond.
The Minister for Social Services in the Welsh Government has         commended it.
A recent initiative by the Welsh Government is to introduce a         Declaration of Rights of Older People.
The Older People's Commissioner         was given the responsibility for drafting this declaration.
Professor         Williams was one of the co-authors of the declaration (5.a).
Although it         will not have legal effect, the Government's intention is that the         principles should be embedded in the culture of the public sector         throughout Wales.
Internationally Williams's impact is evidenced through the recognition         by the United Nations of his contribution to the debate on older         people's rights and his central involvement in the UN Open Ended Working         Group (5.c).
He has also advises Age International on constructing its         case for an international convention (5.b).
Age International is the         only UK national charity that works for older people throughout the         world.
It works in conjunction with Help Age International &#8212; the only         international charity working to promote the rights of older people.
The         impact of Williams's involvement has been to advise on the scope of any         future convention and its relationship with existing international and         regional provision (5.b).
An impact through participation in law reform is apparent.
His         involvement with the United Nations, the Welsh Government, the National         Assembly, the Older People's Commissioner for Wales, and with national         and international third sector bodies demonstrates a significant real         contribution to the shape of future social care and safeguarding law,         particularly for older people.
