     Although individually infrequent, collectively rare diseases are common       and have a profound effect       on patients and their families (as around 80% are inherited, family       members may be affected or at       risk of having affected children).
The need to improve the diagnosis and       management of rare       diseases is important not only because of the overall numbers of people       affected, but also because       many common clinical syndromes are now believed to comprise subsets of       rare diseases.
An       investigation by Rare Disease UK found that 46% of patients waited over a       year for correct       diagnosis following onset of symptoms (with 19% waiting from 5 to over 20       years), 46% were       misdiagnosed initially, and "the majority of patients' care is poorly       coordinated" [1].
This is because       clinical expertise and resources for such patients can be scarce and       complex treatments can       involve several specialists, who may have little or no experience in       identifying optimal care       pathways for rare conditions.
In 2009, Sir Liam Donaldson (then Chief       Medical Officer of England)       highlighted diagnosis and management of rare diseases as one of five key       areas of public health       for the NHS to tackle in his Annual Report.
In Birmingham, Professor Tim Barrett has driven fundamental research into       the genetic causes and       molecular mechanisms of rare diabetes syndromes: meticulously mapping real       patient needs and       requirements for optimised multi-disciplinary care in these patients by       detailed genotype-phenotype       studies.
He has successfully translated this work into clinical practice,       which has transformed the       care for the affected patients and their families.
His initiatives to work       with patient groups in       developing services have just been highlighted in a new Rare Disease UK       report on criteria for       centres of excellence [2].
Specific impacts include:     1.
The development and implementation in routine clinical practice of a         national genetic         diagnostic testing service for Wolfram and Alstrom syndromes,       facilitated by the       characterisation of the genes for these conditions by Professor Barrett's       team.
These tests are       offered through the West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, which has       now become the       national reference centre for genetic testing for these two       diseases, with both tests adopted by         the UK NHS Diagnostic Testing Network (UKGTN) [3].
The NHS service       also undertakes       genetic testing for Spain, Malta, India, Brazil, Slovenia and Iran.
2.
The establishment of nationally commissioned, highly specialised         multidisciplinary         services for Wolfram, Alstrom and Bardet-Biedl syndrome patients.
Molecular and clinical       research in Birmingham has transformed healthcare in several inherited       versions of diabetes and       obesity that are characterised by multi-system involvement; this means       that affected patients do       not only suffer from diabetes and obesity but also have other complex       multisystem problems       requiring multi-disciplinary care.
Professor Barrett's laboratory work in       this respect has tied in       closely with his patient care, and through this he has improved quality of       life for patients through       integrated multi-disciplinary specialist care established as nationally       commissioned services.
Further work from this group has led to the successful application to       deliver highly specialised       multidisciplinary services for Wolfram syndrome and Alstrom syndrome       (University Hospitals       Birmingham (UHB) and Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH) are the national       centres for adults       and children respectively delivering both of these services), as well as       Bardet-Biedl syndrome       (UHB and BCH are two of the four centres delivering this service) [4-6].
These services are       commissioned by NHS England and deliver a `one stop shop' service to       patients from all over the       UK, Northern Ireland, and abroad.
Data from their national audit days       shows objective and       measurable improvements in quality of life, earlier ages at diagnosis, and       children reaching       adulthood with reduced morbidities compared to children before the       services were established [7].
These highly specialised services are regarded by patients and staff alike       as `the jewel in the       crown' of the NHS for their patient-centred care, individualised       appointments and coordination of       services to maximise efficiency, and their efforts were recognised by an       award from Alstrom       syndrome UK at their 10th anniversary conference to celebrate       the establishment of the world's first       Alstrom syndrome paediatric clinic at BCH [8].
Orphanet (www.orpha.net) is the       European portal for rare diseases and orphan drugs and the       repository for European services, reports and resources in the field.
The       three services in       Birmingham for Wolfram, Alstrom, and Bardet-Biedl syndromes are listed as       Designated European       centres of expertise for these conditions, and receive referrals from       other European states       (including Malta, Spain, Republic of Ireland) who do not have designated       specialist centres [9].
Professor Barrett also chairs the NHS England Clinical Reference Group       for Specialised Diabetes,       responsible for advising the NHS on rare disease services.
Under Professor       Barrett's leadership       since April 2013, the impact has been to revise each service       specification, setting process and       quality standards, and creating quality dashboards with which NHS England       will monitor outcomes       [10].
3.
The creation of a European network of excellence as a platform for         rapid translation of         research progress into clinical care, and influencing international       best practice.
Under the       leadership of Professor Barrett through the EU funded EURO-WABB       (European Wolfram-Alstrom-       Bardet-Biedl) project [11], a European reference network for these rare       diseases has been       developed, incorporating a network of European genetic testing       laboratories, a European registry       with over 300 patients registered from 13 different states, and consensus       management guidelines       for health professionals.
The network has just been presented at a       dedicated symposium at the       European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology international meeting,       presented at the International       Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes meeting, and has been       selected by the Directorate       General for Health as an exemplary European public health project.
This has informed policymakers both within the rare disease community in       the UK as well as those       developing plans internationally to support rare diseases.
For example,       Washington University       wrote a letter of support [12] stating that "Professor Barrett         presented details of this initiative to the       International Wolfram Syndrome meeting in Paris in 2010.
After hearing         Professor Barrett's         presentation, Professor Alan Permutt at Washington University began         organizing a Wolfram         Syndrome Research Clinic in St Louis.
This research clinic began with 10         patients in 2010 and now         has 23 enrolled patients seen annually.
Our research clinic has been         supported by the American         Diabetes Association, Washington University and the Jack and J.T.
Snow         Foundation".
Similar       support was given to colleagues in Almeria, Spain, and their local       Hospital "La Inmaculada" wrote       to confirm that "...the meetings on Wolfram's held in Paris within the         EUROWABB framework         project, specially, the 2010 meeting, provided me with a quite clear         idea of how to organise a         Clinical Unit on Wolfram's syndrome.
Based on these ideas, arisen in         these meetings, I organized         the clinical unit of Wolfram's syndrome in Almeria, Spain.
I discussed         with Dr Barrett, the setting up         of our Wolfram clinic.
This now includes an expanding multidisciplinary         team.
Children and young         adults attend over 2 days for a range of investigations."
[13]     Children with the rare diabetes syndromes Wolcott-Rallison and Thiamine       Responsive       Megaloblastic Anaemia, Diabetes and Deafness (TRMA) are also seen in the       NHS national       multidisciplinary rare disease clinics established in Birmingham; and       included in the international       EURO-WABB rare diabetes syndromes registry, ensuring that the clinical       infrastructure established       by Professor Barrett and colleagues to translate University of Birmingham       research findings into       improvements in patient care is used to its full potential.
