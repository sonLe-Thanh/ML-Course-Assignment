     Consumer impact &#8212; better looking, higher quality vehicles     The look of a vehicle plays an important role in the purchasing decision.
Customer feedback and announcements show that Aesthetica helps       manufacturers to maintain consistency in the looks of their vehicles       through better dimension control of parts and by redesigning, at an       earlier stage, to avoid high imperfection rates [A].
Icona customers say       that application of Aesthetica improves how the quality of       products are perceived at all major phases of the digital product       development process [B,C,D].
Ultimately, Aesthetica helps       car-makers ensure that the final product assemblies are more visually       appealing, matching the looks originally conceived by the designer and       hence satisfying customers' expectations on perceived quality [E].
For example, GM Europe has used the software to refine the lines of the       Opel/Vauxhall Insignia which contributed, in part, to the model winning       European Car of the Year 2009 [E].
Commercial impact &#8212; Icona growth, exceeding &#163;1 million sales, private         buy-out     The company has approximately 30 existing customers, the vast majority in       the automotive industry.
Customers include: most western mass-market       automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) (e.g., Audi, Chrysler,       Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Renault and VW), many premium and       sports car OEMs (e.g., Ferrari, Lotus, McLaren, JLR, Porsche and Bentley)       and growing numbers of eastern automotive OEMs (e.g., Hyundai, Kia and       Ssangyong (Korea), First Automotive, Great Wall, Qoros and SAIC (China)       and Tata Motors (India)) [F].
Since the launch of the commercial Aesthetica product, Icona       Solutions has grown steadily &#8212; with total sales of Aesthetica       licences and technical support exceeding &#163;1 million since 2008, and a       current sales pipeline of over &#163;3 million [F].
This is built upon a       network of agents and resellers in every major territory around the world,       including mainland Europe, USA, Brazil, Australia, China, India, South       Korea and Japan.
On the basis of these achievements, in October 2013 Icona Solutions was       acquired by the French- based multinational company OPTIS SA (www.optis-world.com).

Commercial impact &#8212; &#163;25 million savings to customers     Some Icona customers have been willing to disclose to Icona estimates of       the financial benefits they receive from using Aesthetica.
For       example, BMW Mini achieved immediate cost savings of over US$100,000 per       year using Aesthetica on an existing production vehicle through       reduced scrap, less rectification (i.e., less work to rectify       imperfections) and a significant reduction in the cost of labour [G].
Similarly, on individual new-vehicle programmes, Porsche used the software       and identified savings of at least &#8364;250,000 [G]; Nissan estimates savings       of US$875,000 due to reduced re-tooling, less building of physical models       and faster product development [H].
Icona, and other customers [A], believe that these three examples are       typical of cost savings in the industry from use of its software: the       value of Aesthetica to the automotive industry is therefore       estimated at between &#163;200,000 and &#163;500,000 per product line.
Taking       Icona's estimate of approximately 70 different product lines benefiting       from Aesthetica in the automotive industry [F] and assuming a       conservative typical financial benefit of &#163;350,000, Aesthetica has       generated a total financial saving of the order of &#163;25 million to Icona's       customers in the impact period.
Indication of consumer reach     Aesthetica is used by around 20 companies [F] in the automotive       industry and has provided input into the design and assembly of around 70       different vehicle lines [F].
It is therefore possible to undertake a crude       estimate as to the number car buyers who have benefited from the improved       looks and build quality realised by the use of Aesthetica.
The total 2012 car and light vehicle sales in the USA [I] and Europe [J]       from Icona's largest OEM customers (Audi, Chrysler, Fiat, Ford, General       Motors, Nissan, Renault and VW Group) were around six million in each       market.
Allowing for Aesthetica having influenced the final design       of those vehicles sold since the start of 2010 (which is a conservative       estimate), around 42 million car buyers in Europe and the USA alone will       have benefited from the application of the Aesthetica software       during the REF impact period.
