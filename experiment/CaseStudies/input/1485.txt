     Marie-Curie Individual Fellowships (IxF) are designed to add to research       excellence in both the public and private sectors in member states and       associated countries, through sharing and application of new knowledge       which is transferred and developed by highly qualified researchers.
Career       Integration Grants (CIG) facilitate the transfer of knowledge that       researchers have already acquired and the development of lasting       co-operation with the scientific and/or industrial environment between the       country from which they have moved and their new location.
This action has       a particular emphasis on countering the European 'brain drain' to other       third countries (based on the FP7 2013 People Work Programme).
Funding allocations that follow from the relevant Marie-Curie actions       amount (in 2013, for example) to &#8364;134,000,000 (IEF), &#8364;44,500,000 (IOF),       &#8364;44,500,000 (IIF), and &#8364;44,000,000 (CIG).
The programmes were the subject       of independent evaluation by the European Commission in 2010, and that       evaluation focused on the impact of the activities and of the funding       deployed following the advice provided by the expert evaluations of the       applications.
The impact of the funding decisions made is best summarised in the       following extracts from the European Commission's own publications.
This       extract is taken from the Interim Evaluation of the Framework 7 Programme       (European Commission, November 2010, p30):     "Training and mobility of professionals in science and technology is         crucial for the development of the European Research Area, and the Marie         Curie actions, now under the specific programme People, have been         important instruments to make Europe attractive to the best researchers         and to implement the Community's career development policy.
People has         been implemented through a coherent set of actions that aim at         increasing the quality of human resources for research in Europe,         enhancing industry-academia cooperation, supporting research careers for         the young, for female researchers and for households with young         families, and spreading good practices in the recruitment and employment         of researchers.
It is noteworthy that the Marie Curie actions, through a         bottom-up approach with no pre-defined themes, have promoted excellence         and contributed to internationalisation efforts in Europe.
In strategic         terms, the Marie Curie actions are the most international initiatives in         FP7."
(and at p61):       "... the selection criteria for funding are demanding and include a         focus on impacts, and ... FP7 attracts the best and most appropriate         researchers and research organisations.
It is also instructive to note         that the stakeholder consultation highlights the diversity of ways in         which impact occurs and should, thus, be appraised.
It arises, inter         alia, from networking and collaboration, through leverage effects and as         a result of raising the bar for research generally.
Findings from a         study done for the UK government show that it is important in assessing         scientific outcomes to look beyond the direct scientific outputs of         projects.
The study finds that `the FP has had a big impact on the         nature and extent of UK researchers' international relationships and         networks, as well as on their knowledge base and scientific         capabilities', and it is reasonable to infer that similar outcomes will         have occurred elsewhere.

The interface between research outputs and         innovation is crucial.
According to the Technopolis report for the UK         government, `the FP has yielded important commercial benefits.
UK         business participants had made or gained access to new or significantly         improved tools or methodologies and other forms of intellectual         property.
Participation had contributed to the development of new         products and processes and increased income and market share.'"
It is important to note that the impact of the work extends well beyond       higher education: for example 43% of UK participation in FP7 activities       has been from outside HEIs.
The case studies published by the European       Commission (see sources below) include evidence of the significance and       scope of the impacts from the Marie Curie actions.
