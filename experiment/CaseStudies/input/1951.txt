     In the 1990s, high profile case law and the reports of the Law Commission       highlighted the gap that       existed in English law with respect to substitute decision-making; and       specifically the principles that       should guide when other adults can and should make decisions on behalf of       another and how such       substitute decisions should be made.
These issues were illustrated in       cases such as those of Re C       (1993) and Re MB (1997) and also in contentious situations such as       requests to sterilise adults       with learning disabilities (e.g.
Re F 1990; and Re A 2000).
Holland was       involved in the case of Re       A and also as a psychiatric expert in a particularly high profile case       that highlighted the need for       the additional safeguards in addition to those provided by the Mental       Capacity Act (HL vs. the       United Kingdom 2004 &#8212; generally known as the Bournewood case).
This case       led to the UK being       found at fault in 2005 by the European Court of Human Rights resulting in       the later introduction of       the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards in 2009.
Holland's report is quoted       in the 2004 European       Court of Human Rights judgment setting legal precedent in case law that       remains relevant today &#8212; see       para A19 of corresponding document in the British and Irish Legal       Information Institute's       database.1 Early in this legal debate his group became       concerned as to how legal principles that       were emerging in case law, and later in draft legislation, would work in       clinical and social care       settings where the issues of competence and capacity are often ambiguous       and not easily defined       with the precision that operates in law.
In terms of respect for an       individual's autonomy, Holland       expressed strong support for the Law Commission's ideas on the functional       and decision-specific       concepts of mental capacity, and on the need to optimise capacity where       possible.
Findings from early projects within the research group directly informed       the then Mental Incapacity       Bill through a Joint Houses of Parliament Pre-legislative Scrutiny       Committee from 2003 (chaired by       the late Lord Carter) with Holland appointed as one of two advisors.2       Recommendations that       directly arose from this committee and remain very relevant included       provision for the involvement       of people lacking capacity in research, the need for advocacy in specific       situations, and       refinements about end-of-life decisions.
When the Mental Capacity Act was       eventually passed in       2005, Holland submitted evidence to the Department of Constitutional       Affairs with respect to the       Code of Practice, meeting directly and advising the Minister, at that       time, Baroness Ashton.
The way that this research informs policy and practice is perhaps less       direct than in other areas of       clinical research.
It is the clarification of key concepts and the       integration of legal, psychiatric and       psychological expertise that Holland's group was able to achieve with       different members (Michael       Gunn, Isabel Clare and Tony Holland; and later Marcus Redley) contributing       to different audiences       informed by the interdisciplinary discussions that had taken place.3,4,5       During the implementation       phase from 2007 Holland was the advisor for the Royal College of       Psychiatrists on the Mental       Capacity Act working, closely with the British Psychological Society to       produce early guidance.6 He       was also on a working group set up by the Intensive Care Society &#8212; that       guidance being adopted;       and he was also part of a workshop held by the Office of Fair Trading       (OFT) on the Mental       Capacity Act and banking &#8212; guidance later published by the Office of Fair       Trading.
As clinical and       forensic psychologist and sociologist in the group, respectively, Isabel       Clare and Marcus Redley       later led a commissioned study on the early Independent Mental Capacity       advocacy service,       reporting directly to Lucy Bonnerjea7 at the Department of       Health.
This evidence helped reshape       the Government's ideas on the Independent Mental Capacity advocacy       services and their statutory       role arguing, for example, that these should be available in safeguarding       proceedings (see papers       2008 to 2011).
After 2007 when the Mental Capacity Act came into force,       Holland served on an       advisory group for the Social Care Institute for Excellence and, since       2010, has been a member of       a strategy group advising the Office of the Public Guardian.8     Whilst initial publications were primarily in the academic press,       versions were later published in       professional and practice-based journals (see below) and led to guidance       (published by the British       Institute of Learning Disabilities in 2007) on the assessment of financial       decision-making capacity       by people with learning disabilities.9 Once the Mental Capacity       Act came into force in 2007,       Holland was involved, often together with Paul Gantley from the Department       of Health, in       presentations on the Mental Capacity Act to professionals, support       workers, families and user       groups.10 This included Learning Disability Today events (users       with learning disabilities), social       care provider meetings (e.g.
Hft,11 a provider for people with       learning disabilities), Royal College of       Psychiatrists conferences, and local clinical groups.
Holland prepared two       continuing professional       development on-line training modules for the Royal College of       Psychiatrists in 2007 on the Mental       Capacity Act; these have received very positive feedback, and are still       available.
In 2008, Holland       worked with the social care provider Hft to produce a carer/family       friendly DVD on the Mental       Capacity Act sponsored by a grant from the Department of Health; helped       prepare web-based       material for the Prader Willi Syndrome Association (PWSA), also advising       in his capacity as       psychiatric advisor to the Association;12 and as advisor on       ageing and dementia to the Down's       Syndrome Association (DSA).13 Following the Deprivation of       Liberty Standards amendment a       consultation event organised by Holland with the Department of Health in       November 2011 explored       findings with key stakeholders from the Deprivation of Liberty Standards       study.
In 2013 the report       from the study was accepted by the Department of Health and has recently       been quoted in       evidence at a House of Lords Committee hearing.
Holland and colleagues       have submitted       evidence to this Committee.
