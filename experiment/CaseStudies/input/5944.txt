     The accumulated understanding and knowledge generated by the research has       resulted in four broad areas of impact, with the overall aim of       transforming and informing policy and practice, for a variety of different       stakeholders, while stimulating an informed public debate.
A.
Care standards and challenging neglect     An aim of these inter-related impacts &#8212; informed by the research projects       on faith, on education and the SHIFT Triala,b,c - was to       establish good, evidence-based practice, accessible to those working in       health and social care; and to challenge the neglect of sickle cell and       thalassaemia, while ensuring policy was connected with broader       (theoretical) debates about choice, preference and identity.
Several impacts challenged the neglect of sickle cell and thalassaemia         among mainstream service providers working in health and social care,         while encouraging practitioners to adapt evidence based practice.
Impacts aimed at generating debate include a fact sheet for the Race         Equality Foundation (1); an editorial for the National Institute of         Health Library, in celebration of National Sickle Cell month (2009); and         an evidence based briefing paper for the National Children's Bureau (No:         246).
Atkin was invited to produce a report for the All Party Parliamentary         Committee on Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Disorders (chaired by Diane         Abbott, MP) on the care available to those with sickle cell and         thalassaemia disorders (2).
This informed several parliamentary         questions and a debate in the House of Lords, initiated by Lady Benjamin         on sickle cell disorders, in which Atkin was invited to contribute ideas         to her speech (3).
Such activities raised the public profile of the         conditions.
Atkin was invited by the Department of Health to become a contributing         editor to the UK's Standards of Care of Adults with Sickle Cell         Disorders (4).
In addition to advising on the whole document, he         specifically drafted the chapter on social care.
The book offers         evidence-based advice to health care professionals and commissioners,         providing a benchmark against which NHS care for SCD and thalassaemia         should be judged.
This document was endorsed by the UK Forum on         Haemoglobin Disorders, who recommended that it should inform standard         operating practice for those professionals offering haematological care         in the NHS.
During September 2011, Atkin was invited to a closed workshop         organised by the Dutch Ministry of Health to advise civil servants,         senior service managers and policy makers on screening policy.
This was         followed up by a symposium, (Testen op HbP Dragerschap vor en tijdens de         zwangerschap een kwestie van etniciteit) held at Radbound University         (Nijmegen) in November 2012, to encourage debate among key health care         managers on how best to offer ante-natal screening in multi-cultural         societies.
Atkin was invited to give the opening talk.
B.
Public outreach and raising awareness     Informed reproductive choice relies on a well-informed `at-risk'       population.
Using insights gained from his programme of research,a,b,d,e         Atkin has influenced and challenged national policy on screening,       through his position as Chair of Public Outreach, for the (NHS) National       Screening Committee for Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia; and as member of the       advisory group for National NHS Audit of New-born Outcomes (5).
Under his       guidance, the Committee has: established 12 peer educators, working       throughout England to raise awareness of sickle cell and thalassaemia       among at-risk communities.
To date these peer educators have provided       face-to-face information to over 1000 people from at-risk communities, who       in turn have cascaded information through their social networks.
Other       activities include production of a DVD (The Family Legacy) aimed at       African communities (6), who had been previously neglected by screening       policies.
Community screening and repeated plays on local cable television       in London (Ghana TV) suggest the DVD has reached 300,000 people (6).
The       Director of Communications of the NHS Screening Programme (Sickle Cell and       Thalassaemia) Committee wrote: `I would like to thank you in the         warmest possible terms for everything you have done to support the         outreach work.
You have been an outstanding source of wisdom and         knowledge and I cannot say how much I have appreciated this'.
Since 2008, Atkin has been advising NHS Wales on the re-organising of       screening services.
His input, based on the research cited abovea,b,d,e         has included ensuring any proposed changes in service provision       are evidenced-based (e.g.
the Health Impact Assessment of the proposed       accommodation changes to the Cardiff Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Centre       by Susan Toner: March 2011, which Atkin helped draft).
He also worked with       `Cardiff Friends of Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia' to ensure any changes to       provision took account of the views of the local community.
This included       co-ordinating and participating in a community conference, Community         Spirit in Crisis (November 2012), in which 60 lay participants along       with representatives from commissioners debated proposed changes.
An       outcome was to prevent the closure of a community screening centre in       Cardiff and its removal to a more impersonal local hospital, which was       opposed by the community.
The conference organiser and community       development worker for the `Cardiff Friends of Sickle Cell and       Thalassaemia', said: `Thank you so much for your support...[You have]         inspired and motivated us, the support group to continue to strive for         equity of services for Sickle Cell &amp; Thalassaemia patients, carers,         and at risk communities'.
The Secretary of State for Health (December 2011) initiated a       consultation exercise on the re-organisation of screening services in       England.
He requested advice from all the directors of specialist       screening programmes (such as sickle cell and thalassaemia) on a       confidential consultation document.
The Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia       Programme Director sought advice of Atkin and used part of his written       response (informed by the research outlined above) in her evidence to the       Secretary of State for Health.
C. Government policy on screening and supporting informed choice     In 2012, as Chair of Public Outreach, Atkin has used his research on       faith, involving fathers in ante-natal care and the social consequences of       being a trait carrier to help draft nationallya,b,d,e       available, NHS published leaflets for informing `at-risk' communities (7)       including: an introduction to screening aimed at-risk parents; more       detailed leaflets outlining the screening process to parents at risk of a       range of haemoglobinopathies; and a leaflet providing advice to fathers on       ante-natal screening.
These leaflets have been circulated to all primary       health care professionals in England, with a letter of recommendation from       the Sickle cell and Thalassaemia Programme Director, explaining their use.
Atkin's researcha,b,d,e informed the content and style of       these leaflets.
His research also provided evidence on how best to present       accessible messages, consistent with how individuals make sense of their       health, in a way that can help them make choices, commensurate with their       own values and beliefs.
The aim was to raise awareness among at-risk       communities and practitioners, while providing reliable and accurate       information, thereby facilitating informed choice.
The widely published SHIFT studyb was the first in the UK to       provide evidence that current screening targets set by the Department of       Health are not being met.
This challenged policy thinking and informed the       need for the leaflets outlined above.
A letter written by the Sickle Cell       and Thalassaemia Programme Director also drew the findings to the       attention of commissioners.
It initiated a more pro-active engagement with       fathers on the part of the Public Outreach Committee, led by Atkin (see       above).
The research also led to the establishment of a national audit on       new-born outcomes, which will run for three years (2012 to 2015).
The       findings aimed at national policy makers and local health care       commissioners will inform policy by identifying bottlenecks in the       screening process and suggesting solutions to overcome them.
Atkin was       invited to join the project steering group to provide independent advice       on governance.
D. Educational support for children with SCD     Atkin was CI on an ESRC funded study, exploring the educational       experience of those with a sickle cell disorderc.
One study       impact has been the uptake of its guidance on how to manage sickle cell       disease in the classroom by the Department for Education (DfE) on their       web-site providing guidance to all schools and teachers in England on       managing medical conditions in schools (8)
