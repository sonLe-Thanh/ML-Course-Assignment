     Research on European and global LGBT rights has impacted on       international, European and UK human rights law, standards of care, health       policies, and the training of mental health professionals.
It has shaped       public debate on gender and sexual politics in national and international       arenas, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, UK       Parliament, international and UK media, European activist and artist       networks.
Since 1990, Whittle's research has had a real and significant impact for       the better on the legal status of more than 5 million trans people in the       Europe Union and Council of Europe states, and many more throughout the       world.
He worked on the drafting of the UK Gender Recognition Act       (2003-4).
Further research led to Whittle's appointment to the DTI's       Discrimination Law Review [2007], the DCLG's Equalities Review [2008] the       Government Equalities Office Single Equality Act Stakeholders Reference       Group, and Specific Duties Advisory Group [2008-10], so ensuring       transgender inclusion in the Equality Act 2010.
Work with local activists       ensured the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (UK) was the model for legislation       in South Africa (2003), Spain (2007) and Sweden (2011).
Whittle was       invited by the International Commission of Jurists to become a co-author       of the proposed United Nations' Yogyakarta Protocols on Sexual       Orientation, Gender Identity and Human Rights http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta_Principles       which are increasingly used as guidance by courts worldwide.
These led to       the UN General Assembly Statements [A] (2009, 2011) recognising       human rights violations and confirming international protections for LGBT       people.
The first non-medic and trans person to become President of the World       Professional Association for Transgender Health (2007-09), Whittle       obtained SOROS funding for workshops at the 2009 WPATH symposium, which       led to a unanimous vote placing Human Rights at the heart of the new       International Care Standards [B].
A paper to the American       Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic Manual's (DSM5) review on       classification of Gender Dysphoria as a mental disorder [C] led to       the acknowledgement of gender identity as core to personal autonomy, and       amendment of the DSM5 mental health category, leading to material change       in Gender Identity clinical provision.
The results of Whittle's       comprehensive European legal survey and study of trans discrimination in       the Council of Europe (CoE) States, were presented to the CoE Human Rights       Commissioner [D], Thomas Hammarberg, and led to an issue paper [E]       launched at the World Out Games, in Copenhagen.
Whittle was a member of       the steering committee for the Office of the Commissioner for Human       Right's study on LGBTI Discrimination in Europe [F], and was       Transgender Europe's observer to the Council of Europe Committee on Sexual       Orientation and Gender Identity Rights, ensuring trans inclusion in the       Council's Recommendation on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity       Discrimination CM/Rec(2010)5 [G].
Whittle's contribution to the rights of transgender people has been       recognised by a growing number of awards: the North American National LGBT       Bar Association Frank Kemeny Life Time Achievement Award (2012) for the       education of activists, academics and lawyers, and his amicus briefs to       the US and international courts and governments (http://www.lgbtbar.org/awards/frank-kameny-award/), and       the American Bar Association Commission's Stonewall Award in recognition       of his contribution to "removing barriers and championing diversity for       the LGBT community, both within the legal profession and impacting the       greater human universe."

Whittle       has been a frequent commentator on Radio 4, the World Service and TV, and       has widely raised awareness in the UK and other countries of the problems       faced by trans people.
Binnie's work on class within LGBT communities has raised awareness about       socio-economic inequalities within LGBT communities, and strengthened       queer arts networks in Manchester.
His work on `The Globalization of       Sexuality' was featured on BBC Radio 4's `Thinking Aloud', and a related       article in The New Humanist has contributed to more critical       public understanding of global LGBT politics.
His work has contributed       towards public art events including `Exam' by the Ultimate Holding       Company, at the 2010 Queer Up North festival, and `On a Day unknown' with       the artist Jason E. Bowman and the Out in the City Group of Age Concern at       the Whitworth Art Gallery (50 participants from the Out in the City group)       [I].
Research by Binnie and Klesse on LGBT activism in Central and Eastern       Europe raised public awareness of European LGBT human rights, and enhanced       the networking capacity of activists/scholars from Poland through the       organisation of the workshop `Debating Anglo-Polish Perspectives on Sexual       Politics at MMU (15 activists/scholars).
Klesse presented this research at       the `Untold Stories' exhibition on LGBT oppression and politics in CEE at       the Art House Tallinn, Estonia (16/06/2011) funded by European Community       Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (30 LGBT activists) [J].
Klesse's work has raised understandings of polyamory and bisexuality       among health practitioners and therapists.
It has also been utilised by       polyamorous and bisexual activists, as well as artists, journalists,       broadcasters and mental health practitioners/therapists.
Klesse has       contributed his expertise to UK and European activist events, including       the International and UK Bisexual Conventions in London, 26/08/2010 (200       bisexual activists) and Bradford, 09/08/2012 (120 bisexual activists).
His       research was discussed at `The Mutiny &#8212; Love on Trial' &#8212; an       artist/activist event at the Resistance Gallery, London, 10/02/2011 (80       LGBT activists) [K].
Klesse's research also informed public debate       by being featured on BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour, 26/02/2009.
Klesse enhanced       awareness of polyamory and bisexuality among health professionals and       therapists at the Critical Sexology Workshop Up North (23/09/2011       Manchester) (80 participants), the 23rd Scientific Convention       of the German Society for the Research of Sexuality (18/09/2010 Aachen,       Germany), and the distinguished Psychotherapie Seminar Freudenstadt       (24/09/2011) (30 psychiatrists and psychotherapists).
Dr Claudia Schmid       (GP) has requested his research publications on behalf of a       psychotherapeutic practitioner supervision group in Germany, which signals       a growing recognition of polyamorous, and bisexual identities in the       international mental profession.
