     Chantal Mouffe's ideas on agonistic democracy have had an impact most       profoundly on the governing strategy of the current Argentinian president       and the surrounding public debate, but also within Belgium where she has       affected both the political response to far-right parties and the work of       the artistic community.
The work of Chantal Mouffe (together with Ernesto Laclau) is widely       credited by both political actors and the media within Argentina as being       one of the main intellectual resources for what has been termed the National         and Popular Model of Democracy (NPMD) that has dominated Argentinian       politics over the last decade.
Both the current president Cristina       Fernandez de Kirchner (elected December 2007; re-elected 2011) and the       previous incumbent Nestor Kirchner (20003-2007) have publicly recognised       that they have read and been influenced by Mouffe and many journalists       report on her frequent visits to the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace       in Buenos Aires (1).
An article in Clar&#237;n (the largest newspaper in Argentina;       centre-right; and recognised as a leading element in the opposition to       Kirchner) states that `Chantal Mouffe is Cristina's [Kirchner] favourite       intellectual... Mouffe has been sustaining a theory to which the President       adheres' (2).
Similarly, the more conservative newspaper La Naci&#243;n       (second largest circulation; anti-Kirchner) emphasizes that `the Kirchners       are admirers' (3).
Across newspapers of varying political perspective,       there is recognition of the particular importance of the book On the         Political: P&#225;gina/12 (main progressive left newspaper)       states that it is `a book that the President has well read' (4).
La         Naci&#243;n goes even further: `On the Political altered       Kirchner's life as a politician forever, according to what close       acquaintances of the President told La Naci&#243;n' (5).
Mouffe's particular influence, highlighted by opponents and supporters,       relates to the highly contested political strategies and policies of the       Kirchner presidency in the field of human rights, social protection and       civil liberties.
Commentators draw a direct relationship between Mouffe's       work on agonistic democracy and the way in which the Kirchners constructed       an idea of the pueblo in active opposition to `the elite',       supporters of neoliberalism and/or the `old politics' in Argentina.
P&#225;gina/12       goes as far as to directly quote a passage from On the Political       to prove its point (4).
Such a confrontational strategy can be witnessed       across a range of legislative and policy issues that goes back to 2003       with the legislation annulling the amnesty laws (from 1983) that had       benefitted members of the military government of the last dictatorship.
In       the 2008-13 period, the government has engaged in a number of       confrontational strategies that are explicitly linked to NPMD and thus       influenced by Mouffe's political philosophy, including:            the attempted reform in the export taxes of agricultural products         implemented by Presidential Decree in the beginning of 2008 (later         narrowly revoked by the Senate).
The government built a strong alliance         of forces and popular mobilizations against agricultural producers that         were presented as associated with the elites and defenders of a system         that benefitted only a few.
The lively debate in Parliament was followed         on public screens in the main cities.
the reform of the National Broadcasting Law in 2009 followed a similar         logic with the government setting itself in direct opposition with Media         Grupo Clar&#237;n that controlled large proportions of the radio, TV and         newspapers in Argentina.
The strategy included massive mobilisations,         public consultations across the country and, again, public viewings of         the parliamentary debates.
the reform of the Civil Code to allow same-sex marriages in 2010,         which in this case led to direct confrontation with the Catholic Church,         generated extremely high levels of political mobilization, particularly         amongst the young.
In explaining the political strategy of the NPMD, commentators are quick       to make the link with Mouffe's ideas: `Far from the discourse that insists       on the need to achieve a great national consensus - without establishing       what for - Kirchnerism prefers to explore the agitated waters of       antagonism, and the results are evident' (5).
A second article in La         Naci&#243;n similarly explaining how Mouffe's ideas have been influential       on Kirchner's political strategy: `the existence of antagonism is       fundamental, the demarcation of an `us' and `them as a necessary condition       for the exercise of democratic rights... permanent conflict enables the       constitution of an hegemonic power that breaks with the status quo and       breaks the power of deadlock' (6).
Beyond the direct influence on the presidency, Mouffe's ideas are widely       publicized in Argentina: an interview with P&#225;gina/12 (7) in which       Mouffe discusses the way in which Europe can learn from the politics of       Latin America was then picked up a few weeks later in an article by La         Naci&#243;n (8).
The Argentinian Ambassador to the United Kingdom has       provided personal testimony as to the impact of Mouffe's work on both the       President and contemporary Argentinian political culture more generally       and is willing to speak to the REF panel to confirm this account (1).
The impact of Mouffe's work is not only in Latin America, but also in her       native Belgium.
Here political actors have again referred to the way that       her work on agonism has shaped their response to the rise of the extremist       right.
She has contributed to the public debate on the far right through       radio (Radio Klara) and magazine (Knack and Le Vif)       interviews and De Standaard ran an article `Viva Chantal' in       November 2011 (9).
Her influence is not simply on political debate, but       also contemporary cultural activities.
Mouffe has frequently given talks       on the relationship between agonistic democracy and the arts (often at       museums and art galleries), culminating in 2012 with an invited month-long       residency in the annual Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels where she       interacted with artists (in particular a dance company that drew       inspiration from her work on agonism) and gave a keynote public lecture       (10).
While critics often contend that contemporary democratic theory is       divorced from political practice, Mouffe has clearly demonstrated its       relevance to contemporary political life.
