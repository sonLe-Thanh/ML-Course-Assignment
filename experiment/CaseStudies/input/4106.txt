     Our research has increased public and professional awareness       internationally on the potential link       between influenza and AMI and the potential for influenza vaccination to       prevent AMI.
It has also       had benefits for professional policy and practice, by contributing to       better understanding of barriers       to vaccination of adults against influenza and S. pneumoniae (a bacterium       which causes       community acquired pneumonia, meningitis and blood poisoning), and       developing and testing       methods which have improved vaccination rates in high risk groups.
A number of our large scale studies4,5 had a direct effect on       primary care practice (general       practitioners, practice nurses and primary healthcare teams) for       organisation of influenza and       pneumococcal vaccination programmes, and increased rates of vaccination       for vulnerable people       which is known to prevent ill-health and death and reduce health service       costs.
A key factor for       success was that practitioners were involved in the conception and design       of the work.
The context to our work was our research in Lincolnshire which had local       impact through increased       influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in high-risk groups during       2000 to 2001 in a large       primary care organisation where we undertook an organisational       intervention involving 32 of 39       practices: there were improvements in vaccine rates in patients with heart       disease (19% increase       in influenza vaccination; 15% increase in pneumococcal vaccination),       diabetes (17% increase in       influenza vaccination; 13% increase in pneumococcal vaccination) and over       65 year olds (24%       increase in influenza vaccination).4 Assuming 1000 patients       were eligible for vaccination in each       practice, with an average of three GPs per practice, and a change of 20%       in vaccination rate in 39       practices, this equates to an additional 6400 patients vaccinated, and       over 60 GPs and their staff       involved during the course of this study.
The number needed to treat to       prevent one death is 120,       (http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/2/209.full)       which means that around 50 deaths would       have been prevented through this intervention.
A further context is provided by another study which led to increased       influenza and pneumococcal       vaccination rates in high-risk groups in Lincolnshire that we conducted       during 2001, involving a       similar organisational intervention in 22 of 105 practices: there were       significant improvements in       vaccine rates in patients with heart disease (11% increase in influenza       vaccination; 28% increase       in pneumococcal vaccination), diabetes (9% increase in influenza       vaccination; 29% increase in       pneumococcal vaccination) and patients with a splenectomy (17% increase in       influenza       vaccination; 16% increase in pneumococcal vaccination).5 There       were again over 60 GPs involved,       with approximately 4400 additional patients receiving influenza and       pneumococcal vaccination,       and prevention of around 37 deaths as well as hospitalisations.
Our case-control study showing a reduction in AMI with influenza       vaccination3 raised wide-reaching       public awareness of a potential benefit of flu vaccine in preventing heart       attacks.
The       paper published in 2010 led to television and media coverage worldwide       receiving more than 1,000       news items in major international media from the UK, US, India, China as       well as Canada and       other countries.
(e.g.
CBC News, radio interviews (Radio 5 Live UK, Radio       Cyprus, Voice of       America, CBS news), a video interview with Time Magazine and around 1,000       professional and       public websites worldwide (e.g.
Reuters, CNN, Claire).
We undertook a cross-sectional study in 2012 investigating factors       associated with success of       practice seasonal flu vaccination campaigns which showed strategies that       if widely implemented by       general practices would improve average flu vaccination rates by 7% to 8%.1       This has been       publicised by the research team in a popular practitioner magazine,8       and translated by the       research team into an e-learning module,8 with positive       feedback from GPs who reported they       would use this knowledge in practice.
In addition, the recommendations from this study were incorporated in       widely circulated national       guidance for UK health services in the `Seasonal flu plan: Winter 2012/13,       Annex E Increasing       vaccine uptake among clinical risk groups &#8212; GP Practice checklist' and in       the letter from the UK       Chief medical Officer on `The Flu Immunisation Programme in 2012/13 and       2013/14' (Annex B GP       practice checklist).9     The research3 has also been widely cited in international and       UK guidance for practitioners, for       example in the Canadian Influenza Immunization Awareness Campaign       (2013-2014),10 the Australian       Immunisation Handbook (2013)11 and by the Health Protection       Agency UK.12
