     (1) Enhanced cultural understanding of geography and exploration.
The underpinning research suggested that innovative curation and       exhibition of the RGS-IBG collections could communicate a new, more       inclusive history of exploration, in which the contributions of a wider       range of people were recognised and valued than had traditionally been the       case.
The impacts of the research were therefore pursued through a       strategy of public engagement comprising: an exhibition at the RGS-IBG       (October-December 2009); a website, with an online exhibition and related       research and educational resources (2009-present); a travelling       exhibition, available for hire from the RGS-IBG (2009-present); and       secondary reach through media coverage and additional public engagement       activity.
The AHRC evaluated this work as outstanding &#8212; `a highly       effective project which has had a significantly greater public impact than       anticipated' &#8212; and presented it in the AHRC Annual Report and Accounts       2009-10 as a case study of `world class research and its impact'.
Specifically:             Exhibition at the RGS-IBG: 3,664 people visited over 40 days,         significant numbers for RGS-IBG exhibitions.
Visitor feedback was         enthusiastic (examples: `Very moving.
Thank you RGS for evoking a sense         of shared heritage', Janaki Venkat, India; `Thank you &#8212; from an English         70+ woman who did not know!
'; `Fabulous job', Stephen Loring,         Smithsonian).
More than 500 new users actively engaged with the         Society's collections during this period.
Website: A substantial, sustainable website was designed to         present the exhibition and other research and engagement materials, and         secured online within the RGS-IBG (www.hiddenhistories.rgs.org).
From its launch in October 2009 to July 2013, the site received 70,490         page views in 19,614 visits.
Usage of the site was notably         international: 55% of visitors from beyond the UK, 40% from beyond the         English-speaking world, from a total of 132 countries.
Dwell-times were         significantly above average for the RGS-IBG site.
Travelling Exhibition: Venues for the travelling exhibition         until July 2013 included a University Science Festival (2000 visitors,         2010), Kew Gardens Open House Day (1200 visitors, 2011) and the Royal         Engineers Museum (3442 visitors, 2013).
School Teaching Resources: To embed research findings in school         curricula, the project developed a suite of web-based teaching resources         (lesson plans, powerpoints, fact sheets, research resources, podcast         interview, film clips), targeted at KS4 (Geography) and KS5 (History)         teachers.
The former centre the theme of `Exploring Everest', addressed         to GCSE specifications on extreme environments.
The latter centre         `Exploring Africa', addressed to GCE specifications on the history of         the British Empire.
These resources can be accessed from both the Hidden         Histories website and the RGS-IBG teaching resources webpage, the latter         averaging 40,000 direct hits per month.
The resources were profiled in         RGS-IBG mailings to all 3,400 UK secondary school geography departments,         highlighted on the Historical Association website and promoted in         workshops with teachers / Ofsted inspectors for geography and history.
Media Coverage: The exhibition gained secondary reach through         media coverage that went beyond reportage to highlight key debates and         to disseminate exhibition materials.
Extensive interviews appeared in The           Times (7 December 2009), Sunday Times (20 Sept 2009), The Guardian (8           Dec 2009), Times Higher Education (5 December 2009), BBC History           (October 2009), and Geographical (December 2009).
The           Guardian, Telegraph and Geographical also produced online         image galleries using project research.
The exhibition was discussed in         numerous podcasts, blogs and enthusiast websites worldwide from         perspectives ranging from popular histories of science (e.g.
http://timetoeatthedogs.com)         to adventure journalism (e.g.
http://thosewhodared.blogspot.co.uk/).
Other Public Engagement Activity: Diverse audiences were         directly engaged.
19 public talks/lectures were given in autumn 2009,         including one lecture attended by 520 people.
Other activities included         two prisoner-led lectures in Brixton Prison, organised through the         Diversity Department; contributions to the RGS-IBG 2011 exhibition / web         materials on Rediscovering African Geographies; talks to KS5         school students in Black History month; and a Passenger Films discussion         event at the Roxy film-house London (c. 100 attendees).
(2) Heritage collections strategies.
The underpinning research has left lasting impacts on professional       heritage practice both within and beyond the RGS-IBG.
Within the RGS-IBG: The RGS-IBG is one of the world's best         known organisations devoted to the advancement of geographical         understanding.
Its collections received Designated Status from the         Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in recognition of their national         and international significance in extending `understanding of cultural         exchange and encounters around the world'.
The curation of these         collections has been significantly enhanced by the Hidden Histories         project.
In addition to infrastructural and documentation legacies, the         project contributed a new research-oriented model for the Society's         exhibitions and a reappraisal of underused parts of the collections         (notably film).
Following the success of the project, the RGS-IBG has         developed its programme of collections-based research, for example by         supporting 5 Collaborative Doctoral Awards (CDAs) and initiating an AHRC         Collaborative Doctoral Partnership (CDP) with the Royal Society.
The         project significantly enhanced interaction between RGS-IBG divisions         responsible for collections, research and public engagement, a         cross-divisional impact recognised by the Society as strategically         important.
Other heritage institutions: Specific aspects of the research         at the RGS-IBG delivered new insights on exploration to other heritage         experts.
This included: the identification of previously anonymous         indigenous people in artworks (reported to the National Portrait         Gallery); the discovery of watercolours by Catherine Frere (newly         exhibited in the 2013 British Museum exhibition, `Social fabric: African         textiles today'); and the first analysis of the 1922 film `Climbing         Mount Everest' (leading to a new research collaboration on expeditionary         film with the British Film Institute).
More generally, the underpinning         research has helped to embed collaborative research and geographical         approaches within the ongoing curatorial practice of multiple         institutions.
For example, Royal Holloway Geography initiated CDAs at         the Science Museum, collaborations that significantly influenced its         successful application for an AHRC CDP and the foundation of its new         Research and Public History Department in September 2012.
On the basis         of his expertise in collections-based research and public engagement,         Driver was appointed advisor to the Natural History Museum's Centre for         Arts &amp; Humanities Research and the Thames CDP Consortium (The         National Archives, National Portrait Gallery, National Maritime Museum).
4 Royal Holloway Geography PhD students have gained employment in         full-time collections-related positions at the British Library, RBG Kew,         National Maritime Museum and the Science Museum.
