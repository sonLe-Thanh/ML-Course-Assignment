     Creation of new businesses     Apitope, a University of Bristol spinout company, was established by       Professor Wraith in 2002.
Apitope develops peptide therapeutics for a range of autoimmune disorders,       and currently has five       product candidates in its pipeline and employs 26 individuals based in       three key sites across the       UK and Europe.
Since the University of Bristol's initial research into ASPI was       published, a series of patents, start-ups       and spin-outs have established themselves, each developing peptide       therapeutics for a variety       of autoimmune and allergic disorders.
Each company listed has made direct       reference to Professor       Wraith's laboratory at some stage in their initial research and discovery       process.
Additionally       Professor Wraith has collaborated or been in direct communication with the       majority of founding       researchers listed below.
Circassia was established by Professor Mark Larch&#233; who co-authored with       Professor Wraith &#8212;       Circassia is a bio-pharmaceutical company specialising in peptide       therapeutics targeted against a       range of allergies.
Circassia's pipeline currently includes treatments       for: cat dander, ragweed,       house dust mite, grass, birch and Japanese birch pollen, Alternaria, and       dog hair.
ImmuPharma PLC is European pharmaceutical company founded upon Lupuzor, a       peptide       therapeutic for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
ImmuPharma has five       drug candidates in       development, two platform technologies and approximately 70 patents.
ImmuPharma has won       several awards including "Best Technology 2009" at the AIM Awards &#8212;       sponsored by       PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and "Best Medical Research &amp; Development       Company &#8212; Europe" at       the 2012 New Economy's Healthcare awards.
[f]     Based in Yavne, Israel Andromeda Biotech is currently in phase III       clinical trials for DiaPep277, a       peptide therapeutic designed to treat type 1 diabetes.
Industrial investment     Work at Apitope has attracted a high level of investment from industry.
In 2008, Apitope received       &#8364;10 million (~&#163;8.4 million) from an investment consortium based in Belgium       for continued research       into peptide therapeutics for multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and type       A-haemophilia.
[a] The       following year Apitope entered a licensing agreement worth &#8364; 154 million       (~&#163;130 million) with       pharmaceutical industry leader Merck Serono focused on commercialisation       of Professor Wraith's       ATX-MS-1467 compound.
[b] In the Spring of 2013 Apitope received &#8364;5.925       million in funding from       the European commission for their continued research into therapeutics for       Graves' disease [c].
Circassia has successfully completed five fundraising rounds, yielding a       total of approximately       &#163;105 million.
[d] ImmuPharma announced in May 2013 that it has secured a       &#163;50 million, five year       Equity Financing Facility to fund their late stage Lupuzor compound.
[e] In       2010 Teva       Pharmaceuticals Ltd invested in Andromeda at a company to money valuation       of $170 million       (~&#163;111 million).
This followed a $13.5 million investment by Teva the       previous year.
[f]     Adoption of new technology     As a result of its work with Apitope, Merck Serono is continuing       investigation into ASPI, initiating its       own clinical trial into the efficacy of ATX-MS-1467 as a treatment for       multiple sclerosis.
[g]       Additionally GlaxoSmithKline has joined with Apitope in discovering       peptide therapeutics for       Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid.
[c]     The development of new products     A number of candidate products have been created using ASPI, several of       which have entered late       stage clinical trials.
Three of these products are described below:     DNAJP1     Developed through research at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, DNAJP1       is a therapeutic       peptide created to treat rheumatoid arthritis.
DNAJP1 is currently       licensed by the biotechnology       company Synthetic Biologics and is undergoing clinical trials to judge its       efficacy.
[h] Early work on       development of DNAJP1, published in 1997, referred to the ASPI approach       described by Professor       Wraith at the University of Cambridge.
[i]     Dirucotide     Derived from myelin basic protein (MBP) and developed by BioMS, a       spin-out from the University       of Alberta, Canada, Dirucotide is currently under licence by Medwell       Capital Corp, and       pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly.
The therapeutic reached phase III trials       in 2009 for the treatment       of multiple sclerosis but is currently under review to determine its       efficacy.
[j] The description of the       first clinical trial on Dirucotide, published in 2006, refers back to the       original ASPI work from       Professor Wraith's laboratory in Cambridge.
[k]     Patent US 7858738 B2 Synthetic human peptides and pharmaceutical         compositions comprising         them for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus     A patent was published in 2010 by Yeda Research and Development Co for a       pair of therapeutic       peptides aimed at treating the auto-immune disease myasthenia gravis.
The       work preceding this       patent directly references Professor Wraith's research carried out at the       University of Bristol.
