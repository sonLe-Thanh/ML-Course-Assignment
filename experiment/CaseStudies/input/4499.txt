     Education research at UoB into rights-based learning has changed       education policy in developed and developing countries.
Changing policies for learning and teaching in Africa: STEPHENS'       four-country African research on the quality of primary education (QEP)       was part of a wider Save the Children policy to promote more participatory       ways of teaching and learning.
This led to the adoption of these       participatory approaches in the 300 project primary schools involving       1,000 teachers and some 120,000 children (source 5.1).
The evidence of       improved learning provided by the research led to changes in the policies       of Save the Children to promote participatory learning internationally       (5.2).
As a result of the research, the special adviser to Save the       Children, Norway confirmed that QEP is being spread to all       teacher-training colleges in the Amhara region of Ethiopia (serving 20       million inhabitants) and reports that in 2012, `80 teacher training       lecturers have been trained in the new methods in all 15 teacher training       colleges' (5.2).
PAR as a method to evaluate learning and teaching       approaches has been included since 2010 in the curriculum in all 14 of       Zimbabwe's teacher-training colleges, influencing 1,400 teacher trainees.
The research impacted upon Save the Children's international policy       development.
At the 2009 Cambodia meeting of Save the Children       policymakers in Cambodia, it was reported in the national media that, `the       conference was used as a vehicle to present recommendations from Save the       Children Norway's Quality Education Project to educators and government       officials in Cambodia and around the world' (5.3).
Influencing NGO policies for sexual-reproductive rights: JOHNSON's       research for NGOs working in four developing countries has influenced       strategies promoting children's sexual and reproductive health rights in       over 1,600 schools, resulting in evidence-based policy change within IPPF,       which works in 172 countries (5.4).
IPPF's Senior Advisor on Adolescents       says this of the UoB research: `Although the programme is over, the         journey is not.
The legacy of this assessment will help us continue         better equipped and with a stronger focus to put young people at the         centre of our work (5.5).
The advisor paid particular attention to       the application of JOHNSON's theoretical socio-ecological model for youth       programming and its impact on IPPF's 2015 revised global policy strategic       review: `It will have an enormous impact on our strategic thinking in         IPPF... influencing our work with adolescents and young people by         putting them at the centre of our work which will have implications for         IPPF's approach to communication and management' (5.5).
In terms of       policy contribution in Nepal specifically, the Programme Officer for       Adolescents and Young People at the South Asia Regional Office of IPPF has       said: `The life changing impact the project has made in the lives of         the young people in FPAN (Family Planning Association Nepal) in         particular, the imprints are visible across the region in all our Member         Associations (MAs).
The assessment research has brought out excellent         examples of MAs work in promoting and advocating for provision of         Comprehensive Sexuality Education in the national curriculum of Nepal.'
(5.6).
The research has also influenced IPPF-funding decisions that led to       the continuation of services for vulnerable young people in challenging       geographical circumstances.
The Programme Officer provides testimony that       the research results `helped in taking informed decisions on granting a         no-cost extension for six months to the project with FPAN' (5.6).
Policy changes in the UK around RRS: Research by ROBINSON for       UNICEF evaluating their RRS programme has had a policy impact at national       and regional level in the UK, with UNICEF UK adopting the evaluation       findings, particularly around changes to the rights-respecting discourse.
In his review of the Office of the Children's Commissioner presented to       the Department of Education (2010), John Dunford said of the UoB RRS       research: `in conducting my review I visited some Rights Respecting         Schools and saw at first hand that when children are taught about their         rights they learn a greater appreciation of the rights of others.
The         evidence is that this research has a positive impact on behaviour and         teacher-pupil relationships.
Rights respect and responsibility are the 3         Rs of learning to be a good citizen.'
