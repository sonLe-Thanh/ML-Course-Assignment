     Influence on Creative Practice       The research findings generated by the investigations outlined above have       provided the thrust of numerous creative projects, residential artistic       programmes and training events focused on accessible technologies in the       UK and Ireland (twenty events between 2000-2012, for example in Belfast,       Holywood, Lisnaskea, Dublin and Roscommon), Sweden (five events between       2003 and 2007 in Hj&#246;, Gothenburg and Stockholm), the US (Washington, May       2007) and Japan (Tokyo, August 2010).
In the course of this work Lyons has directly influenced over five       hundred composers and performers with disabilities to reassess and revise       their creative practice with a view to more constructive use of new       technologies (see testimonial from a disabled musician in the Wired       Ensemble).
Over fifty access tutors in the UK and Ireland, including those working       with Drake Music Project, Share Music and Stravaganza, have reassessed and       revised their approach to working creatively with disabled musicians after       attending training on accessible technologies delivered by Lyons.
The       methodologies presented by Lyons form the basis of Drake Music Project       training and the format of Share Music and Stravaganza residential       projects to the present day.
Lyons' research findings have directly influenced formulation of policy       regarding music technology provision for musicians with disabilities by       Share Music Sweden, one of the leading arts and disability organisations       in Europe (see testimonial from Share Music Sweden).
Over twenty University of Ulster graduates who took Lyons' research-led       modules in Accessible Technologies have gone on to pursue careers in the       Music and Disability sector.
Lyons has been successful in securing over &#163;200K funding from the       Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) for PhD studentships related       to this research, with past and current postgraduate students working       outside academia using accessible hardware, software interfaces, and       methodologies devised in association with him.
Several contemporary composers, including Iain McCurdy and Bill Campbell,       have been inspired by the artistic excellence of Wired Ensemble       performances to compose works based on Lyons' methodologies for the group       (which has received commissions for high profile performances and       broadcast recordings).
McCurdy's Piano Music for the Wired,       commissioned by Sonorities Festival and premiered there in 2003, was       composed and rehearsed over a period of months in workshops supervised by       Lyons.

They have commented on how, after       implementing in their creative practice methodologies pioneered by Lyons,       they felt empowered by the fact that their compositions and performances       had attained more high-profile, mainstream opportunities for dissemination       (see testimonial from a disabled musician in the Wired Ensemble).
Influencing Public Understanding       Given the limited opportunities for self-expression in more conventional,       less technology-focused approaches to music making by disabled musicians,       there has been a misconception that people with a disability are less       artistic, creative or self-expressive.
Historically, performances by       disabled musicians have been marginalised, often taking place at events       limited to the `arts and disability' community.
The increased levels of       artistic accomplishment achieved by those musicians with disabilities who       have worked with Lyons' technology-focused methodologies has resulted in       greater visibility at mainstream music events and in wider public       acceptance and understanding of, as well as respect for, their creative       output.
This is evidenced, for example, in performances given by the Wired       Ensemble in 2002 at the Belfast Festival at Queen's, at Sonorities       International Festival of Contemporary Music annually 2000-2005, by Share       Music Sweden at the City of London Festival in 2012, and by Stravaganza at       the CultureTECH Festival, Derry, in 2013.
Influencing Public Policy     The influence on Public Policy of Lyons' research is evidenced by:            the decision of the Culture Company Ltd., an entirely publicly funded         body, to devote over &#163;100K of funding to music, disability and         technology events, including c.&#163;25K to commissioning a team led by Lyons         to organise and deliver an international festival, entitled Inclusive           Creativity, to showcase cutting-edge creative work by composers         and performers with disabilities as part of the UK City of Culture 2013         celebrations (see testimonial from Culture Company Ltd.);       invitations to pitch the research and associated projects to the Arts         Council of Northern Ireland (which subsequently took it into account in         the formulation of its five-year Music Strategy, published in 2012);       invitations to demonstrate the research outcomes to Members of the         Legislative Assembly (MLAs) at Stormont.
