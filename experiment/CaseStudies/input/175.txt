     Each year, in England alone, approximately 152,000 people suffer a       stroke.
In the UK, 1 in 5       strokes are fatal.
The annual costs of stroke in the UK are estimated to       be between &#163;3.7 billion and       &#163;8 billion and the majority of this cost is rehabilitation and supporting       activities of daily living (e.g.
bathing, dressing and feeding) after stroke.
When stroke occurs, initial management is critical for the outcome of the       disease.
Hypertension is       associated with poor short-term and long-term outcomes (see for example       Annals Neurol 1998       24:258-263 or J Internal Med 2001 249:467-473).
Hypertension is       common after acute stroke, and       is also a major risk factor for stroke.
However, best practice for       management of blood pressure in       acute stroke has been uncertain because of a scarcity of data from which       to draw evidence.
This is       a serious concern.
The research described in this case study has been used       to inform international       guidelines on the management of hypertension following stroke, promoting       better patient care with       the goal of improving outcomes from stroke.
The American Heart Association used the research outcomes from the CHHIPS       and COSSACS       studies to inform the 2013 `Guidelines for the Early Management of         Patients With Acute         Ischemic Stroke: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals'.
(corroborating source A)     Both the CHHIPS study (their reference 411) and the COSSACS study (their       ref 433) are cited in       the text as supporting evidence for the following recommendations in the       guidelines which       acknowledge the important contribution these trials have made to this       controversial field.
Recommendation 2 (p892) states:     "Patients who have elevated blood pressure and are otherwise eligible         for treatment with         intravenous rtPA should have their blood pressure carefully lowered         (Table 9) so that their         systolic blood pressure is &lt;185 mm Hg and their diastolic blood         pressure is &lt;110 mm Hg         (Class I; Level of Evidence B) before fibrinolytic therapy is initiated.
If medications are given         to lower blood pressure, the clinician should be sure that the blood         pressure is stabilized at         the lower level before beginning treatment with intravenous rtPA and         maintained below         180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after intravenous rtPA         treatment."
Specific reference to the COSSACS study is made in recommendation 10       (p893) which states:     "Evidence from one clinical trial indicates that initiation of         antihypertensive therapy within 24         hours of stroke is relatively safe.
Restarting antihypertensive         medications is reasonable         after the first 24 hours for patients who have pre-existing hypertension         and are         neurologically stable unless a specific contraindication to restarting         treatment is known         (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B)."
The 2013 `Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension'       from the European Society       of Hypertension and of the European Society of Cardiology (corroborating       source B) state that       blood pressure management during the acute phase of stroke is a matter of       continuing concern,       and that this is a difficult area.
The CHHIPS study is used as evidence of       a beneficial impact of       administering lisinopril in patients with acute stroke and a systolic       blood pressure&gt;160 mmHg.
The 2012 Royal College of Physicians `National Clinical Guidelines for         Stroke' (corroborating       source C) advise that parenteral drugs for control of blood pressure       should at present only be used       as part of a clinical trial (apart from certain conditions relating to       patients with very high blood       pressure or in preparation for thrombolysis) and highlight the need for       further research in blood       pressure management in acute stroke, with reference to the CHHIPS study.
As an additional approach to ensuring impact from the research, Potter       has contributed to the       preparation of clinical guidelines.
For example, the 2008 guidelines from       the Royal College of       Physicians National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions `Stroke:         national clinical         guideline for diagnosis and initial management of acute stroke and         transient ischaemic         attack (TIA)'.
