     Leeds research into the factors which determine better outcomes for       cancer patients identified multidisciplinary specialised care as important       and proposed networks of care as a suitable means to deliver this.
This       evidence, directly included in the 1995 Calman-Hine report [A],       underpinned new government policies, which were systematically       implemented, changing guidelines, NHS systems and healthcare practice and       leading to improved survival for cancer patients.
Creating the impact: an active programme of implementation           (1995-2007)       Prior to the evidence-based Calman-Hine report which drew heavily on Leeds       research, cancer services were fragmented with care often delivered by       generalists working in isolation in a single discipline, such as surgery,       medicine or radiotherapy.
The research at Leeds underpinned the       development of the new policy of networks of multidisciplinary teams with       specialist services provided at fewer centres.
The implementation of this       strategy was actively supported and funded by the DH with leadership       provided from Leeds (Haward, Mark Baker, Yorkshire Cancer Network       Director and Sean Duffy, Leeds 1990- and Yorkshire Cancer Network       Director).
The plan reconfigured services into Cancer Centres, Cancer       Units and Cancer Networks covering specific geographical areas.
It       involved the designation of appropriate hospitals, consultants and teams       to provide specialised services, including major surgery, for patients       with rare and intermediate frequency cancers.
Cancer Units with adequate       patient volumes to provide sufficient multidisciplinary care were       identified.
This strategy radically changed services in England and Wales affecting       over 250,000 new patients every year.
Selby and Haward were involved in       designing the new services and planning their implementation.
A series of       service guidance documents developed by Haward determined how services for       all the main types of cancer should function and how the component parts       fitted together.
Improving outcomes guidance, subsequently national cancer       guidance, was prepared first for breast cancer and then sequentially in       all cancers (from 1995-2006) [B].
These documents make multiple references       to Leeds-based research.
In breast, colorectal and lung cancer,       specialists moved to multidisciplinary team working; in upper GI,       urological and gynaecological cancers guidance led to changes in hospital       treatment, required multidisciplinary and specialised treatment and       defined the minimum caseload necessary for surgeons.
Patients with rare       cancers were all referred to Cancer Centres.
The established principles in       the Calman-Hine report were supported by further Leeds research and were       incorporated in subsequent policy documents and service guidance [C].
The       evidence-base was vital to gain support for radical changes which had the       potential to be unpopular.
This is likely to have been the first time that       volume/outcome evidence was used in a systematic way to radically change a       health system.
The result of this systematic evidence-based implementation       has been a sustained and ongoing improvement to services and patient       outcomes in the impact window 2008-2013.
Impact on cancer care services       There has been a radical overhaul of the way multidisciplinary care for       cancer is delivered and the configuration of services, a national strategy       which has remained as a cornerstone of service provision.
Since 2008 up to       2013 this has ensured that across England and Wales, appropriate teams are       in place with adequate degrees of service centralisation and specialised       workload.
A rolling programme of peer review has been established for each       service.
Designated requirements are in place for the membership of       multidisciplinary teams, the referral of cancer patients and their review       in multidisciplinary team meetings, with clear criteria for the service       volume requirements for a specialised multidisciplinary team in a Cancer       Centre or a Cancer Unit.
The National Cancer Peer Review (2010-2013)       database [D] records these service changes for all cancer care in England       and Wales ensuring these improvements reach all cancer patients and are       sustained.
Impact on patient survival       All cancer patients now receive expert, peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary       specialised care.
This has been a major factor in the increase in median       survival from three years in 1995 to five years for patients diagnosed in       2008.
The proportion of all cancer patients who survive for five years has       increased from 40% in 1995 to over 50% in 2008.
This impact is ongoing       with survival figures continuing to improve [E,F].
Cancer Research UK have       analysed one, five and ten year survival for England prior to Calman-Hine       (1991-1995) and in five year cohorts up to 2010 for the 21 most common       cancers [F].
Substantial increases in survival of over 5% at 5 years are       seen in 16 cancer sites including the common cancers of breast (13%       increase), colorectal (12% increase) and prostate (over 15% increase).
Important exceptions are cancers of the pancreas (2% increase), lung (4%       increase) and brain (4% increase) where even specialised treatments have       not led to substantial improvements; testicular cancer where 5 year       survival is 97%; and bladder cancer which has not changed.
Although other       factors have contributed substantially including novel therapies,       epidemiological studies and expert opinion have attributed a significant       proportion of that improvement to the changes in policy and care practices       described here [G,H,I,J].
Multidisciplinary specialised care, Cancer       Networks, Centres and Units and peer review driven service delivery and       healthcare practices are regarded as important factors in improved patient       outcomes [H,I].
If best multidisciplinary specialised practice results in       improvements of 5% in 5 year survival as was shown in Leeds research (1,3)       a conservative estimate of the impact of specialised multidisciplinary       care on 5 year survival across all cancers at 1-2% increased survival on       average, would imply many thousands of lives saved every year in England       alone before, during, and continuing after the Impact period, 2008-2013.
Sir Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer (1991-1997), himself a       cancer specialist said: "The reform of cancer care to ensure all         patients were treated by specialists who were working in         multidisciplinary teams was of great importance.
Dame Deirdre Hine and I         were absolutely committed that it should be firmly based on research         evidence to ensure the best care and use of resources and to give us an         evidence-based platform to persuade clinicians to change their         practices.
These changes included radical reconfiguration of surgical         services for major cancer operations.
Leeds oncology/public health         research was critical to our plan and to its successful implementation.
[H]     Sir Michael Richards, National Cancer Director (1999-2012) said: "The         evidence-based plans for multidisciplinary specialised cancer care and         the radical reconfiguration of cancer services have resulted in         improvements in care and survival for cancer patients which continue to         this day.
Leeds research informed the first plan and changes were         sustained in the National Cancer Plan of 2000 and the subsequent         strategies in 2007 and 2011 and this theme continues up to 2013.
The         strong evidence base provided by Leeds, incorporated into the planning         process, was a critical element of its ongoing success."
[I]     The international impact of the evidence generated by the Leeds team is       confirmed from Australia and New Zealand [J].
Professor Jim Bishop,       the former Chief Medical Officer of Australia, said "The initial work         done at the University of Leeds by Haward and Selby was an important         basis for the recommendations within the report by Calman and Hine on         cancer services improvement in the UK.
This evidence and subsequent work         from Leeds have provided an important part of the much needed evidence         base to establish programs to improve the performance of cancer services         in Australia.
In particular, these data were influential in the         development of cancer plans and in the support for multi-disciplinary         care.
As the Chief Medical Officer for Australia, and Board Member of Cancer         Australia (current Chair) the Australian Government Cancer Agency, I         note that this evidence was also influential within the policy framework         for Cancer Australia especially in promoting multi-disciplinary care in         Australia.
Cancer Australia has subsequently developed an extensive         program of support, evaluation and best practice approaches for         multi-disciplinary care in Australia as national standards."
