     Context       UK SME Malvern Instruments Ltd (MIL) is one of the world's leading       developers and       manufacturers of particle characterisation instruments.
Its products are       used during R&amp;D and       manufacturing to understand and control the properties of dispersed       systems ranging from proteins       and polymers in solution, particle and nanoparticle suspensions and       emulsions, through to sprays       and aerosols, industrial bulk powders and high concentration slurries.
In 2005-2006, concurrent with the EPSRC projects (EP/C009541/1 and       GR/R43860/01), MIL       invested &#163;130k in image analysis and crystallisation research and &#163;300k to       sponsor Prof XZ         Wang's Readership position.
The insights from the Vision       project fed into MIL's development of       Morphologi G2, the first instrument in the world able to measure       particle shape and shape       distribution in real time.
Leeds research "contributed notably" in       three areas [A]:            "The selection of appropriate analysis algorithms leading to           improved correlation between           measured parameters and material performance        Designing and carrying out crystallisation experiments to generate           data for system testing           and validation        Using the multi-scale image analysis algorithm developed at Leeds           to process the images           obtained in experimentation in order to do further analysis of the           particles such as texture           analysis and classification."
The first Morphologi G2 was launched at the end of 2005 and was       superseded in September 2007       by the G3.
Impact       The innovative step to which research conducted at the University of Leeds       has contributed has       had a range of impacts during the eligible period on MIL and also on       Morphologi users around the       world in a range of industrial sectors and applications, much of which is       regarded by MIL as       proprietary information.
However, public sources of information shows MIL       to have a truly global       outreach with over 50 international subsidiaries and distributors of their       instrumentation.
MIL       Impacts on MIL are both strategic and financial, the Company strengthening       its competitive       advantage in markets around the world and winning significant new business       since 2008:     - Establishing Morphologi as a key product in its portfolio, helped by       extending the range in       October 2012 with the launch of the G3-ID [B], which added chemical       identification of       particles using Raman spectroscopy to the core imaging functionality of       Morphologi     - Generating revenue of nearly &#163;11m from Morphologi since 2008, "leading         to revenues of         &#163;12 million, about 90% of it was generated since January 2008".
[A]     -Strengthening its position in all of its important markets (Europe,       USA, Asia and the Far       East) through "increased sales and continued growth worldwide" [A]     - Helping "secure a number of people in employment at Malvern".
[A]     As such Morphologi also contributed to the Queens Award for Enterprise,       International Trade in       2011.
[A, G]     Morphologi Users       Morphologi products provide industrial users with critical information       that helps accelerate R&amp;D,       enhance and maintain product quality, and optimise process efficiency.
They are used in both       traditional (e.g.
cement) and advanced manufacturing sectors (e.g.
pharmaceuticals) in       applications including:     - Discovery/R&amp;D screening     - Crystallisation engineering     - Formulation development and optimisation     - Process scale-up and optimisation     - Troubleshooting and root cause analysis in manufacturing     - Automation of microscopy methods e.g.
detection and enumeration of       foreign particulates     - Validation of quality control particle sizing methods (e.g.
laser       diffraction)     Examples of Morphologi's impact on users include the following (note that       quotes in italics are       taken directly from the relevant web pages shown in the corroboration       section that detail the       business advantages these companies experienced since using the       instrument):     - Mo-Sci Corporation (Missouri, USA) regards the Morphologi G3 as       unique, testing       several systems and finding that "while able to characterise our         specialised glass materials         from a size distribution standpoint, other systems couldn't separate out         and identify         individual particles that overlapped within the view of the microscope".
And in terms of       productivity: "During the development of the unique glass beads used in         blood typing cards         (almost half a million glass microspheres per card), it could take three         operators four days         to look at the beads in a single card."
"The Morphologi G3 can         accurately measure all the         beads on a card in around 15 minutes, and that includes setting up the         sample.
The         measurements themselves take only a few minutes and produce enormous         amounts of         information".
[C]     - The Morphologi G3 is used by Solvay Pharmaceuticals (Georgia, USA)       during R&amp;D: "By         analysing shape as well as size, the Morphologi G3...helps us more fully         understand the         materials we are working with and what we can do with them".
The       company previously       contracted out much of its particle characterisation work and has       benefited from "shortened         R&amp;D times and much richer data".
The R&amp;D team also studies       wet granulation: "Being able         to look at the continuum in terms not only of granule size, but also of         shape was a useful         exercise in determining granule growth".
[D]     - Particle Technology Labs (Chicago, USA), a full service       particle characterisation lab,       uses the Morphologi G3 and G3S (G3 with an integrated sample dispersion       unit) to analyse       clients' materials: "Not only has the Morphologi G3 allowed us to move         away from manual         imaging methods, we can now process large numbers of images in many         different ways         and examine a wide variety of parameters to provide more detailed         information and the         extra insight required".
[E] The ability to "investigate         sample-to-sample differences or R&amp;D         applications...is very important for a cGMP compliant laboratory with a         primary client base         in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food &amp; beauty industries".
And the G3S "provides         the highest level of automation, and the greatest variety of measurement         parameters".
[F]     As one of MIL's "key products" [A] the success of this innovative       range of instruments has made an       obvious contribution toward MIL being awarded the prestigious Queen's       Award for Enterprise:       International Trade 2011 [G].
This award adds significantly to the       national and international       reputation of MIL, to pursue excellence within its business sector.
