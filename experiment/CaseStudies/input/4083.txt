     Our close engagement with policymakers and accessible communication of       climate tipping point       research has informed government debate and influenced policy around the       world, and has also       prompted the insurance and reinsurance industry to reconsider their risk       portfolios.
Informing political debate and influencing policy       Interest in climate tipping points, and the prospects for early warning of       them, led the UK       Government Chief Scientist, Sir John Beddington to convene a meeting [a]       (14/3/2011) and       subsequent workshop (26/9/2011) on climate tipping points.
Following this,       the Government Office       for Science, through their Foresight Project on Environmental Change and       Migration,       commissioned a state-of-science review of early warning systems by Lenton       [2] [b], and       recommended their further development to help in adaptation to climate       change.
In 2012, Lenton was an expert witness to the House of Commons       Environmental Audit Committee       as they reviewed the UK Government's performance in protecting the Arctic.
Lenton's evidence, as       well as his research, is referred to throughout the report from the       Committee [c].
The second       recommendation of this Committee acknowledged that "there may be a number       of tipping points in       climate-driven systems in the Arctic, which threaten to rapidly escalate       the danger for the whole       planet" [c].
The response also confirmed that "a significant       component of the 3-year &#163;50 million       DECC and Defra-funded Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme is       devoted to developing a       better understanding of climate system `tipping points'..." [d].
In 2012, Lenton's work was cited in the World Bank Report, 4o         Turn Down the Heat [e].
This report       was subsequently used to inform political debates in Australia.
In 2012,       Western Australia's       Legislative Council referred to the report during debate on the second       reading of the Climate         Change Readiness (Coastal Planning and Protection) Bill 2012 [f].
In 2013, the Australian Capital       Territory (ACT) Legislative Assembly used the report to support a motion       by the labour government       regarding a set of actions for the ACT Government to take on climate       change, including       implementing a renewable energy target of 90% by 2020 [g].
On the other side of the world, Canada's New Democrat Party (NDP)       referred extensively to       climate tipping points during debate of an Opposition Motion on Climate       Change in 2013 [h].
The       NDP called for the federal government to table its climate change       adaptation plan and expressed       considerable concern that the Minister of Natural Resources was unaware of       the "dangerous       tipping point for irreversible damage" to the ecosystem [h].
In the U.S., an authoritative report by the National Research Council,       which was part of a suite of       studies ordered by the US Congress, stated that "rather than smooth and       gradual climate shifts,       there is the potential that the Earth system could cross tipping points or       thresholds that result in       abrupt changes.
Some of the greatest risks posed by climate change are       associated with these       abrupt changes" [i].
Accordingly, the U.S. Department of       Transportation has dedicated an entire       website to the explanation of climate tipping points [j].
A       follow-up National Research Council       committee on `Understanding and Monitoring Abrupt Climate Change and its       Impacts' &#8212; reporting       in Winter 2013/2014 (for which Lenton is a reviewer) &#8212; recommends       establishing an abrupt climate       change early warning system, following [1].
In 2013, Lenton's work identifying Arctic climate tipping points led the       U.S. Interagency Arctic       Research Policy Committee to invite him to a workshop at the White House       (30/4-2/5/13) to       develop a conceptual model of the changing ecosystem in the Chukchi and       Beaufort Seas.
Furthermore, The United Nations invited Lenton to present on tipping       points at their New York       headquarters (20/3/13) in an Expert Group Meeting to help define the       Sustainable Development       Goals which will replace the Millennium Development Goals in 2015.
Improving risk assessment for insurance and re-insurance industry       Work on the Isaac Newton Institute programme and subsequently at Exeter to       assess the risks       posed by different climate tipping points and develop early warning       methods for them was       highlighted at a public `climate change question time' event at Willis Re       (24/11/2010).
In January       2013, Pete Thomas, Chief Risk Officer for Willis Re, one of the world's       leading reinsurance       advisors, gave a keynote address to the 13th National       Conference on Science, Policy and the       Environment in Washington, D.C.
In his address he discussed the problems       associated with       tipping points and some of the unexpected consequences for the insurance       industry [k].
