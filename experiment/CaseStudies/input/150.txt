     Imsense Ltd.: business and staff     The Intellectual Property which formed the core of the patent portfolio       underpinning Imsense Ltd. pipelined from Finlayson's `Colour Lab'       in the School of Computing Sciences at UEA.
This portfolio included       patents covering dynamic range compression [1], fast algorithms [3,4] and       white balance.
Imsense Ltd. was initially registered in 2006.
It       was supported by Seedcorn funding of &#163;200K from the ICENI Seedcorn fund (www.icenifund.com)       and raised venture capital from Braveheart Investment Group plc       (supporting statement [A]) and IQ capital (supporting statement [B]) in       two rounds of investment in 2008 and 2010.
A significant portion of the       investment into Imsense Ltd. came from COIN (supporting       statement [C]): a regional `co-investment fund'.
Like ICENI, this is an       `evergreen' fund whose remit is to invest in companies in the East-Anglian       region, with any returns reinvested into future regional projects.
At the end of 2010, Imsense Ltd. employed eight full time       equivalent members of staff.
The company was initially based in Norwich       before moving to Cambridge in 2009.
`Silicon Fen' as it is known, is the       network of Cambridge-based engineering and science-based companies which       thrive through the large number of co-located high-tech spin-outs and       their interactions.
Imsense Ltd. worked with local businesses such as N++ and Argon       design.
N++ helped Imsense Ltd. develop its stand-alone PC       software `imphoto' (see supporting statement [D]), whilst Argon Design       helped assess the feasibility of implementing the Imsense technology on       dedicated hardware &#8212; a key requirement sought by many of Imsense Ltd.'s       potential customers (see supporting statement [E]).
Imsense Technology     Imsense Ltd. produced and sold software which had a wide impact in       the photographic world.
Its popular [text removed for publication] App imphoto       attracted 100,000 downloads.
Its Eye-Fidelity software was an       integral part of the OnOne Phototune software (see supporting press       release [F]) and Imsense stand-alone PC software was also available for       purchase on-line.
In January 2010 the Imsense software was a winner of an       International Imaging Industry award (in the VISION 2020 competition) for       its Eye-Fidelity Dynamic Range Correction technology, particularly       as applied to real time video content processing (see supporting statement       [G]).
The Imsense processing software was well regarded by photographers,       including the internationally renowned photographer and author Michael       Freeman, who has stated publicly:     "I've just revisited some images I'd previously processed using high-end       photo-processing software.
With imphoto I can get a more natural result in       a fraction of the time"     (see supporting statement [H])     Acquisition of Imsense Ltd. by [text removed for publication]     In 2010 Imsense Ltd. was acquired by [text removed for publication]       and the Imsense technology has now been incorporated into [text removed for publication] product pipeline (see supporting statement [I]) As a result       of the acquisition, investments made in Imsense Ltd. returned a       significant profit.
The acquisition was also significant for the Imsense         Ltd. employees.
For example, the Engineering Team have now been       working at [text removed for publication] for over two years.
On-going Collaboration     Following the Imsense Ltd. acquisition, [text removed for publication] established a four-year programme of collaboration with Prof       Finlayson and the School of Computing Sciences at UEA.
This collaboration       has resulted in additional IPR, which is now being incorporated into new       products.
