     The research undertaken resulted in a threefold impact: (i) a software       platform EPILAB, which has mainly been developed for academic purposes,       nevertheless has strong potential for non- academic impact, (ii) a       commercial device called LTM-EU for epilepsy monitoring, and (iii) the       world's largest epilepsy database of its type with commercial and       scientific impact.
EPILAB: Implementation of the methods we developed described in       issues (i) and (iii) in the underpinning research, together with other       multivariate algorithms and various pre-processing steps, led to the       compilation of the open source software package EPILAB [3] between 2008       and 2012 under the co-supervision of Schelter (IPAM, Aberdeen) and       collaborator Dr Teixeira (Coimbra, Portugal).
It is available from http://www.epilepsiae.eu/project_outputs/epilab_software.
The main contribution and impact of EPILAB is that researchers can run       their own seizure prediction studies interactively without spending time       working on data and programming data analysis algorithms.
EPILAB's       potential to non-academic impact is evident since it can be used as a       toolkit to implement seizure prediction protocols.
As of July 2013, at       least 262 groups worldwide [c1] use this software platform.
As we can only       track the number of downloads and not its field of usage (academic or       non-academic), we cannot investigate if EPILAB has a particular impact       beyond academia already, although its' progression beyond mathematics is       clear.
The software was designed to facilitate research in seizure       prediction but it has also been designed to be ready for use in a       commercial device.
LTM-EU (also called Brainatics): The research in IPAM has       provided major scientific contributions that have made it possible to       define and significantly improve the requirements and specifications of a       long-term monitoring device (LTM), which monitors a patient with epilepsy       continuously over a long period of time.
The device is a low energy       hardware acquisition system for measuring brain activity in epilepsy       patients using bluetooth roaming capabilities.
It monitors the brain       activity via electroencephalography; the device is wearable and therefore       suitable for use in hospitals as well as ambulatory monitoring.
It enables       long-term monitoring over a period of days without requiring the patients       to remain in their beds.
Knowledge gained through the analytical statistics and the seizure       prediction algorithms implemented in EPILAB, has been key to defining the       device specifications.
Together with the company Micromed (Italy)       a partner in the EPILEPSIAE consortium since 2008, the minimal       requirements for such a device were identified [c2, c3].
Micromed phrases       this as follows [c3]: "These research results demonstrated that in         particular in the field of EEG and seizure prediction (1) higher         sampling rates of up to 2048 Hz, (2) wireless low-energy bluetooth         coverage with roaming capabilities, and (3) high number of channels for         an extensive spatial coverage were needed."
Micromed developed the       LTM-EU, also marketed since 2010 under the name "Brainatics", based on       their previous commercial product LTM-Express.
Micromed also states [c3]:       "We discussed these requirements within the EPILEPSIAE consortium; we         were able to meet all requirements and successfully developed the LTM-EU         prototype device."
The device and its software benefited several       updates since then.
The LTM-EU is a medically certified device (CE 0051) [c3, c4].
Since its       development, these devices have successfully been tested in 2011 on       patients in hospital and ambulatory environments: "After thorough in         house testing and testing by the partners in the consortium in a         clinical environment, we could prove the effectiveness of this         acquisition prototype" [c3].
Micromed refers to the device as       follows [c5]: "Though the EPILEPSIAE project was quite challenging, we         believe that this gave us also the opportunity to improve a lot the         hardware and software performances and allowed us to give our         contribution for a better `European Health."
Micromed claims that: "we         would predict the benefits will develop with time, ultimately leading to         improvements to early diagnosis and long term monitoring for patients         suffering from various brain related diseases such as epilepsy.
We         anticipate that a fully automatic wearable seizure prediction and         alarming device might then change the life for epilepsy patients"       [c3].
The EPILEPISAE Database: The EPILEPSIAE project defined the need       for a comprehensive epilepsy database that contains well-annotated       long-term continuous EEG recordings and the corresponding meta-data       including information about medication, duration of the disease, and       information about the seizures.
The EPILAB software was pivotal to this,       especially related to the statistical evaluation framework for seizure       prediction developed in IPAM, which provided information about the minimum       number of seizures, the minimum time between seizures, etc.
that the       database must contain.
As part of his role in the EPILEPSIAE project, Schelter       supervised the design and implementation of what has become the world's       largest relational database for seizure prediction in epilepsy [5, 6, c6].
With considerable influence of Schelter, a working party was       established to determine what information should be included in the       database, in particular with respect to meta information and the minimum       requirements of sampling rates, number of channels and other data types.
Consequently, the necessary structure and tables in the database were       created [5, 6] under guidance and supervision of Schelter and       clinical partners in the EPILEPSIAE consortium then populated this       database with datasets from 275 patients including highly annotated brain       signals and meta data [c2].
The team led by Schelter (IPAM,       Aberdeen) supervised the population of the database in Freiburg; including       all necessary quality checks.
The database is marketed by and directly available through the University       of Freiburg, Germany [see c7].
Although commercial exploitation of the       database has only recently begun (September 2012), it has already       generated revenue of approximately &#8364;24,000.
The European Union projects       the sales figures of the database to be in the order of &#8364;1 Million [c2].
Susan Arthurs, chair of the patient organisation Alliance for Epilepsy       Research, phrases the importance and impact of the database in a       letter of support as follows [c6]: "Dr Schelter used advancements in         technology to study detecting and treating seizures in very different,         non-pharmaceutical ways.
The keystone of much of this research is the         European Epilepsy Database.
Without standardized data it would be         impossible to compare let alone replicate the many studies being         conducted worldwide.
In addition, having this data already collected         reduces the workload in individual research laboratories and allows for         exceptionally large research studies.
This enables many researchers from         around the world and from seemingly disparate fields such as physics,         computer science, mathematics and engineering, as well as medicine, to         run and validate their seizure prediction algorithms."
