     The programme of research has had a significant impact on "major         strategic shifts" (Research Scientist at the Environment Agency) at       the Environment Agency in the area of flooding, in two key respects.
Two years ago, in 2011, the Environment Agency undertook a Flood         Warning Service Improvements Project.
A Research Scientist of the         Environment Agency explains that this: `used the evidence from your           Public response to Flood Warning research (SC020116) to change the           flood warning codes and messages'.
Both the number and design of         the flood warning codes were changed in line with the focus group         findings.
As a direct result of Surrey's research, the Environment         Agency introduced new flood warning codes in November 2010.
With over         5.5 million people (one in six properties) living with flood risk in         England and Wales, the improvements made are expected to result in         increased awareness of flood risk and greater public understanding of         flood warnings and hence resilience.
Secondly, research published in Burningham, K. et al.
(2008) is         currently informing the Flood Incident Management (FIM) Investment         Strategy (from 2013 onwards) which sets the direction for flood         forecasting, warning and response for the next 5-10 years.
A Research         Scientist of the Environment Agency writes: `(we)are producing the           evidence base for where the focus of investment in FIM should be to           achieve the greatest benefits.
This evidence base draws extensively           from Burningham, K., Fielding, J., Thrush, D. (2008) `"It'll never           happen to me": understanding public awareness of local flood risk',           The Journal of Disaster Studies, Policy and Management 31(2)216-238'.
The research has also had considerable impact in relation to Defra's UK       Climate Change Risk Assessment (2012).
A review of social vulnerability to       climate change was carried out as part of the overall risk analysis, and       parts of that work were then summarized in the main Evidence Report       (Twigger-Ross &amp; Orr 2012 ).
Collingwood Environmental Planning who       authored the report write:     `The work of Burningham and Fielding on vulnerable groups to flooding         was a key source for the part of the review focused on flooding.
In         addition, the recent paper by Walker and Burningham (2011) was a key         source for the conclusions within that review.
Dr Burningham also         inputted to the review via a short interview on vulnerability and         climate change.
Further, the work of the JRF (2011) funded project         "Vulnerability to heatwaves and drought: adaptation to climate change"         which Dr Burningham was a part of, was an important source for framing         the concept of vulnerability'.
The Children, Flood and Urban resilience project, on which K Burningham       and J Moran-Ellis were co-investigators, provided feedback to the Cabinet       Office on the National Recovery Guidance and Strategic National Framework       for Community Resilience regarding children, young people and frontline       workers.
The significant impact of this work was recognised by award of       the second place prize for Outstanding Impact in Public Policy in the       first ESRC Celebrating Impact Prize 2013 (http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/press-releases/26059/researchers-celebrated-for-outstanding-impact.aspx)
