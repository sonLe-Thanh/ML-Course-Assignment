     The underpinning research described above has improved the diagnosis of       the hereditary stomatocytoses, avoiding potentially harmful splenectomies       in these patients, and inappropriate investigation of artefactual       hyperkalaemia.
This work has thus established a standard of care for this       patient group.
Since 2008, Stewart's team have analysed ~500 blood samples from Europe       and North America, successfully identifying hereditary stomatocytoses in       17 pedigrees.
The impact of this on patient care and management has been       paramount, facilitating an accurate diagnosis, enabling counselling and       avoiding splenectomy for at least 30 individuals in the UK.
One patient       described the impact of these findings on her family as follows,       contrasting those individuals who underwent splenectomy, with those who       were able to avoid it as a result of Stewart's research:     "Over the years a number of the family have had their spleens removed         either here or in Northern Ireland.
Our own mother had a splenectomy and         she died in 2004 with problems which were associated with blood clotting         and Crohn's Disease.
My elder sister has had the most problems including         a blockage in a vein leading to the liver after her splenectomy and now         has problems with bleeding from the gullet ...
I have an aunt over in         Northern Ireland who had her spleen removed and she had constant         problems with her breathing.
Those of us who have not had our spleens         removed (which includes myself and my younger brother) are well with         little problem or complication from DHS [dehydrated hereditary         stomatocytosis].
We have another aunt over in Northern Ireland who did         not have her spleen removed.
She had 12 children without any major         problems.
We have anaemia, and we need occasional transfusions (not all         of us), but none of the breathing problems or other complications which         other family members have experienced" [a].
A further impact of accurate diagnosis is the correct understanding of       high plasma potassium levels.
In about half of the cases, high plasma       potassium levels have been explained on the basis of leaky red cells,       removing the need for repeated urgent hospital attendances for repeat       potassium measurements.
A patient described the impact on her family as       follows:     "High plasma potassium levels... were a bother to us all as, after any         blood test we would be recalled to hospital as an emergency... One thing         that has changed our lives is the recognition that our habitually very         high plasma potassium levels are due to the abnormality in the red cell         membrane.
This new understanding has saved us countless late-night         hospital visits for urgent repeat potassium measurements" [b].
This work has been widely cited and included in standard textbooks on       this subject [c].
As described above, Stewart's research identified a common single       nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Caucasian population (`Cardiff' [ref       7, above]) which causes a milder non-haemolytic anaemia.
When blood from       these individuals is cooled, the effect on the red cells is substantial,       resulting in major potassium leaks.
As blood taken from donors is       routinely cooled, this raises the potassium in the donated blood from       these individuals.
When administered to patients this risks unexpected and       potentially harmful true hyperkalaemia and the transfusion of damaged or       partly lysed red cells, making the transfusion less efficacious.
As a       result of work by Stewart and Bruce, blood from such donors has been       identified in the existing pool of donated blood at the National Blood       Transfusion Service (NBTS).
In reaction to this finding, the NBTS is now       in the process of implementing a screening strategy for this polymorphism       on all donated blood in order to avoid this complication.
This will have       an impact at a national and potentially international level.
The work is       the subject of a current patent application [d].
Finally, the underpinning research has improved the diagnosis of the rare       metabolic condition phytosterolaemia (sitosterolaemia), in which       absorption of both dietary cholesterol and plant sterols is unrestricted.
This can now be identified quickly by a blood count rather than mass       spectroscopy of lipids, enabling diagnosis of the condition to take place       via routine haematology, without expensive mass spectrometry.
As a result       of this work, a number of individuals and families have been identified in       the UK (five families in Stewart's study, [ref 6, above]), in China [e]       and in the US [f].
The impact of the correct diagnosis is to       enable effective treatment of the condition.
Patients with the condition       do not respond to the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which are       currently the mainstay in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.
Individuals instead must be treated with a diet low in cholesterol as well       as plant sterols including sitosterol.
With correct dietary treatment,       however, cholesterol remains low [g].
