     This project has generated impact through examining the role and value of       the past in cultural and societal change.
It has focused on the specific       case study of Arediou, in central Cyprus, as an example of a small       community that is disengaged from the process by which its cultural       heritage is constructed and presented, and has only a limited voice, if       any, in articulating local/personal experiences of the past.
The aim has       been to explore ways in which this, and similar such communities, might be       persuaded to engage with constructing their own local narrative,       integrating their rich archaeological heritage within more recent       historical experiences.
Our aim has and continues to be to ensure the       preservation of the archaeological and historical heritage of the       community at Arediou, by actively including members of the community in       the creation of historical narratives, to encourage them and give them the       confidence to grasp intellectual ownership of their past and empower them       to engage with their history.
In this the primary objective has been to       change the local mind-set from one of viewing archaeological sites at best       as simply curiosities or at worst, as resources to be looted.
Instead we       have helped to develop and encourage an understanding of the local       archaeology as an important source of knowledge and information regarding       their heritage, one which they would be proud to claim and which they       themselves would seek to protect and curate: effectively transforming, if       you will, 'poachers into gamekeepers'.
The primary beneficiary is the       local community, which has been closely involved in project from its       inception and has intensified since 2008.     a) School involvement (2012-2013): As a result of UWTSD funding       and the subsequent AHRC grant, we have conducted three separate hands-on       archaeology sessions at the local schools, two with around twenty-thirty       children and the third with around sixty children (ages 6-11).
The       children had the opportunity to handle various artefacts uncovered at       their site.
A key aim here was for them not only to reconsider how these       were used and what they might tell us about the ancient community, but       equally to emphasise the importance of smaller, fragmentary, more       ephemeral remains that otherwise might be overlooked, and how these also       contribute to our understanding of the past.
We supplied the teachers with       photographs of the excavation which they have used in follow up       archaeology classes, in which the children wrote about and/or drew the       finds they had handled and the archaeologists they had met.
In 2012 the       school children, through the intermediary of the local mayor (&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#951;&#940;&#960;&#963;&#949;&#961;),       presented the archaeologists with a reconstruction of an ancient boat that       they had made in one of their archaeology classes.
The teachers have also       organised a visit to the archaeological site.
In 2013 we presented the       school with an artist's impression of the site created by Eloise Govier       (PhD candidate, UWTSD) during in the 2012 study season.
During the 2013       season, the project continued its work with the local school to bring the       heritage into the children's educational and cultural horizons; currently       we are preparing an illustrated booklet in Greek telling the story of the       Bronze Age site.
This is designed to excite an interest in the past which       via the children will permeate the wider community.
The link between the       archaeology found at Arediou since 2004 and its placement within a wider       Cypriot context engages the local population in an understanding of the       importance of the village since antiquity.
We are working closely with the       School's headmistress to ensure that this is pitched at an appropriate       level and is suitable for curricular or ex-curricular activities.
b) Community engagement.
As a result of our engagement with the       local school and the wider community on a more informal basis we have seen       a real interest in the community archaeology on the part of the children       and also their parents.
The children demonstrated a good knowledge and       understanding of their heritage and in particular the importance of Cyprus       during the Late Bronze Age during the most recent hands-on session:       knowing the age of the site, the significance of copper production and the       agricultural role &#8212; which they were able to relate to more recent       experiences in the village.
Regular contact within the wider community (in       local kafeneia and small businesses) clearly shows that this has impacted       the wider community's understanding of their ancient heritage and the       importance of the archaeology.
Initial responses to the archaeology ranged       in 2004 from surprise that we were excavating there &#8212; "&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#945;&#960;&#963;&#945;&#943;&#945; &#950;&#951;&#959;         &#913;&#960;&#949;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#973;;" (is there any archaeology in Arediou?)
&#8212; to bemusement at       the collection of sherds, considered at best rubbish &#8212; "&#951;&#953; &#949;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#962;&#951;&#972;;         &#916;&#949;&#957; &#949;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#951;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#951;&#945;!"
(What is that?
It isn't anything!
), to "&#8220;&#960;&#972;&#950;&#959;         &#945;&#958;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#953;;" (how much is that worth?).
Frequently we have been made       privy to the "economic" worth of antiquities within and beyond Arediou &#8212;       from private collections to the common knowledge that "&#972;&#951;&#945;&#957; &#946;&#960;&#942;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;         &#951;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#953; &#946;&#947;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#949; &#950;&#962;&#954;&#953;&#940; &#956;&#941;&#950;&#945;!"
(When we found tombs we planted fig trees       in them [to hide them]!).
Now, the response from the wider community       reflects a clear change in attitude and an appreciation of the cultural       value of their archaeological heritage.
We are now regularly told by       various members of the community how important our work in the area has       been, that the younger members of the community are beginning to       appreciate their past (both recent and ancient) and that it is important       that we are preserving and recording their archaeology.
Most       significantly, there is a clear aspiration on the part of the wider       community to have a local museum showcasing some of the finds from the       excavation (for which we are continuing to facilitate dialogue between the       Local Council and the Department of Antiquities, Nicosia) &#8212; discussed       below.
c) Exhibition and local heritage `investment'.
At the end of each       season of fieldwork (between 2004 and 2008) the excavation team prepared a       display of the key finds of the season for the local community, labelled       in Greek.
The exhibitions were held in conjunction with the village       council who hosted a barbecue for the community.
The aspiration of the       local community, for which we have secured AHRC funding to help develop,       is to establish a permanent exhibition space at Arediou, in the       newly-built Civic Centre.
While UWTSD will provide academic expertise, in       particular the eventual choice of artefacts that will provide a       representative narrative of the archaeology, we will also be making       available an interpretative framework for the archaeology.
During 2013,       the PI consulted with the local community and representatives from the       Department of Antiquities and these discussions have set in place the       necessary groundwork for the establishment of an exhibition space at       Arediou.
An important aspect of the PI's role was to liaise and facilitate       communication at an appropriate level between the Local Council and the       Department of Antiquities, as the route of communication is not always       clear and the local community feels disempowered in their ability to       achieve control over their local heritage.
Meanwhile the Department of       Antiquities has a very strict policy concerning the preservation and       curation of archaeological materials.
Discussions with local stakeholders       have clarified the process with which they need to engage, and have made       accessible a line of communication with the Department of Antiquities (via       Dr Eftychia Zachariou) thereby empowering the local community.
Such       engagement with the local officials, custodians and community leaders       dates back to 2004 and has continued since 2008; this resulted in the       production of a report on the heritage and ongoing project.
Written in       Greek, the report (&#917;&#954;&#952;&#949;&#950;&#951; &#951;&#959;&#965; &#913;&#961;&#949;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#965;) was circulated amongst the local       community, via the mayor, town council and local priest.

d) Photographic record.
The 2013 season (June) saw the development       of two new community strands to the project, both of which have been very       well received.
The first is creating a photographic and video record of       the old village, focusing on two or three buildings which survive to a       reasonable degree and where we know the families and are able to record       memories of occupation up to the 1950s-1960s.
We have also begun a pilot       project, recording the more recent histories of the villagers, likewise to       encourage a more reflexive engagement with the past.
In addition, the       visual record of the old mud brick village, which currently is falling       into ruin, will be made accessible on the project webpage and we hope this       will generate further interest in the valuable historical resources on the       community's doorstep.
This has resulted in a real generation of interest       in the more recent past; most notably, in June the local priest and his       family organised a tour around the old village with older residents, in       which they shared stories and information about the "old way of life".
e) Oral history project.
In addition to the visual recording of       the old village, during 2013 we tested the feasibility of an oral history       project, recording the memories and recollections of the older surviving       villagers.
While we envisage that the experience of sharing and discussing       memories and histories will also have a positive impact on the community,       enhancing their sense of pride in their village and their past there are       broader political questions emerging here also as there is a very strong       sense within the community of a Greek identity.
Furthermore, over several       years working with the community we have gained the elders' trust and have       consequently been made privy to many hidden histories by different members       of the community, including stories which stretch back to the final years       of Ottoman rule on Cyprus.
This potentially important historical       information is largely unspoken within the community and is in danger of       being forgotten and lost forever as the older generation dies out.
These       areas of impact relate to the wider goal of contributing to community       understanding of the immense value of their local heritage, and their       purposeful engagement with this, as something to protect, preserve and       pass on to future generations.
