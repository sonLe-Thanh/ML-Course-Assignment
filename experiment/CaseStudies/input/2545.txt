     The series of international workshops held by the Co-Investigators in       collaboration with the Argentinian Ministry of Science, Technology and       Innovative Production (MOST) served as both research method and       impact-generator and resulted in more open debate than had previously been       achieved in Argentina.
These meetings were led by Arzuaga, who was       appointed an Edinburgh AHRC SCRIPT Centre Fellow (2006-) and subsequently       appointed Chair of the Argentinian Advisory Commission on Regenerative       Medicine and Cellular Therapies (2008).
Research beneficiaries included       the MOST, select Argentine policy and science elites (legislators,       regulators, policymakers, key members of the life sciences, law and       bioethics academic communities), and invited UK experts.
The impact of the research is that, through the systematic engagement of       the research community and law and policy makers, the partnership between       the University of Edinburgh, on one side, and Argentinian research       regulators, on the other, overcame a long-standing impasse in Argentina       with respect to state non-intervention in the regulation of regenerative       medicine.
There had previously been no thorough consideration of       appropriate regulatory models for Argentina to promote research in this       emerging field.
More specifically, the iterative engagement and associated       findings led to:            Influence on the annual agendas of the Advisory Commission on         Regenerative Medicine &amp; Cellular Therapies.
The research directly         influenced the unfolding policy programme by feeding empirical evidence,         theoretical conceptions, and both normative and institutional         recommendations into official processes and actions, especially that of         the Commission, which has since become a key driving force in the life         sciences in Argentina.
According to its Chair, Dr Fabiana Arzuaga: `This         research served to inform and shape crucial steps in Argentina towards         the construction of a legal framework and regulatory policies and action         for stem cells research and therapies, which led to a proposal to modify         the Civil Code of Argentina' (5.2).
Exposure of the reasons behind scientific and regulatory caution, as         well as uncertainty of having a `legal blank page'.
Importantly, this         included an appetite for top-down regulation in Argentina.
The research         provided regulators with evidence that stakeholders desired central         normative guidance and oversight, a finding subsequently confirmed by a         national survey (5.7).
Recommendations about the need for a central         regulatory authority form a central part of the new model law.
Mobilisation of a close network of Argentine and UK researchers and         regulators which permitted swifter and more dramatic policy movement         than had previously been experienced in Argentine science governance.
The research did not just study key Argentine stakeholders, it brought         diverse interested groups together, helping to forge relationships         across user communities and fashion a more supportive environment in a         morally contentious area.
Dr Florencia Luna, bioethics member of the         MOST, stated: `...the project has shown extraordinary results like         creating engagement with law/policy, medical and scientific         communities...and facilitated an unprecedented consideration of         regulatory options' (5.4).
Facilitation and contribution to both the generation of law and the         design and uptake of new models for performing regulation.
Dr Gustavo         Seveler of the MOST and leading medical researcher confirmed that:         `...data and recommendations arising from the meetings were considered         by MOST and INCUCAI [Argentinian Transplant Authority] as inputs of an         iterative process of research design and production of key findings'         (5.5).
The research created new lines of enquiry and helped to identify the       instruments and institutions that would be suitable for Argentina.
Its       findings and conclusions fed directly into the document authored by the       Commission, circulated throughout Argentina and resulting in a draft Life       Sciences Law (setting standards for regenerative medicine research and       patient care) that the MOST sent to the Argentinian Congress in 2013 (5.1       and 5.2).
The role of the research in overcoming impasse in health research       regulation in Argentina is confirmed by Minister Jose Lino Bara&#241;ao:       `...this project contributed to ensuring that a values perspective was       brought to bear on policy deliberations...and that conclusions of the       research have been taken into account in the drafting process' (5.3).
Dr       Arzuaga of the Commission further commented: `This experience combining       research and policy decisions and actions is an extraordinary case that is       now considered by the Commission as a model for many other areas of       science to transfer knowledge to real world' (5.2).
