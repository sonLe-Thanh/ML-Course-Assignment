     HERG's payback research has produced significant and cumulative impacts,       including on public debates and policy, and on the organisation of public       services and medical charities.
The Payback research provides new       evaluation processes that have been applied by organisations nationally       and internationally.
The impacts were partly generated by extensive       stakeholder engagement and dissemination activities by team members (see       below).
Many stakeholders, in turn, promoted the HERG findings showing the       benefits that come from health research, and used this to support their       case for continued and/or increased funding.
For example, those attending       the seminar in Nov 2008 at the Wellcome Trust to launch HERG's Medical         Research: What's it Worth report to key stakeholders included: the       Chief Executive of the MRC and the Director Generals of R&amp;D at the DH       and at the science department.
In 2010 the UK Science Minister       demonstrated the report's considerable importance: `The report on Medical       Research, What's it Worth?
is regarded by BIS Analysis teams as very       comprehensive and rigorous.
It was used as evidence as part of the       preparations for the Spending Review and it will continue to be cited in       the foreseeable future.'
[1]     Examples of the detailed impact of HERG's Payback stream are organised       into three sections below to demonstrate both the research's wide reach       and its cumulative significance.
1) Adoption of HERG's payback framework in organisations' evaluation         strategies or approaches: The wide use of the Payback Framework       arises partly from the decisions of many public and charitable research       funders either explicitly to request that specific impact studies be       organised according to the Payback Framework and/or to include it in their       strategies.
Examples include:            The main Canadian public sector, charitable, and commercial         organisations funding health research combined to sponsor an expert         panel including Buxton.
Tasked with identifying a best method to         evaluate impacts, it proposed a framework that `builds on the combined         logic model and impacts approach of the "payback model"'(p.18).
The         President of Alberta's main health research funding body has described         its adoption in provinces of Canada and in Spain.
[2]       In 2009 ICDDR,B in Bangladesh, one of the leading research centres in         low-and-middle- income countries, incorporated the Payback Framework         prominantly into its `Strategic Plan 2020' covering 2010-2020 and         set out how it would be put into practice.
[3]          2) Impact of HERG's payback work on stakeholders' political campaigns         to support public funding: A wide and international range of       (health) research stakeholders (including public bodies, charities and       public campaigns) have quoted findings from HERG's payback studies as key       evidence when advocating support for medical research.
Here we give just a       few of the many examples of stakeholders who cited the HERG et al (2008)       report: Medical Research: What's it Worth.
In 2010 the Spending Review was intended to make major cuts in         Government expenditure.
In their evidence to the Spending Review many         medical research stakeholders cited the HERG 2008 report prominently in         their arguments in defence of investment in medical research, eg the         Association of Medical Research Charities (AMRC), specific charities,         public funders.
[4,1]       The report was also cited in policy debates as key evidence in         submissions to the government Spending Review by stakeholders concerned         to defend investment in publicly funded research in general, including         by the Commons Science and Technology Committee and by a public campaign         (Science is Vital) that engaged thousands of scientists and         others [5].
More generally, diverse UK, European and international organisations         used the HERG 2008 report to promote investment in medical research,         including investment in research for international development; it was         the first reference in a Royal Society submission on this [6].
3) Impact of the HERG payback work on policy decisions by governments         and charities to sustain and increase health research funding and         enhance the organisation of research systems: The findings from       various payback studies are not only used in policy debates, but in a       range of ways have been cited as influencing the policy decisions of       governments and other research funders in relation to issues about the       level and organisation of medical research funding.
When the results of the UK Government's 2010 Spending Review were         announced medical research had done comparatively well; various         stakeholders identified the HERG 2008 report as a key part of the         evidence that had been successfully used to influence the decision         [4,7].
In 2012 the MRC launched a research programme on understanding the         link between research and economic impact and demonstrated the         continuing policy-relevance of the HERG 2008 report: `Internationally         there has been little new evidence that could assist funding policy in         the UK since the "Medical Research: What's it Worth?"
report'.
[8].
In 2011/12 HERG worked with a local team from RSM McClure Watters to         apply the Payback Framework to assess the impact of health research         funded by the Northern Ireland Executive.
Based on that study the         Executive changed its policy and announced: `Following consideration of         the report, and the benefits outlined in it, the Health Minister has         decided to invest &#163;2.6 million' to become a full partner of the National         Institute of Health Research (NIHR).
[9].
Asthma UK funded HERG to lead an evaluation of the impacts of their         research funding.
They used the analysis of how different funding         streams had contributed to impacts to help revise their funding         strategies, and hoped the report's publication would boost research         funding.
[10]       When in April 2013 the NBCF in Australia launched the impact         assessment conducted by HERG it received a high media profile, which was         important to increase public understanding of the charity's         achievements, provide accountability for past expenditure, and         justification for future funding by supporters.
On policies it also         stated: `As a consequence of this evaluation process NBCF has decided to         take three actions in terms of future investment in research....we have         decided to substantially boost our investment in translational         research.'
[11]          Extensive dissemination helped generate the full range of these impacts.
It included publications, invited presentations, seminars, and advice       directly to stakeholders, eg on committees in Canada [2], the EU, Ireland,       WHO and the UK.
The resulting impact, illustrated by the key examples       above, has potentially had even wider implications.
The additional/better       organised health research that arose (at least partially) as an impact       from HERG's work might, itself, reasonably be expected on occasions to       have generated some of the range of wider impacts including on health and       welfare.
