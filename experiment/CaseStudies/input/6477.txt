     The 2010 report caught the Government's attention and featured in a       discussion in the House of       Lords on 25th February 2010 [1].
The striking vulnerability of       many corporate and private       businesses during the recent economic downturn gave rise to keen       government interest in the EO       model as an alternative to the reliance of the UK economy on private and       shareholder &#8212; ownership       models.
This interest extended to the discussion of EO as a promising       alternative to the       privatisation of state-owned and not-for-profit public services.
Scotland       and Wales, which have       proportionally more small firms, cooperatives and family-owned businesses       than England, are       moving in the same direction.
`Making a positive difference to public         services', a 2011 policy paper       by Cooperative Development Scotland (CDS), refers to evidence from the       Lampel/Bhalla report to       make the case for the benefits of the EO business model.
CDS is a premier       policy and business       advisory body supporting the development of cooperative and employee-owned       enterprises across       Scotland [2].
The Wales Cooperative Centre, in a report by its Bevan       Foundation, also makes a       case for the benefits of cooperatives, citing evidence from the       Lampel/Bhalla study [3].
The coalition government has continued the previous Labour government's       commitment to the       development of social enterprises to deliver health and social care as       part of a programme of       public service reform.
A 2010 Department of Health report sought to       encourage health care       providers to consider EO and the development of mutuals, with the aim of       creating the largest and       most vibrant social enterprise sector in the world.
In a report titled `Social         Enterprise in Health Care         &#8212; Promoting Organisational Autonomy and Staff Engagement' (August       2011), the King's Fund, a       premier charity in the health and social care sector, recognised that the       new policy environment       presented both opportunities for social enterprises to play a significant       role as providers of health       care and several challenges and risks which meant that they would need to       develop effective and       sustainable business models [4].
The report, which contains key       recommendations for government       on reforming the health and social care sectors along the lines of the EO       model, cites the       Lampel/Bhalla findings extensively to support its arguments.
In a speech at the Mansion House on responsible capitalism on 16th       January 2012, the Deputy       Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP, focused attention on employee       ownership, citing the       Cass study: "Lower absenteeism, less staff turnover, lower production         costs.
In general, higher         productivity and higher wages.
[EO firms] weathered the economic         downturn better than other         companies"[5].
In February 2012, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)       initiated the Nuttall       Review of Employee Ownership to review promoting the benefits of employee       ownership in the       private sector and invited Lampel and Bhalla to contribute to the review       and conduct further       analysis on the long and short-term benefits and consequences of the       employee ownership model.
This research, conducted over a four-month period, provided further       evidence to support the EO       model [6] [7].
On 4th June 2012, the BIS study: 'The         Employee Ownership Advantage: Benefits and         Consequences' was released in conjunction with 'Sharing Success:         the Nuttall Review of         Employee Ownership'.
Both studies were presented at the Summit for       Employee Ownership held       on 4th July 2012, which opened with a keynote speech by the       Deputy Prime Minister and at which       Lampel presented the Cass research findings.
Other speakers included Sir       Charlie Mayfield,       Chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, the Rt Hon Francis Maude MP and       the Rt Hon Norman       Lamb MP.
The two reports and this event generated a commitment from the       Government and a       wide range of stakeholders to take forward the Nuttall recommendations for       increasing employee       ownership and removing barriers to it occurring.
The Government published       its formal response,       'Next steps for employee ownership`, in October 2012.
Another policy perspective recommending and laying out a template for the       public sector's move       towards EO can be found in the BIS position paper `Mutualisation of the         Post Office'.
This report,       published in September 2011, cited the central finding of the       Lampel/Bhalla research in making a       case for `mutualisation' or employee ownership.
The Government's response       to the consultation       published in July 2012 also cited the Cass research in relation to       sustainability of EO firms through       economic downturns and the potential for the engagement of staff to       improve the Post Office's       financial performance under the proposed new model [8].
Lampel and Bhalla were subsequently invited to join the Government's       Implementation Group for       Employee Ownership [9] which was formed in November 2012 with a remit to       advise the Minister       of State on the implementation of EO policy.
The Group is chaired by Jo       Swinson MP, Minister for       Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs, meets bi-monthly and brings       together other       government departments, the business and professional services sector and       the EO sector.
The       recommendations of the group have informed recent policy initiatives       launched to promote       employee ownership.
For example, on 4th July 2013 the       Government announced plans to make       &#163;50M available annually to encourage EO in the UK and launched a       consultation on providing two       new forms of tax relief [10].
The research also informed the Liberal Democrat policy 106 on employee       ownership [11].
On 27th       March 2013, the Deputy Prime Minister launched a consultation on 'a relief       on tax on bonuses paid       through benefit trusts, where a significant chunk of the business is owned       by employees`.
In his       speech announcing the consultation, Nick Clegg said: "Employee         ownership works because it so         neatly aligns incentives and puts the workers at the heart of the         business....
The Cass Business         School concluded in 2010 that employee-owned businesses are between nine         and 19% more         productive than traditionally structured companies.
So not only does         employee ownership help         build a more motivated, more committed workforce, but it improves the         bottom line too"[12].
The research has received extensive media coverage which has raised       general awareness of the       benefits of employee ownership [13].
Print media coverage has included       articles in the Financial         Times and The Economist.
Following the Deputy Prime       Minister's Mansion House speech, Bhalla       was invited to present the key findings on the BBC News on 18th       January 2012.
The study was       discussed at length in the BBC Newsnight programme on 25th       May 2012, during which, in       response to a question from Emily Maitlis on what British businesses can       learn from the       partnership model, Norman Lamb, Minister for Employment Relations, said: "Cass         Business         School demonstrated that they [Employee-owned firms] have been more         resilient through difficult         economic times and they have been more profitable.
So this is a powerful         concept and the key is         how we can unlock the potential of this for use in the rest of the         economy."
On 17th July 2012, the       research was acknowledged in a discussion about mandating all companies to       have employees on       boards during a House of Commons Debate on Enterprise and Regulatory       Reform Bill [14].
In March 2013, the Deputy Prime Minister backed a call from the Employee       Ownership Association       for a threefold increase in the value of EO firms to UK GDP (currently       standing at 3% of GDP) by       2020.
The Deputy Prime Minister said: "Through tough economic times,         these firms can outperform         others...from April next year we will inject &#163;50M into the sector,         making it easier for staff to take         over the running of companies and for new firms to set up under EO         models" [12].
On 30th April       2013, while outlining changes to over-burdensome share buy-back rules       aimed at boosting direct       employee ownership and cutting red tape, Jo Swinson MP, Minister for       Employment Relations and       Consumer Affairs, again cited the Bhalla/Lampel report to support the case       for employee       ownership.
The Cass research has had a substantial impact on government policy by       providing evidence that       has enabled policy-makers to argue the case for EOBs as an attractive       organisation model.
The       key beneficiaries of these developments are: (i) companies, with the       potential for increased       flexibility in the workforce leading to new initiatives and increased       productivity and staff retention;       (ii) employees, both financially through the sharing of profits and       through greater job satisfaction       and wellbeing; and (iii) communities which benefit through the quality of       services delivered (for       example, EO firms such as Waitrose are well regarded for their charitable       giving activities).
This is       of particular significance at a time when the knowledge and       skills-intensive sectors are critical to       long-term economic sustainability.
It is also significant for employment       in sectors such as health       and social care where those in need of care benefit because care       professionals may have a       stronger sense of commitment when they have a stake in the health or care       organisation.
