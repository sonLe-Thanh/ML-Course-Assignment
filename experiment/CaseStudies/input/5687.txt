     Reynolds is one of the world's leading school effectiveness       researchers and is currently (2011-present) the Senior Educational Policy       Adviser to the Welsh Government, responsible for applying his research to       the Welsh (and from Wales to the international) policy-making and       practitioner community with a view to raising Wales's showing in PISA [5.1].
Reynolds is also, through his membership of the Board of E-ACT and       as Chair of its Educational Committee, using his research to impact         directly on 31 schools with 20,000 children and 3,000 staff [5.2].
In the US, his High-Reliability School research, which has been       disseminated in the leading American practitioner journal Phi Delta         Kappan and at multiple practitioner and policy-maker conferences,       has led to the current construction of a US national cadre of         `High-Reliability School Districts' [5.2].
Muijs's research on the effectiveness of `TeachFirst'       significantly and directly influenced the decision to expand that       programme.
The DfE document, `The Case for Change', informed the 2010       White Paper and cited his research, as a result of which the government       decided to "more than double the size of TeachFirst and extend it         across the country and into primary schools" [5.3].
Muijs's       research on the impact of collaboration between schools was also incorporated         into, and cited by, the NCSL's `Guide to Federations', produced for       all headteachers in the UK [5.3].
In Europe, he serves on the       committee that advises (and reports directly to) the Education Minister of       the Flemish Government on reforming teacher training [5.4].
Kelly and Downey's research has made a direct contribution to         changing the practice of professionals by encouraging the use of       data by local authorities and has been regularly cited in policy-making       circles.
The research, described by one LA as "invaluable", enabled       Dorset, for example, to develop tools to survey children's well-being,       saving the Authority more than &#163;100,000 in direct costs (based on the       rates that were charged at the time for the Pupil Attitudes to School and       Self (PASS) survey from `W3 Insights') [5.5].
Kelly was       called as an expert witness before the House of Commons Select Committee       on Education (10/11/2010) and also serves on the Parliamentary Group on       School Governance since its inception in 2011, both of which have materially         affected the way schools are governed and inspected in England and       Wales.
Kelly's research has also been cited in Parliamentary       Debates (e.g.
in January 2013, Lord Clancarty cited Kelly when he opened       the debate in the House of Lords opposing the government's EBacc       Certificate proposals, which Minister Gove subsequently withdrew) [5.6].
Downey, Muijs and Kelly's FFT-funded study developed new       quantitative metrics for optimising data-use by practitioners,       which has had a direct effect on the content of FFT's service to schools       and LAs throughout England and Wales [5.7].
Kelly's recent project       (2012-13) on Jersey has drawn on this theoretical work on equity       measurement, and the marrying of school effectiveness and Sen's (Nobel       prize-winning) `capability' approaches, and is impacting on schooling on       the island.
Findings by Kelly and Downey about the extent to which data can       be used as a driver for reform in schools was cited in the DFE's         `Impact of Research' policy review document by Goldacre and Plant       (2013), the effect of which has been to steer government policy towards       greater reliance on robust longitudinal and RCT-trialled practice [5.8].
The group's extensive programme of dissemination to practitioner and       policy-maker audiences through multiple conference presentations is       exemplified by the influential (`State of the Art') reviews by Muijs       and Reynolds commissioned by ICSEI in 2011 and 2012.
ICSEI is one       of the few international organisations in education that links       policy-makers, practitioners and researchers (in Cyprus in 2011, 43% of       the 500+ delegates attending the annual conference were leading       practitioners and high-ranking policy-makers; in Malmo in 2012, the figure       was 46% of 600+ attendees).
In 2011, Reynolds presented his       research to 1,250 practitioners at the Chinese National Association for       School Effectiveness and Improvement organised by Shenyang Normal       University; and in 2013, Muijs presented his research to more than       1,500 headteachers in Chile and the Chilean Minister of Education.
All       locations show evidence of take-up of `effective schools' practices and       the contribution "had a great impact on teacher training and on the         formation of educational policy".
