     The struggles between Hanoverians and Jacobites attending the formation       of the British union in       the eighteenth century (culminating in the failed risings of 1715, 1719       and 1745) are not only       crucial episodes in the formation of the modern British nation state, but       play a central role in       understandings of modern Scotland.
The fresh insights generated by       Aberdeen research into the       history of these events have had an impact on Scotland's heritage and       tourism industry and on       public discourse about Scotland by informing the reconstruction of the       visitor centre at Culloden       and a major exhibition at the Scottish Parliament, subsequently restaged       in Aberdeen.
4.1.
Stimulating Tourism and Generating Cultural Benefits Through the         National Trust         Visitor Centre at Culloden     This impact originated in work undertaken prior to the Census Period.
In       2005-6 the National Trust       for Scotland raised &#163;9.5 million from a public appeal (&#163;1.8m), the       Scottish Government (&#163;3.75m),       the European Regional Development Fund (&#163;2.4m), Highlands and Islands       Enterprise Inverness       and East Highlands (a company which `engages in promoting economic       development by providing       financial assistance and infrastructural support', &#163;350,000) and the B&#242;rd       na G&#224;idhlig (&#163;200,000) to       reconstruct its visitor centre at Culloden.
This was the largest project       the Trust had ever       undertaken.
(1,2) Mackillop's research specialisation in Hanoverian policy       and Highland       engagement on the Government side led to his being appointed as one of the       Trust's expert       advisors on its academic panel which had oversight of the formulation,       structure and delivery of       the Centre's historical interpretation.
As a direct consequence of       Mackillop's involvement, the       principle of equality of interpretative space for Jacobites and       Hanoverians was enshrined from the       early planning stage.
This principle of equality even directly affected       the final interior with the       adoption of a `Jacobite' and `Government' wall, where dedicated       chronologies, themes, and       examples for each side could be displayed and explained.
On the basis of       Mackillop's involvement,       the Centre heightened the emphasis given to Gaelic-speaking communities       and clans who actively       supported the Hanoverians.
It also highlighted Highland engagement with       British imperialism in the       decades after Culloden.
(3) Finally, the Trust commissioned Mackillop to       contribute an article to the       Centre's guide book, selling c. 36,000 copies during 2008-11 and 8,154       between July 2012 and       July 2013.
(2, 3)     Much of this redevelopment work took place in 2006 and 2007, but the       centre officially re-opened       in December 2007.
At that event, Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond,       described the battle as       `a hugely significant part of Scotland's history' and praised a `first       class visitor attraction and an       innovative record of a vital part of Scotland's history'.
(1) The work       done at the Centre has had an       ongoing impact during the census period.
The ultimate beneficiaries of       this re-opening include the       NTS and visitors, not least parties of school children in visits arranged       by the Trust.
The       redevelopment of the Centre saw an increase in visitor numbers.
In 2005,       2006 and 2007 (prior to       the redevelopment) the Centre received 87,340, 89,332, and 84,227 visitors       including schools.
Visitor numbers increased after the Centre re-opened: 2008: 125,687       (excluding schools); 2009:       109,437 (excluding schools); 2010: 94,292; 2011 (including schools):       96,200; 2012 (including       schools): 96,424; 2013 (including schools, to the end of July): 61,389.
Between March 2008 and       July 2013 the Centre received a total of 25,307 visitors in school       parties.
During that period (and       including schools from 2011) the cumulative total of visits to the Centre       numbered 583,429.
A       comparison of average visitor numbers in 2005-7 and 2008-12 reveals that       visitor numbers were       20 per cent higher in the later period.
Even excluding 2008 (the       year of the Centre's re-opening)       and 2009 (the Year of Homecoming) and comparing 2005-7 with 2010-12       results in a 10 per cent       increase in visitor numbers, suggesting that the impact of the       redevelopment has been sustained.
(2) A survey of 143 visitors to the Centre in 2011 and 2012 conducted for       the NTS by Ronnie       Cramond (former chairman of the Scottish Museums Council) concluded that       the Centre was       transforming visitors' conceptions of the battle.
As Cramond commented to       the Herald:     Almost all visitors surveyed said that the Centre had increased their       knowledge significantly.
Many highlighted new knowledge that had specifically surprised them about       the battle, such       as: that the battle was not between Scotland and England or between       `Catholic' Highlanders       and Protestant Lowlanders but rather that it was part of a wider       international military and       political struggle .... (4)     This changed understanding of the battle was precisely the area in which       Aberdeen's research       findings and Mackillop's contributions to the project were concentrated.
(2, 5) Thus the       redeveloped visitor centre saw an increase in tourist numbers combined       with a cultural enrichment       based on the findings of Aberdeen research.
4.2.
`Rebels with a Cause: The Jacobites and the Global Imagination'         at the Scottish         Parliament, subsequently re-staged in Aberdeen University Library     A second impact came through a major exhibition at the Scottish       Parliament from 27 October 2010       to 8 January 2011.
This exhibition, as the first to be staged in the new       Holyrood Parliament,       testified to the profound contemporary political significance of the       history of the formation of the       British state.
It also facilitated the Parliament's mission of `engag[ing]       with the Scottish public and       to delivering stimulating, educational public exhibitions that will       attract a wide range of       audiences...to the Parliament'.
(6) The exhibition drew exclusively on the       University's collections       (Aberdeen has the largest collections of Jacobite-related material in the       world after the British       Library) and placed at its centre the global dimensions of Jacobitism, a       major focus of Aberdeen       research (as described in Section 2).
The exhibition was co-ordinated by       the University of       Aberdeen's Archivist and Head of Special Collections.
Mackillop was       directly involved in the       planning, and provided explanatory text displays on the nature of Scottish       Jacobitism and Jacobite       exile in North America and India.
Members of the unit including Frost,       Davidson, Mackillop and       Morrison also contributed to a public lecture series which accompanied the       exhibition.
(6)     The opening of the exhibition featured in the Scottish press and was       covered on BBC Radio's       `Good Morning Scotland' and on STV.
(7, 8) Over 24,000 hits were recorded       on the Parliament's       press release.
The exhibition itself attracted 55,622 visitors during its       three-month duration.
Of       those completing the exhibition's visitor survey, 70.2 per cent rated it       good or excellent, and 69.1       per cent stated that they gained knowledge of the global dimensions of       Jacobitism.
A digest of       visitors' responses to the question of Jacobites' contemporary relevance       generated a broad range       of answers highlighting the powerful resonance of Jacobites in       contemporary Scottish political       discourse.
An analysis of this visitor feedback by the Parliament       concluded that the key theme of       the exhibition drawn from Aberdeen research (the complexities of Jacobite       and Hanoverian support       and ideologies) `got across'.
According to visitor feedback, the       exhibition also made an important       contribution to public participation in political and civil life.
38.8 per       cent of visitors travelled to the       Parliament specifically for the exhibition.
Prior to coming only 30.9 per       cent of visitors said they       were `quite' or `very' involved in the Parliament's activities; after       attending the number rose to 45.7       per cent.
(7) The exhibition was subsequently re-staged in the dedicated       exhibition space at the       University of Aberdeen's newly-constructed Sir Duncan Rice Library (see       REF3A), generating       further benefits locally.
From November 2011 to March 2012 it attracted       10,496 visitors.
Associated       `Family Fun' days (143 attendees) and schools visits (148 pupils) shared       the exhibition's findings       with younger audiences.
Feedback on the Family Fun Days was overwhelmingly       positive with 97       per cent rating the content excellent (84 per cent) or good (13 per cent).
(9)     Thus, the reconstructed visitor centre and Jacobite exhibitions presented       a more complex,       nuanced, and global image of Jacobitism to a wider Scottish public that       drew heavily on Aberdeen       research, generated cultural benefits for visitors and enriched Scottish       political discourse, as well       as yielding economic benefits through tourism.
