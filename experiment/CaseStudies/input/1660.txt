     Mascie-Taylor's research has been widely recognised as having had a       significant influence on UK and Bangladesh government policy, practice and       understanding in relation to food supplementation and the association       between poverty and undernutrition.
By being instrumental in bringing       about changes in government policy and practice, the study has benefited       the poor of Bangladesh and improved their health, wellbeing and nutrition       and reduced individual and household poverty through new programmes       involving 250,000 households (~1 million participants).
Professor Mascie-Taylor and his research team were invited to initially       disseminate the research findings in 2003 through a half-day symposium       held at the National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM),       Dhaka with key stakeholders as well as at meetings with World Bank and       DFID personnel.
Naturally, the findings from NMT's research around the       lack of impact of the BINP on infant weight gain caused significant       concern.
Following this and with input from Professor Taylor and citing       the above research (p.155), the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) an       independent unit within the World Bank; carried out a re-analysis of the       BINP outcome data and published the report `Maintaining Momentum to         2015?
An Impact Evaluation of Interventions to Improve Maternal and         Child Health and Nutrition in Bangladesh` (February 2005, OED, World       Bank)(a), drawing similar conclusions (e.g.
p.38 `However,         nutritional outcomes in terms of low birth weight have been         disappointing'.
p211 `Participation in supplementary feeding was         not found to have a significant impact')(b)     This report then led to a second World Bank report in 2005 `The         Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project, Effectiveness and Lessons'       aiming to address this controversial issue.
The report states `p.iii     `There has been considerable debate in the press and the scientific         community and among development partners about the impact of BINP.
This         study tries to lay that debate to rest by critically reviewing the         various evaluations and trying to explain the variation across the         results that were obtained.'
The report repeatedly cites the findings of the above research as well as       the OED re-analysis, and reluctantly acknowledged the validity of NMT's       findings on supplementary feeding and weight gain.
For example it states     `the available evidence from BINP does not show that it improved         growth in BINP children, weight gain in pregnant women, or birth weight         in infants.'
(p.37).
Eventually, a clear impact of the research on policy and practice was the       ending of the National Nutrition Programme in 2011 as a result of the       recognition by the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and The World Bank that       Mascie-Taylor's independent research had shown a number of significant       weaknesses in the programme's design and implementation.
In the light of       these weaknesses, the GoB, in the new Health, Population and Nutrition       Sector Development Programme (HPNSDP, 2011-2016), closed the NNP(c)       and decided to implement a new policy incorporating the outcomes of       Mascie-Taylor's earlier research.
Subsequently, DFID has collaborated with the Government of Bangladesh in       two projects designed to meet MDG1, again building on Mascie-Taylor and       team's evaluations of the BINP/NNP and CFW programme.
These programmes,       Shiree/Economic Empowerment of the Poorest Programme (EEP), aim to bring       1.5 million people out of poverty by 2015 and involve a number of NGOs.
As       a result of the importance attached to his research outcomes,       Mascie-Taylor was invited to become the Nutrition Advisor on these       projects and also to lead the evaluation of the effectiveness of the       programmes.
His engagement on the project has extended to capacity       building for local staff to undertake monitoring and evaluation.
Evidence       from the programme evaluation (being undertaken by Mascie-Taylor and Goto       for DFID) has already shown significant benefits to programme participants       (DFID, 2011, 2012 and 2013)(d,e).
Improvements were also found       in wealth and income, expenditure, nutrition and health.
In the first year of the programme (2010-2011) average household         assets rose by 7000 Taka/month and again by 3000 Taka/month between       2011 and 2012.
Mascie-Taylor's research into this improvement has       attributed this to increased animal ownership (an increase of 28.4% to       63.9% of households) and land ownership (15.2% to 31.4%).
Income also rose &#8212; from 1766 Taka/month to 3298 Taka/month in       2012.
Whilst expenditure also rose over the period (from 19.5 Taka pppd to       26.3 Taka pppd), by 2012, nearly all households on the programme devised       mainly by Mascie-Taylor had managed to accumulate some cash savings (84%)       compared with less than 36% at the outset of the programme in 2010.
Furthermore, the amount of savings had increased by over 10 fold (from       about &#163;3 to over &#163;30).
The increased household income and in rural areas the promotion of       household gardens resulted in nearly all household reporting improved         nutrition.
Most householder members reported eating three meals/day       and with greater food diversity, especially increased consumption of fish,       eggs and green leafy vegetables.
There are positive signs of the programme having fostered improvements         in nutritional status with adults gaining weight and the prevalence       of anaemia falling.
In children the prevalence of anaemia, which had been       very high at over 60%, fell to only 36%, which is less than the national       prevalence.
The programmes have also been associated with improvements in health.
For example, subsequent analysis of the results has shown that the       proportion of programme participants reporting chronic health conditions       dropped from 15.6% to during the same period.
There were also reported       reductions in fever and coughs in children and babies.

(DIFD,       2012)(d)                      In summary Mascie-Taylor's research has directly influenced government       policies in a way that has changed the lives of thousands of people in the       most profound way possible, helping to alleviate the worst effects of       poverty.
