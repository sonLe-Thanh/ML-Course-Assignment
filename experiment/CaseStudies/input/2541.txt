     Impact has been achieved through the Centre's high level of engagement       with key policy-makers, index bodies, companies and investors.
Additionally, opportunities for impact have been generated by the fact       that carbon accounting and performance measurement is such a new field,       with massive financial implications (for example the International Energy       Agency estimates that responding to climate change will require       approximately US$1tr/year of additional investment).
1.
Carbon Accounting.
Recognising that carbon accounting is framed         differently by different communities of practice has helped to enable         collaboration between communities to propose more effective solutions to         carbon accounting problems.
The concept of five key frames of carbon         accounting (Ascui and Lovell, 2011) was enthusiastically endorsed by the         Executive Director of the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) in         2011, and now features in the opening slide of the standard CDSB         presentation template [5.1].
For example, it has been used to introduce         debate at a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Climate         Change in November 2011 on the topic of "Consistency in Climate Change         Disclosure for Better Decision Making" [5.2].
In January 2012, the Executive Director of the CDSB wrote to Ascui         providing feedback on a draft of Ascui and Lovell (2012), noting the         CDSB's interest (as suggested in the paper) of moving from climate risk         reporting into carbon financial accounting [5.8].
In January 2013,         Lovell, Ascui and other academics, with the CDSB and the International         Emissions Trading Association (IETA), hosted a two-day joint         academic-practitioner workshop at the UoE Business School, aimed at         helping to resolve one of the problems identified in Ascui and Lovell         (2011), namely that there is currently no international standard for         carbon financial accounting.
The workshop included representatives from         the International Accounting Standards Board, European Commission and         the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, all of whom         expressed strong interest in the research presented.
A key outcome from         the workshop was a 7-page submission, by the organising academics, CDSB         and IETA, to a consultation by the European Financial Reporting Advisory         Group (EFRAG) on a possible new international standard for carbon         financial accounting [5.3].
2.
Carbon benchmarking.
Mackenzie's research has built the         evidence base that sustainability benchmarking can drive corporate         performance improvements.
This research has been greatly strengthened         during the period Mackenzie has worked at the Centre, both         methodologically (Mackenzie, Rees and Rodionova, 2013) and in terms of         impact.
A key impact is carbon benchmarks for supermarkets and mobile         telecoms, funded by major companies in the respective sectors (see         above), leading in 2009 to the creation of ENDS Carbon, a University         spinout company backed by &#163;300k of investment from Haymarket plc.
ENDS         Carbon has now benchmarked over 1,000 companies for 20 corporate         clients; a market-leading trade publication (Brand Republic); and FTSE         Group, the international index provider [5.4].
3.
Benchmark-driven investor activism.
Mackenzie's work         demonstrating that performance ratings and investment indices influence         corporate environmental management (published in Mackenzie, Rodionova         and Rees, 2013) has directly encouraged their use by investors as the         basis for their investor activism.
In 2010, the Carbon Disclosure         Project, the world's leading initiative encouraging voluntary corporate         carbon disclosure, launched the "Carbon Action" initiative, based partly         on Mackenzie's benchmarking research [5.5].
The initiative has recruited         over 90 global institutional investors with $7tr of assets, and last         year engaged with 50 large international companies to reduce carbon         emissions.
The Chief Executive of the UN Principles of Responsible Investment (UN         PRI), a network of 1,200 investors (with $35tr in assets under         management), credits Mackenzie's work as a key inspiration for the PRI's         corporate engagement focus.
His research has prompted a new PRI         initiative testing the effectiveness of shareholder engagement         strategies using a randomised trial of engagement with 2,200 companies.
According to UN PRI, this work "will allow the PRI Secretariat to more         effectively inform the collaborative engagement process in the future."
[5.6].
Mackenzie and Rees are involved in the analysis.
Mackenzie was         also appointed to chair the committee designing the UN PRI's own         benchmark for its 1200 investment institution members.
4.
Additional impacts.
In 2009, Mackenzie and Ascui were invited         by the UN Global Compact to write an executive briefing paper, in the         lead-up to the Copenhagen climate summit, on investor leadership on         climate change.
Their definition of climate bonds, included in the         paper, was adopted by the Climate Bonds Initiative in their briefing         papers on the subject [5.7].
Mackenzie and Ascui's research has also informed the Business School's         carbon finance executive education programmes delivered to 28 senior         decision-makers from 17 countries over 2009 and 2010, and a Foreign and         Commonwealth Office funded training programme on carbon policy delivered         in 2012 to the largest group of directors from China's National         Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and provincial DRCs ever to         travel overseas as a single delegation.
NDRC is the most influential         government department in China.
A final, and more general, indicator of         the utility of the research is the fact that large UK and international         companies have invested over &#163;500k in its further development and         application.
This includes &#163;25k from Tesco, Waitrose and Marks and         Spencer in 2008, &#163;42k from Vodafone, Deutsche Telecom, Telefonica and         France Telecom in 2009-10, &#163;300k from Haymarket in 2009, and &#163;80k from         Brand Republic, the UK's leading marketing website, in 2010.
