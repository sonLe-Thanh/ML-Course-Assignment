Hodgen et al.
's research has directly contributed to a shift in       policy about participation in mathematics education post-16 from one       concerned with encouraging `more young people [to] continue longer       with the study of mathematics' [22, p.13] to one aimed at ensuring       `that within a decade the vast majority of pupils are studying maths right       through to the age of 18' [Michael Gove: 17].
The impact of the new policy       is not limited solely to participation in post-16 mathematics education;       it will have a significant widening participation impact.
In comparison to       other A-levels, participation in mathematics education is skewed towards       high attainers, boys and groups with low deprivation, whilst a mathematics       qualification (GCSE or A-level) brings significant economic and other       social benefits [see evidence cited in 10].
The current government came to power with serious concerns about       attainment in school mathematics and the UK's relative performance       internationally, but was not then committed to the majority studying       mathematics to 18.
In his early speeches as Secretary of State for       Education, Michael Gove frequently mentioned concerns about mathematics       attainment at primary and GCSE levels, but made no mention of post-16       mathematics.
2011-12 was a turning point.
At this time four influential reports were       published recommending a substantial expansion of post-16 mathematics       education.
In each of these Hodgen et al.
's data on international       participation rates was the key evidence cited (and was reproduced in       detail in three of the reports [13, 14, 15]):            In 2011 the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education (ACME) [13]         recommended that `Policy on mathematics post-16 should ensure that a         large majority of young people continue with some form of mathematics         post-16' (p.3), and reproduced the participation table from Hodgen et           al.
's first Nuffield report, Is the UK an Outlier?
[7] in         full to support this recommendation.
Established by the Royal Society         and the Joint Mathematical Council, ACME is the key national stakeholder         body on mathematics education, acting as a `single voice for the         mathematics education community to government'         (http://www.acme-uk.org/about-acme).
The Conservative Party's mathematics taskforce [14] made a similar         recommendation.
The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology [15]         recommended that `the Government makes studying maths in some form         compulsory for all students post-16'.
The Wolf Report (2011) [16] recommended that students without a GCSE         A*-C grade in mathematics should be required to continue to study         towards GCSE mathematics.
Wolf cited the Is the UK an Outlier?
research [7] as evidence, commenting that it `examines upper secondary         maths provision, with particular attention to vocational programmes, and         underlines how extraordinary our policy is and has been.
The UK         (including England) is effectively unique in not requiring continued         mathematics and own-language study for all young people engaged in 16-19         pre-tertiary education' (p.83).
In a speech on mathematics and science education at the Royal Society       [17], Michael Gove announced the Government's aspiration that all students       should study mathematics to 18, citing the international evidence from the       Is the UK an Outlier?
report [7].
In the following year, Nick Gibb,       Minster of State for Schools, reiterated this policy shift [18], citing       the evidence from the same report [7] and from the ICCAMS study on       attainment [5] to justify the policy.
Since September 2012 when Elizabeth Truss, who as a backbench MP had       played a key role in publicising the research findings [e.g., 21, 23], was       appointed as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Education and       Childcare, the focus on implementing this policy has intensified.
In five       speeches [19] she has restated and elaborated on the policy, citing the       participation [7] and attainment [11] evidence, and describing Is the         UK an Outlier?
[7] as a `blockbuster report' (17/1/13).
In addition,       the Government has accepted the need for an alternative advanced       qualification, as recommended in Hodgen et al.
's second Nuffield       report, Towards Universal Participation [9].
In her keynote speech       at the launch of that report, Truss reiterated the Government's intention       that all students should study mathematics post-16, agreed the need for an       additional `Maths for All' qualification in advanced mathematics and       acknowledged the risks identified in the report (15/1/2013, see also her       17/1/2013 &amp; 7/3/2013 speeches [19]).
Additionally, in her lecture on       A-Level reforms at the Institute of Education [19], Truss quoted directly       from Hodgen' et al.
's research [9], citing New Zealand's advanced       statistics option.
The Labour Party (in an article by Kevin Brennan,       Shadow Minister for Schools [20]) has also announced its support for the       policy, citing the King's research [7, 10]).
Concurrently, Hodgen was asked by the Department for Education (DfE) to       provide confidential advice on the implementation of the policy and       specifically the supply of mathematics teachers.
As a result, Hodgen,       Tomei and Brown provided a detailed commentary on the DfE's (confidential)       modelling of mathematics teacher supply [24], drawing on the findings of       their previous research [3, 9 and 12].
This commentary reiterates the key       risks threatening successful implementation and the need to implement the       policy over an extended time period.
As a direct result, the DfE are       currently exploring a phased introduction of the policy from 2015.
According to Roger Porkess, lead author of the Vorderman report [14], the       Nuffield research [7] was `critical to the direction of national policy.
The report was widely read and discussed at the time of its publication       and... was cited in two influential reports [13, 14] ... Consequently the       findings came to the attention of government ministers and top officials       in the DfE, resulting [in] a major change of policy' (personal       communication: 26/5/2013).
Tim Oates, Chair of the National Curriculum       Review Expert Panel, has said that the research has `identified a serious       gap in post-16 provision and ... the strength of the evidence has       convinced ministers, subject associations and exam boards ... to address       this serious gap' (personal communication: 17/7/13).
