     Impact summary: During the REF period, employee numbers at Q Chip       increased from 10 to 29 (up 180%), there were 5 patent filings and there       was &#163;7.5M of new investment (75% of the total company investment) over 6       funding rounds [5.1],[5.2].
Access to new miniaturised industrial       bioprocessing equipment and new drug delivery techniques (currently under       trials) were sold to top pharmaceutical companies for improved quality of       life through cancer treatment.
Revenues from four, staged payment,       six-figure value contracts [5.1],[5.2] have risen from &#163;17k in 2010, &#163;297k       in 2011 to &#163;578k in 2012.
Company growth: During the REF period Q Chip has developed a       bio-encapsulation and drug delivery platform that enables companies to       extend product life cycles and deliver complex bio-therapeutics [5.3].
It       currently manufactures drug-loaded microspheres, mainly for pharmaceutical       industries.
Q Chip aims to improve patient compliance and experience, and       improve therapeutic performance through the development of long-acting,       injectable therapeutics using its proprietary platform, Q-SpheraTM [5.3].
This breakthrough microsphere manufacturing and formulation system is       compatible with small molecules, peptides and complex biologicals.
With its commercial client partners, and with guidance from its       scientific advisory board (on which Barrow sits), Q Chip is developing       point-of-care clinical data with three different molecules encapsulated       within drug-eluting, polymeric microspheres.
Q Chip is licensing the       microsphere production and sale via these client partners who, through       their own existing global marketplace presence, are taking the products to       market.
Q Chip has five injectable, encapsulated drug formulations in its       therapeutics pipeline, including Q-Goserelin and Q-Leuprolide for the       treatment of breast and prostate cancer, Q-Insulin for diabetes therapy,       Q-Octreotide for acromegaly, and a new formulation of monoclonal       antibodies for a confidential application [5.1].
All have substantial       existing markets.
For instance, Leuprolide and Octreotide products       achieved annual sales of around $1800M and $1200M in 2010; this is out of       a total global market for injectable therapeutics of $49B.
During 2011, Q       Chip signed four separate multi-year R&amp;D deals with international       pharmaceutical companies [5.1].
Two of these contracts are with those in       the top five global pharmaceutical industries.
Q Chip has developed a       contractual relationship with leading biotechnology/pharmaceutical       company, ARTES Biotechnology GmbH [5.4], for the sustained release of       therapeutic protein interferon alpha 2 (using microspheres) to treat       chronic hepatitis B and C. A third contract is with a UK pharmaceutical       company, a fourth with a mid-sized European pharmaceutical company [5.1]       (contractually, other company names cannot be disclosed).
Further technical development: During the REF period Barrow has       continued to be instrumental in determining the on-going evolution of the       technology developed through the underlying research into Q Chip's       expanding range of products.
He has also supported the company as chair       and co-chair of Q Chip's Scientific Advisory Board.
His involvement has       enabled access to his TSB funded metaFAB facility for HPLC-MS and       femtosecond laser micromachining, and has enabled additional two-way       development contracts between the University (Professor Steve Dunnet, Dr.       Peter Kille) and Q Chip.
The latter contracts developed cell-encapsulation       capabilities for the company, using its core microsphere production       technology.
Since Q Chip's inception, there has been significant process development       and intellectual property protection, through five patents, based on its       collaborative research programme.
Microspheres are produced using a hybrid       of the original IP with new geometries and sub-systems.
This happens at a       greater rate, with less solvent waste, using automated, industry-ready       bespoke equipment, also manufactured by Q Chip.
The Q-Sphera manufacturing       process leads to environmental improvements and is now much `greener' than       current methods because (i) it operates without Class II       halogenated/hazardous solvents (e.g.
dichloromethane/chloroform), (ii) it       uses &gt;80% aqueous solvents (so waste may be recycled to remove Class       III solvents such as DMSO, alcohols), (iii) it is far more efficient than       current methods since there is no need for size-fractionation (no wastage       of intermediary product since there is none), and (iv) the unique, highly       miniaturised, production-on-demand processing equipment (manufactured by Q       Chip) sits on a desk, rather than occupying a building [5.1].
In 2011,       through a &#163;3.6M external investor round, the Q Chip BV European       manufacturing subsidiary was founded as a cGMP sterile pharmaceutical       production facility at Geleen, near Maastricht, with initially three FTE       staff [5.5].
In 2012, the company was awarded a TSB grant of &#163;250k towards       the cost of developing its innovative, scaled-up, sustained-release       pharmaceutical manufacturing process and production equipment [5.1].
Company investment: To provide context to the company investments       during the REF period, it is valuable to know that before the         REF period, the business secured first round funding from the       E-Synergy investor syndicate in 2004 (lead investor John Moulton), with a       corresponding second closing IP-equity swap with Cardiff University, which       now holds about 3% equity.
Since its incorporation in 2003, Q Chip has       attracted investment of &#163;10.4M over 12 funding rounds from angel and       institutional investors, has over 57 shareholders, with 29 FTE staff who       have contributed to employment in Wales [5.6].
During 2011-12, existing shareholders, including Disruptive Capital       Finance and Finance Wales, were joined by venture capitalist Jon Moulton       (founder of Better Capital) [5.7] and industrial entrepreneur Sir Harry       Solomon, in two &#163;5.6M Series C financing rounds led by Limburg Ventures       and Nedermaas Hightech Ventures [5.7],[5.8].
Q Chip uses these funds to       increase production by scaling-up manufacturing development of       encapsulated drugs for prostate cancer and acromegaly.
Finally, in 2011-12 EPSRC undertook a healthcare economic IMPACT Study on       Q Chip, since its origins were based on EPSRC-funded research (IMPACT       summarised in [5.9] and [5.10]).
