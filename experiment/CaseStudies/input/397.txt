     Based on data from the Department for Work and Pensions' Compensation       Recovery Unit which recorded 1,041,150 claims for damages in 2011-12,       there is the potential for a huge number of people to be affected by       issues relating to the amount of compensation offered by the courts.
Many       of these claims will include a future loss (earnings) or expenditure (care       and accommodation) which are unknown at the time of trial or settlement       and must be estimated.
Calculating future losses     The measuring of partial loss of earnings has been described by Robin de       Wilde (QC and Chairman of the Ogden Working Party), as being the "most         intractable of problems"5.1.
A set of discounted life       expectancies and employment risks comprise the basic parameters for the       loss of earnings estimation and are contained within the Actuarial         Tables with Explanatory Notes for Use in Personal Injury and Fatal         Accident Cases.
These tables, first published in 1984, are simply       called `The Ogden Tables' and were formally endorsed by the House of Lords       in 1999, "the actuarial multipliers published in the Ogden Tables         should form the starting point of any settlement and that any departure         would require compelling evidence pointing to another figure" (Wells         v Wells [1999] 1 AC 345).
As a result, these tables are used by       lawyers and the courts as a starting point in all future loss claims in       personal injury in England and Wales and every legal practice, if not       every personal injury lawyer, owns a copy of these tables.
A new calculation     The impact presented here is a result of the introduction of a radically       new methodology and set of estimates for the calculation of loss of future       earnings, based on CBS research.
A key departure from previous practice is       the explicit calculation of the impact of disablement on future earnings.
Previously, compensation paid to disabled claimants in respect of their       future disadvantage on the labour market had been arbitrary in its       determination and insufficient in its value.
The application of the new       approach provides injured claimants, principal beneficiaries of the       research, with a more consistent, accurate and equitable award of damages       for their injury-induced employment-based future financial losses5.2.
Whilst the change was first introduced in The Sixth         Edition of the Ogden Tables (2007) (set out in paragraphs 26 to 44)5.3,       pre-dating the REF impact period, the impact of its application has been       from 2008 onwards, with Wass taking the lead role in the dissemination of       the new methodology and the delivery of training to practitioners.
Convincing the professionals     In statements made during the discussion of the RSS paper in which the       new methodology was explained (published in 2008)5.1, Grahame       Codd (Partner Irwin Mitchell Solicitors) acknowledged that the new       methodology would lead to "a significant improvement in the ability of         legal representatives more accurately to calculate future loss of         earnings", Chris Daykin (Government Actuary) praised researchers for       "the combination of rigorous methodology and practical explanation of         the application of the work" and Robin de Wilde QC concluded that, "There         will be many injured people who will now achieve proper compensation for         their future losses."
The underlying research and publications have       been widely cited in claimants' evidence in support of a claim for loss of       future earnings and also in judgments5.4 &amp; 5.5.
Wass has       also provided expert evidence on behalf of numerous claimants in       furtherance of the correct application of the new methodology.
In 2009, in       view of her contribution to personal injury law, Wass was awarded "Expert       of the Year" in the Eclipse Proclaim Personal Injury Awards, an award       series designed to highlight the excellence of individuals and       organisations across the personal injury sector.
Converting the practitioners     The new methodology has raised compensation which is not in the interests       of those who must pay the damages, normally an insurance company, leading       to considerable debate surrounding its use.
Defendant insurance companies have contested the application of the         new methodology, often arguing for lower compensation payments.
In the         first case to be adjudicated following its publication, Conner v Bradman         [2007], the defendants were successful in their objective.
In response to this decision, in June 2008, Wass published a review of         the judgment, highlighting the judge's misunderstanding of the meaning         of the new disability-adjusted work life expectancies.
While the         judgment has been widely used in subsequent cases by defendant lawyers,         it has been countered by claimant lawyers using Wass' review.
Wass' review is highlighted as an important reference in the current (Seventh)         Edition of the Ogden Tables5.6 in which it is stated in         paragraph 18: "The Working Party notes that there have been a number           of cases in which judges have made significant adjustments to the           suggested discount factors.
In particular the approach of the trial           judges to the calculation of future loss of earnings in Conner v           Bradman [2007] EWHC 2789 (QB) and Clarke v Maltby [2010] EWHC 1201           (QB) has generated some debate ... practitioners performing           such calculations are referred to the helpful article by Dr Wass,           "Discretion in the Application of the New Ogden Six Multipliers: The           Case of Conner v Bradman and Company", published in JPIL Issue 2/2008           ..." 		  At the invitation of the Journal of Personal Injury Law,         Wass gave the keynote presentation at their 2012 annual conference         reviewing judicial decisions following Conner v Bradman; this         presentation was rated "excellent" or "very good" by 75%         of respondents surveyed.
Wass was also invited by this journal to write         a review of cases which used the new methodology (published 2012) and a         question and answer style article dealing with some of the more complex         issues arising out of their application (published 2013).
These articles         were both produced in response to demand from practitioners and related         to questions which they themselves had raised.
[5.7]       Wass' contributions to both the new methodology5.8 (para.
5,7,8,&amp;11) and subsequent debates around its use5.8           (para.
22&amp;23) have been recognised directly by         practitioners.
In an article5.8, barristers Lemmy and Snarr,         make reference to the change in approach taken by the courts since the         introduction of the new method, making the observation that "In           practice, although slowly, the Courts have tended to lean           towards adopting a multiplier/multiplicand approach..."5.8           (para.
15&amp;16)           Consolidating the impact     In recognition of the important intellectual and practical contribution       of the revised methodology and the task ahead in educating lawyers in the       correct use of the new approach, Wass was invited to join the Ogden       Working Party in May 2009 by its Chairman, Robin de Wilde QC (see       Introduction, paragraphs 17 and 18 of the Seventh Edition)5.6.
The Ogden Working Party is an advisory committee of leading lawyers,       accountants and actuaries, responsible for devising and publishing the       Ogden Tables.
They meet monthly prior to publication of a new edition to       consider the implications of new law, to include the updated       life-expectancy estimates, and to develop improved guidance notes.
Wass'       membership of this group provides a vital contribution to the valuation of       damages for loss of future earnings and an important opportunity for her       to act as an intermediary between academics and the application of their       research in the practice of the law5.2 &amp; 5.4.
It       has been predicted by practitioners that Wass' membership of the Party       will lead to "significant revisions and/or guidance ... on the         calculation of future loss of earnings.
"5.8 (43)     Training the practitioners     As predicted by Chris Daykin who said "it will probably take the         courts some time to get to grips with thinking in this way"5.1,       the training of practitioners - principally solicitors, barristers,       insurance claims managers and the judiciary, in the application of the new       methodology is proving to be vital.
Wass has taken a leading role in this,       delivering training through a range of media.
She has presented material       to members of professional associations at conferences including the       Association of Personal Injury Lawyers in 20095.9, and the Personal         Injury Bar Association and Professional Negligence Bar Association       in 2011.
She has also provided training to barristers in Chambers, for       example at Hardwicke Building in 20095.10, and to practitioners       of leading personal injury firms, such as Berrymans Lace Mawer Solicitors       in 2009 and Stewarts Law in 20125.7.
These events have directly       reached an estimated 50-70 practitioners per event.
A wider audience has       been targeted through both the provision of online material dedicated to       providing background and explanation to practitioners (www.victoriawass-laboureconomics.co.uk),       and the delivery of a Webinar for the APIL which has had 145 registrations       to view to date (with 1 to 20 individuals viewing per registration).
The       RSS seminar is also publicly available online and has had over 1,000 views       to date (https://talk.city.ac.uk/ogdenlecture).
