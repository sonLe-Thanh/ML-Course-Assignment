     Impacts: LSE research on gender diversity in the boardroom has       contributed significantly to public debate and policy-making in the UK and       beyond.
a.
Public Debate: There is an on-going public debate about       the potential costs and benefits of introducing gender quotas on company       boards in the UK and in the EU more generally.
Laws mandating such quotas       are already in effect in Norway, and recently have been approved in France       and Spain.
There is currently a push by some country members for an       EU-wide mandatory quota.
The committee of the European Commission is       explicit in its support for quota-based initiatives.
The UK has been an       opponent of such mandatory quotas, and has supported instead a voluntary       approach based on self-regulation.
Research by Adams and Ferreira has significantly influenced the public       debate on gender diversity in the boardroom, and has also influenced the       UK position.
Ferreira was invited to give oral evidence to the Treasury       Select Committee inquiry on Women in the City in the House of Commons.
His       input has influenced the Committee's conclusion not to support a "legal         requirement for boards to contain a particular proportion of women"       (see [5], p. 33).
Adams and Ferreira have been at the centre of the public debate on the       issue of gender diversity.
For example, Ferreira has written an opinion       piece discussing mandatory quotas [6]; gave numerous interviews to the       press; and has been invited to discuss this issue with practitioners and       regulators at important events, such as the International Corporate       Governance Network Conference in Toronto (2010).
Adams has presented her       follow-up paper based on the work with Ferreira &#8212; "Beyond the glass       ceiling: does gender matter?"
[4] &#8212; at our LSE Governance Research       Debates, with Lucy Kellaway (FT) as a discussant.
This paper has       also been cited in the FT and discussed in The Wall Street         Journal blog.
Many policy articles written by leading academics also       cite the evidence in the paper (an example can be found in [7]).
Paper [2]       has also directly influenced the views of some major companies on the       issue of gender diversity on boards.
An example is the recent report by       Credit Suisse on gender diversity and performance [8], which refers to       many of the findings of the paper.
b.
Policy-making: Paper [2] has had an immediate impact on       the British public debate on the issue of women on boards.
It was       published at the end of 2009, soon after the now famous comment by Harriet       Harman that female under-representation on bank boards was partly to blame       for the financial crisis (The "Lehman Sisters" episode).
The publication       of paper [2] received extensive coverage in the British press (FT,       Guardian, The Times, The Economist, etc &#8212; for       evidence see [9] and [10]), as well as in the international press.
The       Report of the Treasury Committee [5] explicitly refers to the evidence in       the paper, as well as the oral evidence given by Ferreira (for evidence       see pages 10, 11 and 14 of [5]).
In particular, when referring to the       desirability of quotas, the report notes that "Dr Ferreira noted that         while quotas can achieve gains in the long run, they are associated with         costs in the short run" ([5], p. 14).
This argument is based on the       theoretical foundations laid down in paper [1], which emphasise both the       benefits and costs of increased monitoring by boards.
The European       Commission has also used the findings in [2] in its recent assessment of       the effectiveness of imposing quotas for gender diversity in the boardroom       (see [11]).
And there is evidence that LSE governance research has had       impact beyond the boardroom.
For example, Paper [2] is cited twice in       responses to a consultation on "Women in the Workplace" by the House of       Commons (see [12]).
The paper is also cited in an OECD report on       entrepreneurship [13].
Wider Implications Effective corporate governance is vital       to long-term firm performance.
LSE research has established that the       imposition of gender quotas in the boardroom is not necessarily the most       effective way to match skills to needs.
By informing the UK government's       approach to this matter, LSE research has contributed to a more nuanced       and context-dependent policy approach to governance and economic       performance in the UK.
The reach of future impacts is likely to be beyond       the UK.
