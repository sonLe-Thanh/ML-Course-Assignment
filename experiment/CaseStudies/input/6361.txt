     (numbers in [ ] refer to section 5)     To ensure the sustainability of satellite services, IADC SDM guidelines       published in 2002       recommended retired GEO spacecraft should be manoeuvred to graveyard       orbits above the       geostationary ring.
The IADC reported to the UN in 2000 that the shape of       these graveyard orbits       did not need to be circular because altitude variations arising from       elliptical orbits would reduce the       collision probability within the graveyard       (http://www.iadc-online.org/Documents/37th_UN_COPUOS_STSC.pdf).
Lewis was able to use his research findings and capabilities of the       DAMAGE simulation tool to       influence the IADC SDM guideline for disposing of GEO spacecraft.
In the       2006 final report on       IADC Action Item (AI) 22.1, GEO Disposal Orbit Eccentricity [5.1],       the analysis by Lewis et al.
in       [3.6] and work by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)       were credited as the key drivers       for updating the IADC SDM guidelines.
Both sets of researchers recommended       the graveyard orbit       should be nearly circular with a maximum eccentricity of 0.005.
This shape       ensures that retired       spacecraft do not return to the geostationary ring and pose a risk to       active spacecraft there.
According to Luciano Anselmo, the former Head of the Italian Space Agency       Delegation to the       IADC [5.2],     "this `interference' situation occurs more frequently than is         typically assumed, and has definite         costs in terms of control centre resources and eventual avoidance         manoeuvres.
The critical role         of the initial eccentricity was therefore confirmed, and the results         obtained by Lewis and         colleagues, due to their level of completeness and detail, offered the         needed guidance to         propose a change of the IADC Mitigation Guidelines."
In the context of work for IADC AI 22.1, some IADC delegations expressed       concern that a       guideline containing a maximum eccentricity requirement was overly       constraining for satellite       operators and proposed manipulating the initial orientation of graveyard       orbits, as an alternative.
By increasing the scope of their investigation for the IADC study and       analysing the evolution of       many possible graveyard orbits using DAMAGE, Lewis et al.
demonstrated an       initial `sun-pointing'       orientation was insufficient for long-term stability of the graveyard       orbits in every case.
Although       contradicting the analyses performed by some other space agencies, Lewis       argued this was due to       a selection bias.
Failure to address this issue correctly could have       allowed some retired spacecraft       to interfere or collide with active spacecraft on the geostationary ring       and pollute the region with       fragmentation debris.
The final report of IADC AI 22.1 [5.1]       adopted Lewis et al.
's recommendation       that orbit orientations should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Thus, a consensus was reached and the IADC SDM guidelines were updated,       reflecting a more       conservative, maximum orbit eccentricity requirement of 0.003.
The updated       guidelines were       published in 2007 and have remained unchanged throughout the REF impact       assessment period       [5.3].
According to Holger Krag, the acting chairperson of IADC       Working Group 4, which       establishes and maintains the IADC SDM Guidelines [5.4],     "The systematic analysis by Lewis of the stability of GEO graveyard         orbit altitudes constituted a         major input to the working group's activities.
The recent version of the         guidelines and the         Support Document, which recalls the theoretical background to the         guidelines, build upon         findings in [3.6] and make use of material         gathered in that work."
Compliance with the IADC SDM guideline ensures that valuable "real       estate" in the geostationary       ring is freed for future use, interference with active satellites is       minimised, and collisions resulting in       the degradation of the GEO environment are prevented.
Holger Krag       explains, "GEO operators         appreciate such guidance and apply them with increasing success rates as         can be concluded from         [ESA's Report on the Classification of Geosynchronous Objects].
Joanne Wheeler, Partner for       Telecoms and Satellite at CMS Cameron McKenna LLP [5.5], agrees:     "Lewis and the team at Southampton have world-leading experience in         this area and the         reputation for this.
A key outcome of their work has been to identify         what measures can be         taken by satellite operators to support the sustainable use of the         geostationary region, given         the challenges presented by space debris risks.
This is critical for the         future growth of the UK         and international space sector, which rely on revenues from         communications satellites in         geostationary orbit."
The IADC SDM guidelines also directly influenced ISO 24113 Space Debris       Mitigation       Requirements and ISO 26872 Disposal of Satellites Operating at       Geosynchronous Altitude.
Dr       Hedley Stokes, Co-convener of the ISO Orbital Debris Coordination Working       Group explains [5.6],     "The University of Southampton's analysis of GEO spacecraft         post-mission disposal orbits has         provided organisations such as IADC and ISO with extremely valuable data         to assist in the         formulation of international space debris mitigation guidelines and         standards."
In addition, Lewis has informed the public debate over the threats from       space debris, through       evidence given to the June 2013 meeting of the House of Commons Science       and Technology       Committee [5.7], and through a September 2011 interview on the BBC       World News Today       programme broadcast on BBC World News (weekly audience estimated to be 74       million:       http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-12957296)       [5.8].
In terms of compliance with this IADC SDM Guideline, there are       consequences for GEO satellite       operators: the fuel used to manoeuvre a satellite to a graveyard orbit       would otherwise be used to       maintain satellite operations on the geostationary ring and generate       revenues for around three       months (roughly one-quarter of the yearly station-keeping budget).
Dean       Hope, Senior Manager of       Flight Dynamics at Inmarsat [5.9] explains:     "Inmarsat and many other commercial operators now recognise the need         to budget sufficient         propellant onboard spacecraft in order to perform orbit raising at end         of life.
This is an         investment that is vital to avoid the possibility of running out of fuel         and drifting through the         GEO arc, thereby increasing the risk of collision and polluting such a         valuable resource with         orbital debris.
Inmarsat appreciates the work of Lewis and colleagues,         which has enabled the         IADC and ISO to provide much-needed, precise guidance to spacecraft         operators on end of life         orbit raising.
Most recently, in April 2013 and after almost 23 years of         operations, Inmarsat 2F1         was successfully re-orbited to an altitude of more than 400 km above GEO         in accordance with         IADC space debris mitigation guidelines and new ISO recommended disposal         standards."
Based on the fuel requirements, re-orbiting to a graveyard orbit in       compliance with the IADC SDM       guideline requires an investment by satellite operators, equivalent to &#163;16       million of earnings per       satellite [5.10].
According to European Space Agency data, 50 of       79 GEO spacecraft reaching the       end of their operational life between 2008 and 2012 were re-orbited in       compliance with the IADC       SDM guideline resulting in an investment of up to &#163;800 million by the       commercial space service       sector.
Based on current re-orbiting rates, an additional 8-18 GEO       spacecraft are expected to be       re-orbited by the end of 2013, increasing the investment to an estimated       &#163;1 billion during the REF       assessment period.
