     Canadian Athletics Coaching Centre (CACC); 2009-ongoing:       The cited research has supported the development and incorporation of       critical ideas concerning the micro-politics of sports coaching into coach       development workshops, clinics, mentorships and conferences for all       track and field coaches in Canada, including high performance pathways.
In       this way, the cited research has contributed to the CACC's strategic plan       to develop coaches who can better recognise and address the complex,       political and highly contextual nature of practice.
The Director of CACC       (source no.1) reports improved coach-athlete relationships and performance       changes as a direct consequence of improved coaching practice.
"My decision to have a strand related to the sociological aspects of         effective coaching behaviour is a direct result of the research         conducted by Dr. Potrac ...In terms of direct impact on practice due to         being exposed to these ideas, I have seen a significant change in how         the track and field coaches based here at the University of Alberta act         and behave as coaches everyday."
Gaelic Athletics Association (GAA); 2009-ongoing:       The cited research has informed the course content at various levels of       the coach education structure (including 1,100 elite level coaching       awards) provided by the GAA &#8212; involving delivery to over 45,000 coaches       since 2008 (source no.2).
The research has been used to underpin GAA coach       educator workshops (source no.3) that consider the ambiguity, pathos, and       politics inherent in the relationship between coach educators, learners,       education courses and coaching practice.
In addition, it has also been       integral to the content of the new Coach 10 Coach Education       Scheme.
This national level coach education entails the delivery of new       courses improving the practical, technical, and social competencies of       coaches operating at all levels of Gaelic sports in Ireland.
The Education       Officer, responsible for the enhancement of the coach education programmes       of the GAA, reports on the positive coach feedback on the issues of social       interaction and the constructive pedagogical relationships between       coaches, athletes and other stakeholders.
"the cited papers have had, and will continue to have, a significant         impact on my work in my role as Education Officer and the learning and         development of our coaches and coach educators.
The ways in which these         papers problematise practice and pedagogical endeavours has helped us         not only enhance the content of our coaching curricula across all         levels, but also some of the ways in which are coach educators seek to         engage with coach learners."
High Performance Sport (HPS) New Zealand; (2011-ongoing):       The cited research has informed the course content provided by HPS New       Zealand in its Coach Accelerator Programme, an elite 3-year multi-sport       coaching scheme.
This on-going intervention seeks to "accelerate the       development of outstanding coaches, capable of coaching athletes to become       World and/or Olympic champions" (HPS, New Zealand, 2011).
The research is       used to strengthen the selected HPS coaches' engagement with, and critical       reflection upon, the micro- political nature of their practice during the       10 compulsory residential learning camps that are a feature of this       programme.
The Coach Accelerator Manager (source no.4), comments,     "I believe that the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of their         research has significantly influenced the continued evolution of the         programme, and many of the coaches have reported that their work has         resonated with them most closely as they continue to coach their         respective athletes and teams at the highest level."
A number of sporting organisations (including the English Golf Union,       Professional Golfers' Association [source no.5] and Hong Kong Rugby Union)       have applied the psychological research findings to coaching practice and       elite development programmes.
Two specific examples are detailed below;     Rugby Football League (RFL): (2012-ongoing)       The RFL "Embed the Pathway" (EtP) programme was established in 2012.
This       inaugural project (based on a major audit conducted by the RFL), is aimed       at the development of players aged 12- 16 years.
In particular, this       programme aims to develop playing standards by improving coach education       (including psychological preparation) and curriculum delivery.
The audit       by the RFL revealed that "effective psychological coping" is one of the       most important factors, along with skill acquisition, which often       determines player transition from academy to professional status.
As such,       the cited research on stress and coping, and numerous other published       outputs by Nicholls and colleagues within professional rugby union, has       been instrumental in the development of the EtP programme.
The Head of       Performance Services at the RFL (source no.
6) emphases the integration of       research into coaching development practice,     "The research by Dr. Nicholls has been implemented into the Embed the         Pathway programme by incorporating psychological skills into training         sessions.
We have incorporated many of his findings by training coaches         in how to teach coping strategies, so that players are deploying coping         strategies whilst on the field in training and matches to help them         perform better when stressed."
The research findings have been disseminated to all senior academy staff       of the 12 professional RFL Super League clubs (source no.7).
The provision       of psychological care to athletes is a factor that will now contribute to       whether clubs retain their academy accreditation.
The National Player       Development Manager will be assessing the ongoing impact of this work.
Rugby Football Union (RFU); (2006-ongoing)       The cited research has informed the coaching of both rugby union players       and coaches.
The research identified effective coping strategies, which       have subsequently been incorporated by an RFU Academy Coach and the       England Saxons Head Coach.
This individual is responsible for the coaching       of kicking across the RFU, from age group international players to England       first team players (source no.
8) and for managing the England Saxons       teams.
"The aforementioned research has impacted my coaching in a number of         ways.
In relation to kicking, since reading the papers in which Nicholls         identified effective coping strategies (Nicholls et al., 2005; 2006,         2009; Nicholls &amp; Polman, 2007), I have incorporated these strategies         into players' pre-kick routines.
For example, I teach players specific         coping strategies and encourage them to use them in their kicking         routines."
This research has also impacted on the professional development and       coaching practices of RFU specialist kicking coaches;     "A part of my job involves mentoring and running coaching sessions to         other specialist kicking coaches within England.
When delivering these         sessions I now include elements of psychology, particular on coping         skills that were identified by Nicholls in his research during the         pre-kicking phase.
This enables other specialist kicking coaches to         include psychology in their coaching too and I know it has been very         successful in the development of players."
Furthermore, a report in the Rugby Football Union's technical journal       revealed how the findings of (Nicholls et al.
2009) were presented to       other coaches and how the club used this information to provide additional       support to their younger players (Source no.9).
