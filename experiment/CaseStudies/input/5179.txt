     The research has changed public and professional awareness as well as       professional policy and practice, by contributing to a better       understanding of deficiencies in care and by developing and testing       methods which have improved delivery of care for sleep problems and       insomnia, which have improved quality of life for patients.
It has had a       direct benefit on primary care (general practitioners, practice nurses and       primary healthcare team) and provision for patients with insomnia and       sleep problems.
Service users, the public and health practitioners have       been involved in the conception, design and dissemination of the work.7                   Initially the work had local impact in Lincolnshire in 2009, where in         a non-randomised control group study we compared development of a new         model of care for insomnia through a Quality Improvement Collaborative         with 16 GP practices, which led to improvements in frontline primary         care practice resulting in greater satisfaction for patients and staff 5         and significant reductions in inappropriate prescribing and costs of         hypnotic drugs.7 These changes in practice are reflected in         case studies published by the National Prescribing Centre to provide         information to GPs.10 The model was used in an educational         programme delivered by the team and involving a further 20 general         practices which led to improvements in care.
The team have led events         for local patient groups (in 2011), for example the Sleep Interest Group         Network in Lincoln, led by a service user representative for the         Resources for Effective Sleep Treatment (REST) study.
From 2011, the research began to have a wider regional impact on the         NHS through well-attended seminars for GPs on management of insomnia         conducted by the team in Lincolnshire (attended by 100 GPs),         Chesterfield (20 GPs), Leicester, (40 GPs) Nottingham (26 GPs) and Derby         (30 GPs and specialists).
There was also UK-wide impact in 2011, when a national event for         doctors, `Sleep and mental health' was run by the Royal Society         of Medicine, together with the Mental Health Foundation, as part of         their Mental Health Awareness week 2011 campaign on sleep, where we         presented our findings to around 100 delegates.
The research team also raised public awareness of insomnia and better         care for insomnia through a national UK television documentary, in which         we were featured and which covered the findings of our research (ITN         `Tonight' screened 17 November 2011 on ITV1).8 This led to a         significant increase in use of the REST website with over 1,000 hits in         the month following the documentary.
The findings have led to national changes in health service policy and         practice, having been incorporated in policy information, educational         resources and guidance to clinicians on hypnotic prescribing developed         by the National Prescribing Centre9-11 and in reviews         conducted by others of the impact of national (National Institute for         Health and Clinical Excellence: NICE) guidance from 2008-10.12        The research has had an international impact through a process of         dissemination and knowledge translation efforts conducted by our team         via workshops, seminars and e-learning (2009 - 2011).
These have changed         clinical behaviour among GPs, practice nurses and practice teams and         changed relationship with patients.
The workshops and seminars last from         one to three hours and include background information, practical         training on assessing sleep problems and providing CBT-I and videos         showing how this can be done in practice.
We have conducted an         evaluation of participants, which has indicated changes in both         awareness and behaviour of clinicians in relation to their management of         patients with insomnia with greater use of psychosocial methods and         reduced use of hypnotic drugs.
Clinicians have moved away from         prescribing drugs to using psychological therapies for insomnia, which         is a cultural shift in clinical behaviour towards shared care and         greater involvement of patients.
The research has been cited by North         American Space Agency (NASA).13        Our team have developed an online e-learning resource to provide         information and education to practitioners.
In the first two years of         operation there were over 4,000 visits from more than 3,000 unique         visitors, who spent on average 4.5 minutes on the site from 90 countries         across all five continents (data from Google analytics).
We have had         very positive feedback from GPs in the UK and internationally including         direct feedback on how they will use the learning in day-to-day         practice.14 This includes the citation and recommendation to         use the e-learning tool by GPs in New Zealand through prescribing         guidance.15        There is also greater public awareness of the work through information         available to the general public through the press and online media         including Wikipedia.16 The paper by (Huedo-Medina et al BMJ         2012:345: e8343) received press and radio coverage in local (BBC Radio         Lincolnshire), national (Times, Telegraph, Daily Mail, Radio5live) and         international (US, Australasia, Asia) media.
