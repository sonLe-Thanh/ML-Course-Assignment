     Evidence of the approach's significant commercial impact can be found in       the adoption of Sentic Computing tools and techniques (as part of bigger       commercial systems) by large international companies who are Stirling       collaborators.
These can be specifically outlined as follows:     (1) HP Labs India for image metadata processing, social network       analysis, user profiling, social communication, and troll filtering.
(2) Microsoft Research Asia for text categorisation, knowledge       base design and sentiment polarity detection.
(3) Zoral Labs for real-time monitoring and extraction of       transactions from any type of unstructured data.
(4) TrustPilot for effective commercial machine learning       technology     Three UK SME companies have also adopted our techniques, namely     (5) Patient Opinion Ltd for the automatic analysis of       unstructured patient opinions.
(6) Abies Ltd for the daily measurement of patients' healthcare       quality of life.
(7) Sitekit Solutions Ltd (a Microsoft Gold Partner company) for       document and web-page auto-categorisation.
In addition, the following international institutes have drawn upon our       Sentic Computing research:     (8) The Brain Sciences Foundation (http://www.brainsciences.org/)       represents a collaboration between MIT, University of Oxford, UCLA at       Irvine, Boston University and University of Paris, which is physically       located in Providence, Rhode Island.
It has used our Sentic computing       research for metaphor detection.
(9) The A*STAR Institute for High Performance Computing is a       research institute (http://www.ihpc.a-star.edu.sg/)       supported by the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research.
It       has employed Sentic Computing to underpin a suite of analytical tools.
The depth and reach of the impact of our research on all the       organisations outlined above can be highlighted by considering the       following products and tools:     (i) Social Media Marketing Tool: this is an       intelligent Sentic Computing based web application that helps companies       efficiently visualise and manage relevant social media information, and       accordingly perform product positioning.
The tool, released in 2012, is       used by Stirling's industrial funding partner, Sitekit Solutions Ltd       in the field of social media monitoring and is offered as additional       functionality to Sitekit customers within Sitekit's       current commercial content management systems.
(ii) Sentic PROMs: this represents a new framework       that exploits the ensemble application of standard PROMs (patient-reported       outcome measures) and Sentic Computing for measuring patients' health       related quality of life in a semi-structured way.
The commercial       development of Sentic PROMs was funded by the UK Technology Strategy Board       funded grant, eCommissioning Community to Support NHS GP Consortia (&#163;858k,       TSB Grant Reference: 12074-75246), with C. Grant (CEO of Sitekit         Solutions Ltd) as Principal Investigator and T. Benson (CEO of Abies         Ltd) as Co-Investigator (and co-author of research reference [2]       above).
Sentic PROMs are now in use by Sitekit Ltd's partner, Abies         Ltd, in place of their standard PROMs as a key clinical assessment       tool.
Stirling played a major role during this development (which required       company visits by Cambria).
The CEO of Abies Ltd has said, "Sentic         PROMs are the next-stage of health-related quality of life measurement,         and are helping substantially expand Abies healthcare business".
(iii) SENTRA: Stirling-pioneered Sentic Computing tools and techniques       have also been adopted into a commercial product by Zoral Labs, a       world-leading company specialising in processing unstructured data.
According to Zoral Labs, most state-of-the-art textual analysis       engines are not granular (i.e.
are not sentence-level based), and       understand neither "context" nor "relationships".
They achieve accuracy       rates below 70%.
However, Zoral Labs' novel scalable Sentic       Computing based sentiment transactions system (SENTRA) (now available on       the market, and which exploits Stirling published research and software)       has been found in their tests to routinely deliver accuracy rates in       excess of 85-90%.
This is equivalent to, or even slightly in excess of,       human performance.
The Business Development Manager at Zoral Labs       said "we are proud to confirm that we have employed the sentic         computing engine developed by Stirling in our commercial product,         SENTRA.
We always want to be updated with state-of-the-art technologies         and sentic computing is surely the next stage of intelligent opinion         mining systems".
(iv) Sentic Album: this is a content, concept, and       context based online personal photo management system.
Sentic Album       modules, released in 2012, are now used by HP Labs India, for       photo management systems.
In addition, The Hourglass of Emotions,       a biologically-inspired and psychologically-motivated model for the       representation and the analysis of human emotions, released in 2012, has       been adopted for several applications by HP Labs India.
This work       was facilitated by Cambria spending six months on an invited research       visit to HP Labs.
A senior researcher at HP Labs has said,       "The sentic framework developed by Stirling has been applied in several         applications designed here at the Labs.
It's been a joy to collaborate         with Erik and Amir and I am looking forward to the next SenticNet         release".
(v) Crowd Validation: this is a process for mining       patient opinions that can be applied to any domain for bridging the gap       between unstructured and structured data.
Contacts through Sitekit Ltd       resulted in Stirling collaborating in parallel with, Patient Opinion         Ltd.
This company is now commercially exploiting such a process,       released in 2010, for automatically categorising new patient opinions and       hence for improving opinion search.
The CEO of Patient Opinion said: "The         growth of Patient Opinion over the past few years was greatly affected         by the adoption of Cambria and Hussain's Crowd Validation technique, in         which we can now easily aggregate patient-related information in a more         meaningful and user-friendly way".
(vi) AffectiveSpace: this is a vector space       representation of AffectNet for reasoning by analogy on affective common       sense knowledge.
The tool is being used by Luminoso (spin-off of Stirling       collaborators, MIT Common Sense Computing) for detecting the polarity of       sentiments in natural language text.
MIT acted as a project partner on the       collaborative project between Stirling and Sitekit Ltd, with       Cambria spending time at MIT, with one outcome being this application.
(vii) IsaCore: this is a semantic network of common       (and common-sense) knowledge for auto-categorization built upon       ConceptNet and Probase.
IsaCore, released in 2012, has been adopted by       Stirling's Chinese collaborator, Microsoft Research Asia, for the       retrieval of semantically related concepts/instances in Probase as it       outperforms previous probabilistic approaches to reasoning by analogy.
This collaboration arose from contacts made through Sitekit Ltd       and the Chinese Academy of Sciences which (jointly with the Royal Society       of Edinburgh) funds a separate research collaboration with Stirling.
Cambria spent several months at Microsoft Research Asia.
The Head       of the Web Search and Data Mining Group said "SenticNet and Sentic         Computing by Cambria and Hussain are ground-breaking technologies that         are helping our team to enrich ProBase and to showcase its usefulness in         many different NLP applications such as topic modelling and opinion         mining".
(viii) IARPA Metaphor Project: The Brain Sciences         Foundation has drawn upon our research in their IARPA (Intelligence       Advanced Research Projects Activity) Metaphor project to enable deeper       understanding of metaphor detection.
The MIT Director of the Brain         Sciences Foundation, involved with IARPA, said, "I am delighted         to confirm that sentic computing techniques pioneered by Erik and Amir         have been widely adopted by the Brain Sciences Foundation and have been         deployed as the core sentiment and opinion mining module of our existing         commercial system.
We believe this has added significant value to our         system, and is continuing to attract the interest of various companies         around the world.
We have employed SenticNet in many different projects         of ours including the IARPA Metaphor Project, for metaphor detection and         understanding".
(ix) SPICE: This is a suite of analytical tools       that has been developed by the A*STAR institute and which draws       heavily on our research.
A principal investigator at A*STAR said,       "We have adopted Sentic Computing to develop a human-in-the-loop         platform with a suite of analytic tools for social media monitoring,         analysis, tracking, as well as provide communication strategy         recommendation that we refer to as SPICE [Strategic Public Information         and Communication Enhancement].
Sentic computing techniques turned out         to be key in enhancing SPICE performance for tasks such as fine-grained         opinion mining and sentiment analysis, influencer network analysis,         insight analysis, and social media based psychographic analysis".
(x) TrustPilot Technology: A developer at TrustPilot       said: "I participated to WWW13 Conference to attend Dr Cambria's         tutorial on Sentic Computing.
We are now using SenticNet as one of the         means to enhance TrustPilot technology.
Sentic Computing is taking us         much further than any other machine learning technique we have applied         before."
Sentic Computing tools are freely available for download and use through       the Sentic API at sentic.net.
The Sentic API is being used by a       continuously growing number of researchers and companies world-wide:       sentic.net was visited 600,000+ times from Oct 2012 to June 2013       (statistics available upon request from iPage.)
