     Southampton research has driven major advances and changes in       international standards for       lymphoma care, greatly improving survival rates and quality of life for       the 14,000 people affected       by the disease in the UK each year, establishing standards of care in the       UK [5.1-5.4] and       internationally [5.5, 5.6], and reducing healthcare costs across       the NHS.
The use of anti-CD20 reagents represents the single biggest improvement       in lymphoma survival       rates over the last two decades.
The Southampton team has played a key       role in defining their       mechanisms of action, and developing new reagents.
Southampton's       integration of lymphoma care       provision with pre-clinical research and experimental medicine has enabled       rapid, robust       development of reagents effective against chemotherapy-resistant or       relapsed lymphomas (e.g.
ofatumumab / Arzerra; licenced by the FDA in 2009), giving patients early       access through trials.
GlaxoSmithKline is currently conducting clinical trials of ofatumumab for       relapsed follicular non-       Hogkin's lymphoma and DLBCL and, in May 2013, announced it was filing for       approval of Arzerra       as a first-line chronic lymphocytic leukaemia therapy on the back of phase       III trials [5.7].
Moreover,       Southampton's trial of a novel ritiximab radioconjugate defined a regimen       yielding improved       survival rates, good quality of life and low complication rates for       patients, whilst also defining the       critical relationship between bulk of lymphoma and antibody       pharmacokinetics.
Combined with       Southampton's elucidation of the key biological mechanism limiting       efficacy of these reagents,       these studies underpin current prospective studies aimed at further       improvements in survival rates       and efficacy against a wider range of lymphoma types.
For Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) between 2005-2009, dissemination of the LY09       and Stanford V       studies' findings resulted in UK practice moving away from more toxic       multi-drug regimens to a       standard ABVD regimen [5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 5.9], improving survival       rates from 70-75% in the 1990s to       85% in 2009 at five years, according to Cancer Research UK.
International       practice has similarly       been influenced, with current guidelines in the USA [5.5] and       Italy [5.6] advocating the same       approach since 2009.
For Burkitt lymphoma (BL), the LY06 and LY10 studies establishing the       CODOX-M/IVAC regimen       as optimal, led to greatly improved survival rates from under 50% to over       70% between the 1970s       and 2013 (Cancer Research UK).
Further, Southampton's establishment of       diagnostic standards to       differentiate BL from DLBCL has had ongoing impacts for those patients       with non-Hodgkin       lymphomas diagnosed every year who previously would have been wrongly       diagnosed and treated       with higher intensity chemotherapy than necessary [5.9].
Following       its publication in 2008, this       standard has been adopted in the best practice guidance by the British       Society of Haematology       since 2010 [5.3] and in overseas lymphoma care guidelines, e.g.
in       the USA [5.5].
As Chief Clinician at Cancer Research UK (2008-) and chair of the       National Cancer Research       Institute's Lymphoma Clinical Studies Group (2005-2011), Johnson has       represented Southampton       research at the highest levels of professional policy-making.
Since 2008       he has been actively       involved in writing and updating guidelines and patient information for       the Lymphoma Association       [5.8] and Macmillan Cancer Support [5.9].
He has influenced       professional practice through his role       on the organising committee of International Conference on Malignant       Lymphoma (2008, 2011,       2013) and at the International Symposium on HL (2010, 2013).
Since 2009 he       has been       contributing editor to The Hematologist, distributed to more than       14,000 international members of       the American Society of Hematology.
This is the world's largest       professional society concerned       with the causes and treatments of blood disorders.
Awareness of Southampton research and improved lymphoma treatments has       been       communicated to the general public through contributions to BBC Radio 4's       Today Programme       (28/9/11, 22/11/11, 21/5/13), BBC2's Newsnight (7/4/09, 17/7/12,       13/6/13), and The Daily         Telegraph (6/12/10, 13/2/12, 15/5/12) among many others [5.10].
These profile-raising efforts have       underscored Southampton's leadership in the field, in part contributing       to, in July 2012, a       philanthropic donation of &#163;10m to further translational cancer immunology,       and linking it to basic       immunology research of the Francis Crick Institute; the recipient of a       matched &#163;10m gift from the       same donor.
