     The first application of the `duplicate method' to the food sector for       estimation of sampling uncertainty was described by Ramsey et al.
in Sussex in 2001 [see Section 3, R5] and this approach has now been       proposed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) for use in international       regulation by the Codex Alimentarius Commission [see Section 5, C4, C5,       C6].
This method was then also applied to measurements made on soil in         situ by Taylor et al.
in 2004[R6], and has also now been       included in guidance [C3] provided by the Environment Agency.
As a direct result of his published and presented research, Ramsey was       approached by a member of the Executive Committee of Eurachem (Alex       Williams, also former Government Chemist of the UK), and was commissioned       by Eurachem to Chair an international committee for the preparation of the       Eurachem Guide [C1], which includes case studies across several       areas of environmental monitoring including soil, water and food.
Eurachem       is a network of organisations across Europe and is an independent body       that provides a focus for analytical chemistry and quality-related issues,       with the objective of establishing a system for the international       traceability of chemical measurements and the promotion of good-quality       practices (http://www.eurachem.org/).
The Eurachem Guide describes how to estimate measurement       uncertainty arising from sampling using Ramsey's duplicate method.
The Guide       has been in use throughout the REF period (2008-13) and is widely quoted       within the soil, water and food sectors.
For example, within the soil       sector, this report has informed and modified the guidance on measurements       of land contamination set out by the UK Environment Agency and the British       Standards Institution (BSI).
The UK Environment Agency's guidance on the       use of rapid measurement tools at contaminated sites [C3] cites the Eurachem         Guide [C1], exemplifying the use of the duplicate method and       uncertainty information for the probabilistic mapping of soil       contamination.
The 2011 revision of the British Standard (BS 10175) on the       investigation of contaminated land [C2] similarly cites the Eurachem         Guide [C1], and includes guidance to the contaminated land community       in the UK on how to estimate uncertainty from sampling using the duplicate       method.
Within the food sector, Ramsey's research has also informed Codex,       an international body organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization       and the World Health Organization (FAO/WHO).
Two Codex committees, at       three annual meetings between 2008-10 [C4, C5, C6], discussed the role of       uncertainty from sampling in the regulation of the international trade of       foods.
Codex recommend `The measurement uncertainty of an analytical         result including uncertainty from sampling may be estimated by a number         of procedures, notably those described by EURACHEM [C6].
In       addition, guidance supporting the implementation of the EU Water Framework       Directive [C7] now cites the Eurachem Guide [C1] and describes the       use of the duplicate method.
