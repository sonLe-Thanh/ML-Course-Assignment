     Commercial Impact:     This work at Keele University attracted the attention of a UK-based       global crop protection company       (Syngenta         Bioline Ltd. part of Syngenta AG) who were interested in the       potential of the technology to enhance environmentally benign Insect Pest       Management (IPM) approaches to crop protection that minimise pesticide use       and have minimal effect on beneficial insects.
In particular they were       interested in using the pheromone to enhance conventional monitoring of       WFT in crops to allow earlier intervention so that growers could apply       pesticides only when thrips are present.
In addition to economic benefits       this approach is of particular importance because of the increasing       resistance to conventional pesticides in this group of crop pests.
Environmentally damaging pesticides have been removed from sale in the EU       and there is increasing consumer demand for produce that is deemed       insecticide-free at the point of consumption.
Syngenta         Bioline Ltd. funded several projects to characterise the active       compound and conduct field trials in protected sweet pepper crops in Spain       to confirm its identity and evaluate approaches for its effective use.
Keele University signed a technology licence for the commercial       exploitation of the pheromone in 2004 and this was followed by an       amendment in 2008.
Syngenta         Bioline Ltd. have included the technology as part of their product       portfolio to UK and International growers as two products; Thriplineams&#174;(product       codes 8061-01 and 8061-02).
The commercial products allow Syngenta         Bioline Ltd. to offer an enhanced monitoring service to growers       giving earlier warning of potential       thrips damage and thus the possibility of earlier, more effective and less       costly intervention.
Syngenta have sublicensed distribution and sales of their products mainly       in overseas markets including in the protected horticultural crop industry       in Spain, France and Morocco.
Here, the products target particularly       aubergine, cucumber, melon, pepper, blueberry, raspberry, strawberry,       tomato, cut flowers and ornamental pot plants.
Sub-licensees include Fargro         Ltd (UK), Biobest Belgium         N.V. (marketed as ThriPher       &#8212; mainland Europe), Anthesis         Ltd (Greece, Turkey), Waldo         and Associates Inc (USA) and Brinkman         International BV (UK, mainland Europe).
Syngenta         Bioline Ltd. invested in research to characterise the WFT pheromone       (2001) and evaluate its commercial potential (2002).
They remain an active       partner in the development of new approaches for the use of the WFT       pheromone and in the identification and commercialisation of pheromones of       other economically important thrips species.
The research group (Hamilton       and Kirk) have carried out academic consultancies as part of DEFRA/FERA       (2011, 2006) funded projects for the Central Science Laboratory (CSL,       York).
As the pheromone is sold as part of a pest control or monitoring       package and because of commercial sensitivity, detailed analysis of the       commercial impact of the pheromone is not available.
However taking into       account variability in the type of crop, severity of thrips infestation       and the equipment used in application of the pheromone, Syngenta         Bioline Ltd. tell us that use of the pheromone can reduce growers       costs by more than 30% through reduction in pesticide usage, reduced       labour costs, more accurate timing of insecticide application and       increased cropping.
Also, in recent trials the pheromone has been shown to       reduce crop damage by 30%.
From a monitoring perspective, use of the       pheromone provides an additional easy to use monitoring tool for growers.
It helps them distinguish between damaging pests and accidental, largely       benign but similar insects such as cereal thrips.
By doing so it reduces       further the tendency to spray with insecticides.
Impact on Practitioners and Services:     The work at Keele has influenced the work of other crop protection       researchers and practitioners.
The initial Keele work has generated new       avenues of research and international links for example research groups in       the USA, Australia, China, Tunisia and Romania have either confirmed our       original results or are working on new aspects.
Independent research       published by the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (DAFWA) has shown that Thripline         ams&#174; gave significant improvement in monitoring of WFT       (3x greater catches of thrips) in top fruit orchards in Western Australia       when compared with alternative monitoring systems including a competitor       product (Lurem-TR).
They have recommended the use of traps baited with Thripline         ams&#174; for improved selectivity of WFT and reduced capture       of beneficial insects.
The Keele Research group is part of an EU International Research Staff       Exchange Scheme (IRSES)       that allows us to disseminate our existing and developing technology to a       global audience of partners who are heavily involved in the provision of       advice to end users on control and monitoring of thrips pests as well as       the development of new crop control measures.
Engagement with these       organisations is leading to the development of new related products and       services.
The IRSES       project has partners in; Plant and Food Research (PFR)       (a New Zealand government-owned institute agency), the Department of       Agriculture and Food Western Australia (DAFWA),       the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU),       Austria (an education and research centre for renewable resources), the       Institut de Recerca I Tecnologia Agroaliment&#224;res (IRTA), Spain       (IRTA is a public company of the Government of Catalonia, linked to the       Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Action (DAR) and Plant Research       International (PRI),       Netherlands (a private not-for-profit research institute, which is part of       Wageningen University and Research Centre).
The research group at Keele has worked with industry (e.g.
Syngenta         Bioline Ltd., Russell IPM Ltd.,       and others) growers groups (e.g.
Horticulture         Development Company, ADAS UK Ltd) and end users (e.g.
Bayer         CropScience Ltd., Belchim         Crop Protection Ltd., BerryWorld         Ltd., Certis Europe B.V.,       Tesco Ltd.) individually and       collectively through the DEFRA         Hort-LINK program to develop enhanced methods and technology for       using the WFT pheromone for enhanced monitoring and to develop control       measures.
