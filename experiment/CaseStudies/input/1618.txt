     Since Hawthorne introduced the concept of the Bioquality index in 1996,       RBS has been used to:            Set forest conservation and management practices in Ghana         (1996-ongoing);       Identify biodiversity-rich forests on Mount Cameroon leading to         sustained protection (1997);       Assess logging impacts in forests in Malaysia leading to the long term         protection of important areas (1998);       Prioritise areas for conservation management in Mexico (2003);       Develop offsetting strategies after construction of a hydroelectric         dam in Sierra Leone (2006 and ongoing);       Influence mining practices in Liberia, Senegal and Guinea (2008-2012);       Support biodiversity management decisions in Trinidad &amp; Tobago         (2012);       Inform plans for the expansion of biofuel production in Brazil         (2012-ongoing).
Examples in Ghana, Liberia and Brazil illustrate the reach and       significance of these impacts.
Ghana       In 1997, the Oxford University Researchers proposed a conservation       strategy for Ghana's forests that was based on the use of Star and       Bioquality indices4.
The strategy aimed to reconcile the demand       for the conservation of biodiversity with the production of timber and       non-timber forest products, and to protect forest reserves.
The Ghanaian       Government responded by introducing the Timber Resources Management Act       (Act 547) and Timber Resources Management Regulations (LI 1649) in 1998.
These legislations underpin current Forest Regulations and the enforced       logging manual is framed in the context of Star categories (e.g.
only       limited numbers of Scarlet Star species are approved for logging whereas       Black Star species are wholly protected).
In 1999 the Ghanaian Government established the High Forest Biodiversity       Conservation Project (HFBCP), which was funded by $9 million from the       World Bank.
The project's objective was to "target the forests in         Ghana that, based on a comprehensive national forest inventory, rank         highest in terms of their global importance for biodiversity"5.
The project aimed to conserve biodiversity in these forests through the       establishment and protection of Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas       (GSBAs).
These regions were identified on the basis of their bioquality       index as defined by the Hawthorne inventory1.
One of the objectives of the Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas       programme was to engage local communities whose livelihood depended on       resources and income from the forest.
To facilitate engagement at       community level, Dr Hawthorne developed his plant identification       methodology into a field guide for non-specialists6.
Development of this user-friendly guide was essential to Ghana's new wave       of community participation in forest management as it enabled local people       to identify forest flora and thus to measure and monitor bioquality       indices.
The guide was developed using evidence-based methods to assess       optimal content and layout for a non-scientific audience.
Drafts were       field-tested with more than 600 potential users across rural Ghana,       including school-children, foresters, and the general public.
The guide is       based on photographs and drawings, and is designed to minimise the need       for reading complicated botanical text.
It includes 326 species,       representing virtually all of Ghana's forest canopy and emergent trees.
The field guide is now used by timber companies to ensure accurate       identification prior to logging.
All of the 2000 copies that were printed       have been distributed and are in circulation in West Africa.
At the end of the World Bank funded programme, a post-project evaluation       report was commissioned by the Global Environmental Facilities/United       Nations Development Program.
This concluded that government organisations       had successfully introduced new policies, and that the establishment of       GSBAs had achieved positive and measurable environmental impacts7.
In discussing the strengths of the programme, the report stated that "the         outputs included the establishment of 29 forest reserves and their         exclusion from timber harvesting on the merit of their high significance         as biodiversity-rich areas" (these 29 form the core of the GSBAs).
It also stated that the environmental impacts of establishing the GSBAs       were "(1) afforestation and rainfall patterns improved, (2) illegal         tree felling and group hunting reduced, (3) seasonal reduction of         volumes of water bodies subsided, and (4) use of poisonous chemicals in         fishing ended".
In 2007, continued forest depletion was estimated to cost 3.5% of Ghana's       annual GDP in loss of economic and environmental assets, prompting the       International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to report a "new         paradigm shift of inclusive forest governance in Ghana".
Conservation of the Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas remains a high       priority and key advances since 2008 include:            Introduction of Dr Hawthorne's field guides, which are now central to         all forest survey work.
The Head of the IUCN Forest Conservation         Programme writes8: "the Star scoring system is now           standard knowledge across the forest profession in Ghana.
Most           foresters are aware of it and understand the importance in terms of           rarity values of Black and Gold species.
They also understand the           importance of protecting these species.
The significance of imbuing           this knowledge amongst the professional cadre in an economically           developing country should not be under-estimated".
In 2009, Ghana was the first country to sign a FLEGT (Forest Law         Enforcement Governance and Trade) Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA)         with the EU9.
As a condition of the VPA, it is stated that no         Black Star species, as defined by Hawthorne1 can be felled;         no timber can come from a GSBA; and regulations and guidelines         recommended by Hawthorne4 must be adhered to.
The first FLEGT         licenses will be issued in late 2013.
Liberia       In 2010, Dr Hawthorne's group was commissioned by the international mining       company, ArcelorMittal (AML), to carry out a Bioquality assessment of the       West Nimba region of Liberia, a mountainous area and global biodiversity       hotspot.
AML used the botanical survey to assess the environmental impact       of proposed iron ore mining activities, and to investigate the scope for       offset or mitigation.
A second assessment in 2011 and recommendations       published in 201310 have guided AML's operations in the area.
The Environmental Adviser for AML reports11 that key activities       in relation to conservation and mitigation have been:            To position all new roads, ore concentrators and waste centres away         from high quality forest, and some existing roads are being re-aligned.
To avoid mining one of the ore bodies because of its co-location in         high-quality forest.
To carry out plantation trials with species that are important to         local communities for medicine, food and construction materials, to         compensate for any loss from forests.
To protect culturally important and rare species at mine sites, and         collect seeds from individual trees to propagate in a local tree         nursery.
To cultivate globally rare and taxonomically distinct species in         nurseries for restoration and re-vegetation when mine sites are closed         (estimated ~2030).
Brazil       Currently, the University of Bras&#237;lia and BP Biofuels are using       Hawthorne's RBS tools to assess biodiversity in the Cerrado       hotspot of Brazil.
Cerrado is attracting international attention       because of its agricultural and biofuels potential, and associated       biodiversity conflicts.
RBS is being used to prioritise areas for       conservation, whilst supporting agricultural and economic development12.
