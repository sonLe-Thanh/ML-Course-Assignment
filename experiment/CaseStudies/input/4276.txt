     Our impact on legislation, designations, policy and practice: QUB       research on maerl beds       and their biodiversity (Sections 2, 3) has had impact since 2008, in the       context of member states'       obligations to protect maerl under the 1992 Habitats Directive.
QUB       research has benefitted the       environment through traceable inclusion in current government policy       papers, legislation and       planning decisions designed to reduce or mitigate anthropogenic impacts on       maerl in Northern       Ireland, Great Britain and Europe.
Northern Ireland: QUB research contributed to setting specific       targets and actions of the Northern       Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)'s Habitat Action Plan (HAP) for maerl       beds, published in       2003 and still in effect.S1 The HAP was designed to       deliver Northern Ireland's contribution to the       UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) for maerl.
It cites our published       research1and describes       (Sections 1.1, 3.2) ongoing QUB projects, some commissioned by the NIEA,       that were later       published2,3and contributed to achieving the HAP targets.
Maerl       beds and Phymatolithon         calcareum are respectively a Northern Ireland Priority Habitat and       Species.
In 2010 our research on the extent and biodiversity of a maerl bed off       the Antrim coast near Red       Bay5 (commissioned through Quercus, our biodiversity       partnership with the NIEA) was used to       designate a new marine SAC for this Annex 1 habitat: "The Red Bay       sandbanks are dominated by       both living maerl and sub-fossil maerl and have been thoroughly mapped and       characterised as       part of this SAC selection assessment".S2This new SAC       with its ancient maerl beds was       welcomed by local media as "Northern Ireland's answer to the great       tropical reefs" and NIEA       spokesman Joe Breen cited our research: "It's the only known site in       Northern Ireland for the       orange northern starfish ...
Some of the surface sub-fossil [maerl has       been] carbon-dated to 650       years".S3     Great Britain: The Habitats Directive was implemented in Great       Britain as The Conservation       (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 (now The Conservation of       Habitats and Species       Regulations 2010).
The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)       designated Phymatolithon         calcareum as a UKBAP Priority Species in 2007 (updated 2010)S4       using criteria including the slow       growth rate.2 From July 2012, under the UK Post-2010         Biodiversity Framework, UKBAP work is       carried out at country level and has moved to BARS (Biodiversity Action       Reporting System).S5       The current Vision Statement for the National Action Plan for maerl beds       notes "Our knowledge of       the maerl resource is continuing to grow although it remains       incomplete.... recent completion of       postgraduate projects at University Marine Biological Station Millport and       Queen's University       Belfast (and subsequent publications in the scientific literature) has       significantly improved       understanding of maerl ecology and sensitivity to impacts..."S5     The Fal and Helford SAC includes the largest maerl bed in England; the       SAC Management       SchemeS6 cites our research.1 In 2009       Falmouth Harbour Commissioners applied to the Marine       Management Organisation (MMO), as the `competent authority' under the       Regulations, to licence       work involving dredging a channel through the maerl beds.
The       Environmental Statement by       Royal Haskoning cites our research.1     An independent maerl recovery report by Jason Hall-Spencer cited our       paper on extinction of       maerl beds4 and considered that there would be potential loss       of maerl habitat.S6 Natural England       advised the MMO that the proposal was likely to have a significant effect       on the designated       features of this protected European site.
Therefore, under the       Regulations, an appropriate       assessment was required to assess the impact of the proposed development       on the conservation       objectives of the site.
The MMO's assessment was that "it cannot be       concluded that there would       be no adverse effect on the integrity of the Fal and Helford SAC" and the       application to dredge       was rejected.S8 The MMO required further research into       mitigation measures, and in 2011       recruited Maggs (QUB) to an Independent Science Advisory Panel (ISAP) of       "five independent       scientists who have significant and recognised expertise in maerl ecology,       experimental design       and the wider impacts on benthic ecology from dredging operations".S9       In 2012 the MMO       approved a licence for a maerl-relocation trial to take place, overseen by       the ISAP, to determine       whether this novel approach can safeguard Falmouth's maerl.
Europe: In 2008, Maggs and Jason Hall-Spencer (University of       Plymouth) were commissioned to       prepare an assessment of maerl for OSPAR on behalf of the Department of       the Environment,       Heritage (now Community) &amp; Local Government, Ireland S10.
The 1998 OSPAR Convention, the       instrument guiding international cooperation on the protection of the       North-East Atlantic marine       environment, lists maerl beds (Agreement 2008-6) as threatened and/or       declining.
Our       assessment, with recommendations for actions and measures that could be       taken to improve the       conservation status of maerl, delivers one of Ireland's commitments under       OSPAR.
