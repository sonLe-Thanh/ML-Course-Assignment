     The research undertaken by the UCL Dental Public Health Group on the       nature of oral health inequalities, the common shared determinants of oral       and general health inequalities, and the design and approach needed to       reduce inequalities has been highly influential in national and       international oral health policy and in changing professional practice.
Our research has helped to shift oral health policy from an isolated       perspective, towards a more integrated public health approach.
Our research on the common risk factor approach and the determinants of       oral health inequalities has been highly influential on national oral         health policy.
As a result of the expertise developed through the       underpinning research described above, Watt has advised on and authored a       number of key national policies over the last decade, including the       national strategy "Choosing Better Oral Health: An Oral Health Plan for       England" which was first published in 2005 [a].
This key document       has continued to inform national oral health policy throughout the current       REF period including the approach adopted by Public Health England, who       state that the research of our group provides a very important       contribution to their overall agenda to improve the nation's health and       address health inequalities [b].
In view of his common risk       approach to oral and systemic health Watt was also a core member of the       Department of Health working group which produced Delivering Better         Oral Health: An evidence-based toolkit for prevention [c].
This document was distributed to all general dental practitioners in       England in April 2009.
Its goal was to re-orientate dentists towards       working in a more preventive manner based upon up-to-date scientific       evidence.
Specific areas of work included diet advice, smoking cessation       support and brief interventions to reduce harmful alcohol intake.
Smoking cessation: Watt chaired the group which wrote the       Department of Health guidance document, Smokefree and Smiling: helping         patients to quit tobacco [d].
This document provided       guidance for primary care dental teams on the contribution that they can       make to smoking cessation.
In the same year he authored a smoking       cessation training resource for dental teams, published by NICE which was       designed to equip members of the dental team with the skills and knowledge       needed to provide effective smoking cessation support [e].
The       training materials were distributed to all undergraduate dental and oral       hygiene and therapy schools in England.
As a result of this work, combined       with the toolkit set out in Delivering Better Oral Health,       dentists do now routinely take a smoking history and are beginning to       offer cessation advice or refer patients for specialist support.
This is       demonstrated by the results of the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey which       report increasing rates of smoking cessation advice delivered by dental       teams [f].
Maternal and child nutrition: In 2008, NICE issued guidance on       Maternal and child nutrition (PH11) which aimed "to improve the         nutrition of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and children in         low-income households."
As a consequence of his earlier work on the       social gradients associated with breast feeding and reference nutrient       indicators in pre-school children, Watt was a member of the Programme       Development Group and the only representative from an oral health       background [g].
Specifically based upon the outcome and process       evaluation of peer support infant feeding interventions, Watt provided       detailed input on the peer support elements of the guidelines and also the       incorporation of oral health in relation to sugars consumption.
The incorporation of our research into oral health policy has since led       to various changes in professional clinical practice amongst primary care       dentists in England.
The current care pathway of the Dental Contract         Reform Programme is seeking to develop "a new contract model and         way of working which shifts the focus of NHS dentistry from treatment         and repair to prevention and oral health" [h].
The more       integrated preventive approach based very much on our model of common risk       factors through the inclusion of advice on diet, tobacco and alcohol.
Present evidence suggests that this model would be acceptable to patients       (for example nearly three-quarters of responding patients of the a pilot       scheme of a new NHS contract "said they had a better understanding of         their oral condition following their recent visit under the new system         and a similar proportion said they had actually changed their oral         hygiene habits as a result of their visit"), and that dentists will       utilise resources more effectively and positively influence future NHS       dental care as a result (only 8% of responding dentists indicated that       they would not align their clinical practice to the new contract) [h].
At a local level, the research outcomes have been highly influential in       supporting the development of local oral health strategies and in       particular the importance of adopting a common risk factor approach in       tackling shared risks for a range of chronic conditions including oral       diseases.
Across the country many Primary Care Trusts and Local       Authorities have used our work in shaping their local strategies.
Good       examples of this include the oral health strategies for Islington,       Cambridgeshire and Norfolk [j, j, k].
Our research has gone on to have an influence on oral health policy and       practice in other parts of the world also.
In Australia, our work       was influential in informing the development and contents of both national       and local policies.
The Principal Population Oral Health Advisor in the       Victoria State Government writes that "Over the last ten years their         work has shaped key population oral health plans, policies and         resources.
These documents include the National Oral Health Plan &#8212;       Health Mouths, Healthy Lives 2004-2013, the Evidence-based oral       health resource, Department of Health Victoria, 2011 and the soon to         be released National Oral Health Promotion Plan" [l].
Attesting to a broader impact on the oral health agenda, the Chair of the       Australian National Oral Health Promotion Plan Committee writes that: "International         leadership in population oral health, especially with regards to         promoting effective policies and interventions to reduce oral health         inequities, is not a feature of the organized dental profession either         in Australia or internationally...
The work that you and your graduates         have been championing is a major support to numerous academic, public         health educators and researchers throughout the world struggling to have         a policy impact in their national health agenda" [m].
