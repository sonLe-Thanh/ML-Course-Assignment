     Hawton's research on paracetamol, and the consequent change in       legislation, has had impacts since 2008 in addition to those which       occurred previously.
Sustained reduction in UK deaths from paracetamol poisoning     The detailed analysis of Hawton et al.
(2013) shows that 68 fewer deaths       occur in the UK each year from paracetamol poisoning than would have       expected to occur without the change in legislation.
This number reflects       the difference between the green and red lines (shown in the Figure,       reproduced from the paper), and equates to a 43% reduction.
There is no       evidence that the effect is tailing off over time: the effect persists         and remains significant during the REF2014 impact period.
The data       show an estimated 136 lives saved in 2008 and 2009 (and a total of 765       fewer deaths since 1998); extrapolation across the whole REF2014 impact       period (January 2008-June 2013) gives a figure of 374 lives saved.
(Section 5, Source 1).
The paper also shows that, even under the most conservative assumptions       (e.g.
that paracetamol deaths would have remained constant after 1998       rather than continuing their upward trend, and adjusting for other       potential confounding factors), the legislation has saved 40 lives per       year (and a predicted 220 during the REF2014 period).
The significance of Hawton's work and the change in legislation is       acknowledged by the MHRA and the Chair of the National Suicide Prevention       Strategy (Section 5, Sources 2 and 3).
Hawton et al.
(2013) also show a sustained effect on registrations for       liver transplantation due to paracetamol toxicity, with an estimated 61%       reduction, corresponding to 44 fewer registrations per year, and 242       during the REF2014 impact period.
However, using the more conservative       analyses mentioned above, the reduction becomes smaller, and no longer       statistically significant.
In a separate study (Simkin et al., Quarterly Journal of Medicine,       2012; 105; 41-51), Hawton's group had shown that at least one retailer was       circumventing the law by offering `multi-buy' deals for paracetamol.
Because the Hawton et al.
(2013) analysis showed clearly the continuing       effectiveness of the legislation, the UK Royal Pharmaceutical Society       highlighted the problem and called for further legislation to outlaw the       practice (Section 5, Source 4).
Changes in legislation in other jurisdictions     Since 2008, three other countries have announced a restriction on       paracetamol pack sizes, based on the findings of Hawton's research:       Denmark, The Netherlands, and Australia (Section 5, Sources 6-9).
These       are in addition to the countries that had done so before 2008.
