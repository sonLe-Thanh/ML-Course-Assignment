     The research undertaken by the group has had a wide range of impacts on       practitioners and communities, in addition to some uptake in policy.
Exploration of community level responses from a wide range of       stakeholders to issues relating to sustainable energy has had effects on       those involved in community action research projects, primarily at       Brampton, Eskdale, Witherslack Estate and Askham in Cumbria.
The action       research approach helped to directly support these specific projects, by       catalysing activities and bringing expertise into the project, which has       helped these communities to make progress through developing action plans       and following through with the implementation of renewable energy       solutions to power remote local communities.
Through the action research,       Thirlmere residents and the Impact Housing Association were provided with       a report which outlined the community voice and provided an independent       view of attitudes.
As a result, additional funding is sought to install a       community biomass boiler: the report informed the work and provided a       mandate to pursue a scheme.
Eskdale had already developed a community       renewables scheme and were seeking ways to take the idea forward, whereas       the work with Askham centred round a community valuation exercise.
Witherslack were seeking ways of understanding the local market for       renewable energy products.
The research undertaken considered woodland       management practice in terms of maximising biodiversity as well as       economic benefits in order to engage and benefit local communities.
The       work had specific impact through informing silviculture decisions by the       estate as an important small business land owner and contributor to the       local economy, supporting conservation of ancient woodland and through       facilitating community engagement with carbon management and renewable       energies.
The research programmes were developed and led by staff, and       data collection for these projects was facilitated through the use of PhD       studentships.
Whilst these specific examples have small localised impacts, the broader       findings are applicable to small rural communities globally.
The specific       impacts have included reducing the barriers to the adoption of woodfuel       heating, increased engagement of individuals within communities with       sustainable energy issues and with other forms of renewable energy.
Further stakeholder engagement has also been gained through dissemination       at the University of Cumbria Climate Change Symposium for local       sustainability stakeholders in 2009, and at the Rural Entrepreneurship       conference in 2011.
In terms of production of biomass, the research has primarily had impacts       via stakeholders involved in woodland and wider land management, both       those influencing policy, affecting practitioners and directly through       practitioner engagement.
Impact on these aspects of sustainable energy has       been created through dissemination in practitioner focussed publications,       such as the Quarterly Journal of Forestry and the Forestry         Journal, and through practitioner conferences.
The effectiveness of       this form of dissemination is shown in the direct take up of these       publications by stakeholders, for example:            Cope, M., Leslie, A. and Weatherall, A.
(2008) The potential         suitability of provenances of Eucalyptus gunnii for short         rotation forestry in the UK.
Quarterly Journal of Forestry 102         (3): 185- 194.
This paper was used as part of the evidence base used by         the Forestry Commission in 2009 to design small scale research trials of         Eucalyptus compared to other species, but also of larger scale         operational trials focussed solely on Eucalyptus.

This paper was cited in the 2nd edition of `The Silviculture of Trees         Used in British Forestry' by Peter Savill, which is the standard text         used by forest managers to help them with species selection choice in         the UK.

This was also presented to Forest         Research, and attended by Tom Nisbet, Programme Manager at Forest         Research and the main author of `Guidance on site selection for brash         removal' (a simple traffic light system for forest managers assessing         site suitability for brash harvesting according to soil type).
(The         research was not cited in the outputs as the peer-reviewed publication         of the work presented was delayed, and it was not ready before the         protocol was published).
The main research outputs themselves have also been noted by       practitioners, as exemplified by the fact that Mason et al.
(2012)       received the Silvicultural Award for Best Paper in 2012 in Forestry, which       is read by UK forest managers, as well as academics.
The award was       presented at an Institute of Chartered Foresters Annual Conference, which       is a key event attended by UK forest managers to gain access to knowledge       for continuing professional development.
The Joule project research was intrinsically stakeholder and community       focussed, as it was participatory in nature, with the Cumbria Farmers       Network as a co-investigator.
Findings of the research were disseminated       at a Cumbria Farmers Network meeting at Newton Rigg, Penrith in September       2011, including a workshop for famers and land owners.
The research led to       a number of farmers exploring biomass options at a later stage, including       the use of hedge trimmings as an energy source by a farmer in Ennerdale,       Cumbria).
The research has also fed into the strategy and action plan for       Cumbria Woodlands, who support the efficient usage of woody biomass for       conservation, environmental and economic gain.
This has also contributed       to further impact through community projects, such as through support       provided by Cumbria Woodlands to the Witherslack estate, catalysing the       move towards woodfuel as a major strand of the business.
The body of research has also underpinned engagement with the Lake       District National Park in managing land for carbon.
This Knowledge       Transfer Partnership (KTP) hosted by the University has drawn on research       insights relating to community engagement for sustainability projects and       novel findings around managing and measuring carbon sequestration to       deliver on project objectives.
The KTP has resulted in a production of a       total of 1000 hard copies of the `Managing Land for Carbon' booklet, which       has been promoted through press releases, National Park launch events,       plus access to materials on the web-site, including facility to download       electronically.
Copies have also been provided to stakeholder       organisations for further dissemination, including Cumbria Woodlands,       Cumbria Wildlife Trust, Nurture Lakeland, Royal Society for the Protection       of Birds, United Utilities, Friends of the Lake District, through the       Carbon Landscapes Forum, and to attendees at the Farming and Forestry Task       Force, including farmers, foresters, businesses within relevant sectors,       private advisors to and representatives of farmers and foresters       (including the National Farmers Union and land agents).
These stakeholder       targeted outputs are therefore now being disseminated by these additional       organisations to land management consultants and landowners beyond the       Park.
Wider uptake is demonstrated through copies sent to or requested by       others, including Natural England Leeds office, Forest Enterprise (the       land-owning element of the Forestry Commission), the Cornwall Development       Company (Rural Development Programme for England funded body of Cornwall       Council) and the Cairngorms National Park Authority.
The wide relevance       and usability of the guide is also shown by its promotion on a range of       stakeholder websites, including the Natural Environment Research Council Planet         Earth site, the Farming Futures blog which aims to help       farmers manage challenges and opportunities relating to climate change,       and the Foundation for Common Land website, who aim to conserve       agricultural systems.
