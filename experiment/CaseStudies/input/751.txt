     a) The development of the new IB Diploma Programme course:     Dr Brocklehurst's analysis of children's exposure to educational       materials on war and terrorism and call for greater attention to their       critical literacy has secured and informed her three-year contribution as       external Curriculum Developer for the International Baccalaureate       Organisation.
In October 2009, Dr Brocklehurst was invited to participate       in a multidisciplinary, international working group, developing a course       for the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme.
The IB very       rarely designs new courses but was responding to growing interest in       current affairs and considering the revision of small specialist courses,       including IR and Peace and Conflict studies, or the design of a new model       to replace these.
In the first session of this process, chaired by the Curriculum Leader       for Humanities, Social Sciences and the Arts (C1), she gave examples of       her research on children's informal consumption of global politics and war       (R4) and the risks of not encouraging their critical capacities given       their exposure to partial accounts of power.
She made the case for       planning a global curriculum that was sensitive to children as political       stakeholders and exposed, but did not privilege, the discipline of IR       (R2).
She was subsequently invited to participate fully in the development       of the syllabus, and assessment models as a paid Curriculum Developer,       including attendance at six, three-day, closed meetings over three years.
Dr Brocklehurst framed `global politics' as a useful overarching framework       and emphasised the need for sensitivity in the way in which key concepts       (such as power or cooperation) were positioned and weighted throughout the       drafting process.
A testimonial on this contribution (C1) states that Dr       Brocklehurst was `instrumental in helping shape the structure of the IB         course, supporting the location of `power' and `IR' as compulsory core         elements, within a context of critical thinking skills'.
The current       IB Curriculum manager (C2) has stated that:     `Dr. Brocklehurst's expertise, academic background and enthusiasm have         meant that she has been able to make a really significant contribution         to the development of the new IB Diploma Programme global politics         course &#8212; a course which will ultimately be offered to schools in over         140 countries around the world.
She has been able to advise us on the         importance of including elements of IR such as peace and cooperation in         the course rather than it focusing primarily on conflict, and has         continually emphasised the importance of developing a broad balanced         course which develops student's critical thinking'     A fellow curriculum designer (C3) and teacher of International Relations       in IB schools stated that she had an `invaluable role in, and         contribution to, the curriculum development phase' and that `her         teaching and research interests in the situating of war/IR has been         evident throughout her participation in this project'.
Dr       Brocklehurst was the only consultant external to the IB, and the only       academic in International Relations during the drafting process.
She is       now an External Examiner to the IB until 2015.
The finalised pilot was       first taught in 17 schools worldwide from 2012 and from 2015 the Global       Politics Diploma will be available in 3294 schools worldwide and       eventually taken by an estimated 20,000 children each year.
b) The development of best practice guidance and contribution to           Continuing Professional Development on the teaching of sensitive           issues in global politics:     In her research on children's books Brocklehurst has made clear how the       absence of oversight or critical reflection in education sectors is       symptomatic of the problematic relationship between children and politics       and with International Relations in particular (R2).
Her research has       greater urgency however in recognising and addressing how sensitive topics       such as terrorism can be better resourced for children both inside and       outside the formal curriculum.
The book archive was critical in allowing UK stakeholders, to see the       extent of this challenge.
In a workshop, Non-fiction?
Children's book,         military literacy and the war on terror, held in Swansea in July       2011, she effectively challenged the conventional wisdom that educational       organisations provide sufficient protection for children in this sensitive       area.
The workshop provided an opportunity to widen the reach of the       research to Subject Associations &#8212; including RE, Citizenship and History       and to teachers and librarians.
At this event an author of the only review       of textbooks in a cognate area &#8212; a government report entitled, Materials         used to Teach about World Religions in Schools in England       (2010) DCSF-RR197, observed that they had been powerless to expose texts       identified as problematic and that their own audit had overlooked books in       the archive which covered fundamentalism and extremism.
Prior to the       workshop the invited UK Publishers Association also shared their concern       over less robust `texts'.
Stakeholders agreed to raise awareness of the       harms associated with poor quality material and address it through       training or critical engagement.
National organisations such as the School       Library Service and History Association committed themselves to increasing       reviews of non-fiction and observed that they needed such partnerships to       shed light on how they were contributing to children's vulnerability to       partial accounts or insensitive offensive narratives and images.
The       School Library Association Reviews editor (C4) said that the workshop was:     `brilliantly informative, raised crucial issues, offered practical         developmental possibilities and it was all so well prepared and         resourced....Your subject is so important and the potential for creating         informed and balanced teaching and educational awareness is a very         welcome aspect of research and exploration.....Teachers / librarians /         educationalists are indeed very uncertain of how to approach such         sensitive and politically charged issues and need, really do need, the         confidence of informed advice as well as information on recommended         resources'.
Brocklehurst has stimulated debate within organisations and created       resources to underpin her partnership with them.
She provided a Continuing       Professional Development (CPD) session on `Military literacy and the       challenges of teaching contemporary conflict' at the Historical       Association annual conference in 2012.
The CPD manager (C5) subsequently       solicited her future participation and resources, noting that her `work on       terrorism texts has a ready audience and will provoke both thought and       action in the classroom'.
In response Brocklehurst circulated documents,       authored by her, on best practice in teaching and writing on sensitive       topics in global politics &#8212; including the military recruitment of children       (R3).
These provided resources, guidelines and reflective exercises for       children and teachers and guidelines for authors and commissioning editors       (pre-production).
It was anticipated that widespread adoption of guidance       in these documents could in time pave the way for creating a jointly       authored `code of conduct', endorsed by a number of professional and       subject associations.
Brocklehurst's claim that these broader relationships need to be engaged       with, and bridges built between Politics' professional bodies and       educational providers, was endorsed by the National Union of Students in       Wales.
She was identified as a key thinker in the empowerment of children       and was one of four consultants recently invited in June 2013 to       contribute to their formulation of strategy.
The President (C6) stated: `Helen         led a session at one of our `Imagine Education' Commissions; the content         was absolutely thought provoking and has influenced our thinking and         focus of work.'
The book archive was updated up to 2013, and stored       as a University Callaghan research centre resource, allowing teachers and       educationalists to explore these texts for themselves.
This forms the       continuing basis for the research to engage multiple stakeholders across       the UK to contribute to a better formulation of global politics for       children and young people with consequent societal impacts and benefits.
