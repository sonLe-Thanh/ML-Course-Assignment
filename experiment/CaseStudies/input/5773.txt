     The research directly addressed the issue of over-prescribing for       depression in primary care in       Scotland by observing prospectively the activity of over 30 GPs assessing       and treating almost 1,000       patients in four general practices in the Grampian region.
The work was       peer-reviewed and       published in the British Journal of General Practice [1].
The study was       reported widely in the media,       and appeared on BBC and Scottish Television News web-sites [a].
The       research team lead       appeared on the Radio 4 "Today" programme [a].
The findings were also noted by the Scottish Parliament Public Audit       Committee and described in its       3rd report 2010 "Overview of Mental Health Services" (SP Paper       433; PAU/S3/10/R3) [b].
The       Committee stated: "The Committee is concerned that the HEAT target on         reducing the increase in         antidepressant prescribing may be too simplistic.
It notes the         University of Aberdeen study results,         which identified that, in around 98 per cent of cases, people on a         prescription are receiving the         medication appropriately.
The Committee feels that no explanation has         been given as to how this         HEAT target can therefore be appropriately achieved and recommends that         the Scottish         Government reviews the target, in light of the results of this study."
The findings of the study were acknowledged in the Scottish Parliament in       a written answer to a       question from an MSP (Member of the Scottish Parliament) (S3W-34428, 25th       June, 2010) [c]:     "Since 2008 there has been significant work to support appropriate         prescribing in Scotland through         the work of the mental health collaborative which is in place to work         with NHS boards in supporting         delivery of NHS mental health targets.
Research work undertaken by the         University of Aberdeen,         and published in the British Journal of General Practice, September         2009, would suggest that in 99%         of cases, the prescribing is in accordance with clinical guidelines."

The target to reduce antidepressant prescribing was withdrawn shortly       afterwards, thus changing       Scottish Healthcare policy for the benefit of patients, and reversing a       Scottish National Party       manifesto commitment made in 2007.
This work therefore directly resulted       in a major change to       health policy in Scotland, and has further implications for antidepressant       prescribing practice on a       world-wide basis.
The concurrent work on the use of rating scales to determine severity of       depressive disorder was       also published in the British Journal of General Practice [2,3], showing       that the rating scales       produced results inconsistent with one another, and inconsistent with       "gold standard" assessment of       depressive disorder severity, thus demonstrating their lack of validity.
The results were       controversial, given that the rating scales had already been embedded in       the performance       management and payment systems for all of UK general practice, and were in       daily use.
The       research was the subject of two editorials in the British Journal of       General Practice [d,e].
The       findings were replicated and cited by research groups in Sweden [f], the       Netherlands [g], Australia       [h], and the US [i].
The Aberdeen University publications were cited in subsequent iterations       of the Quality and       Outcomes framework for UK General Practice (2009/10; 2012-13) [j], forming       part of the evidence       base used by NICE to "retire" those measures that the Aberdeen researchers       had described as       "invalid" (2013/2014 [k]).
This will have a positive impact on the daily       assessment of depressed       patients in primary care throughout the UK.
The research findings have       since been discussed in       commentaries on the development of forthcoming US (DSM-V) [i] and European       (ICD-11) [l] disease       classifications systems, and are likely to contribute to global       definitions of depressive disorder.
Claimed impact as defined by REF guidance: outcome for patients has         improved; healthcare         guidelines have changed; decisions by health services have been informed         by research;         professional guidelines have been influenced by research and         practitioners have used these         research findings in conducting their work.
