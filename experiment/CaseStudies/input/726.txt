     Low breastfeeding rates are an intransigent public health problem with       multiple causes (R6).
Our work identifying links between medicines in       labour and reduced chances of breastfeeding has focused on one aspect of       this complex aetiology - iatrogenic harm.
Public and professional awareness was raised by: 1) The media,       including front page of The Times 1.9.2009: and "Concern over       painkillers led the NHS to revise its guidelines on epidurals", BBC, Daily         Mail, Western Mail, Reuters, UNICEF baby friendly website, BMJ, NCT       journal; 2) 7 clinical guidelines and 7 books for clinicians; 3) 56       citations by 31.7.13 in midwifery, obstetrics, paediatrics, anaesthetics,       public health, chiropractice, pharmacy publications.
The standard       textbooks (R4,5) ensure that our research recommendations reach most       midwifery students working in English, Farsi and Indonesian: 40 of 65 UK       midwifery courses have adopted our textbook (R4).
The &gt;5,800 and       &gt;3,800 copies of the English 1st &amp; 2nd       editions sold reach most of the UK's 35,000 midwives and many in       Australasia, USA, Ireland and Malta (July 2013).
Accordingly, when labour       has been extensively medicated, practitioners are now aware of the need       for additional support and time to allow the body to eliminate medicines.
The impact on education is evidenced by suggestions that the book makes       "care safer for mothers and babies" (C9).
Citing our work in R1, West       &amp; Marasco (2009 p.59 C2) advise: "epidurals (...) can temporarily         diminish infants' nursing behaviours (...); it may take a little more         work to get breastfeeding started".
The position is summarised by       the National Childbirth Trust (NCT): "NCT has been concerned         about use of opioids during labour and their impact on women's         experiences of establishing breastfeeding, breastfeeding initiation and         continuation for many years.
We consider the work in Swansea, which         centred on the impact of drugs in labour on breastfeeding, to be really         important.
The recommendation to minimise doses of epidural fentanyl was         adopted by NICE in the Intrapartum Care guidelines, and the literature         indicates that doses are now lower.
Breastfeeding rates have improved,         for a number of reasons.
Lower doses of opioids may be contributing to         women having more positive experiences of feeding in the very earliest         days, and to this improvement in rates.
The associations between         medicines and breastfeeding rates, together with knowledge of the         importance of breastfeeding, persuaded the Cochrane group to include         infant feeding as one of the core outcomes for future trials in         childbirth.
NICE recommendations were based on Swansea work."
(C8)     Incorporation into Guidelines Citing our work on the association       between the dose of fentanyl and breastfeeding, 7 guidelines (C1-7)       recommend restrictions on epidural fentanyl doses.
Our recommendations       (R1) against high doses and the need for further research were adopted by       NICE: the NICE Evidence statement reports the association between the dose       of fentanyl and the success of breastfeeding, and indicates "a need for         studies (...): to assess the impact of low-dose epidurals with opioids         (fentanyl) on neonatal outcomes, including resuscitation and         breastfeeding."
(NCC 2007 p.123 C1).
Recommendations (p.14 C1)       include informing women that "opioids may interfere with breastfeeding".
The US Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Protocol (2008 p.129 C2), citing       our work (R1), states: "consideration should be given to the type and         dose of analgesia.
Higher doses of intrapartum fentanyl may impede         establishment of breastfeeding."
Also citing R1 and a small trial,       Reynolds recommends: "When prolonged epidural analgesia using local         anaesthetic-opioid combination is extended for emergency section, it is         unwise, for the baby's sake, to give further opioid epidurally or         systemically until after delivery" (Best Pract Res Clin Obstet       Gynaecol.
2010;24(3):289-302 p.298).
Also, if epidurals are       contraindicated, the more rapidly metabolised remifentanil is now       selected, as it is less likely to enter the foetus and depress neonates'       behavioural responses.
Practice changes NICE now recommends initiation of epidural       analgesia with bolus doses of 10- 30mcg fentanyl (C1 p.137).
Previously,       analgesia was initiated with bolus doses of 100mcg (Anesth Analg.
2000;       91(2):374-8): in 2003 a bolus of 50mcg was considered `ultra low dose' (J       Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs.;32(3):322-31).
In local hospitals, epidural       fentanyl total doses now range 40-240 mcgs.
In the COMET trial, in 2000,       155/757, 20.5% parturients received &gt;200mcgs epidural fentanyl and       41/757, 5.4% received &gt;300mcgs (Anaesthesia.
2010; 65(2):145-53).
Changes in Breastfeeding Rates Publication of our work (R1 in       2005) and guidelines citing it (2007) were followed by improved       breastfeeding initiation in England between 2005 &amp; 2010 (Figures from       Dept.
of Health Statistics).
Breastfeeding             Initiation           % (95% CI)           OR increase each             year from 2005           Breastfeeding at             6-8 weeks           % (95% CI)                             2005/06           66.2 (66.1-66.3)                      2008/09 Q1           48.7 (48.4-49.0)                             2010/11           73.7 (73.6-73.8)           1.076 (1.074-1.077)           2009/10 Q1           50.3 (50.0-50.5)                             2011/12           74.0 (73.9-74.1)           1.066 (1.065-1.068)           2011/12 Q1           49.1 (48.9-49.4)                          The deceleration in improvement from &gt;1% to &lt;0.5% pa after 2010     intimates that the impetus for improvement was discrete and     sustainable.
Similarly, 6-8 week data (only available from 2008/9) indicate     improvement to 2009/10, but not thereafter.
The quinquennial Infant Feeding     Surveys from 1980 indicate that breastfeeding rates deteriorated when     epidural fentanyl and routine uterotonics were introduced in the 1980s, and     recovery was co-temporaneous with our work.
Alternative explanations, and commonly held beliefs regarding strategies       to improve breastfeeding rates, are not supported by evidence from       industrialised countries.
1) Well-conducted trials suggest that       psychosocial interventions and support do not improve rates (BMJ.
2009;338; 392-5 &amp; 338; 388-92).
2) Systematic reviews indicate that       lay support confers no advantages in the UK (BMJ 2012; 344:d8287), and       benefits of any support are minimal or non-significant in countries with       low or intermediate initiation rates, particularly when only studies with       low risk of bias are considered (Cochrane 2007 Jan 24(1):CD001141; 2012       May 16(5) CD001141).
3) Lay support is difficult to obtain, due to limited       supply of altruistic mothers and inadequate administrative support (Soc       Sci Med.
70(5):769-778).
4) Delivery in `baby friendly' hospitals does not       improve breastfeeding rates at 1 month (Int J Epidemiol.;35(5):1178-86).
Without evidence for the efficacy or effectiveness of other feasible       strategies to improve breastfeeding, awareness of the impact of drugs in       labour (via NICE and other guidelines, textbooks, press coverage,       UNICEF and NCT), and subsequent decreases in fentanyl doses, are       important.
Health gains Before 2005, high fentanyl doses affected at least       3-4% of the 750,000 infants born each year in the UK: in our hospital, 4%       primiparae received over the current maximum dose of epidural fentanyl.
Practice and dose changes related to our work were important in the 7.5%       increase in breastfeeding initiation 2005-2010 and the subsequent       reduction in admissions for diarrhoea and gastroenteritis (A09) (Hospital       episode statistics 2012).
A 2-4% increase in breastfeeding rates improves         health by reducing UK infant hospital admissions for diarrhoea and       lower respiratory tract infections by 2% and 1%.
An extra 2-4% UK women       breastfeeding for 3 months decreases childhood obesity by 1% (R2);       underlying mechanisms (Brown et al., Paediatric Obesity 7; 382-90)       and preventive strategies (Brown et al.
2011, JAN 67; 1993-2003)       are incorporated in several guidelines (NCT, UNICEF, US Surgeon General).
Breastfeeding also has measurable impact on: necrotising enterocolitis,       sudden infant death, asthma, leukaemia and cardiovascular disease in       infants, breast &amp; ovarian cancer in mothers, and diabetes in infants       &amp; mothers (UNICEF UK, 2012).
Cost savings Improved infant and maternal health translate into       cost savings.
Increase in any breastfeeding at 6 months by 2-4% saves       &gt;&#163;1m pa from reduced gastrointestinal, respiratory and ear infections.
Reducing the number of women who never breastfeed by 2-4% saves &gt;&#163;3m in       breast cancer expenditure over the lifetime of the cohort, exclusive of       quality adjusted life years.
Where 1% of those who "never breastfeed"       initiate breastfeeding, the associated small increase in infants' average       IQ results in a gain of over &#163;278 million in economic productivity over       the lifetime of each annual birth cohort (UNICEF UK, 2012).
In summary, identification of the association between medicines       administered in labour and breastfeeding raised public and         professional awareness of a health risk and engendered practice changes,         including lower doses of opioid analgesics.
Subsequently,       breastfeeding initiation rates increased 2005-2010 (66.2-73.7%).
This       represents a significant avoidance of harm.
