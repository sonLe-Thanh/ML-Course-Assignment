     Hoekstra's autism research is making an impact on several levels:            clinical practice (through the development of a rapid quantitative         instrument of autistic traits)       by raising awareness, both in the UK and in the Netherlands (through a         book, conference talks, articles and interviews in the popular media         such as the New Scientist and the BBC)       by raising mental health and autism awareness in Ethiopia (Hoekstra's         mental health research project).
Clinical impact and impact on families affected by autism     The Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) is an instrument to assess autistic       traits, both in the research context and in the clinic.
According to the       Dutch national psychiatry consortium for autism spectrum disorders in       adults [5.1], the Dutch translation of the AQ (validated by Hoekstra et       al., [3.2]) is the most commonly used instrument in clinical practice to       aid autism spectrum diagnoses in adults in the Netherlands.
The British National Collaborative Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH)       developed the UK NICE guidelines for autism spectrum disorders in adults       simultaneously and in collaboration with the team devising the       multidisciplinary guidelines for the Netherlands.
The Dutch guidelines       recommend using Hoekstra's Dutch translation of the AQ as a case       identification instrument [5.2].
Apart from the paper and pencil version,       the Dutch AQ is now also included as a digital test application and even       though the digital application only started recently, it has been used 34       times by 22 different institutions over one month (July 2013) [5.3].
The international impact of Hoekstra's research is further evidenced       through her development, in collaboration with Ethiopian psychiatrists and       mental health experts, of mental health education materials for the HEAT       programme in Ethiopia [5.4].
A first cohort of 1,367 health extension       workers started studying these materials in 2010/2011, a further 20,000       students are expected to enrol in the programme.
The first 204 students       graduated in 2012; Hoekstra and colleagues evaluated the mental health       study sessions of HEAT in this first cohort of graduated students, and       compared their knowledge, attitudes and skills with health workers who had       not yet received training.
The first findings of the study with       HEAT-trained health workers showed less stigmatising attitudes and       incorrect beliefs regarding the causes and treatment of autism.
Based on       the findings from this study, the research team produced additional       training materials comprising five videos showing how to conduct a       clinical interview with parents of a child with intellectual disability or       autism, and a mental health pocket guide with dedicated sections on child       mental health including autism and intellectual disability.
The Ethiopian       Federal Ministry of Health has formally approved these study materials and       intends to distribute the pocket guide to all 39,000 health extension       workers in the country.
All study sessions and training materials are free       and openly available online, with the potential for re-use in other       under-resourced countries.
Hoekstra is included in the World Health       Organisation's global autism network.
In 2013 she presented the first       project findings at an autism consultation organised by the World Health       Organisation and Autism Speaks [5.5].
Public engagement     Research advances made by Hoekstra informed her book, The Autism         Spectrum in the 21st Century: Exploring Psychology, Biology and Practice,       co-authored with Drs Ilona Roth, Chris Barson, Greg Pasco and Terry       Whatson [5.6].
The book is seen as `a must-have manual' of       `extraordinarily good value' [5.7].
Parents of children with autism have       commented on how helpful they have found the book: (i) `every parent       should be given this book upon receiving such a devastating diagnosis, as       although my son was diagnosed more than a year ago, and despite reading       much on the internet, I have learnt so much more from the book.
...' (ii)       `I find it [a] very good summary ... and [the book] actually helped me to       adjust the course of actions in ... helping my son.'
Hoekstra's research also features on The Open University's OpenLearn       website, for which she and colleagues Ilona Roth and Mark Hirst produced       the following materials:            Autism quiz: http://www.open2.net/autism/autism_quiz.html        What is autism?

Altogether, these autism-related educational pages have attracted over       62,000 unique visitors in the period between April 2011 and July 2013.
The       `Unzip your genes' page has attracted more than 37,800 unique visitors       since April 2011; and more than 20,000 people have completed the Unzip       your genes quiz.
The `Unzip your genes' page includes not only a quiz, but       also two animated videos explaining 'what is meant by genetic difference'       and 'what are twin studies'.
The two animations have been viewed around       26,000 and 35,500 times between April 2011 and July 2013.
The videos can       be found on the 'unzip your genes' page, direct links to the YouTube       videos are: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5yzRRvROpE         and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTYCv1ObZrI.
Hoekstra frequently gives talks to a wider audience [5.8] and her research       and her comments on autism research findings are covered in the popular       media [5.9].
