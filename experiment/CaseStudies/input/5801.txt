     Hurst and his collaborators have established a global reputation for       identifying the presence and       significance of sand injectites in petroleum systems.
Direct practical       implications of the models       include:     a) improved pre-drill prediction of sandstone distribution that leads to       more successful       exploration;     b) more accurate and appropriate description and modelling of reservoirs       in which sandstone       intrusions occur;     c) targeting of "sand injectite exploration prospects" - intrusive         traps - by the direct application       of the scientific basis from their occurrence developed by SIRG;     d) definition of criteria for identifying sand injectites in boreholes       (Duranti and Hurst 2004) now in       widespread use in the oil industry and academia;     e) a programme of workshops and courses with industry partners to ensure       transfer of science       and technology into their environment.
New exploration and field-development drilling targets have been       identified that led to the       generation of completely new exploration plays, the discovery of new       oilfields and improved       recovery from existing oilfields.
Currently several oil company sponsors,       including Marathon,       Premier Oil, Total and Statoil, amongst others, use SIRG's concepts and       data routinely in their       exploration programmes.
Four case studies from these named companies offer       examples of this.
Marathon Oil participated in Phase 1 of the Sand Injectites research       programme.
As a result of the       research findings concerned with intrusive traps Marathon discovered       Volund field in 2003, with an       expected gross value &gt;$6Bn (7).
Following discovery SIRG worked closely       with the Volund field       development team, supporting validation of quantitative models of oil       production and advising on       appropriate geological procedure for drilling (7).
The Chief Geoscientist       at Marathon Oil has       confirmed that SIRG's "analogue data were a critical component of the         pre-exploration de-risking of         Volund and had a direct impact on the eventual approval to sanction         funding an exploration well         given by Marathon's Head Office, Houston" (2).
This exploration success prompted new sponsor involvement with an       injectite exploration focus.
Encore (now Premier Oil) have used the results of research to confirm the       production potential of       the greater Catcher field in 2010, and have commented that "EnCore's         discovery of Catcher,         Varadero and Burgman fields in Block 28/9 was the UK exploration success         story of 2010.......         there is believed to be 400mmbo [million barrels of oil equivalent]         in place" in which "Prof Hurst's         research has had immediate effect on our evaluation of the Greater         Catcher area and we plan to         develop our working relationship with him.
It appears that Sand         Injectite research is a rather         special feature of UK geological research with high relevance to the oil         industry and well deserving         of international recognition" (3).
Statoil have financially supported Sand Injectites research from the       outset in the late 1990's.
As a       result of research findings, Statoil were able to identify the widespread       presence of injected sands       within their field development areas, and were able to re-frame and       optimise their field       development strategies accordingly.
The generic benefits of SIRG's       research to Statoil have been       summarised by a Senior Research Scientist (Exploration) for Statoil, in a       communication to the       University of Aberdeen: "Statoil recognised the lack of research on the         enigmatic but often       regionally-developed features known as sand injectites.
By investing in         the Sand Injectites         consortia at the University of Aberdeen Statoil has increased its         understanding of when, where and         how sand injectites form thus enhancing our understanding of their role         in basin evolution.
Equally         important has been the generation of the first ever large outcrop         database of sand injectites that         helps all aspects of our subsurface evaluation, including seismic         interpretation, and reservoir         characterisation.
In my daily work I use pictures and ideas from these         outcrops to educate and         illustrate how sand injectites are formed and expressed in the         subsurface" (1).
Most recently       Statoil's development of the Mariner field in the UKCS has been approved,       with a field       development strategy based around exploitation of reserves within sand       injectites, which is a direct       consequence of collaboration with SIRG.
The field is believed to hold       reserves of approximately       300 million barrels with a commercial value of some $8 billion.
As a       result of this field development       700 new jobs will be created (6).
Statoil have confirmed that the SIRG "group         has made tangible         contributions to Mariner's commerciality and allowed an appreciation of         the main uncertainties and         how to best geologically model them" (5).
Whilst production from the       field will not commence until       2017, the impact generated from government approval of development plans       is considerable in       guaranteeing future economic returns.
In the context of oilfield development SIRG research has played an       important role supporting       operators with well placement and optimising hydrocarbon recovery.
In       2002, prior to development       of Girasol (offshore Angola, 1.55 MMB OOIP), Total Research in Pau invited       SIRG to examine       core data from Girasol and other offshore fields/discoveries that "confirmed         the presence of         significant sub vertical sandstone intrusions ...... their         identification gave the possibility of much         higher than expected vertical permeability between the main sandstone         reservoirs and consequent         improved aquifer support.
This interpretation proved to be correct and         participated to the         understanding of the oil production and water-handling characteristics         of Girasol" (4).
SIRG's transfer of research results to the oil industry is a prioritised       activity and has an increasingly       global impact.
Company-specific workshops and field courses are also       common activities (in 2013       4 field trips are organised for the benefit of Premier Oil, Wintershall,       Cairn Energy, Maersk, Det       Norske, Statoil and Tullow Oil).
Since 2008 approximately 150 oil-company       personnel have       attended field courses led by Hurst and colleagues and many more have       attended office-located       workshops.
Courses are typically associated with specific oil fields or       are used to heighten the       awareness of sand injectites within companies.
