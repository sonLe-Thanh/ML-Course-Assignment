     Morrow's research has been extensively disseminated through multiple       interviews on local, national and international broadcasts and through the       publication of op-ed pieces in local and national newspapers (BBC TV and       Radio, AP/Reuters, Guardian, Irish Times, Belfast Telegraph, Irish News,       Newsletter (see source 10).
Through the active dissemination of the       research and using the media as impact generating interfaces, Morrow's       work has impacted on the tone, language and framing of debates around       sectarianism, political division, peace building and reconciliation in       Northern Ireland.
Impacts on Public Policy: The issue of a shared future is now       central to the concerns of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern         Ireland Executive.
Commitments to a shared and better future have       been integrated into the Northern Ireland Programme for Government       (2008-11) and into the current Programme for Government (2011-2014).
More       specifically, in 2008 the Department of Education in Northern Ireland       appointed Duncan Morrow to an advisory group to review current practice       and to advise government on its new policy for Community Relations,       Education and Diversity (CRED).
In order to articulate more effectively       the wider scope of the new policy, from existing community relation policy       in education, the new policy drew heavily from the original EDI principles       and is now premised on the interdependence between equality, good       relations and human rights, including UNCRC and commitments in the Good       Friday, St Andrews and Hillsborough Agreements while acknowledging the       greater diversity of our community.
This policy has now been adopted and       implemented across all schools in Northern Ireland.
Thanks to these policy       interventions, Duncan Morrow has also been an expert advisor to the US         Government, the Scottish Government, the Northern         Ireland Executive and local government on community relation       issues.
The Chief Executive Officer of Belfast City Council noted that:       "For over a decade we have relied directly and repeatedly on the academic       research, policy relevance and practical advice of Duncan Morrow in a wide       variety of areas" (see source 1).
Extending from this and "in light of his       research, practical experience and independence" he was appointed by the       Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs to drive forward the Ministerial         Advisory Committee on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland (see source       2).
An example of his impact at an international level was referenced in       the recent correspondence from the White House in relation to       advice given to the US Government on Policy in Northern Ireland.
The US       Consulate General noted recently that he believed Morrow's work and       discussions with senior White House officials in Washington in the Spring       of 2013 had played a part in the "issuance and tone" of two statements       released by both President Barak Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry       in Washington in April 2013, just prior to the anniversary of the Good       Friday Agreement, on the US policy position (see source 3).
Impacts on Local and International Funding Streams: The Morrow et       al.
principles of Equity, Diversity and Interdependence       have been established as core principles of the Community Relations       Council since 2000 and applied to all of its work.
This commitment was       confirmed through the new CRC Strategic Plan (2011-2014).
Since 2008, the       principles have been applied to funding schemes of an estimated &#163;20m per       annum operated by or through the Community Relations Council (see source       4).
The European Union PEACE III programme (2007-2013) with a       value of 333m Euros also incorporated the principles of EDI into its core       objectives to allocate its funding and sought to promote "A normal, civic       society, in which all individuals are considered as equals, where       differences are resolved through dialogue in the public sphere, and where       all people are treated impartially.
A society where there is equity,       respect for diversity and recognition of our interdependence" (see source       5).
Impact on Culture and Society: The research has enhanced the       cultural understandings on particularly sensitive issues in Northern       Ireland, such as parading and dealing with the past through commemorative       activities.
The EDI principles were fed through into the Ashdown         Commission on Parading in Northern Ireland appointed by the Northern       Ireland Office when Duncan Morrow was tasked as a political advisor to the       group.
The interim report of the Commission in 2008 provided an outline       basis for the Executive proposals for legislation in 2010 (see source 6).
It has also been influential within the Irish Football Association's         (IFA) `Football for All' project which uses football as a conduit to       promote peace and reconciliation, develop partnerships and build capacity       within clubs, fans and communities.
Founded originally in 2000, the       project involves 850 clubs, 1,000 coaches, 600 referees, 15,000 players,       6,000 people with special needs, 15,000 women and girls and 8,000       schoolchildren each year.
Morrow was appointed as a member of the Football       for All Advisory Panel in 2000 to help the group embed the EDI principles       in their work.
A hugely successful initiative, the IFA were invited by the       Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in 2012 to present       on their community relations activities at the European governing body's       inaugural corporate social responsibility workshop in Sarajevo, Bosnia and       Herzegovina.
It was highly commended for significance and impact beyond       Northern Ireland: "Over the last ten years, the Football For All Project       has transformed the atmosphere at Northern Ireland international football       games creating a fun, safe and family friendly environment," said the EU         Commissioner for Regional Policy.
"Bringing together key partners       from both the private and public sectors, the project has played a central       role to get real progress in community relations in football ...Not only       has Football For All made a meaningful difference locally, but we also see       it as a model which other countries around Europe can learn from and       aspire to" (see source 7).
Impact on Practitioners and Professional Services: In May 2013,       two days of talks were held in Cardiff involving senior Northern Ireland       police officers, politicians and representatives from loyalist and       republican communities in Belfast.
As a co-organiser and facilitator of       these high level political negotiations on peace-building and policing,       Morrow used the EDI principles as the underpinning framework for the       negotiations and discussion.
This was acknowledged by Police Service         of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable who said "Most       importantly, he developed a process for engaging police with community and       political leaders which culminated with important talks in Cardiff in May       2013".
These talks then led to a joint declaration &#8212; the Cardiff         Declaration &#8212; which set the agreed framework for subsequent dialogue       between politicians and the police over contentious issues (see source 8).
Impact on Conflict Transformation in Local Government: Belfast City         Council Good Relations Plan     Belfast City Council has adopted the Morrow et al.
principles of equity,       diversity and interdependence into its good relations planning.
The Belfast         City Council Good Relations Plan (2007-2011) stated "We are       committed to the principles of equity, diversity and interdependence and       have agreed that these should be firmly anchored and integrated within our       policies and programmes" and defines them in terms of the original       definition developed in 1997.
In 2011, the most recent Council plan       states: "The principles of equity, diversity and interdependence should be       mainstreamed into all of our activities, policies, structures and       procedures, recognising that diverse groups are interdependent and basing       relationships amongst them on agreed principles of fairness and equality"       (see source 9).
Reach: The reach of the research has extended far beyond policy       makers and donors to the public sector as indicated above.
A range of       groups have integrated the principles of equity, diversity and       interdependence (EDI) into their ethos and values documented through their       operational plans and programmes of activities including: Youth Link &#8212; the       inter-church youth service for Northern Ireland which was established by       the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church in       Ireland and the Presbyterian Church in Ireland in 1991 and exists to       provide support and training for youth workers and community relations       experiences for young people; Hazelwood Community Partnership (an       interagency project to support the community in building good relations by       delivering practical responses to all issues arising from community       tensions in the greater Whitewell area in North Belfast); Lurgan Town       Youth project (a town based approach aiming to build a shared agenda       educationally, socially, politically, civically and economically); and the       Rural Community Network (a regional voluntary organisation established by       community groups from rural areas in 1991 to articulate the voice of rural       communities on issues relating to poverty, disadvantage and equality).
Significance: The overall significance of the development of the     Morrow et al.
equity, diversity and interdependence (EDI) principles lies in     the substantial influence which it has had in shaping and framing the     discourse on the specific of the processes of peace-building and     reconciliation in a society emerging from conflict.
The local-global impact     and lessons from the implementation of the EDI principles have helped to set     the agenda in public policy on issues of sharing and integration over     separation and segregation in divided societies.
