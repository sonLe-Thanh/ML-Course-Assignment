     4.1 Updated treatment guidelines resulted in earlier treatment     Earlier ART leads to better treatment outcomes for people with HIV       throughout the world with fewer deaths and hospitalisations.
ART-CC's       research on prognosis [1-3] has been extensively cited by treatment       guidelines between 2008 and 2013.
Our 2009 paper on timing of ART [3],       which clarified that the CD4 threshold for starting ART should be at least       350 cells/mm3, was particularly influential and informed       changes during 2009-11 to World Health Organization (WHO) [a], British       [b], European, US [c], and other national [d] guidelines to recommend       starting treatment earlier.
High income countries: ART-CC research suggests that increasing       the CD4 count at start of ART from 200 to 350 cells/mm3 will       increase life expectancy of a 20-year-old by between 8 [6] and 12 years       [5].
The bar chart on page 2 (based on unpublished ART-CC data) shows that       patients started treatment earlier in the UK, Europe and North America       after guidelines were changed in 2009-10.
The Health Protection Agency       (HPA) 2012 report stated that between 2010 and 2011 AIDS diagnoses in the       UK decreased by 33% and mortality by 18% [e].
Low income countries: UNAIDS reported that the number of people in       Africa receiving ART increased from less than a million in 2005 to 7.1       million in 2012, with nearly 1 million added in 2012 alone.
During 2009-11       the recommended threshold for treatment in at least 29 low and middle       income countries changed (based in part on ART-CC's work) from 200 to 350       cells/mm3 [d].
This has led to more and earlier treatment,       particularly in Africa.
Data from Western Cape, South Africa, show the       steep increase in numbers of people treated and their increased CD4 count       at start of ART as a consequence of the adoption of the new guidelines       (graph &#8212; personal communication, Cape Town University, South Africa).
During this period, AIDS-related deaths in Africa fell by 32% from       approximately 1.75 to 1.19 million (calculated from UNAIDS 2012 global       report).
The massive scale-up in treatment due to increasing the threshold       from 200 to 350 cells/mm3 has been replicated across the globe.
4.3 Raised public awareness of consequences of starting treatment late     May worked with the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) Study to raise       awareness of the loss in life expectancy due to starting HIV treatment       later than guidelines recommend [6].
This work was extensively reported in       the UK and worldwide, for example in a two-page feature in The         Independent in October 2011 [f] and in The China Daily [f]       and was also discussed by professional publications such as Nursing         Times, on 8 November 2011 [f].
The same research was presented in a       poster [f] displayed in hospital waiting rooms across the UK, to       communicate the findings to patients as part of a wider effort by UKCHIC       to disseminate information to key patient communities.
According to the       2012 HPA UK HIV report, the proportion of HIV positive people diagnosed       late (with CD4 count below 350 cells/mm3) fell by 3% during       2011 [e].
The ART-CC paper on life expectancy [4] influenced a campaign to halve       the proportion of people diagnosed late with HIV [g].
The UK CHIC life       expectancy paper [5] contributed evidence to "Standard 1: HIV Testing and       Diagnosis" in the policy document from BHIVA on "Standards of Care for       People Living with HIV" [h].
Earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment       reduces onward transmission since successfully treated people with       suppressed virus replication do not transmit HIV [h].
This not only avoids       illnesses and early deaths, but also has the potential to deliver huge       financial savings.
The HPA 2011 report estimated that the prevention of       one new HIV infection saves the public purse between &#163;280,000 and &#163;360,000       in direct lifetime healthcare costs [e].
This research therefore impacts       not only the 22,600 people the HPA estimated were living with undiagnosed       HIV in the UK in 2011 (2012 report) [e] but also uninfected individuals,       who are less likely to be exposed to HIV if those infected with HIV are       diagnosed and treated [e].
4.4 Improved access to insurance.
The opportunity to obtain life insurance has a major impact on quality of       life, particularly since a term of 20 years is required for a mortgage.
ART-CC research [1,6] had a commercial impact by providing data to       insurance companies that led them to improve the provision of life       insurance and open up the insurance market to HIV positive people.
Swiss       Re [i], Hannover Re (UK) and AERAS (France) [i] based their assessment of       insurability of HIV positive people on ART-CC's publications [1,6] and       web-based mortality risk calculator.
Based on our 2002 data [1], SwissRe       recommended that certain patient groups should be offered up to 10 years'       insurance.
During 2010-12, ART-CC worked with SwissRe to extend this to 20       years and estimate the excess premium that HIV positive individuals would       need to pay [6].
This had an impact prior to publication: ART-CC tables       were presented at a national meeting of insurers in Paris [i], and New       York [i] by Swiss Re, and to the French AIDS research agency (Agence       Nationale de Recherche sur la Sida et les hepatites virales, ANRS) by       May[i].
Based on this research, Swiss Re updated its underwriting       guidelines for western Europe resulting in cheaper insurance costs and       broader coverage with policies offered up to 25 years [j].
The Head of       Research Innovation and Product Development, Swiss Re, stated that there       would be "greater access to home ownership and to business loans for HIV       positive persons" and the research "has led to increased normalisation of       HIV compared to other chronic diseases...
The study has also influenced       Swiss Re's ratings for HIV+ lives in South Africa and the ratings of       direct insurers" and "has influenced debate on HIV ratings in India and       Australia" [j].
ART-CC research on insurability [6] has impacted awareness of insurance       products among HIV positive people through the work of advocacy groups       such as HIV i-base [i] and the European AIDS Treatment Group, which in       discussing our paper [6] wrote "People doing well on HIV therapy should be       eligible for life insurance" [i].
The proportion of UK insurers that       provide services to HIV positive people increased from 33% to 66% between       2010 and 2012 [i].
A 2012 UK survey found that the percentage of HIV       positive people who knew of the existence of life insurance products       increased from only 20% in 2012 to 78% in 2013 [i].
