     Impact on political and public debate in Italy       Duggan's work has from the outset been strongly debated, especially in       Italy.
His first book &#8212; La         mafia durante il fascismo (1986) &#8212; on the campaign of the fascist       regime against the Sicilian mafia,       was the focus of a national debate after being reviewed in the Corriere         della Sera (10/1/1987 and       26/1/1987) by the writer and politician Leonardo Sciascia.
To mark the       twentieth anniversary of the       national debate it had generated the book was reissued in 2007 with       Sciascia's articles and an       essay by the writer Gaetano Savatteri.
Duggan's study of Francesco Crispi,       Creare la nazione (`To       create the nation'), published first in Italian in 2000, received much       media coverage, especially in       relation to what were perceived as being Italy's ongoing problems with       establishing a stable nation-       state.
Extensive reviews appeared in e.g.
La Stampa (14/1/2001), Avvenire       (14/1/2001), Il         Gazzettino (21/1/2001), Corriere della Sera (30/1/2001), Sole         24 Ore (18/2/2001), La Repubblica       (6/4/2001), The newspaper Il Giornale, owned by Silvio       Berlusconi's brother, sought (29/7/2001;       author's reply 22/9/2001) to suggest that the book demonstrated that only       a charismatic leader       could unite the country.
One of the central themes of the book &#8212; the       relationship between nation-       building and war &#8212; aroused strong reactions (e.g.
the review by Giuseppe       Giarrizzo, L'Acropoli,       August 2002, which objected furiously to the idea that Crispi had an       aggressive foreign policy).
For       responses to the book &#8212; and the issue of nation-building and war in       particular &#8212; in the UK, see, for       instance the long review in the TLS, 2 May 2003 (pp.
3-5).
Duggan's book, The Force of Destiny, was published in Italy in       November 2008.
It was the subject       of an hour-long public debate with the author on state national television       (RaiUno) on the evening       of 5 December 2008.
Hosted by the journalist Gianni Riotta, the studio       audience included       academics and writers (Sergio Luzzatto, Franco Cardini, Vincenzo Mollica,       Karima Moual) as well       as members of the public.
There were also interventions from politicians       such as the Minister of       Defence, Ignazio La Russa.
The book was discussed in a series of public       events from 27-30       January 2009.
In Rome it was presented by the former prime minister,       Giuliano Amato, and former       Minister of Education Tullio De Mauro, and debated with the author by some       forty historians.
In       Turin the public debate was led by the editor of La Repubblica,       Ezio Mauro and in Milan by the       historian and diplomat, Sergio Romano.
There were twenty-two newspaper       reviews of the book       and several articles and interviews (e.g., La Repubblica,       25/11/2008, Corriere della Sera,       30/1/2009).
At the Estoria festival in Gorizia on 24/5/2009 the author       discussed the themes of the       book in a charged atmosphere with the writer and historian Ernesto Galli       della Loggia.
Galli Della       Loggia claimed subsequently, in an editorial in the Corriere della         Sera (7/1/2011), that the book       was damaging Italy's international standing by presenting a `caricature'       of the country's history.
The first edition of the book (6,000 in hardback) sold out in six weeks.
A       new paperback edition       was brought out in 2011 to mark the 150th anniversary of       Italian unification.
In recognition of the       author's contribution to the study of Italian history, the President of       the Italian Republic, Giorgio       Napolitano, conferred on him the title of Commendatore in 2008.
The       President and his Diplomatic       Adviser, Ambassador Stefano Stefanini, discussed the book personally with       Duggan at a meeting       in Oxford on 29 June 2011.
Impact on public understanding of Italian history and its present-day         relevance       In the UK Duggan's work has engaged with audiences beyond university       circles.
His Concise         History of Italy, first published in 1994, has sold 40,000 copies to       date and is used extensively in       schools.
A second and updated edition of this book will be published in       the autumn of 2013.
The         Force of Destiny (2007) received widespread coverage in the press.
UK sales of the book stood at       over 11,000 in September 2013.
Fascist Voices &#8212; a history of the fascist regime as seen through       the diaries of ordinary people -       was published in the UK (Random House) in November 2012.
The US edition       (OUP) appeared in       July 2013; the Italian edition in November 2013.
In February 2013 Fascist         Voices was named       Political History Book of the Year at the Political Books Awards in       London; in May 2013 it received       the Wolfson History Prize for 2012: a BBC History Magazine podcast of       Duggan discussing the       book is available at:       http://d2j7noxmrt3xhh.cloudfront.net/bbchistory/audio/HistoryExtra_2013_05_16.mp3.
Duggan       was invited by the BBC to work with the journalist Misha Glenny on a       forthcoming series (starting       14/10/13) for Radio 4 on Italian history (`The Invention of Italy').
Duggan's more recent research on fascism &#8212; exploring the role of the cult       of the Duce in the       process of nationalisation in the inter-war years &#8212; has been disseminated       through three       documentary films (screened in the UK and Italy) and an exhibition at the       Estorick Collection in       London (22 September - 19 December 2010: 4,850 visitors).
A film of this       exhibition, with       commentary, is available on: www.youtube.com/user/mussoliniexhibition.
Duggan is also frequently asked by national newspapers in the UK and       Italy for articles or       interviews on aspects of contemporary Italy and how current problems       relate to broader historical       trends.
(e.g.
La Repubblica, 25/11/2008, The Independent,       29/9/2009, Corriere dell Sera,       24/10/2009, 31/8/2013 Daily Telegraph, 12/11/2011).
Impact on education and educational resources       The documentary films on the cult of the Duce were distributed to many       universities and schools in       the UK and fifteen overseas countries: 94% of users reported that the       films encouraged an       increased engagement with the topic among their students.
Work is       currently being done with the       Historical Association and history teachers to see how the research on the       cult of Mussolini (which       has largely been conducted within a multi-disciplinary AHRC-funded       project) can be made       available for use in schools.
Duggan was asked by a leading educational       publisher (Hodder) to       revise school textbooks on modern Italy: this advisory and editorial work       began in September       2013.
