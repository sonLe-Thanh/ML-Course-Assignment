     Research contribution to impact:       The involvement and participation of the photography research team in this       high profile international event with an established lineage and heritage       has enabled research through curatorship, exhibition and critical writing.
The nature and significance of this has focussed on processes of       dissemination and the evaluation of the Festival and its cultural value.
The research has inspired new ways of generating and influencing creative       practice and exhibition in photography.
The Festival has contributed to       the cultural life of the city and the attendant economic and social       benefits this brings.
FORMAT 11 hosted exhibitions in other areas of the region (namely at       Burton-on-Trent and through the New Art Exchange in Nottingham).
This was       continued in 2013 with the use of 18 venues including the Beetroot Tree in       South Derbyshire, the New Art Exchange, Nottingham and John Smedley's       factory in Lea Green near Matlock, Derbyshire.
The Festival also made use       of the Chocolate Factory, an empty warehouse which was used as a temporary       exhibition space in the City.
As in 2011, the festival had a press launch       in London at St. Pancras International, with support from Marketing Derby,       Derby City Council.
The launch event for FORMAT 13 featured a performance of Elemental Force,       which is an Arts Council England funded series of free spectacular       large-scale outdoor events that put historic buildings centre stage and       use light, sound and film to celebrate the rich heritage of Derbyshire and       Nottinghamshire.
The research team broadened the use of online platforms       with the EyeEM mobile phone app and the Exhibition Explorer App.
This       experimented with an enhanced use of social media in order that the work       of photographers across the globe could be submitted in real-time.
In       total over 7,000 images were submitted to the festival via MobFORMAT.
