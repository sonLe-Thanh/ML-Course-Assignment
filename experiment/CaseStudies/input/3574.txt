     Most of Ajegbo's (2007) Curriculum Review: Diversity and Citizenship       recommendations stem from our research, particularly concerning            then current approaches to identity and diversity in schools       pupils' and teachers' concerns about these areas       the need for further teacher education, resources and leadership       the characteristics of good practice          Members of the research team had meetings with the Ajgebo Commission in       2006 to review drafts of the Review.
These led to substantial editing on       the nature of multiple identities and how they affected diversity (in       particular, how some Muslim young people successfully combined British and       other identities).
The Review's findings were accepted by the Secretary of State, and the       QCA subsequently revised the National Curriculum.
The 2007 programme of       study included a new element, Identities and Diversity: Living         together in the UK, in which Citizenship supported community       cohesion.
The Citizenship Programme of study for key stages 3 and 4 lists       key concepts reflect closely the findings of our research: http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/uploads/QCA-07-3329-pCitizenship3_tcm8-396.pdf&#8212;            Appreciating that identities are complex, can change over time and are         informed by different understandings of what it means to be a citizen in         the UK.
Exploring the diverse national, regional, ethnic and religious         cultures, groups and communities in the UK and the connections between         them.
Considering the interconnections between the UK, the rest of Europe         and the wider world.
Exploring community cohesion and the forces that change in communities         over time.
The revised national curriculum took effect from 2007/8, and had been       used in every successive year, thus impacting on all pupils in England       since 2008.
The QCA also produced cross curricula guidance in which identity and       diversity featured as one of seven dimensions to be considered by schools       when designing and planning their whole curriculum.
(QCA, Cross-curriculum         dimensions: A planning guide for schools:       http://schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/el/98010.pdf(2009).
The Agebgo Review recommended (following our identification of a       significant lack of knowledge of available resources) that the DfES       commission a review of existing educational resources covering issues that       explicitly relate to teaching about identity and diversity in the       Citizenship curriculum.
This was undertaken by the Citizenship Foundation       (http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/lib_res_pdf/0747.pdf).
The Research also impacted on the Higher Education curriculum for       teachers of Citizenship.
The Professional Standards for Teachers Qualified Teacher Status were       revised by the TDA in September 2007 http://www.tda.gov.uk/teacher/developing-career/professional-standards-guidance/~/media/resources/teacher/professional-standards/standards_qts.pdf       to include a revised set of professional attributes concerning diversity       (Q18 -20) and the requirement (Q25) that teachers take practical account       of diversity and promoting equality and inclusion.
The Revised Teachers'         Standards, effective from 1 September 2012 also refer to Fundamental       British values and include references to the Report's findings       (http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/t/teachers%20standards.pdf).
All relevant initial teacher education has been revised to include these       changes.
The University of Exeter write "the fact that this area was now       statutory was significant &#8212; it ensured that we explored these important       issues of race and diversity.
This was particularly important in the South       West where there is still a tendency for schools to think `there is no       problem here'".
Their Professional Studies course for primary and       secondary students has a lead lecture on diversity which refers       extensively to the Report.
The University of York "welcomed the       opportunity offered by the addition of the Identities and Diversity strand       to the ... curriculum.
We made alterations to the PGCE programme so that       this significant area could be developed better by trainee teachers.
We       see links between this area and the building of community cohesion."
(Both       communications available in full on request)     A further outcome was the DCFS created a duty for schools to promote       community cohesion.
Non-statutory Guidance on the duty to promote         Community Cohesion was published in 2007 (www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/DCSF-00598-2007.pdf),       and repeatedly quotes the Ajegbo report and the `Identity and Diversity'       strand in citizenship education.
The inclusion of identity-related       elements in the Citizenship curriculum has strengthened the subject, and       demonstrated its effectiveness in promoting and maintaining community       cohesion.
This is evidenced in the 2012-13 consultation on the National       Curriculum: 61% of those expressing an opinion on Citizenship wanted it to       be retained: they `believed that pupils should learn about ... the       challenges of living in a diverse society.
.... that it was essential to       retain a statutory Programme of Study to ensure that issues such as       racism, discrimination, diversity and inclusion were covered by all       schools, in all year groups.'
(Department for Education (2013) Review         of the National Curriculum in England: Summary Report of the         Call for Evidence.
p 59).
Thus in turn contributed to the present       Government's decision to retain the subject (Hansard Official Report;       Vol.
550, c. 655, 7 February 2013).
