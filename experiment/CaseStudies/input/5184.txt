     The reach of the impact achieved by this research has extended to       governmental and official bodies at the European level, and to educational       groupings both nationally and internationally.
This is indicated by: (i)       Engagement of a large number of academics, officials and Non-Governmental       Organisation (NGO) representatives in a common project (The seven series       of Cross-National Research Papers involved 234 authors from 16 countries,       and IPROSEC covered 11 countries, and the impact on those involved has       extended significantly into the 2008-2013 period) [5.1]; (ii)       Creation of a large cross-national network of researchers including young       researchers with an explicit focus on enhancement of their training and       professional skills (opportunities for them to acquire skills and publish)       (13 non-UK partners and 20 research assistants for IPROSEC and 8 core team       members for the ESRC seminar competition award in 6 countries; events held       in Paris and Tallinn).
Again, this has had significant resonances in the       later careers of those involved [5.1,]; (iii) Transfer and sharing       of knowledge through workshops, policy papers, reports, policy       recommendations (see above) [5.2, 5.3, 5.4]; (iv) The ESRC       training programme in International Social Research Methods involved the       design and organisation of a launch event (May 2010) to assess research       training needs in academia, government, private and NGO sectors throughout       the UK [5.4, 5.5].
Seven workshops were held during the funding       period in London, Paris and Nantes, in cooperation with the British       Library, British Council in London and Paris, the Society for Research in       Higher Education and R&#233;seau des Maisons des Sciences de l'Homme, for       experienced researchers seeking to develop their competence in       international research methods [5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8].
The       success of the work carried out under the award has been recognised       through requests to extend the programme to postgraduate/postdoctoral       research students (Bristol and Leeds) and to run further workshops at       venues in France (Rennes, Lille) after the end of the life of the project       [5.4].
To date, a total of almost 200 participants have benefitted       directly from the training provision; (v) A database of International       Social Research Methods Case Studies has been developed hosted by the       ESRC's National Centre for Research Methods, and Palgrave has launched a       web companion for International Comparative Methods, which has       also been made available as an e-book, thereby extending the reach of the       project worldwide [5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8]; (vi) The       International Social Research Council is interested in including       international social research methods training in its fellowship scheme.
This is proving to be an area of training that is underdeveloped in other       countries.
Publicity about the launch of the databank has, for example,       brought requests from researchers in South Africa and Slovakia.
The       research has thus reached a wide range of audiences at several levels:       education and training beyond the host institution, policy officials,       networks of professionals and researchers in a variety of national and       cross-national contexts.
The significance of the impact generated by the research is       indicated by: (i) Creation of an enhanced knowledge base for policy       innovation and for the enhancement of international research methods.
The       IPROSEC and related projects have been particularly important in       incorporating `new' EU Member States that entered the Union in 2004, and       extending the network to them, creating new knowledge from what was often       a low base and disseminating good practice in cross-national social       (policy) research [5.1, 5.2, 5.4]; (ii) The International Social       Research Training project has resulted in the creation of research methods       resource in the form of an on-line data bank of International Social       Research Methods Case Studies, based on a Framework, developed in large       part from the International Comparative Research web companion,       under the auspices of the ESRC Re-Store initiative.
The website is proving       to be a valuable resource for researchers embarking on international       research projects both in policy studies and in other areas of social       science research [5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8].
In the ESRC impact       report on the RDI project, the Framework is cited as a key innovation;       (iii) The methods and training activities encompassed by the International       Social Research Methods project have had a strategic impact by       contributing to the development of a national infrastructure for       researcher development, and this has reached beyond the UK through the       provision of international training and the on-line databank, which have       acted as a catalyst for further research and training activities [5.3,         5.4].
The activities have fostered innovation through a novel focus       on the development of flexible-use training materials, and the on-line       databank provides a sustainable baseline for the engagement of further       participants [5.3, 5.4, 5.7].
(iv) As Chair of the International       Advisory Group of the Academy of Social Sciences, drawing on her       international network of contacts, her international social research       methods training provision and interest in the research-policy interface,       Professor Hantrais is coordinating a programme of seminars entitled       `Social Science Evidence and the Policy Process: International Insights',       starting in October 2013 [5.2, 5.4, 5.5].
(v) SAGE are including       the International Social Research Methods Case Studies in their on-line       collection of SAGE Methods Cases, and Professor Hantrais has accepted an       invitation to be on the SAGE Review Panel [5.7].
The research has       thus had substantial significance for policy debate and formation during       the 2008-2013 period, especially in the area of international social       research methods drawing upon extensive comparative and cross-national       work.
