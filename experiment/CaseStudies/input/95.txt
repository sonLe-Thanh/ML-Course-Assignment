     The programme of research undertaken within CIDD has been instrumental in       addressing the health inequalities and the health promotion needs of       people with ID.
The impact is evident in the following six areas:            The identification of health inequalities through health           surveillance:       Members of CIDD through robust research have clearly identified the         health needs of this population (1-6).
As a result, a `health passport'         was developed which provides a structured nursing assessment and assists         in the communication of information between the person with ID and         mainstream healthcare professionals (Source 3).
In addition training         courses for over 150 acute hospital staff in Northern Ireland were         devised by University personnel in collaboration with a theatre company         of people with ID.
The training supported the implementation of the GAIN         Guidelines (Source 2).
The learning gained from this work led to an exploration of other         chronic health conditions and a focus on diabetes emerged.
A new project         has brought together an inter-disciplinary team of international experts         from across the four UK countries in order to adapt and test a diabetes         education programme for people with ID.
This is funded by a grant from         Diabetes UK &#163;291,678 in 2012.
The development of a network of Health Facilitators in GP Practices           to promote health screening/annual checks:       The research undertaken by members of the CIDD was cited in Equal Lives         (DHSSPSNI, 2005) (Source 1) that led to the pioneering appointment of         nine Health Facilitators for people with ID across the five Health and         Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland.
The health facilitators         encourage attendance at annual health screens undertaken by GPs: with         uptakes in certain areas (76%) exceeding those reported for other         regions of the UK.
They also support the implementation of health action         plans within ID services and they have adapted and instigated health         promotion activities around healthy hearts and exercise (Source 4).
The development of accessible information to assist people with ID           to make positive lifestyle choices:       A colourful, user friendly information booklet on breast         cancer/screening was developed that allows women to make more informed         decisions about monitoring their own health and accessing breast         screening services.
It gives women with ID, their carers and         professional staff a greater understanding of what breast cancer is, the         signs/symptoms, what to do and the process involved in receiving a         mammogram.
This innovative publication was developed in collaboration         with women with ID within an advocacy network and has been circulated         widely within the UK and internationally (www.easyhealth.org.uk)         (Source 3).
A similar booklet on promoting good mental health has been         published.
The translation of research into pre/post multi-disciplinary           education:       Findings from research undertaken by CIDD researchers have guided the         development of best practice standards for `Care of People with Learning         Disabilities in General Hospitals' (DHSSPSNI, 2010).
Three major         hospitals in Northern Ireland have implemented these standards focusing         on the care of people with ID through service improvement plans.
These         plans focus on increased use of accessible information to explain         admission, consent and care and treatment processes: as well as         facilitating a comprehensive assessment of their needs and improving         communication among hospital staff in meeting these needs.
More         recently, a new innovative e-learning module has been designed for         teachers, classroom support assistants, H&amp;SC professionals and         parents to promote the physical and mental health of children and         adolescents with developmental and ID.
Also a training DVD a resource         manual has been produced to increase the partnership between palliative         care and ID services focusing on end of life care for people with ID         (McLaughlin, PhD thesis, 2012)..
The influence of regional, national and international policy           guidelines:          The research undertaken by CIDD researchers has resulted in specific       recommendations in key Northern Ireland H&amp;SC policy documents aimed at       improving access to healthcare for people with ID (DHSSPSNI, 2005, Ch.7: www.dhsspsgov.uk/equallivesreportchpt7.pdf)       and across the UK (Michael Report, 2008).
These research findings were       also cited in the World Report on Disability produced by the WHO in       2011(p.8) (Source 1).
