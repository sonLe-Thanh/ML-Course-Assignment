     The impacts can be captured under three main headings, as follows:     Empowering the Local            influencing the Making Belfast Work programme into setting up         area partnerships that operate at a geographic scale which permits         cross-community regeneration strategies, thereby helping to create the         opportunity for development beyond segregated communities; (see letter         from Permanent Secretary, Department of Education)       establishing collaborative regeneration projects with nine         difficult-to-access local communities.
.
Impacts here have been to         create engagement among relevant stakeholders and to bring strategic         thinking to local issues.
Community schemes include Ligoneil, New Lodge,         Mount Vernon, Tiger's Bay, Donegall Pass, Lower Ormeau, the Markets and         Sandy Row, involving a total population of 25,000.
Two of these areas         (Mount Vernon and the Markets) have had subsequent investments in         masterplans.
As expressed by one neighbourhood worker, the impact of the         action-research was `great ... because of the capacity and           confidence it (gave) the residents ... in dealing with architects and         planners ... (the removal of paramilitary murals) all came from the           work we did with Ken and Frank'.
(see Wilson Report, page         7 below).
Another neighbourhood worker acknowledged that the work had         been `very good at getting me interested in contested space ... (at           looking at the local interface) in a totally different way ...           as an underdeveloped space'.
He welcomed Gaffikin and Sterrett's         ability to present argument in lay language &#8212; `sometimes with           academics you don't know what they are talking about' &#8212; and also         to place the issue of interfaces in their wider social contexts.
(see         Wilson Report, page 6 below);       empowering local community leaders with planning competencies through         working with them on developing local cross-community regeneration         strategies (30 people); one neighbourhood worker, for example, said: `I           have the greatest admiration for both Frank and Ken and I'm           not sure they even know the impact they have had '.
(see Wilson         Report);       demonstrating how socio-spatial division impedes the linkages demanded         by sustainable urbanism, as evidenced by a survey of key players in a         cross-sectoral group of 50 at one of our workshops, in which 76% of         respondents said that they found the research data very useful, with         comments such as 'innovative inspiring ideas for change' and 'It           will have an impact on place-making in Belfast' (November         2012); and       showing senior government officials and local activists (150) how         practice from other divided cities indicates how neighbourhood planning         can be linked to macro-statutory planning in ways that make territorial         borders more permeable.
Confirmation of the impact of this aspect of the         work is evident in the evaluator's appraisal that: 'Gaffikin and           Sterrett have placed great store by understanding other           socially and ethnically fractured cities internationally, such           as Chicago and Nicosia.
While this might seem ethereal from a           street-level Belfast perspective, on the contrary, the neighbourhood           workers interviewed spoke of its tangible value'.
(see         Wilson Report, p. 8)          Remaking City and Regional Planning            The issue of division and segregation has only relatively recently         been recognised by the planning agenda.
One authoritative source, for         example, confirmed that he was `90 per cent certain' that Prof           Gaffikin's work had influenced the introduction of the idea of           contested space into the official Regional Development Strategy for           Northern Ireland published a decade and a half earlier.'
(See Wilson           Report page 7, below).
Similarly, the work of Sterrett and         Gaffikin was adopted by the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan, which         uniquely acknowledged the significance of sectarian spatial divisions in         the urban area.
The Strategic Local Partnership, set up to achieve a twin process of         regeneration with reconciliation, adopted a strategy of One City, based         on the analysis generated by this research about planning in contested         space (2005).
Influencing Legislation and Policy     Connected to the above work, it helped to introduce the concept of       long-term vision planning, inviting inventive scenarios beyond violent       conflict; and ensured that the challenge of sociosectarian division was       embedded into the local &#8212; regional scale.
This impact is evident in a       number of key areas of planning practice.
For example:             Sterrett's joint authoring of the publication `Government           Action for our Urban Environment' (May 2011) triggered a series of         significant impacts.
Following meetings with four key ministers         (May-October 2011), a joint ministerial summit on urban design was held         (January 2012) with two key outcomes: (1) a government-sponsored Winter         School to explore how a new approach to urban planning and design could         address spatial issues in inner north Belfast (March 2012) and (2)         publication of new cross-departmental policy on `Urban Stewardship           and Design' (February 2013).
Explicitly acknowledged is the fact         that: `Northern Ireland has a unique set of socio-political           circumstances ... (with) a legacy of division ... materialising in           many of our urban centres and inner city neighbourhoods.'
It goes         on to refer to `the long term objective of a shared future (with the           need to) avoid the creation of near permanent barriers, be they           physical or perceived set within the structure of our urban areas.'
This breaks completely new ground in this neglected area.
Parallel research work on urban structure and form by Sterrett         with the co-directors of the Forum for Alternative Belfast has         also seen two official local masterplans being taken forward by Belfast         City Council's Masterplan, again a break-through initiative (June 2013);       An urban design scheme (researched and developed by Sterrett         in partnership with the Forum for an Alternative Belfast) -         challenging the design of a major &#163;100m regional roads proposal that         would have further segmented the contested space of north Belfast -         influenced government's eventual adoption of a more progressive option.
This offers the potential for better pedestrian connections and         regeneration of the area.
(confirmed by Department for Regional         Development press conference, December 6th 2012);        Gaffikin and Sterrett's partnership with the Department         of Environment on a major EU-funded action-research project, `Planning           for Spatial Reconciliation' (2011-2014), is seeing further         significant impacts on planning policy and practice via engagement about         the significance of contested space for spatial planning and         regeneration strategy with:         - senior staff in departments responsible for planning and regeneration       (since 2011);       - the 70 most senior staff in the Department for Social Development       (November 2012);       - And the Environment Minister (April 2013).
Most tellingly, following       this briefing with the Minister he requested a paper outlining the key       lessons from our work, to help him develop an operational agenda about how       new planning could redress the intractable problem of socio-spatial       division.
Moreover, he asked for us to specify how civic capacity to       deliver such an agenda could be enhanced (May 2013); This engagement led       to:        introduction of spatial analysis of ethno-religious/ social divisions         into the Department of Environment's manual for preparing statutory         spatial plans (2013), and inclusion of new policy on spatial segregation         and the creation of shared space within the DoE's new Single Planning         Policy Document (Summer 2013), which sets the framework for development         planning and management.
Again, this inclusion sets a precedent for         dealing with this contentious issue, and the corroborating letter below         from the Director of Planning Policy confirms the importance of this         research to how planning can deal with this problem.
