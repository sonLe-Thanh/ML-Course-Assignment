Enhanced public engagement with, and understanding of, climate         mitigation by individuals     Pathway: One pathway arises through the continuing popularity and       influence of the Climate         Change Begins at Home book [A], much of the content of which       is underpinned by the work       encapsulated in research output [1], Section 3.
First published in 2005,       the impacts of the book       over the period January 2008 &#8212; July 2013 include continuing sales and the       commissioning of Reay       by Macmillan to write a popular book for children on climate change       mitigation by individuals,       entitled Your Planet Needs You!, which was published in 2009       jointly by the Science Museum [B].
Over the same period Reay has also delivered a wide range of public       lectures and media pieces.
Significance and reach:            Although the majority of the &gt;7,500 to-date sales of Climate           Change Begins at Home         occurred 2005 - 2007, it has continued to sell &gt;250 copies over the         period January 2008 &#8212; June         2010 [A].
That Climate Change Begins at Home has         translated directly into         household-level changes in behaviour is exemplified in the 2011 case         study of the Cayley         Family, as presented on the 10:10 Global website.
They say: `We're           tackling this as a           family, and we're always searching for new ways to cut carbon           together.
We aren't           extremists by any account, but I really do believe that individuals           can make an impact by           making simple changes day by day.
We've been using Dave Reay's           'Climate Change           Begins at Home', a really entertaining read, to see what we can do.'

Your Planet Needs You!
sold over 5,000 copies in its first year         (2009) and continued to sell         over 600 copies in 2010 [B].
The book has been widely praised in         the print and broadcast         media, for example on The Hour (STV, June 2009) [D].
Between January 2008 and July 2013, Reay gave 35 public lectures,         school and science         festival talks (including three British Council events), reaching the         UK, Mexico and the         Philippines.
Several of the research outputs cited in Section 3 have also gained         considerable media         attention.
For example, the work published in 2011 on dietary choice and         food wastage ([6],         Section 3) has received widespread popular media coverage (including         ITV.com,         Independent, Metro and International Business Times, combined         circulation 18million) [E].
The study was described by the UK Government's Chief Scientist as `a           really intriguing           study and very important' [F].
Public policy formation related to climate change mitigation     Pathway: Reay's research into the role of individuals in climate       change mitigation has led to his       establishment as an expert advisor to government on these issues.
For       example, research-led       evidence given by Reay was cited six times in the UK Government's House of       Commons       Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee on `Climate         Change: the citizens' agenda'       (2006 - 2007) [G] and the resultant recommendations for reducing       emissions from lighting and       stand-by power were adopted in December 2008 European Commission       directives [H].
Reay's       work on climate change communication and mitigation has also been       recognised directly by       several MPs and MSPs over the period 2008 &#8212; July 2013.
Significance and reach:            The UK Government response to Climate Change: the citizens' agenda         confirmed that         proposals would be developed and supported under the Eco-Design of         Energy-Using         Products (EuP) framework directive to restrict standby power usage for         most appliances to         2 watts within one year, and 1 watt within three years, such that the         impact extends into the         period 2008 - 2010 [G].
The European Commission regulations         based on these proposals         came into force across the EU in 2009 [H].
The influence within UK and Scottish Government of Reay's research is         illustrated by the         following statements (both made in 2011).
The MP for Edinburgh North and         Leith, Member         of Environmental Audit Committee and Prime Minister's Special         Representative on Global         Carbon Trading (2008 - 2010) said: `Dave Reay's work on climate           change communication           and individual action has made a substantive impact over several           years.
His advice on           climate change to MPs such as myself has helped to inform policy           recommendations and to           enhance understanding of climate change by the public and politicians           alike.'

The MSP         for Glasgow and Co-Convener of the Scottish Green Party said: `As           Scotland's Climate           Change Act worked its way through Parliament [ed: this occurred in         2009], it was vital to           raise the awareness of climate science and its implications among           MSPs.
It was only with a           good degree of cross party involvement and continual pressure from           outside of politics, that           we ended up with a strong Act and world-leading CO2           targets.
Dave Reay's work on climate           change communication and individual action has made a substantive           impact during that           period and since.'
