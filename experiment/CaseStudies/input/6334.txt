     For decades the dearth in available treatments for exacerbations of       asthma and COPD has had global health repercussions.
Within the UK, asthma       exacerbations have an estimated impact of &#163;1.2bn in lost productivity,       &#163;850m in NHS provision and &#163;161m in social security costs.
COPD       exacerbations are the major cause of morbidity, mortality and reduced       health.
They are the commonest cause of medical hospital admission in the       UK, with an average length of stay of nine days accounting for just over       one million bed days annually in England &#8212; at a cost to the NHS in excess       of &#163;253m/year [5.1].
Patients with frequent exacerbations exhibit       accelerated disease progression, increased hospital admission and greater       mortality.
Since 60-80% of exacerbations are virus-driven, they are much       more common in autumn/winter, adding to seasonal pressures in the NHS.
Studies at Southampton have led to the discovery of a new drug under       development by the spin-out company Synairgen Plc to address these       previously unmet clinical needs.
Findings from Southampton's original body       of research are also shaping the development of novel treatments for other       serious viral infections such as avian and swine flu, driving       collaborations with the Public Health England (formerly Health Protection       Agency) and the US Department of Defense.
Synairgen was founded in 2003 by Stephen Holgate, Donna Davies and Ratko       Djukanovic (1988-present), with investment from IP2IPO Group plc (now IP       Group).
It was floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in 2004,       raising &#163;10.5m, and its market capitalisation on admission was &#163;28m [5.2].
Since 2008 it has concentrated its effort on the clinical development of       inhaled IFN-03b21 for the treatment of exacerbations of asthma and COPD       caused by respiratory viruses.
In 2009 Synairgen completed Phase I trials       of inhaled IFN-03b21a in moderately asthmatic subjects and progressed to       Phase II proof of concept studies.
Underlining significant investor       confidence, the company raised &#163;6m (net) in 2009 to fund Phase II clinical       trials in asthma and &#163;2.5m (net) in 2011 to accelerate completion of       asthma Phase II, conduct various in vitro experiments and fund avian flu       research [5.3].
During the Phase I and Phase II clinical trials Synairgen linked with       researchers in NIHR Biomedical Research Units in Southampton and       Nottingham, clinical trial units in Manchester, Leicester, Glasgow,       Belfast, Newcastle, Oxford, Sheffield and Norwich and commercial trial       sites in Liverpool, Cardiff, Birmingham, Leeds and Reading, as well as       five sites in Australia [5.4].
These Phase I and Phase II clinical       trials have been highly successful and have shown that IFN-03b21a by       inhalation is safe both in normal and asthmatic volunteers [5.5].
Evidence of anti-viral biological activity in asthma was demonstrated by       showing treatment-related elevation of anti-viral lung biomarkers.
In a       further placebo-controlled RCT involving 134 asthma patients, efficacy of       IFN-03b21a in preventing viral exacerbation in moderate-severe asthma has       been demonstrated on a range of patient-centred and objective asthma       endpoints, as well as confirming enhanced local and systemic anti-viral       activity as reflected in circulating and lung biomarkers [5.6, 5.8,         5.9].
Moderate-severe asthma, comprising ~10% of the asthma       population, accounts for 50% of the total health costs of asthma of which       the majority relate to exacerbations against which IFN-03b21a is active [5.1].
Media coverage in the likes of the Daily Mail, Huffington Post and MSN       News in April 2012 [5.8] reported Leanne Metcalf, Assistant       Director of Research at Asthma UK, as saying: "This has the potential to       be one of the biggest breakthroughs in asthma treatments in the past 20       years ...
This clinical trial demonstrates the potential of this       anti-viral drug to prevent asthma attacks for thousands of people with       severe asthma."
Synairgen has filed three patents [5.7].
The patent for the use       of inhaled IFN-03b21a for treatment of virus-induced exacerbations of       asthma and COPD was granted in the United States in 2009, Europe in 2010       and Japan in 2011.
Based upon these positive trial outcomes in asthma,       discussions are at an advanced stage with two large pharmaceutical       companies to take forward clinical development of inhaled IFN-03b21a in       asthma and COPD.
Following the announcement of these talks in September       2012, Synairgen's stock value rose 6%, giving it a total market value of       &#163;33.1m [5.9].
An additional key focus is the elderly population, where RV infection has       been linked with the increased use (and cost) of healthcare resources in       long-term care institutions and unexpectedly high mortality.
Ongoing       research throughout the impact period shows increasing age is associated       with a decrease in epithelial innate responses to RV.
A US patent       application for use of IFN-03b21a to treat RV infection in the elderly was       given Notice of Allowance in 2010.
Further work undertaken by Synairgen internally and in collaboration with       the Public Health England has shown IFN-03b2 has utility against       established influenza (swine flu &#8212; H1N1, avian flu &#8212; H5N1 and seasonal       flu) infection.
In 2010 this resulted in the filing of a patent for the       use of inhaled IFN-03b21a against influenza, attracting the US Department       of Defense's interest in its applicability for combating bioterrorism.
Synairgen's proprietary technology has been endorsed by external research       collaborations with companies including Centocor, Merck and Cambridge       Antibody Technology (now AZ/Medimmune) [5.7].
The research impact       also extends to Synairgen's employment of highly skilled staff: the       company currently has around 25 employees and has aided the career       development of 15 scientists, five clinical fellows, 12 nurses and four       clinical trial management staff with specialist knowledge of drug       development.
Thanks to reputation and expertise developed via the underpinning       research, Holgate, Davies and Djukanovic have been invited to advise the       pharmaceutical industry and government committees on measures to tackle       complex respiratory disease [5.10].
The NIHR and MRC has awarded       Southampton a total of &#163;16.5m in follow-on funding during the REF impact       period to further develop new treatments for respiratory illnesses (see       list of grants in section 3).
