     Our research has demonstrably changed the approach to illicit drug       related deaths.
While it is too early to determine whether these changes       in process will lead to a measurable reduction in the number of drug       deaths, this University of Dundee-led body of research, together with the       engagement of strategic bodies and advisors to the Scottish, UK (np-SAD)       and European Union governments (EMCDDA), has changed the approach taken to       address illicit drug-related deaths in both Scotland and more widely       across Europe by introducing standardised mandatory annual review       processes, the inclusion of multi-agency data sources, thus enhancing       understanding of drug deaths and facilitating targeted prevention       approaches.
Local, national and international impact             Local: The research team expanded the impact of the study in         response to the demand for improved data management systems.
In 2007 Dr         Baldacchino developed a local drug death investigation team which         grew to cover three NHS Board areas &#8212; a population of approximately 1         million.
This team developed local multi-agency data-sharing agreements         &#8212; addressing a key practical challenge to this work &#8212; and has supplied         intelligence and analysis for six years [v].
Scotland: In 2008, Dr Baldacchino gave expert evidence         on data collection to the National Forum on Drug Related Deaths [1, 2];         subsequently the Dundee data collection tool formed the basis for         ongoing data collection for the Scottish drug death database.
The         database was launched in 2009 [3].
National Forum on Drug Related Deaths in Scotland &#8212; As         recommended, the National Forum has continued to meet quarterly and has         made annual recommendations to government as part of its reporting.
These recommendations continue to reflect the findings of the 2005         Report and many of the actions promoted (e.g.
delivery of the national         Drug Death Database) echo its recommendations.
Scottish Drug Strategy Delivery Commission Independent Expert           review of Opioid Replacement Therapies in Scotland - In 2013,         responding to a further increase in drug deaths, this independent         commission, chaired by Dr Kidd, published a report [4, 5] to         government on the quality of its treatment services, in particular with         regard to their consistency and safety.
Citing the 2005 research         findings and recommendations, this report has led the Scottish         Government to launch a collaborative national improvement programme,         based on patient safety mechanisms, which aims to significantly reduce         drug deaths over the next five years.
UK: Dr Baldacchino has collaborated closely with         np-SAD; the 2005 research and the subsequent research programme have         informed UK responses to better understand the circumstances associated         with illicit drug deaths [6,7].
International: The importance of Dr Baldacchino's work         has been acknowledged by the EMCDDA, which directly informs EU drug         policy [8,9,10].
The psychological profiling method has been accepted as good practice         by the EMCDDA.
It was presented to the EMCDDA Drug Death Group, which         involves all European Reitox Centres (Reitox is the European information         network on drugs and drug addiction), in November 2012.
The consequent         recommendation was that this method be adopted by all EU         countries as a valid method to understand drug death populations and to         help translate findings into regional/local/national policies.
The experience gained from ten years of psychological profiling (the         ORION project was one example of utilising such evidence to support         innovative projects &#8212; in this instance a collaboration between the         Universities of Dundee and St Andrews) is informing actions aimed at         changing risk taking behaviour and reducing drug deaths.
