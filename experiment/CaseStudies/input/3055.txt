     Law's project of identifying and diagnosing doubtful intellectual       strategies for defending belief       systems and creating a false impression of reasonableness has obvious       practical importance.
Raising public awareness of such strategies enables people to think more       critically and reflectively       about topics of fundamental importance.
Law's 'Evil God Hypothesis', his       critique of Plantinga's       EAAN and his examination of criteria employed by Biblical historians with       respect to Jesus also raise       questions about the extent to which theistic, Christian and       atheistic/naturalistic positions are       rationally held.
These are on-going debates that are obviously of       considerable public interest and       significance.
Law's research has had far-reaching and significant impact       on popular discussion and       understanding of these issues, as will be detailed.
Reach     Law has offered versions of his philosophical arguments in popular books,       notably Believing Bullshit:         How Not To Get Sucked Into An Intellectual Black Hole (Prometheus,       2011) and Humanism, A Very         Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2011), as well as       contributing popularisations to       Blackford &amp; Russell (eds.)
50 Voices of Disbelief: Why We Are         Atheists (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009) and       Warburton &amp; Edmonds (eds.)
Philosophy Bites (Oxford University       Press, 2010, 2012).
Total sales of       these books prior to July 2013 come to 34,581.
Law's books received       high-profile reviews, including       in THES and The Guardian, and widespread online       discussion, and his contribution to 50 Voices (on       the Evil God Challenge) was singled out by several reviewers, including in       the biggest US       ecumenical journal First Things and the Polish broadsheet       newspaper Gazeta.
Law's work has also been the subject of numerous reviews and articles       published both in print       and online.
These include a Newsweek magazine article (4th       September 2011), which focused on       Law's thinking on irrational belief systems, a double-page spread       interview in New Scientist       magazine (13th June 2011), an article in the `Life and Style'       section of The Hindu newspaper (29th       March 2012, circulation 1.5 million) and an interview on irrationality in       the Swedish national       newspaper Dagens Nyheter (13th November 2012).
These       few examples display the geographical       reach that Law's ideas have had, as well as their relevance to and impact       within a variety of religious       and cultural contexts.
Law's research has also been made accessible to the public via the       publication of ideas and       papers on his blogs.
These have received a cumulative total of over       961,000 views and generated       around 15,000 comments since 2008.
On his academic blog, `The Evil God       Challenge' has been the       most popular &#8212; accessed over 4,000 times; on his main blog, `Evidence,       Miracles and the Existence       of Jesus' has been accessed 23,390 times.
His main blog is accessed from       around the world, most       notably the US, but it also draws significant traffic from Germany (30,000       views), Russia (9,000       views), and India (4,000 views).
The publication of material relating to Law's academic research has       promoted impassioned but       content-driven and content-focused discussion from those inside and       outside academia, inside and       outside religious traditions, and from a number of different countries.
Explicit discussion of Law's       central claims and arguments appears on over 90 blogs and websites with a       cumulative total of over       11,000 comments.
Discussions range from Bayesian logic to how Law's       challenges might be       incorporated into Quaker praxis, demonstrating the variety of debates and       audiences Law's research       impacts upon.
One example is Reasonable Faith, the website of       William Lane Craig, recognised as       one of the world's leading apologetic Christian theologians.
Craig has       published a number of articles       online engaging directly with Law's work, notably on the Evil God       Hypothesis and the historicity of       Jesus.
The website receives an average of 500,000 visitors per month and       articles directly engaging       Law's work are viewed an average of 1,230 times a month.
A second example       is Right Reason, the       website of Dr Glenn Peoples, a Christian philosopher.
Peoples has written       about Law's Evil God       Hypothesis, and recorded a podcast discussing it.
The podcast has been       downloaded 2,670 times       and generated 95 comments.
A third example, Why Evolution is True,       is the website of Dr Jerry A.       Coyne, a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the       University of Chicago.
Coyne       is an atheist who has published analyses of Law's `The Evil God       Hypothesis' and `Evidence,       Miracles and the Existence of Jesus'.
These pieces have generated 285       comments.
Finally, The         Malcontent's Gambit is the personal website of Alan Litchfield, a       layperson with a background in       technical journalism, who hosts podcasts in the interest of promoting       secularism.
Litchfield's podcast       featuring Law has been downloaded 26,077 times.
The websites of Craig,       Peoples, Coyne and       Litchfield serve as examples for many other blogs and websites where       discussion of Law's ideas       can be found.
They demonstrate that discussion has been generated on both       sides of the       theism/atheism debate and has engaged people from a number of different       disciplines and       backgrounds, professional and lay.
Law's research has also found a       platform in 51 YouTube videos,       with a cumulative total of 279,408 views, 11,300 comments, and 3,580       'likes'.
Multiple audio       recordings and podcasts are accessible online, with cumulative downloads       in excess of 397,500.
These are largely recordings of public lectures or debates that Law has       participated in, but also       include independent third-party discussion of his ideas.
Law has presented his research concerning the rationality of theism and       atheism/naturalism,       especially `The Evil God Challenge', in numerous public forums in the UK       and abroad.
These have       included lectures and debates presented in collaboration with high-profile       universities and institutes,       and lectures to schools and non-institutional societies.
He has spoken to       over 4,600 school children,       and the cumulative total for audience figures for other talks and       discussions since 2008 exceeds       2,250 (excluding those mentioned below).
One example of a high-profile       talk is Law's debate with       Craig in Westminster Hall in October 2011 as part of Craig's Reasonable         Faith tour, which was       discussed extensively in the media.
BBC Radio 4, The Daily Mail       and The Telegraph all gave the       debate prior mention, and Law's Evil God Challenge was singled out for       mention afterwards in The         Independent.
The debate, in front of an audience of 1,900, was       broadcast on Premier Christian       Radio, and discussed and referenced extensively online, including in       numerous blog posts, reviews,       and even argument maps.
The audio and video recordings of the debate have       been accessed over       37,881 times.
A further example is Law's discussion with Richard Dawkins       in the Sheldonian       Theatre in February 2013 to a full house exceeding 500, in which Law again       drew significantly on his       research.
The discussion has been made available in a number of places on       YouTube.
The full       videoed discussion has been viewed 116,482 times, generating 1,344       comments and 1,385 `likes'.
A final example of the reach of Law's research into the rationality of       belief systems is Law's       public voice in the debate regarding potentially problematic beliefs       within school curricula, as seen in       his piece for Channel 4's 4Thought TV (22 November 2011) on the       teaching of Young Earth       Creationism in schools.
Significance     The significance of Law's impact is evidenced by public recognition of       his work, notably:     (i) Humanism, A Very Short Introduction was the winner of the       $1,000 Morris D. Forkasch award for       Best Humanist Book of 2011.
Shortly after its publication, Law was elected       a Laureate of the       International Academy of Humanism.
(ii) Law's many public appearances have all been by invitation.
He has       had repeat invitations to       appear on BBC television and radio programmes, such as The Big         Questions, Steve Wright in the         Afternoon and others (with cumulative viewing/listening figures of       over 1,348,000).
He has been       invited to contribute multiple times to Oxford THINK week.
He has had       repeat appearances on       Closer to Truth, an increasingly influential television series and       award-winning online media archive       concerned with 'cosmos, consciousness and God', currently broadcast on       around 170 US public       television stations and in several other countries.
Total monthly viewings       of Closer to Truth in       January 2013 was recorded at 184,994,020.
Law has had repeat invitations       to speak on       Unbelievable, an award-winning programme hosted by Premier       Christian Radio which aims to       promote conversation between Christians and non-Christians on topics       concerned with the viability       of the Christian faith, with an average weekly listening audience of       138,000.
(iii) Law's Evil God Hypothesis is becoming increasingly established in       the accepted catalogue of       arguments for atheism.
Evidencing this, the University of Cambridge's Investigating         Atheism website       includes a version of the Evil God Hypothesis alongside well-established       arguments for atheism.
In       The Huffington Post (8 June 2013), Nathan Schneider's `10 Proofs       That Will Change How You Think       About God' put Law's Evil God Hypothesis number four on his list.
(iv) Law regularly receives emails, comments and tweets from members of       the public, which include       testimonies of how his work has impacted their philosophical studies,       their need for teaching       resources and their personal intellectual journeys regarding the question       of theism/atheism and       related issues.
The following examples are indicative:             I've used your evil God hypothesis often with A level           students-always well received.
(Paula         Saunders, St Albans, UK)        I was a student when [the evil god challenge] was put forward to           me, by you, at one of           Heythrop's seminars for a-level students.
I think I was 17...
It has           had a large impact on me           personally, educationally and vocationally.
Much appreciation for           that.
(Phil Carter, UK)        I just read Believing Bullshit &#8212; and I absolutely loved it.
I did not put it down at all &#8212; I even missed           an episode of Glee so I could continue reading!
(D. Spina,         Australia)        I am slowly integrating quite a bit of your material into my           teaching of Year 13's doing the OCR           Philosophy of Religion and Religious Ethics courses at 'A' Level.
(Jonny,         UK)        I often come across the Evil God Challenge online, especially since           the debate with William Lane           Craig.
Craig was flustered.
I think that was because EGC is a genuine           advance on previous           formulations of the problem of evil.
(Tony Lloyd, UK)        I thought I'd already heard all the arguments concerning God and           Christianity, and was pretty           well bored with the subject.
I'm glad I decided to listen to one more           debate.
My full appreciation           of the merits and depth of the EGC took some further reading on           Stephen's blog.
There was           much more to it, it was far more robust than I could take in when I           heard it in real time listening to           the debate recording.
No wonder theists and atheists continue to           discuss this argument.
It's been           added to the canon, it's here to stay!
(Greg Burke)        I'm looking forward to your next book, Believing Bullshit,           and hoping I can find a way of           incorporating into my teaching!
(Jeffrey Canton, Lecturer,         Children's Studies program, York         University, Toronto)        I'm a science professor in Brazil, and I like to discuss with my           students how important it is to           think clearly, not only in science, but in all areas of our lives...
I           consider Believing Bullshit one of           the best books I've read about critical thinking.
(Guilherme         Guzzo, Caxias do Sul, Brazil)
