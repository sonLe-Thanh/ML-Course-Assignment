             Gene stimulation (Osteostimulation): The fact that critical         concentrations of dissolution         products stimulated bone cells to produce more bone matrix.
This led to         use of the term         "Osteostimulation" by NovaBone Products, which described to surgeons how         NovaBone&#174;         performed better than its competitors, leading to a 20% increase in         sales.
The Vice President Research &amp; Development at NovaBone Products LLC         states:       "...the work conducted by Dr Larry Hench and yourself, in           collaboration with Professor Dame           Julia Polak, carried out from 1998-2002..., enabled NovaBone Products           to provide scientific           data to the FDA to support claims of "Osteostimulation" for our           products.
More specifically, the           studies conducted at the Imperial College London were essential to the           development and           definition of the concept of Osteostimulation which is now understood           among orthopaedic           surgeons and researchers as the activation of the genes responsible           for osteoblast           differentiation and proliferation.
In addition, the Osteostimulation           studies that you have           conducted provided NovaBone with an important marketing advantage over           our competitors           that claim their products to be osteoconductive.
This advantage has           allowed NovaBone to           increase sales by more than 20% since the claim of Osteostimulation           was allowed by the FDA.
As you may be aware, NovaBone is available in more than 80 countries           and has been used in           more than 1 million patients worldwide with significant growth           expected to continue well into the           foreseeable future."

Biomineralisation: The fact that dissolution products within a         material stimulated         biomineralisation led David Greenspan, who was previously Hench's PhD         student, to develop a         toothpaste containing bioactive glass particles to treat         hypersensitivity.
The product was named         NovaMin&#174;.
David Greenspan, Vice-President for Research at US Biomaterials and then       at NovaMin       Technology Inc. states:     "The research that we funded at lmperial focused on materials           characterization (dissolution and           bioactivity) and cellular response.
A key aim was to determine           mechanisms behind why           bioactive glass was performing so well in vivo in terms of rate of           bone bonding.
Collaborations           between Larry Hench and Professor Dame Julia Polak led to in vitro           studies (e.g.
J Biomed           Mater Res 2001.55: 151-157) that revealed that the dissolution           products of the bioactive glass           stimulated cells at the genetic level.
Glass characterization studies           that we funded focused on           understanding how bioactive glass type (sol-gel v melt-derived),           particle size, specific surface           area and dissolution media type affected the rate of dissolution and           apatite formation (J           Biomed Mater Res B, 2001,58B:734-740 and J Biomed Mater Res A           2002:61A: 301-311)."
"The study of how the dose (concentration) of bioactive glass           affected its dissolution and           bioactivity (J Biomed Mater Res B 20A58P.72A-726) was also important           work.
These data,           along with other studies that we conducted, contributed to our           confidence that relatively small           particles used in NovaMin would be appropriate, and that we could           achieve an effective loading           of NovaMin in the toothpaste.

was acquired by           GlaxoSmithKline in           December 2009 for $135 million" [E].
Clinical studies show brushing with toothpaste containing         NovaMin&#174; can: reverse early tooth         decay; eliminate hot and cold sensitivity and kill more bacteria that         cause gum disease than         standard toothpaste.
GSK acquired NovaMin&#174; in 2009         for $135M.
Sensodyne Repair and           Protect was launched in 2011 in over 20 countries including most         of the EU.
Sensodyne Repair and Protect has, since its launch in         2011, been purchased by almost 1.5m         UK households and is worth &#163;10m in the UK market alone [A].
It has         achieved 2.7% share of         the total toothpaste market and became the number one toothpaste launch         in 2011 based on         the first 16 weeks of sales.
Sensodyne Repair and Protect has         won Product of the Year 2012 in         the Toothpaste category and numerous packaging awards including The         Grocer Gramia         Awards 2011, Packaging of the Year, [A] and won Product of the Year in         2013 [B].
Sensodyne         bucks the trend in consumer products as a GSK press release indicates...         "However,           toothpaste performance was particularly strong in the quarter:           Sensodyne delivered double           digit growth (+14%) driven largely by the successful rollout of           Sensodyne Repair and Protect."
This contributed to a consumer healthcare turnover of &#163;1.277Bn in Q2         2011 of which oral         Healthcare comprised &#163;425M.
NovaMin&#174; achieved considerable recognition         prior to acquisition         by GSK [C].
