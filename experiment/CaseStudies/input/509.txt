     Developing countries, especially in Africa, have struggled with the       colonial legacies of dual       systems of formal and customary tenure, whereby only a minority had secure       property rights       recognised by the state, and the majority accessed land under insecure and       unrecognised       customary arrangements, at risk of expropriation by the state or       traditional leaders.
Post-independence,       individual land titling, based on colonial models, favoured the interests       of local and       national elites and proved too costly and cumbersome to roll out on a       large scale.
NRI's research       identified alternative ways of increasing tenure security through       registration of collective and group       rights, establishment of decentralised land boards, and assistance to land       management by       customary authorities.
These can be used to formalise existing land rights       and improve existing       tenure and management systems, instead of undermining and replacing them.
NRI's research has       helped achieve consensus on effective approaches by influencing       international and national bodies       and working closely with local organisations to pilot solutions.
These       methods have demonstrably       improved the lives of rural land users in several African countries.
The impacts listed below were initiated by a landmark, NRI-organised,       DFID-funded international       conference in 1999; following this NRI also facilitated development of an       African network and       further work was presented at a series of conferences organised by the       group in Africa and UK.
Shaping land policy of African governments and pan-African bodies       The team advised the African Union, UNECA and African Development Bank's Land         Policy         Initiative (LPI): Quan was principal author of the background paper       and draft policy framework.
The       team helped establish an African Task Force and regional consultations       which finalised the Land       Policy Framework and Guidelines, endorsed by African governments and       formally adopted by the       African Union in 2009 (AUC, UNECA and AfDB 2010).
NRI's inputs were       seminal in incorporating       research findings on legitimacy of indigenous land tenure systems, the       economic context of       agricultural and urban growth, development of effective land       administration systems, gender and       common property rights, and workable land policy processes into a key       pan-African policy       document that addressed land as one of the most fraught and complex policy       issues, fundamental       to Africa's development.
The beneficiaries are African Governments, civil       society organisations,       private investors, and indirectly, the mass of ordinary land users.
Quan       continues to advise the LPI       in rolling out implementation of the policy guidelines and specifically in       addressing governance and       capacity development issues in the context of large scale land       acquisitions.
Informing and influencing policy and practice of international         agencies       NRI presented research findings to a series of Annual World Bank Land       Conferences, organised       an African debate, provided independent input for the World Bank's review       of land policy, and       developed principles on donor engagement with land for the EU.
As a result       NRI research       influenced two landmark documents that signalled decisive policy shifts on       land tenure in       international development, and have had lasting influence: the World       Bank's Policy Research       Report on Land Policies (Deininger 2003), and the European Union's Land       Policy Guidelines       http://bit.ly/IeWFsu.
These remain in       force and are flagged on EuropeAid's Agriculture and Rural       Development webpage (http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/rural-development/index_en.htm).
NRI       helped develop policy and technical guidelines on land and rural       development for FAO       (http://www.fao.org/sd/2003/IN0501_en.htm),       also contributing one of the only research papers on       land tenure and climate change in 2008 (Quan and Dyer 2008).
The team       contributed to agency       staff training and policy development, and addressed high profile       international events, including the       2006 FAO Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development in Brazil,       and a 2009 assembly       of ambassadors to the EU.
In 2008, Quan synthesised research findings for a key UN-Habitat and       Global Land Tool Network       (GLTN) policy document on urban and rural land, Secure Land Rights for         All, which cites the       team's findings extensively, showing the importance of securing land       rights through multiple tenure       options rather than an exclusive focus on individual land titling in       reversing social exclusion and       reducing inequality.
The document has been widely cited and continues to       orient the 2012-17       GLTN programme.
Quan also helped develop indicators for social,       environmental and governance       outcomes of land policies for the World Bank, part of the basis for       continuing work on a global       framework for improved land governance (see http://go.worldbank.org/HY9RUE0PQ0).
Proposed       targets on tenure security put forward for the post-2015 development       agenda by an expert group       with representation of donors and global civil society build on the       conceptual underpinnings of the       2008 UN-Habitat publication and the contributions of the research       undertaken and coordinated by       NRI.
The impacts of NRI's work on the EU Guidelines, AU Land Policy       Initiative and UN-Habitat's       publication on land, alongside the earlier collaboration with FAO, have       all fed into the Voluntary       Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and       Forests in the Context of       National Food Security (http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-Guidelines/en/)       published by FAO       and the Committee on World Food Security.
These have now become a key       point of reference for       global debates on land tenure and governance, in the context of the       post-2015 development agenda.
Improving livelihoods of land users through UK and other aid         programmes       The research had direct impact on UK policy and practice, influencing the       1998 White Paper on       International Development, ensuring that the importance of land for the       livelihoods of women and       vulnerable groups, and need for open land policy reform processes, were       incorporated into DFID       policy.
The team provided technical advice to DFID land reform programmes       in Malawi, South       Africa, Rwanda Tanzania, Uganda, and also Guyana, and to other agencies'       programmes in       Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Niger.
NRI played a central role in the       successful design and       implementation of several innovative land projects, which can be traced to       the research and       collaborative platform coordinated by NRI:            The Mozambique Community Land Initiative (iTC - 2006-2014), which         provided tenure security         for some 250 communities and 350 producer associations, now using land         for productive         projects and benefiting almost 1 million customary land users.
Establishing over 30 Customary Land Secretariats linked to the formal         land administration         system in Ghana (2005-2009) through DFID funding of the World Bank Land         Administration         Project, leading to more orderly land transactions, and enhanced         security for growing         populations in and around Ghana's expanding major cities.
