     A major feature or our heath/moorland research throughout has been the       development of an evidence-based framework that guides policy development       that is of direct use to land managers.
Development of novel practices in lowland heath restoration at         Minsmere, Suffolk (1993-2002)     Marrs' experimental research on both cereal cropping to deplete soil       nutrients and specifically on soil acidification, provided the       underpinning methods allowing the RSPB to implement acid-grassland and       heathland restoration at the landscape-scale on former arable land       (1999-present) at their flagship reserve.
This restoration linked up       existing patches of good quality habitat and conservation value e.g.
recovery of silver-studded blue and Stone curlew populations; this       resulted in a significant improvement in the conservation of the       landscape, which was reported by RSPB staff in British Wildlife describing       the RSPB's restoration program on lowland heathland on the Suffolk coast;       six of the 11 cited references were produced by Marrs' group and the soil       chemical data quoted in the paper are their results.
This improvement in       conservation value was further recognized by the award of the Environment       Agency's `Pioneering Biodiversity Programme` prize in 2010 the RSPB's       Suffolk coast project won.
The RSPB have used the overall program as a       contribution to meeting the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) targets.
The       methods developed, although geared towards this site, are generic and can       be applied to any former agricultural land.
(b) Development of methods for the use of prescribed burning on upland         moors (2005-2012)     There are several ways that Marrs' group has been involved in influencing       policy and practice.
In 2006 Marrs was the only practising vegetation       scientist to sit on the DEFRA panel which reviewed the policy for "Heather       and grass burning in England and Wales".
Marrs was included because of his       upland vegetation experience and specifically knowledge of long-term       burning experiments on Moor House National Nature Reserve.
One of the       reasons for this review was a concern over the potential for earlier bird       nesting as a result of climate change and the potential need for revised       burning dates, specifically making the latest date for burning earlier in       Spring.
This was not substantiated by evidence.
However, at the same time       the impact of prescribed burning on both biodiversity and ecosystem       services were reviewed.
The output was a complete revision of the "DEFRA       Burning Code", and led to changes in the law affecting heather and grass       burning, effective 1 October 2008.
Compliance with the Burning Code is       required (inter alia) for estate owners receiving Higher Level       Stewardship grants for land management.
This review work led to the formulation of many of the hypotheses tested       in the FIREMAN project and advisory work done since.
In 2012, Marrs has provided expert witness testimony on prescribed       burning (based on 30-years research-experience on moorlands and especially       work associated with the FIREMAN project) at a landmark Public Inquiry       (PI) run by DEFRA.
The PI tested some aspects of the need for prescribed       burning and hence examined some of the guidance within the Burning Code       (see above).
The PI was to hear an appeal against a "Notice of       modification of consent (NoMoCo)" where Natural England (statutory       conservation body) was attempting to change the burning rotation interval       (along with several other practices) on an upland estate in the Pennines.
Indeed, the preferred stated case of Natural England was to ban burning       all together (the subject of a second NoMoCo).
After evidence was       presented, but before closing speeches, a settlement was reached where       Natural England agreed conditions that were agreeable to the estate owner       with sensible burning rotations allowed.
This allowed the estate owner to       manage for commercial grouse production whilst maintaining a more       sustainable upland landscape which included a wildfire resilience       strategy.
Mr David Elvin QC stated "Marrs' evidence came from         rigorously analysed long-term studies ...
I found his scientific         analysis, objectivity and rigour particularly welcome .....
The         conclusion [of the PI] was to a significant extent the result of         evidence we presented, a significant part of which was that of Professor         Marrs."
Marrs' has continued to translate his long-term research on       heathland/moorland management to end-users through Knowledge Exchange.
Apart from helping to revise the Burning Code, he helped establish a       series of Demonstration Moors and through this implemented       "Good-practice-management training days"; here up-to-the-minute research       has been translated to end-users (farmers, estate owners, land agents,       gamekeepers and conservation agency staff).
Some of this has been done in       partnership with the Heather Trust and the International Bracken Group.
Between 2008-2012, five training days have been run reaching over 400       end-users.
Simon Thorp (Director, Heather Trust) stated that "His         research work based on a combination of surveys, modelling and both         current and past experiments, where he has an obvious "hands-on"         approach endears him to practitioners.
On our burning KE days, it is         obvious to the visiting practitioners that he knows what he is talking         about, because he shows them that he can do the job himself, action as         well as words."
