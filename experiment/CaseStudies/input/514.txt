     REBOUND targets a demanding age group in which many demonstrate       experimental use of psychoactive drugs.
The programme aims to help young       people build resilience, a "strength which helps recognising challenges       and facing them actively.
Resilience in regard to alcohol and other drugs       also means the ability to protect oneself."
The challenge is to create       materials the target group can relate to rather than experience as a       parental or social directive.
Impacts       1.
Reduction in drug and alcohol harm       UK charity Kids Company is providing the REBOUND resilience training.
The Greenwich team contributed to the training of six key workers from         the Kids Company who are delivering the course.
Preliminary results from         a controlled study showed:                a decrease in the number of binge drinking events by participants;         a decrease in the use of cannabis;         an increase in search for help;         an increase in knowledge of risks related to drugs and alcohol.

Production of films which are being used and are widely accessible       By working in collaboration with a wide group of young people, the         research team has produced a series of films that engage British 16-24         year olds.
These films are now being used in the REBOUND Programme UK         and form part of the resource library of the European programme.
They         are available on the REBOUND website and YouTube.
After using and investigating the films, course participants produce         their own risk and resilience-related short videos, assess their         educational value and upload them to the REBOUND website.
This is         building a material base for the course, and for critical public         dialogue by young people, parents, health workers, politicians etc.

Learning during the making of the films       Eighty-five young people were involved in the project at the initial         planning stage to discuss feasibility and script ideas, of whom 31 were         directly involved in the production of the eight films and appear on the         credits.
The films were produced in their entirety in collaboration with         these young people.
From script, through storyboarding to production and         final edit, the films set out to fulfil the needs of the REBOUND project         by centring them on the young people who would ultimately also         constitute the target audience.
Using action research as methodology, we         found that the prospective target audiences were more likely to be         receptive to films that had been produced by their peers.
Scripting,         storyboarding, shooting and editing all took place against a background         of constant dialogue between the production crew and the researchers.
The collective achievement was celebrated by showcasing the films at a         screening at the University of Greenwich, attended by all those who had         participated.
The 31 involved in the production of the films were         awarded certificates in recognition of their contribution.
Four of the         young people have gone on to train as mentors.

Redesigning the curriculum and programme for the UK       University of Greenwich's Russell Duke sat on the steering group to set         up REBOUND in the UK.
The first step was an Implementation Conference in         November 2011 to discuss the planned adaptation and implementation         process, at which Duke and Kennedy presented the university's research         to project partners and supporting experts.
They included six experts         from Mentor Foundation UK and representatives of the Kids Company and         Caught in the Act theatre company.
The group concluded that a cultural         adaptation to British culture was going to be challenging, making it         especially important to integrate people from different professional         areas as well as students and young people from various backgrounds.
The         steering group met every four to six weeks to discuss current steps as         well as focus group results.
The Greenwich team and young people had regular working sessions before         making the films, in which they adapted the German curriculum and         learning materials for the UK audience.
5.
Extending the impact       Greenwich researchers ran two film workshops with young people at the         Urban Academy, which supports over 200 young people who reject or have         been rejected from other educational facilities due to their complex         emotional or behavioural needs.
The long-term aim of such workshops is         to assist participants in moving into university, college, or         employment.
We are keen to develop this link further in the future.
