     Pathways to impact     The spin-out company, i2eye Diagnostics Ltd. [5.1], has put in place a       Quality Management       System to ISO13485, obtained clearance to market in the US and EU and       engaged fully with the       market to confirm strong market traction with a lead list of over 80       confirmed prospects.
Orders       have been received from leading paediatric eye centers in the US,       Australia and Europe and the       company started shipping product to customers in November 2012, only 10       months after starting       commercial operations [5.2, 5.3].
The initial value of the market targeted by i2eye is estimated at US$280M       in the United States, with       markets of similar potential available in Europe and Asia out of of a       total addressable worldwide       market of &#163;15B.
Impact on clinical practice     The development of the SVOP system meant that, for the first time, the       visual fields of the 30% of       people who were previously untestable could be tested reliably and       routinely.
SVOP is now being       used in the US, EU and Australia and is rapidly being accepted by the       international       ophthalmological community.
One customer, the Director of the       Neuro-ophthalmology Service at       Boston Children's Hospital, said "We are incredibly excited about this         technology as the first of its         kind....We anticipate that this tool will be an invaluable asset..."       [5.3].
The technique was featured       in Ophthalmology Times Europe (March 2012) [5.4].
Impact on commerce     In April 2012, following the successful closing of a seed investment with       Kelvin Capital (&#163;200,000),       Edinburgh BioQuarter announced the launch of i2eye Diagnostics Ltd., a       company to deliver the       world's first visual field analyser for children and vulnerable adults.
In       January 2013, the company       hit all technical and commercial milestones necessary to close a follow-on       round led by Kelvin       Capital (&#163;700,000).
It presently employs five staff.
In only 10 months, the company sold 8 units and up to 16 more are in the       pipeline.
In February 2013, i2eye Diagnostics Ltd. won the Scottish Enterprise Life       Science Award for the       best new life science company in Scotland [5.5].
It is one of 12 companies       that won a Scottish       Enterprise-supported place on the prestigious Entrepreneurship Development       Programme at the       Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston.
It has been featured in the       media (The Scotsman;       [5.6], in Edinburgh taxis [5.7], and has a social media presence on       Twitter.
