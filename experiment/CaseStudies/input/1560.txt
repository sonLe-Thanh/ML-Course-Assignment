     The impact of this work is evidenced by the current coalition       government's implementation of the policy on `Catapult Centres', or       Technology and Innovation Centres, which are designed to facilitate the       translation of scientific research into commercialisation and wealth       creation.
This policy was a key recommendation of the 2010 Hauser Report       entitled The Current and Future Role of Technology and Innovation         Centres in the UK (Source 1).
The key contribution of the       Cambridge team was to submit evidence to the policy making process,       through select committee evidence and advice, and provide input to key       policy meetings at the relevant government department and       cross-departmental groups.
The Cambridge input, evidenced by substantive       publications and competitive awards listed above, provided evidence to       support this key policy development (cited in Source 2, 7).
Source         9 below provides a statement from a senior government official       involved detailing the impact of Source 1 in shaping the policy       relating to Catapult Centres.
In particular, the CBR team: developed a       vision for the role of technology and innovation centres within the UK       system, provided international case studies of technology and innovation       centres, provided evidence of the impact of technology and innovation       centres.
The role of the Cambridge team `helped to build a strong         evidence base and consensus behind the report and its recommendations.
Without this, it would not have been possible to persuade the incoming         Coalition Government to adopt this policy' (Source 9).
Based on the findings from (Ref 1), the Cambridge team were       directly involved in the provision of written and verbal evidence to the       2010 Hauser Review of Technology and Innovation Centres (Source 10).
The team took part in discussions with, and submitted written advice to,       Ministers before and after the 2010 election and submitted written       evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and       Technology (Sources 3, 4).
(Ref 1) was cited several times       in the Hauser Report on The Current and Future Role of Technology and         Innovation Centres in the UK, presented to Lord Mandelson on 25       April 2010 (Source 10).
Hughes attended policy seminars and       briefing meetings in 2010 and 2011 with the Prime Minister, the Secretary       of State for Business Innovation and Skills, and the Minister for Science       and the Universities, the Director General for Innovation and a number of       senior officials in BIS, the Technology Strategy Board, and with the OECD       Innovation Policy Review Secretariat.
The recommendations in (Ref 1) relating to the identification of       sectors for TIC investment, the scale and duration of public sector       funding and the attraction of private sector co-investment were embodied       in the policy announced by the government in January 2011.
The Technology       Strategy Board would establish a network of six to eight world-leading       technology and innovation centres with funding of &#163;200m in the four years       2011-2015 (Source 5).
Seven `Catapult Centres' have now been       established in the areas of high value manufacturing, cell therapy,       offshore renewable energy, satellite application, connected digital       economy, future cities, and transport systems.
Five are running in 2013,       with future cities and transport systems scheduled for 2014, with chairman       and chief executives having been appointed.
The policy is set to expand in       2015-16 in two further areas (energy systems and diagnostics for medicine)       with &#163;185m funding added to the Technology Strategy Board from July 2013.
Making the announcement of the new Future Cities Catapult, at Innovate         UK 2013, Secretary of State for Business, Vince Cable said, `One         of the decisions of this government I am most proud of is establishing a         chain of catapults across the UK.
These are national centres of         excellence, promoting innovation in collaboration with business' (Source         8).
