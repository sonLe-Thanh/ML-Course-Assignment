       [Numbers in square brackets refer to corresponding sources in section 5 to       corroborate the impact]                Impact on public and political debate via international media         The authors are at the forefront of the debate in two key areas: (1)           the effect of high sex ratios on gender based violence (particularly           following new population policy announcements in China           and the effect these may have on gender relations or prospects for           social stability [see 5.3], or specific events such as the December           2012 gang rape in India and the way in which this violence resulted           from the high sex ratio in Delhi           [see 5.1 and 5.2]); and (2) the debate regarding the security risk of           populations with a large male youth bulge (journalists consulted the           authors as the Arab Spring events unfolded, seeking predictions for           the possibility of similar uprisings in China [see 5.4]).
Through           numerous interviews on television, radio, and in press, as well as           through Opinion Editorials and other media outlets throughout North             America, Europe,           and Asia, Dr. den Boer has shaped understanding and increased           awareness of the impact of gender selection and gender based violence           on states (The authors have been interviewed, and/or the book           referenced in the arguments of more than one hundred newspaper           articles, internet discussions, blogs, or other media since 2008).
The           Bare Branches argument has been widely disseminated and its           findings adopted by journalists, which has in turn led to adoption by           NGOs (Oxfam and the Gendercide Awareness Project have drawn on the Bare             Branches text and argument), individual bloggers (including           foreign policy blogs, see for example, http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2011/03/19/india%E2%80%99s-bare-branches),           and even a musician/composer [see 5.6] seeking to express the negative           consequences of sex selective abortion&#8212;the composer, Pia Palme,           commented that after reading a discussion on the book Bare             Branches in an Austrian newspaper, she bought it and read it,           and explained that `It was a great source of inspiration for the           piece'.
Bare Branches research has moved public and political           debate beyond initial discussions of the marriage squeeze resulting           from a dearth of females of marriageable age to arguments examining           the wider societal and international impact of skewed sex ratios.
Impact on public and political debate via international             organisations         The policy briefing, `Missing Women and Bare Branches: Gender Balance           and Conflict' published in the Environmental Change and Security             Program Report (a journal sponsored by the Wilson Center and the           United States Agency for International Development) has been utilised           by international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic           Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The OECD database, which is used           by institutions, scholars, and policy makers throughout the world to           calculate gender equity within developing states, drew on the 2005           policy report [3.3] in its 2009 and 2011 Social Institutions &amp;           Gender Index (SIGI) in order to evaluate the level of gender           discrimination and the physical security of women within many of the           states in the database [see 5.7].
Furthermore, the United Nations           Population Fund has adopted the language and argument of Bare             Branches, even referring to unemployed `surplus males' in high           sex ratio populations as `bare branches' in their reports [see 5.8].
Bare             Branches research was the first to highlight the need for policy           makers to recognise the need to examine gender issues when assessing           the security of states and thus has made a significant contribution to           understanding and practice in this area.
Impact on political campaigns and public policy               Research from Bare Branches has been used to support         international (`All Girls Allowed') and national political campaigns         (`Defend Girls' in Canada)         [see 5.9] against pre-natal sex selection, as it offers support to the         arguments that skewed sex ratios have the potential to destabilise         societies.
This research is thus affecting public debate and attempting         to influence public policy regarding the politics of sex selection and         gender-based population policies&#8212;the US         based `All Girls Allowed' works with schools, churches, NGOs, and         individuals to raise awareness about gendercide in China, rescue         abandoned females and promote the well being of female infants in China.
The US government has also drawn on Bare Branches research to         examine the effect of `surplus male' violence in China in its US         Congressional-Executive Commission on China in 2009 and 2011 utilised Bare           Branches to suggest that the large male population in China could         pose a threat to social stability in the state [see 5.10].
Bare           Branches research is therefore influencing government         understandings of the relationship between population and         violence/security.
