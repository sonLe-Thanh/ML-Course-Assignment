     i1) Polley's poetry, underpinned by Jones's research, raises awareness         of an historically remote body of English poetry, and contributes to         prosperity in the publishing sector     Polley's version of The Ruin, worked on with Jones, and his Old       English-inspired riddles formed the core of The           Havocs (the title of which comes from Polley's Ruin),       a poetry volume published by Picador.
The Havocs was shortlisted       for the T. S. Eliot and Forward poetry prizes and won the Geoffrey Faber       prize.
[S5] Widely praised in the non-academic press and blogosphere       (`moving and memorable, The Guardian [S6]), with `The Ruin' often       singled out for attention, The Havocs has promoted knowledge and       understanding of Old English poetry, as well as enriching the cultural       life of readers.
Picador's publishing director reports that sales to       31/07/2013 for the book were `around 1500', `healthy sales         figures for a poetry book eight months from publication', adding       that the prestigious awards garnered by The Havocs `draws         attention to the Picador Poetry List, and enhances its reputation as one         of the UK's major poetry publishers.'
[i1]     i2) Cultural heritage is curated when Polley's `new medieval' poetry         is commissioned for a cultural regeneration project.
Contribution is         made to prosperity of the creative sector in an economically         disadvantaged part of the UK and paid employment is created.
In 2011 Polley received a commission from North Tyneside Council and       their project partner New Writing North for a site-specific, multi-media       poetry installation in the reconstructed Roman Bath House at Segedunum       Roman Fort museum in Wallsend.
The commission specified that Polley's work       should not only address the Roman ruins at Segedunum, but also the remains       of the once prosperous local shipbuilding industry at Wallsend, an area       that has been in economic decline since the closure of the shipyards.
The       installation was funded by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport       Executive, Nexus, to the sum of &#163;15,000 [S2]; New Writing North supplied a       further &#163;2000.
[S3] Other partner organisations involved in the project       included Tyne and Wear Archives &amp; Museums, and Renaissance North East,       an organisation whose mission         statement is `to establish places of learning, inspiration and         enjoyment for all, and to be central to, and reflective of, the region's         character, culture, economy and aspirations.'
[S7] The work       resulting from this commission was to provide exhibition content for       Segedunum museum from 10/08 to 18/09/2011, and to form the centrepiece of       Segedunum's participation in the nation-wide `Heritage Open Days' week-end       (08-11/09/2011), an initiative to attract non-traditional visitors into       their local museums with free admission and newly commissioned exhibition       content.
[S2]     In response to this commission Polley decided to use as the centrepiece       of a sequence of poems, the version of The Ruin (thought by most       scholars to be an Anglo-Saxon meditation on ruined Roman baths) that he       had produced with Jones.
As Senior Manager for Culture and Commissioning       at North Tyneside Council put it, Polley employed `an unusual use of         Medieval source material and inspiration in order to bring the historic         site to life.'
[S2] Programme Director for New Writing North also       noted that Polley's involvement was conceptually `fundamental', `moving         the project away from the Roman history of the site and towards the         Medieval "afterlife" of the site'.
[S3] The texts of several new       supporting poems, which Polley worked around The Ruin, were partly       `crowd-sourced' from interviews with Wallsend residents.
In this way the       local community was involved in the creation of the project.
As the       Programme Director for New Writing North reported `Jacob's approach         meant the artwork was a critical success, but it came out of a         participatory process, which had local people at its centre, and their         self-expression was key to the creation of the piece.
This is a model         which New Writing North will draw on when developing their participatory         work in the future, and promote within the arts sector as a model of         good practice.'
[S3]     Polley collaborated not only with Jones, but also with visual artist       Imogen Clo&#235;t, who was employed for three months on the project.
`Jacob's         work also contributed directly to the local economy', with fees paid       to designers and printers, construction companies, sound engineers,       photographers and other local craftspeople.
[S2] The multi-media poetry       installation that resulted, Bathtime,       incorporated industrial-sized text-objects from Polley's Ruin, as       well as piped recordings of Jones reading the Old English poem, offering a       unique interpretation of the long history of the site and immersing       visitors in a multi-sensory experience.
[S8] Other sections of Polley's       sequence were specially performed for the audio recording by actors from       the north-east, including Emmerdale's Charlie Hardwick, a native       of Wallsend.
500 copies of a 28-page pamphlet of poems were produced for       sale at Segedunum, with revenue generated returning to the museum.
[S2]     The Bathtime project was of cultural value and significance in       itself, both in bringing the voices of members of the local community into       poetry and in delivering a poetic revisioning of its deep history back to       the community.
But it was also of benefit to the local area in purely       practical terms.
More than 5,600 people came to Segedunum to visit the       exhibition over its lifetime, generating significant revenue for the       Museum (entry charges were &#163;4.50 for adults; &#163;2.70 concs) and for the       surrounding area in general spend.
[S2] Of these visitors, more than a       thousand came just on the Heritage Open Days week-end, an increase of more       than 50% on the visitor numbers to Segedunum for the Heritage Open Days       week-end in 2009 and around 20% more than in 2010: an improvement `directly         attributable to the success of Bathtime'.
[S2] On 25/07/2011 and       01/09/2011 an interview with Polley about Bathtime was broadcast       on BBC Radio Newcastle (reach of 265,000 listeners) and garnered strong       local press coverage as well as a Guardian         blog write-up, which benefited New Writing North and their strong       regional mission by raising their profile locally.
[S2, S3 &amp; S9] In       this way, Old English poetry was found a twenty-first century application       and meaning in an area of the North East in need of regeneration, and       acted as a stimulus to the local heritage and creative industries,       promoting increased participation of the local community in their shared       cultural heritage.
As Senior Manager for Culture and Commissioning at       North Tyneside Council put it: `Bathtime not only brought new audiences         to an historic site, but also engaged the public, from an area of         economic deprivation, in the creation of new work of lasting value.
Jacob's contribution to the quality and success of this project was         fundamental.'
[S2]     i3) Digital and performance content is provided for an independent         poetry festival, simultaneously developing a stimulus to local tourism.
Historically remote literary heritage is presented and interpreted for         the general public.
A recording of Polley reading his Ruin was incorporated in the       StAnza Poetry Festival's online Poetry Trail, 	  [S10] `the first of its kind', [S4] developed in conjunction with the Computer       Science department at St Andrews, released in March 2013 and also       available as an App for iPhone and Android, as was Jones's poem `Borges on       the Wall' (PNReview, 34/5 (2008), 40), a poetic reimagining of Old       English in a modern context.
Funded by National Lottery and Creative       Scotland grants totalling &#163;5,000, and promoted by Event         Scotland, [S11] the poetry trail guides literary tourists around the       town of St Andrews by use of QR codes at several sites (including local       museums, visitor centres, and independent cafes) where the user can listen       to site-appropriate poems.
According to the Festival Director, StAnza       events and activities such as the Poetry Trail initiative, which broaden       the Festival's outreach beyond the window of the dates of the live       festival (five days in March each year), `are crucial to the success of         the festival in building and maintaining its audience support base'       and `finding ways to make poetry more accessible'.
[S4]     Further to further and develop Medieval Poetry in the Modern World,       members of the School also contributed medieval programming content to       StAnza, Scotland's International Poetry Festival: Jones's talk `Old       English Now and Then' 20/03/2012; Jones and colleagues Robert Crawford and       Rhiannon Purdie's `dynamic and engaging' sell-out performance of       the fifteenth-century `Flying of Kennedy and Dunbar', garnering `very         positive feedback from the audience and reviewers', 8/03/2013.
[S4]       Other public talks include Jones's inaugural Edwin Morgan lecture for the       Scottish Poetry Library, Edinburgh, `Here         Be Dragons: Edwin Morgan and Old English' 25/04/2012, supported by       the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
i4) Jones and Polley continue to collaborate in creating new forms of         artistic expression based on their inquiries into medieval poetry.
Jones and Polley have begun to collaborate on producing translations of       the Anglo-Saxon Exeter Book riddles in 140 or fewer characters: tweetable riddles 	  which Polley dubs `twiddles'.
Polley and Jones appeared on BBC Radio 4's `The       Echo Chamber' reading from these twiddles as well as from The Ruin,       both in Old English and in Polley's translation (10 &amp; 16/03/2013).
This is a recent extension of their collaborative research, and its impact       has yet to be fully developed, but the fact that the `twiddles' were       picked up for national radio broadcast is an early indication of their       potential impact.
They are mentioned here to close this case study, as a       coda to the benefit to Segedunum, StAnza and the reading public mentioned       above, and as an indication of the future direction of this collaborative       research and its impact, idiomatic of medieval studies at St Andrews:       Anglo-Saxon poems inscribed on badly damaged vellum in the tenth century       are recast in the most emblematic digital medium of twenty-first century.
