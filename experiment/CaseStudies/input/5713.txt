     To best exploit the original research work, the University merged the       CDFS, with the recently formed biotech company, Vectura, in 1999.
This       provided Vectura with the novel technology and innovation, derived from       the University's research, to create a high level capability for the       development of inhaled products.
In the words of Vectura's Chief Financial       Officer [7], "This acquisition provided Vectura with formulation         expertise, a contract services business, and a team of research         scientists whose primary focus was inhaled product development.
It also         furnished Vectura with a suite of intellectual property rights relating         to inhaled drug delivery from dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices".
This now represents a major success story with respect to the creation of       commercial value from academic research [8].
The PowderHale&#174; technology has to-date been licensed by many       of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and is currently used in       several globally marketed DPI products.
The most significant of these are       two products developed in association with Novartis.
Vectura NVA23 was       approved in Japan and in the EU, respectively, in September and October       2012 [9] and is marketed by Vectura's partner, Novartis, as Seebri&#174;       Breezhaler&#174;.
This product delivers glycopyrronium bromide, a       long-acting muscarinic antagonist with a rapid onset of action.
Seebri&#174;       Breezhaler&#174; is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator       treatment to relieve the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease       (COPD) in adult patients.
Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174;       (indacaterol 85 &#181;g + glycopyrronium 43 &#181;g) is a first-in-class combination       maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in COPD.
Ultibro&#174;       Breezhaler&#174; was developed under the name QVA149 and was       approved in Japan and Europe in September 2013 [10].
The mechanism of       action of these drugs leads to an increase in the diameter of the airways       in the lungs giving extended relief and easier breathing to patients due       to the prolonged bronchodilator effect.
The development success of Seebri&#174;       Breezhaler&#174; and Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; are       a direct result, therefore, of facilitating the efficacy of known drug       substances through the application of novel drug delivery technology       derived from Bath-originated research.
COPD affects an estimated 210 million people worldwide, resulting in 58       million lost workdays each year.
The disease is the fourth leading cause       of death in the U.S. [11], and it has been calculated that the annual       economic cost of COPD is over $30B.
As easy-to-use, cost-effective       bronchodilators, with rapid onset of action for fast symptom relief,       Seebri&#174; Breezhaler&#174; and Ultibro&#174;       Breezhaler&#174; are significant therapeutic advances in this area.
The products afford greater treatment options for the physician through       the provision of better COPD management.
The improved therapy possible       with Seebri&#174; Breezhaler&#174; and Ultibro&#174;       Breezhaler&#174; has been demonstrated to result in patient benefit       [10] and, as a consequence, one may anticipate added social and economic       benefit as well.
The EU and Japanese approvals of Seebri Breezhaler&#174; and       Ultibro&#174; Breezhaler&#174; have each triggered milestone       payments under the collaboration agreement with Novartis and further       substantial milestone payments are anticipated, in addition to royalties       on sales [10,12].
The Chief Financial Officer of Vectura affirms that [7],       "To date, Vectura has received $52.5M from Novartis and, under the         terms of the licence agreement, could receive up to an additional $135M         upon achievement of regulatory and commercialisation targets for both         products".
In addition to delivering new medical therapies, Vectura is a remarkable       commercial and business triumph.
After several productive years, Vectura       completed a successful IPO and floatation on to the London Stock Exchange       Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in 2004.
This floatation raised &#163;20.1M       and placed the company's initial market capitalisation at around &#163;60M       [13,14].
In 2006, the acquisition of Innovata Biomed created the UK's       largest biotech company at that time [15].
The addition of Innovata       brought additional capability and capacity in the pulmonary products       arena, adding new formulation technologies and devices to the Vectura       portfolio [16].
The company has provided key employment opportunities for skilled       scientific, ancillary support and administration staff in the Chippenham,       Cambridge and Nottingham areas, and it has contributed significantly to       the development of the South-West science base.
Vectura has grown from 35       staff in 1999 to over 250 employees by 2009; the majority are science       graduates, with many of them recruited locally from the South-West.
The       company has invested in a 1,300 m2 state-of-the-art facility       specifically designed for the manufacture of inhaled products.
Vectura's       acquisitions have enabled the creation of a significant pipeline of       products, comprising 5 other approved dry powder inhalers, which are       marketed across the globe [12].
Furthermore, the company has strengthened       its revenue base by diversification (i.e., it is no longer simply an       inhalation-only organisation), and it now also has a strong presence in       other sectors with ADVATE&#174; for haemophilia A, Extraneal&#174;       for peritoneal dialysis, and Adept&#174; for prevention of surgical       adhesions, three products which have all been licensed to Baxter       Healthcare [12].
In 2012, Vectura posted annual revenues of &#163;33M.
Major pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), continue       to draw upon the original Bath research and resulting technology,       demonstrating its sustained impact on the use of dry powder inhalers.
In       2010, Vectura signed a collaboration agreement with GSK [12,17] worth &#163;20M       in stage payments, and royalties of greater than &#163;10M per year, for the       use of Vectura dry powder drug formulation intellectual property for       late-stage development compounds in GSK's respiratory product pipeline.
The New Drug Application for the GSK's BREO&#8482; ELLIPTA&#8482; (fluticasone       furoate/vilanterol 100/25 &#181;g) was approved by FDA in May, 2013 [19].
This       will be the first product to be launched by GSK that will use patents       covered by the agreement.
A second GSK combination product, similarly       protected by the agreement, has also been filed for approval in the US,       Europe and Japan [18].
In summary, the Vectura story demonstrates both reach, with regional,       national and global impact, and significance, insofar that it has led to       the creation of novel medicines, supported the evolution of a successful       new enterprise, realised important therapeutic and economical benefits,       and enabled the translation of basic pharmaceutical science into obvious       benefit for the patient.
This conclusion is succinctly captured by       Vectura's Chief Financial Officer [7]: "As a result of both the         inventions acquired from the University of Bath, and the subsequent         development of the technologies, Vectura has become a high-value company         recognised for innovation in the development of pharmaceutical therapies         for the treatment of airway-related diseases".
