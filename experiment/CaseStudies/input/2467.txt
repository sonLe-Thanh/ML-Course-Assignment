     Rett syndrome is a severe autistic-spectrum disorder with delayed onset       that affects 1 in 10,000 girls.
It is a childhood-onset regressive disease       that causes loss of speech and hand movement, coupled with autistic       behaviour, microencephaly, and growth retardation.
In most cases the       disease is due to mutations in the gene coding for MeCP2.
Affected females       carry a single copy of the mutation, they are heterozygous.
Males that       inherit a mutant gene almost always die.
Affected girls develop normally       for around 18 months then regress, losing abilities they once had and       requiring increasing levels of care as they age.
Rett syndrome was       believed to be a developmental or neurodegenerative disease because of its       early onset and the gradual deterioration of those affected.
A cure or       therapy was thought to be most unlikely and Rett charities focussed on       family support; the care given to sufferers was palliative.
In 2007 UoE researchers published the landmark paper that established the       principle of reversibility for Rett syndrome even in late stages of the       disease [3].
This work was immediately featured widely in communications       amongst Rett syndrome support groups and infused Rett families with hope       and urgency.
For the first time the focus was switched from symptom       management to the realistic hope of finding a cure for Rett syndrome.
The work of a charity has been substantially influenced by this         research:     As a direct result of the 2007 results, a small group of parents of       children with Rett syndrome, led by Monica Coenraads, formed the Rett         Syndrome Research Trust (RSRT), a highly efficient non-profit       charity devoted to finding a cure for Rett Syndrome [a, b].
The RSRT was       established purely because these parents believed there was now a real       prospect of a cure for Rett syndrome.
Monica Coenraads states:     "The elegant execution of Professor Bird's experiment and the         unexpected results has forever changed the way Rett Syndrome is         perceived.
No longer confined to symptom management, it is now realistic         and urgent to focus on a cure.
I formed the Rett Syndrome Research Trust         to pursue the vital next steps from this milestone".
The RSRT was launched in September 2008 and has so far raised over $15M,       93% of which has been committed to funding research projects seeking to       cure Rett Syndrome.
Adrian Bird is a trustee of the RSRT and sits on their       scientific advisory board.
As such, he has influenced the practice and       policy-making of the charity.
The RSRT seeks to identify, evaluate and       prioritise novel and ambitious research projects.
It is an example of       venture philanthropy, which is becoming an engine for innovation in       biomedical research.
Venture philanthropies are adopting the techniques of       venture capital finance and the strategies of business management to build       networks of scientists to work through early findings and develop       promising ideas for new experiments.
The RSRT is a member of The Research       Acceleration and Innovation Network (TRAIN), a group of 55 unique       non-profit foundations created by patients and their families.
These are       organisations with a singular focus on, and a significant stake in,       getting promising therapies from the laboratory bench to the patient's       bedside as rapidly as possible.
In July 2010, the UK charity `ReverseRett' (originally RSRT-UK)       was formed in collaboration with RSRT by families across the UK who wanted       to contribute to RSRT's efforts to accelerate treatments for Rett Syndrome       [c,d].
Two `Reverse Rett' London Gala Fundraisers, in 2010 and 2011,       addressed by Adrian Bird, raised a total of &#163;425,000.
The charity won the       'Best New Charity' Award at the UK Just Giving Awards in March       2012.
The UK charity has raised a total of &#163;1.5M since 2010 and 95% of all       funds generated have been delivered to support RSRT's research projects.
The charity now uses the name `ReverseRett' to emphasise the prospects       which arise from the underpinning research.
The charity succinctly       demonstrates the impacts of UoE research on the families living with Rett       Syndrome with its statement:     "For families living with Rett syndrome, the prognosis has always been         poor until the reversal experiments of 2007 catapulted the disorder into         new realms of possibility, positioning Rett Syndrome to become the         world's first curable brain disorder.
We believe that Rett Syndrome is         reversible.
Everything we do every day stems from this belief".
Public debate has been stimulated or informed, and the awareness,         attitudes and understanding of sections of public have been informed by         the research:     The RSRT launched a campaign in November 2011 to boost awareness of Rett       syndrome and the possibility of a cure presented by the UoE research.
Their public service announcement ran in Times Square, New York for three       months and it is estimated that 1.5 million people per day, viewed the       6000 square foot display.
This powerful campaign, showing that Rett       Syndrome is curable, has increased the public awareness of Rett syndrome       [a,e].
A documentary film that has increased awareness of Rett syndrome, `RETT:         there is hope' [f], was recently honoured with a Rising Star Award       by the 2012 Canada International Film Festival and won the Awareness Film       Festival, USA, in 2012.
It has also been selected for the New Hope, We       Care (India), DC Independent, Culture Unplugged and Focus film festivals.
Filmmaker Jason Rem was inspired to make the documentary, which features       the UoE research, after attending an RSRT charity event.
Rem says:     "The goal of the film is solely to assist fundraising efforts to help         bring about a cure as soon as possible".
The UoE research has given hope to thousands of families world-wide that       there is a cure for Rett Syndrome where previously there was none.
Rett       syndrome is also connected to other genetically complex disorders, such as       autism.
The transformational results of this research influenced the       international neuroscience community to re-evaluate their approach to       research in this overall area [e.g.
Silva AJ &amp; Ehringer, D. Adult         reversal of cognitive phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders.
J       Neurodev Disord.
2009 Jun; 1(2):150-7].
Interviewed in the February 2012       edition of BioWorld Insight, Monica Coenraads traced the realisation that       developmental disorders do not necessarily mean a lifetime of disability       to the 2007 reversal of Rett syndrome in a mouse model [a, g].
She stated:     "It changed the perspective, not just for Rett syndrome, but for other         developmental disorders".
Impact on health: new clinical interventions are being trialled with         patients with funding from RSRT     The RSRT has committed to funding drug trials to treat Rett Syndrome.
A       two-centre Phase 2 clinical trial of Copaxone, an immunomodulator drug, is       being carried out by Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, USA and at       the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, Israel.
It is currently recruiting       twenty patients.
This trial marks the beginning of a trend toward drug       treatments seeking to modify the underlying mechanisms of neurological       dysfunction in Rett syndrome, rather than just treat symptoms, and our       research [3] is cited as underpinning this rationale [h].
In a separate       development, Children's Hospital Boston commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial       of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) in January 2013 with thirty girls       with Rett syndrome [i].
IGF-1 is indirectly regulated by MeCP2 and has       been shown to ameliorate several features of Rett-like disease in mice.
Our research [3] is referenced as underpinning the rationale behind this       clinical trial [i,j]
