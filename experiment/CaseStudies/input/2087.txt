     Impact is of two types.
Most recognizable and familiar are publications directed at the informed       public, in Britain and world-wide, who are now engrossed by the Wars of       the Roses and in particular Richard III.
Many of them belonged to the       former History and Medieval History Book Clubs and still belong to the       Richard III Society.
The excavation of Richard III's remains (`The King in       the Car Park') is an international sensation.
Hicks' Warwick and The         Wars of the Roses were directed at trade audiences and have been       repackaged by commercial publishers for wider consumption, e.g.
in Hicks'       biographies of the three Yorkist kings and their brother, consort, and       father-in-law.
Biography is more entertaining and accessible to       non-academics than many forms of historical writing and has become a key       medium for disseminating up-to-date research to wider audiences.
Success       here is demonstrated by the sales of Hicks' books, Richard III       (Tempus: 2000), Edward V: The Prince in the Tower (Tempus: 2003),       and Anne Neville, Queen to Richard III (Tempus: 2005), together       27,000 sales, 5,058 in this REF cycle.
Richard III and Anne         Neville are e-books.
Hicks' The Wars of the Roses 1455-87       (Osprey: 2003) was written for re-enactors.
All Hicks' books sell abroad.
Hicks contributes to numerous encyclopaedias and directories, such as The         Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004), Oxford         Bibliographies Online: Military History (2011), Wiley-Blackwell's Encyclopaedia         of War: Wiley Online Version (2011), and The Oxford Dictionary         of the Middle Ages (2010).
Hicks has published articles on this subject in the BBC History         Magazine which claims 60,000 sales and a readership of 265,000 and       on `Henry VI: The Misjudged King' in History Today 61.1 (2011)       (circulation 15,000).
Hicks was consulted about Richard III's bones by       media in Britain (BBC News Magazine, September 2012), &#201;ire (Irish       Radio's Talking History, 7 April 2013), the USA (Washington         Post, 6 February 2013) and Chile (El Mercurio de Chile, 9       February 2013) and commented in the Times Higher on 15 February       2013.
Hicks' public papers on the Wars of the Roses and Richard III's       character, hosted at the Tower of London by the Royal Armouries (2011) and       Historic Royal Palaces (2013), each attracted over a hundred fee-paying       and historically informed audiences.
The latter paper was published as a       podcast on the Historic Royal Palaces' iTunes site https://soundcloud.com/#historic-royal-palaces/sets/richard-iii-uncovered-1.
Hicks contributed sections to the Richard III Society website       http://www.richardiii.net/2_2_0_riii_family.php#george.
In 2013, he published two podcasts for sixth formers for the Historical       Association on `Richard III' and `The Wars of the Roses', http://www.history.org.uk/resources/student_resource_6307_107.html.
Hicks' book Anne Neville was acknowledged by Philippa Gregory as       the basis of her bestselling novel The Kingmaker's Daughter (2012)       and hence for her sixteen-part BBC2 series on Women in the Wars of the         Roses (The White Queen and The Real White Queen, 2013), for       which Hicks was a historical consultant.
He will write the 60,000-word       essay on Anne Neville for Gregory's Women of the Cousins' War, ii,       to be published by Simon and Schuster.
Other types of impact on local historians and family historians worldwide       are achieved by Hicks and Holford through their digitisation of a key       source, the IPMs, on the Mapping the Medieval Countryside project.
This is academic research impacting beyond academia.
IPMs record deaths       and succession to property everywhere, topographical features from fields       and markets to mills and weirs, and the personnel of local government.
This data is valuable to landscape and other archaeologists, demographers       and geographers as well as historians.
IPMs mention thousands of medieval       places &#8212; the subject matter of local historians &#8212; and tens of thousands of       people for family historians to study.
Family and local historians       contributed to the public engagement survey.
The project website explains       the IPM system, trains non-academics in using IPMs, and includes examples       of their effective use: http://blog.inquisitionspostmortem.ac.uk/.
There are featured inquisitions, blogs, news items, and a Twitter account.
The website was recommended by the Family History Magazine       (January 2012) and The Ricardian (April 2013).
The Companion       gives further guidance.
The digitised IPMs on British History Online had       made available source material hitherto inaccessible: www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=108073&amp;strquery=inquisitions%20post%20mortem.
Local and family historians with an internet connection anywhere in the       world can now consult this material free of charge.
Impact is already       indicated by hits on the various websites: 50,696 in British History       Online (up to 31 July 2013) and 6,719 (up to 31 July 2013) on Mapping         the Medieval Countryside.
