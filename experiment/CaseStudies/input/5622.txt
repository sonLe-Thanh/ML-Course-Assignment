     Senior Producer at BBC Radio 3, James Parkin, notes: "[Dr Duran's]       research has taken her far       beyond the commercial market of Mali's world music success stories."
(3,       4) Such was the case in       her championship of the Bamana jeli and virtuoso of the ngoni,       Bassekou Kouyate.
Though an       accomplished musician supporting Ali Farka Tour&#233;, Toumani Diabat&#233; and       Youssou N'Dour,       Kouyate and his then more marginal Bamana style were relegated to the       background of the       thriving Malian music scene of the 1990s and 2000s.
It was during the       making of the 1999 album       Kulanjan, intended in part to confirm the West African roots of the       Blues, that Duran realised that       there was actually far more musical common ground between Blues great Taj       Mahal and the       backing Bamana musician Kouyate than with the headline Maninka kora       player Toumani         Diabat&#233;.
In contrast to Maninka music, traditional Bamana jeli music is       largely pentatonic and slow in tempo       and &#8212; unlike the more popular west African kora &#8212; the ngoni       is capable of elaborate microtonal       variations on pitch, made possible by sliding and bending the strings on       the ngoni's neck in ways       echoed in the Blues.
This realisation inspired Duran to work directly with Kouyate to record       an experimental acoustic       album that showcased the distinctive features of traditional Bamana ngoni       music and explore       potential transatlantic links between Banama and the Blues.
As producer,       Duran strongly       encouraged Kouyate to remain true to his familial jeli traditions.
The result was the 2007 album       Segu Blue featuring four ngonis.
Kouyate has referred to Segu         Blue as a "listening album,"       intended to introduce people outside West Africa to the ngoni for       the first time.
Segu Blue's critical and popular reception surpassed all       expectation, as it quickly reached number       three in the World Music Charts Europe in 2007 and had accolades and       positive reviews hailing       the album's authenticity and purity from publications and outlets such as       Songlines (where it was       listed as one of the 10 best albums of the year), The Guardian,         Independent, iTunes and All About         Jazz amongst many others.
In 2008 the album won two BBC Radio 3       Music Awards for Best       Album and Best African Artist (5) and the stage shows of the international       the tour that year (also       championed by Duran) were equally well received: The Guardian, for       example, gave Ngoni Ba's       performance at the Malian Festival au Desert of January 2008 a       review of 9.5/10 stars.
Sales       figures were and remain strong for a world music title, exceeding 30,000       to date (2).
As of the 1       March 2013 the album was illegally downloadable from file sharing site       Pirate Bay.
This is       significant because in World Music generally and African music in       particular the vast majority of       distribution happens through pirating/illegal copying.
Through the course of touring in 2008-09, Kouyate and his fellow       musicians further developed the       songs of Segu Blue with more up tempo and dynamic arrangements.
A       second album, I Speak         Fula of 2009 reflects these developments and includes the       contributions of special guests.
I Speak Fula too received fantastic popular and critical acclaim:       It reached number five in the       Billboard Music Chart in February 2010 (7) and was ranked tenth on the       World Music Charts       Europe for the year, having reached number five in March 2010.
Together       with Segu Blue, the two       albums have more than 160,000 plays and 24,000 unique listeners on online       radio station Last FM       as of 1 March 2013.
Despite fewer sales with c. 10,000 to date       (2), a raft of awards and accolades       followed the album's release culminating in a Grammy nomination for Best       Traditional World Music       Album of 2010 (8).
I Speak Fula was also voted by The         Independent one of the Top Ten Best       World Music Albums, and Kouyate won in the Best Artist category at the       2010 Songlines Music       Awards.
Reviewers applauded both the album and the stage shows with       positive reviews       appearing, for example, in The Los Angeles Times, New York         Times, Telegraph, Guardian,       Afropop, All About Jazz, Time Out New York and       American National Public Radio.
Indeed, NPR       hosts a permanent artist's page on its website "Hear the Music" featuring       interviews, sound files       and a filmed recorded session with Kouyate (6).
Not only has Duran's championship and sensitive production of this artist       and traditional jeli music       of a remote swathe of the Niger introduced to global audiences a new type       and sound of Malian       music with potential historical and stylistic connections to the       development of the Blues in the       southern United States, she has contributed to changing the fortunes of       Kouyate, his family and       the local community in his native Segou and beyond.
The success of the       albums she produced has       reinvigorated interest in the ngoni in Mali (as well as in the       musics of Mali beyond the more       dominant Maninka tradition).
Kouyate has used the proceeds of his success       to found a music       school in Bamako (2) and is exporting ngoni internationally to       satisfy newly-found, global, demand.
