     The research has had an impact on urban and climate change discourse and       policies at international, national and local levels.
Impact on OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and           Development) policies on suburbs within compact cities       The OECD sees the compact city as a significant plank of its Green Growth       agenda.
In 2012, it launched a comprehensive report: Compact City         Policies: A Comparative Assessment (S1), which is `the first       comprehensive report across the world that redefines the concept of       compact city in today's context' (S2).
Two of Williams' papers       (R3,7) are cited, providing evidence on the role of suburban areas in       future climate conditions, and cautioning the impacts on social       sustainability (p.70,71).
She was subsequently invited by the OECD to       undertake an independent assessment of the report.
The OECD's Senior       Policy Analyst for Regional Development Policy states that Williams'       research `provided an important insight that compact city policies may not       be a universal solution' (S2) and that `...by referring to her paper we       pointed out compact cities' risk against extreme weather and natural       disaster, which was lacking in previous draft versions' (S2), and that       `compaction may have a negative impact on privacy in the home and on       social interaction' (S2).
Impact on the National Adaptation Programme (for England) and on           Government's and industry's understanding of risks to suburbs from           climate change       The SNACC research was undertaken at a key time for UK climate change       policy development.
Following the Climate Change Act (2008), the       Government published the National Adaptation Programme (NAP) (S3)       in July 2013.
This sets out how government, businesses, communities       and civil society should prepare for, and adapt to, climate change.
Chapter 2 of the NAP `Built Environment' reports on future risks of       overheating and cites SNACC (p.26) as providing evidence on overheating       risks at neighbourhood and individual building levels.
The Built       Environment chapter of the NAP, and the Government's broader understanding       of the problems of adaptation, are also informed by Williams et al's       research.
DCLG's, Head of Climate Change and Sustainable Buildings       team reported that SNACC's findings have `strengthened the evidence base       underpinning the Built Environment chapter' (S4), and that findings on       `overheating, flood risk and the importance of community resilience were       particularly useful in helping DCLG officials and Ministers to       understand future climate risks' (S4).
He also valued findings around       motivations for adaptation actions by householders, reporting they offer       insights to DCLG into behavioural issues (S4).
Similarly, DEFRA's Head         of Buildings and Infrastructure Team reported that SNACC had       improved understanding of how to adapt suburbs, particularly highlighting       the risk of overheating, the range of effective solutions, the need for       local councils to work with community groups to build capacity, and how       adaptation has to be built into other policy interventions (S5).
He       reports that the research helped develop the approach of the `Green         Infrastructure Partnership' in considering planting, shading and       external microclimate for cooling (S5).
Prior to the NAP's publication, SPE's research helped       inform a growing evidence base on adaptation that is now used across       Government and by industry.
In response to growing concerns about       overheating from SNACC and others, DCLG commissioned an Investigation         into Overheating in Homes (S6) which cites SNACC as a source of       evidence (p 79, 80, 117,119).
Concurrently, DEFRA was also keen that       practitioners had up-to-date evidence, so commissioned an industry guide:       Overheating in Homes: An Introduction for Planners, Designers and         Property Owners (S15).
Williams provided evidence for       this guide and a paper (R3) and the SNACC Final Report (R5) are cited.
The       guide is publicly available for practitioners (info@zerocarbonhub.org).
In 2012, SNACC's Final Report (R5) was launched in London by the Right         Honourable Don Foster, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and         Minister for Localism and Climate Change.
In his speech he stated he       was: `surprised to hear such a strong emphasis on overheating as a climate       change issue', and concluded that `[t]his is an important report from       which government is already learning.
Central Government has a role, and I       will make sure that the SNACC findings are taken on board as Government       develops the National Adaptation Plan' (S8).
Impact on the implementation of `the Green Deal'       The Green Deal is a scheme launched by DECC to enable householders and       businesses to make energy-saving improvements without having to pay all       the costs up front.
It targets 14 million homes that could benefit from       such improvements and will bring large numbers of new players into the       energy efficiency market as authorised Green Deal assessors, providers and       installers.
Between January and September 2013, 71,000 Green Deal       assessments had been completed.
SNACC, along with other ARCC projects (CREW, LUCID, see       www.arcc-cn.org.uk) produced research findings that indicated that some       Green Deal measures could create problems with overheating.
Williams       (and Gupta) worked closely with ARCC-CN and DCLG, DECC and DEFRA       to provide accurate guidance, summarised in Synthesised Advice on         Identifying and Preventing Overheating in Homes under the Green Deal       (S9).
This resulted in DECC issuing guidance to Green Deal suppliers to       ensure energy efficiency measures are installed correctly so that       overheating is not a common problem.
In addition, DECC is now working to       ensure that energy efficiency supply chains, including those working       within Green Deal, are aware of overheating risk, and that guidance is       provided on homes which are most likely to be vulnerable, and the measures       that could be taken to minimise risk.
These changes mean that Green Deal       should result in effectively adapted, comfortable homes, avoiding       significant overheating problems.
The research on overheating and Green Deal from the ARCC projects       received media attention during the warm summer of 2013.
BBC News       reported: `Green Deal could lead to deadly summer overheating', which was       followed by a similar article in The Daily Mail (both citing the ARCC-CN       advice) (S9).
Coverage led to commentaries on numerous housing,       environmental and climate websites, as well as from professional       institutions (e.g.
RICS), raising public and practitioner awareness about       the UK's preparedness for climate change.
Impact on local responses to climate change adaptation in suburbs       SPE's research has assisted local level strategies for       suburban adaptation.
As an example, the SNACC team has worked closely with       Bristol City Council to develop jointly our understanding of local risks       and strategies.
The research has informed the Council's Sustainability       Advisor and her team who have used SNACC's findings to provide the       evidence base for assessing some climate risks in the city, but also to       feed into strategic planning policy, community resilience, neighbourhood       planning, asset management, protection of vulnerable people, and the       City's own retrofitting programme (S10).
SNACC has also       provided case studies of `successful adaptation' which are now used by       local authorities (via London Climate Partnership), Sustainability West       Midlands, and across Europe (via CIRCLE-2, a database of climate       adaptation projects).
Overall, SPE's research has had a significant impact on       international, national and local policy and practice responses to the       very pressing issue of how best to adapt and plan neighbourhoods and       suburbs in response to future climatic conditions.
