     Context of patient need and benefit     The population who could potentially benefit from this research is very       large: in population studies up to 25% of adults report current dizziness       and peripheral vestibular disorder is the most common cause of dizziness       presenting in primary care.
Currently, 80-90% dizzy patients are managed       in primary care, and very few gain access to the treatment of choice, BR.
Primary care staff do not usually have the specialist skills and       experience to diagnose and treat vestibular disorders, and so most       patients simply receive reassurance and medication for symptomatic relief       (though no medication in current use has well-established curative or       preventative value or is suitable for long-term use).
Access to BR       typically involves a costly and lengthy referral process to secondary care       for assessment by a variety of specialties, often including imaging, and       it can be difficult to locate suitably trained therapists to teach       patients BR.
In the first of Yardley's trials just 3% (5/170) of       participants had previously been offered BR, despite a mean duration of       dizziness of 8 years, yet two thirds of participants benefited from it in       the trial.
Yardley's research at Southampton has offered thousands, potentially       millions, of dizziness sufferers, not just in the UK but also across       Europe and Asia, free access to previously inaccessible treatment at no       extra cost to national health services.
As the 2012 BMJ paper [3.4]       concludes: "At a minimum, simply providing a booklet that explains to         patients how to self-manage their symptoms using vestibular         rehabilitation exercises appears to have lasting benefits, without         incurring any additional resource use relative to routine care."
One       participant in Yardley's BMJ clinical trial said: "Well, it's changed         my life.
I couldn't believe that such simple exercises could make such a         difference to my balance, and the dizzy feeling, because I used to have         them during the week, and I don't have them anymore.
Having done the         exercises, it doesn't happen.
So you know, for me it's wonderful."
How this research has been disseminated to the target population     A proactive campaign by Yardley to disseminate the BR booklet to a twin       target audience of dizziness sufferers and clinical practitioners has       increased the number of beneficiaries.
The primary method of ensuring that       this research impacts on clinicians has been to publish trial results in       top international journals that are widely read by practising GPs, such as       British Medical Journal (Impact Factor 14.09, ranked 6/155 general medical       journals), as well as other journals and conferences for relevant       practitioners.
For example, Annals of Internal Medicine (Impact Factor       16.73) is ranked 4/155 among general medical journals; publication of the       trial in this journal generated over 6,879 web hits during the first 3       months after publication.
The success of this dissemination strategy can       be gauged by several indices.
The BMJ paper [3.4] was nominated by the BMJ editors as one of the         three papers they proposed as keynote lectures for the WONCA (World         Organisation of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations         of General Practitioners/Family Physicians) Conference in Vienna, 2012.
Since this presentation there have been requests from clinicians for         permission to translate the booklet for use in France, Belgium, Austria,         Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Romania, Turkey,         Saudi Arabia, China and Japan.
Following the 2012 BMJ publication, information about use of the BR         booklet was disseminated to practitioners via numerous secondary routes,         including websites e.g.
NHS Choices [5.3], and providers of medical         education to over 18,000 GPs [5.5, 5.6, 5.7].
Copies of the BR booklet are supplied to patients and practitioners         worldwide by the patient self-help group for people with dizziness, the         Meniere's Society UK.
The Meniere's Society [5.1, 5.2] has to date         supplied around 17,000 printed booklets, around two-thirds to patients,         and one third to practitioners.
These figures are likely to greatly         under-estimate the actual numbers of patients who have received         booklets, as most clinicians request an electronic copy, which they can         then duplicate freely.
Patients have learned about the effectiveness of         BR through coverage of Yardley's research in the media (e.g.
Saga,         Reader's Digest) and request booklets directly and can also download the         booklet from the Meniere's Society website (linked to the NHS Choices         site).
There are no NICE guidelines for management of dizziness, but this         programme of research was the main source of high quality evidence for         the Cochrane Review of vestibular rehabilitation [5.4] which noted: "There           is a growing and consistent body of evidence to support the use of           vestibular rehabilitation for people with dizziness and functional           loss as a result of UPVD (unilateral and peripheral disorders)."
Yardley also contributed expert evidence to the relevant Department of         Health guidelines `Provision of Adult Balance Services: A Good Practice         Guide' (2009) [5.9].
