            Dissemination and engagement          This research was directly disseminated through lectures or training       sessions up to and after 2008 organised by the World Bank       (Nairobi, 1998; Delhi, 1999 - Milner), UN Economic Commission         for Africa -UNECA (Addis Ababa, 2004 - Milner), for DFID       economists (University of Nottingham, 2005- Milner &amp; Morrissey),       the New Zealand Treasury (Wellington, 2009 - Milner) and       at a public lecture chaired by the Minister of Trade in Ghana       (Accra, 2010 - Morrissey).
The findings of the EC-PREP study were       presented by Morrissey at workshops in Kenya, Tanzania       and Uganda in 2004, which included participants from government       ministries (trade, planning and transport), local World Bank and EC       offices.
Morrissey also provided a policy brief disseminated       through EC-PREP to DFID and to EC offices in Brussels and       overseas.
He was interviewed on local radio and TV about trade policy in Ghana       (2010).
The findings of the research and their implications for trade       facilitation and `aid for trade' programmes were indirectly disseminated       through a number of policy-oriented publications and through papers,       reports and workshops for the Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD,       and WIDER, again both before and after 2008.
The academic research       is also cited in the policy research of a number of agencies &#8212; DFID,       African Trade Policy Centre at UNECA, World Bank, OECD       and NBER.
The research gave rise to an invited theme paper on       operationalizing aid for trade; presented at a conference (Delhi, 2008) on       `Partnerships for Development' (with participants from the policy and aid       communities in south Asia and Africa and sponsored by the Consumer         Unity &amp; Trust Society (CUTS), Commonwealth Secretariat,       World Bank and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce,       subsequently published in 2009) [A].
Impact          The research demonstrates that trade policy reform in many African       economies may be necessary, but is unlikely to be sufficient, to support       export development because other obstacles prevent this, such as poor       transport infrastructure and poor customs procedures.
In order to enhance       economic development in these countries, trade policy reforms should be       coupled with complementary infrastructure and related reforms to increase       the efficiency of transport and other services that affect trade costs.
These findings have had major impact on international policy formulation,       including in the 2008-12 period.
For example, the research influenced DFID       in the design of the Trademark Southern Africa trade facilitation       programme [B].
An independent evaluator of DFID's trade work in Southern       Africa writes that it has:     ` clearly influenced and informed the emphasis DFID has placed on         addressing transport costs and trade facilitation in the type of trade         policies and interventions implemented through Trademark Southern Africa.'
[L]     The research influenced the work of the African Development Bank         (AfDB), which assists African governments and policy-makers in their       efforts to achieve sustainable economic development and social progress;       the African Development Fund providing finance in concessional terms, with       a recent focus on transport infrastructure.
In 2009 AfDB       commissioned Morrissey, given the research cited in section 3, to       review the evidence and policy implications on `Trade and Transport Costs'       as a background paper [C] to its 2010 African Development Report       [D], having earlier commissioned a paper by him on constraints to African       exporting that was published in the ADB research working paper series.
The high level and international nature of the impact of the research on       the policy community is evidenced by the citing of papers [1], [3] and [4]       in the World Trade Report, 2013 [E] and Milner's       publication in the Commonwealth Ministers' Reference Book [F]; a       central source of information on key aspects of policy issues for       government ministers in Commonwealth countries, including many developing       countries in Africa.
The Head of the International Trade Division of the Commonwealth         Secretariat writes:     `...the Secretariat has greatly benefited from the research         Commissioned to Professor Chris Milner and Professor Oliver Morrissey;         commissioned because of their research and expertise on trade and trade         policies in developing countries (including Commonwealth developing         countries).
Their high-quality analytical work in a range of areas         comprising intra-Commonwealth trade and cooperation, Aid for Trade,         impact of the Rise of China and India on Sub-Saharan Africa, and         promoting trade within the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries have         hugely informed discussions involving Commonwealth nations in various         fora including high-level meetings and conferences organised by the         Commonwealth Secretariat, the World Trade Organisation and UN         agencies.'
[K]     Direct impact on policy formulation in some African economies themselves       is evidenced by Milner's direct involvement in the support and       advice given for the preparation of Uganda's and Kenya's National         Trade Policies; giving advice on the content and assisting in the       drafting of these documents, both of which have substantive sections on       the complementary reforms (including on infrastructure, institutions and       non-trade policies) to improve the effectiveness of export promotion       measures [G], [H] -the operative national trade policies, post-2008 and         up to the present of these two countries.
In the case of Uganda,       Milner had earlier advised on and prepared a zero draft of the       national trade policy, having engaged with a range of stake holders [I].
This zero draft specifically included a section on complementary measures       to reduce trade costs, and the final national policy retains many of these       elements.
In the case of Kenya, Milner was invited to       comment on early drafts of the national trade policy document both through       a presentation to a National Trade Policy Workshop (November,       2008) in Nairobi and through the submission of commentaries [J] to the       country's National Trade Policy Task Force.
This body of research by Milner and Morrissey on the       relative importance of trade policy and other sources international trade       costs (in particular transport costs) in Africa has therefore       directly influenced national trade policy design in Kenya and Uganda,       and has informed the advice given by several national and international       agencies (specifically AfDB, Commonwealth Secretariat, and       DFID) to African and other developing about increasing the scope       for improved trade performance and increasing the effectiveness of trade       policy reform through enhanced trade facilitation and transport       infrastructure improvement.
