     The EU FP7 framework of the KEEP project located research in a       European-wide range of partnerships with academic researchers, digital       preservation agencies, professional archivists and librarians.
The early       research framework was developed by analysis of existing processes but       also through workshops and conferences designed to maximise `user'       perspectives.
Workshops were held to involve professional communities       directly in the design, development and implementation of TOTEM at French       National Library, Paris (2011/2012); Royal Dutch Library, the Hague       (2011); alongside the InFuture2011 conference, Zagreb (2011); Italian       Video Games Developer Conference, Rome (2011), Novotel Cardiff (2012);       German National Library, Frankfurt (2012) and the Computer Games Museum,       Berlin (2012).
These events were used to disseminate research to show how       TOTEM contributed to preservation policy and strategy: structured       tutorials, using the live online TOTEM database, were used to trial       applications from which written feedback was used to improve the       functionality and performance of TOTEM.
Conferences were also used to       advocate the use of this emulation registry, and to trial and test in       applied contexts of use: at GOPORTIS (Leibniz Library Network for Research       Information consisting three leading German Libraries) in 2011, iPRES 2011       and at Open Planets Foundation workshops.
Those present included key       figures from Portico (JSTOR), Harvard Business School, and the Library of       Congress who saw for the first time that emulation was now a practical       proposition due to the presence of tools such as TOTEM, having succeeded       in designing suitable data for the KEEP Emulation Framework (http://emuframework.
sourceforge.net/).
Utility and uptake     Delve and Anderson's collaboration with Chair of Digital       Humanities, Professor M.Thaller at the University of Cologne and Johanna       Puhl converted the created models into a form that could be used on the       Web.
Potentially, all data that is already `linked' (http://linkeddata.org/)       can be used to provide information about sharing and connecting in       computing environments.
To ensure wide compatibility with existing       initiatives, TOTEM includes a link in the file format data to the PRONOM       registry         http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx.
At GOPORTIS,       TOTEM was presented as part of a global `eco&#8212;registry' initiative       alongside the UK National Archives PRONOM format registry.
This practical       application of TOTEM's functionality was identified as an exemplar of best       practice by S. Knight, Program Director of the Preservation Research &amp;       Consultancy division of the National Library of New Zealand (http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/series/edge/newzealand.html, http://natlib.govt.nz).
Knight       recognised TOTEM as a significant tool upon which to build a future meta       registry for use in `memory' institutions worldwide.
This led to global       strategic collaboration for its adoption with the National Library of New       Zealand (NLNZ), the National Library of Australia (NLA), their registry of       media (http://www.nla.gov.au/mediapedia)       and the US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) (http://www.archives.gov/),       conducted under the auspices of the National and State Libraries       Australasia (NSLA) from 2011- present.
Delve and Anderson       contributed further to this development in Wellington, New Zealand in       March 2013, together with key personnel from NLA, NLNZ and NARA, produce       the model behind the meta-registry.
From discussions and communications with industry professionals, key       utilities of TOTEM have been defined as:     &#8226; Preservation planning     &#8226; Digital content review to consider preservation strategies     &#8226; Checking the compatibility of given formats with software     &#8226; Gathering information on platforms     &#8226; Investigational work around support/dependencies on software and data     &#8226; Finding formats; software and operation system combinations for       emulation paths     &#8226; Finding tools for working with files     &#8226; Discovering software/hardware tools necessary for handling particular       files     &#8226; Identifying software/hardware configurations for testing and research     &#8226; Identification of problem file types from legacy collections     &#8226; Working with legacy digital material not yet investigated     &#8226; Cross-checking metadata terms to ensure consistency     &#8226; Gleaning information about hardware     &#8226; Appraisal of electronic records     &#8226; Documenting the AIP (Archival Information Package)     &#8226; In the context of formats, migration to identify file formats readers     &#8226; Documenting reference environments for data assets     By collaborating with organisations such as the Digital Preservation       Coalition       http://www.dpconline.org     and Open Planets Foundation     http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2013-04-01-software-archiving-eaas),     TOTEM is being validated and implemented by the digital preservation       community, with robust data entry methods being employed.
Current projects       such as bwFLA at the University of Freiburg (http://bw-fla.uni-freiburg.de/wordpress/?page_id=7)       are using TOTEM as the basis of future research.
&#163;3 billion of public finance is invested annually in research in the UK       alone yet the full economic and cultural value of research in all       disciplines is lost where it cannot be preserved.
TOTEM directly       contributes to the sustainability of global digital architectures,       lowering barriers to effective conservation and curatorial management of       collections, and preserving cultural value through technical application       of research to preservation policy and practice.
