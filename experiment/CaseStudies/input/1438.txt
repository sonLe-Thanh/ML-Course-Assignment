     Background.
This case study originates from original excellent research in which       end-user needs have been       considered from the outset.
Part of the impact chain in shaping       public health outcomes and policy       begins with the publication of the Twigg et al, 2004 `Smoking Epidemic'       report (which featured a       foreword by the (then) Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson).
The       headline figures were used       in February 2006 to open the debate on the Health Bill that eventually led       to the ban of smoking in       enclosed public places in England.
Evidence suggests that this legislation       has led to       improvements in health in the current REF period and has resulted in a       change of attitude towards       smoking behaviour (1).
Although the rationale for policy change focused on       health benefits for non-       smokers, according to the Smoking Toolkit Study, adult smoking prevalence       has reduced from       24.1% in 2007 to 20.6% in 2011 (2).
Impacts within the REF period (2008-13)       Alongside these indirect contributions, the Smoking Epidemic work and       other MLSASE research       has had direct, significant and far reaching impact across a number of       areas in the current REF       period:-            In 2008, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) used         headline figures from the         Smoking Epidemic as part of the rationale for implementing NICE Public         Health Guidance         No 10 that focuses on smoking cessation (3).
NICE recommends that this         guidance is used         by cessation service workers in the NHS, local authorities, the wider         public, voluntary and         community sectors and the private sector when carrying out their         professional, managerial         or voluntary duties.
Updated estimates of smoking prevalence were generated for English         Primary Care Trusts         on behalf of the Care Quality Commission in 2009.
These were used to         evaluate the         performance of NICE smoking cessation guidelines in an overall attempt         to tackle         inequalities in health relating to cardiovascular disease.
Specific         attention was given to         assessing whether nicotine replacement therapy, smoking cessation         advice, recruitment to         stop smoking services etc reflected variations in smoking prevalence and         how this varied         across deprivation groups.
The report's evidence of `inverse-care' (i.e.
an imbalance         between service provision and service need) has led to a series of         policy recommendations         including better data collection, improved patterns of prescribing and         monitoring of         evidence based practice (4).
The estimates created for the Atlas of Tobacco Smoking in Scotland         (see above) have         mainly been used at local level (by NHS Boards, Community Health         Partnerships etc) to         plan and monitor smoking cessation services and tobacco control         activity.
They have also         been used to inform debate and influence opinion by the Scottish         Government, ASH         Scotland and the Scottish NHS (5).
The Smoking Epidemic estimated that smoking causes an average of         nearly 10 deaths an         hour.
In 2010 such summary calculations were used by the Medicines and         Healthcare         Product Regulation Agency in their consultation with over 250 public and         private         organisations/charities (including Asthma UK, the Advertising         Association, the Royal         College of GPs and the Welsh Assembly) on the regulation of nicotine         containing products         (6).
In the same year additional headline figures from the Smoking         Epidemic report were         quoted as part of an `expert testimony' on `lessons from tobacco         control' in the development         of NICE Guidance to prevent obesity using a whole systems approach (7).
Treatment and care for people with long-term conditions account for         seventy per cent of         health and care spending, and over 20 million people in England are         living with one or more         long-term condition.
In May 2013, the UK Centre for Tobacco Control         Studies (University of         Nottingham) used example findings from the Smoking Epidemic in their         evidence to the         Commons Select Committee on the Management of Long Term Conditions (8).
The original English estimates of smoking prevalence (and the         associated estimates of         smoking-related deaths) have continued to inform and influence policy         and debate in the         public health field.
Shortly after the publication of the report, the         smoking estimates were         placed in the public domain via an interactive mapping tool on the         Action on Smoking and         Health (ASH) website and were used to demonstrate the `Iron Chain         between Smoking and         Deprivation' (see http://www.mapsinternational.co.uk/_subroot1/ash/ash.html         for the         mapping tool and http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_491.pdf         which explains how         the mapping tool has been put together).
By the end of this REF period, both the Smoking Epidemic and Scottish         Atlas are being         used by a set of wide-ranging organisations, including health agencies,         pressure groups,         military groups, schools and local authorities to inform debate, form         anti-smoking policies         and influence opinion.
A simple internet search on the respective         reports results in at least         25 different non-academic organisations referring to the reports'         findings.
A sample of         these is provided as links to the associated websites (9).
