     Links Between Impact and Research:     The AE knowledge and technique, established entirely through Cardiff's       research, was transmitted to Mistras Group Ltd. (MGL) through two KTPs       (1998 and 2000, Jon Watson and Tim Bradshaw, who are now full time       employees at MGL).
These provided a mechanism to embed the research and       its findings in the company.
They also enabled its commercial development       and subsequent impact, through close collaboration and the final placement       and employment of the KTP associates by MGL.
Moreover, both parties have       actively ensured the continued impact of the work via engagement with       industry.
Impacts During the REF Period:     Direct Economic Gain &#8212; Through commercially exploiting the       techniques developed and refined by Cardiff University (under a know-how       licence, 2005-2015), MGL's turnover in the UK has soared from &#163;300k in       2005, &#163;608k in 2008, to &#163;2.5M in 2012.
In the current financial year the       company has recorded a turnover of &#163;7.5M &#8212; &#163;5M relating to Cardiff       University's research.
MGL is now the market leader in using AE for       structural testing.
It claims over 85% of the global market share in AE       sensors and equipment sales.
Its AE techniques are exported to subsidiary       companies in Northern Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
The current value       of the company worldwide (after the integration of Cardiff's innovations)       is $531M [5.1].
Referring to the immediate and lasting impact of the       research, Phil Cole (the Group Executive Vice President, International, of       MGL) stated that `as a result of the KTP, Physical Acoustics Ltd. is         now the market leader in the application of acoustic emission technology         to civil engineering structures.
The KTP proved invaluable for my         company.'
[5.2]     MGL's major contracts have included the M4 Thames Bray Bridge, M5 J1 and       J2 box girders, M6 J6-J9 box girders, M6 J21 Thelwall Viaduct, M8       Whitecart Viaduct, M53 Bidston Moss, M50 Queenhill Viaduct and M60 Irwell       Bridge.
Furthermore, Cardiff's research has allowed parallel developments       of other applications with large commercial contractors on both Severn       (&#163;550k) and Humber (&#163;900k) Suspension Bridges, A4 Hammersmith Flyover       (&#163;2.4M), Royal Navy Trident submarine dock, M4 elevated section, A38(M)       Aston Expressway and North Sea oil platforms.
MGL is now regarded       worldwide as a major structural monitoring contractor which has aided       corporate positioning, allowing bids for major new build projects such as       the Izmit Bay Suspension Bridge in Turkey (worth &#163;1M), Qatar to Bahrain       Causeway (&#163;20M) and the proposed Messina Suspension Bridge between Italy       and Sicily (&#163;10M).
Examples of the international contracts the company has       secured to date are the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge (&#163;3.4M), the       Anthony Wayne Suspension Bridge (&#163;1M), and the Manhattan and Ben Franklin       Suspension Bridges [5.1].

Recently MGL has successfully applied the techniques to       the monitoring of cables and wind turbines (both on and off shore).
Jon       Watson, Project Manager at MGL, stated that `the techniques developed         through the research have been used on concrete and steel bridges in the         UK and have significantly developed the UK branch of Mistras and helped         to gain business abroad and add value to the parent company         overall...Moreover, the techniques have been applied to other         fields...which would arguably not have been possible without the         original research'.
[5.1]     Environmental and Economic Savings &#8212; Cardiff's research       enables bridges that previously had to be manually inspected to be       promptly, accurately and safely monitored using AE techniques.
It acts as       an early warning system to prevent major structural repair.
Subsequently       it mitigates lengthy road closures, traffic congestion, CO2       emissions, and delays to individuals and emergency services (and the       negative effects thus caused to regional economies).
Government statistics       estimate that traffic delays costs the local economy &#163;8B/year while the       International Road Transport Union states that traffic congestion can       increase CO2 emissions by 300% [5.3],[5.4].
Examples of major       and lengthy road closures that have occurred through the need to perform       expensive structural repairs are the Hammersmith Flyover in London (closed       at Christmas 2011 and not fully reopened until May 2012, as part of work       costing &#163;10M), the Sutton Ford Bridge in Essex (closed for 6 weeks, in       August 2012, in a &#163;2.9M rebuild) and the Lovell Park Road Bridge in Leeds       (closed for 9 months until March 2013, costing &#163;25M).
Cardiff's AE       techniques act as a preventative to this and are applicable on an       international basis [5.5].
Industrial benefits &#8212; Cardiff's research has had a major       impact on industrial practises and standards.
Cardiff University jointly       composed the Highways Agency "Advice Notes on the Non-Destructive Testing       of Highway Structures &#8212; 3.6 Acoustic Emission", which is used by engineers       throughout the UK [5.6].
Moreover, as mentioned above, the techniques have       been adopted by contractors performing AE tests UK-wide and       internationally as a product of MGL transmitting the know-how it has       gained to its subsidiary companies in Northern Europe, the Middle East and       Asia.
The AE techniques have been disseminated to industry professionals       through seminars organised by the BSSM, the Institute of Physics and MGL.
Furthermore, staff from Cardiff University and MGL are members of relevant       industrial advisory groups that work with organisations such as London       Underground, Network Rail, the Highways Agency and Sellafield Ltd. [5.7].
