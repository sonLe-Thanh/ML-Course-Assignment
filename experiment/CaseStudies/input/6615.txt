              The report on media coverage and public perceptions of poverty was         launched in 2008 with presentations to the Society of Editors; the All         Parliamentary Group on Poverty; the Scottish Government; the TUC         national conference; the Association of Journalism Educators; and the         BBC College of Journalism.
The research was reported in The Guardian,         Daily Record, Daily Telegraph, The Scotsman, The Daily Mail, Daily         Mirror, The Herald, The Sun, and Metro; and Stephen Sinclair was         interviewed on BBC Newsnight Scotland.
The report has been viewed 12,908         times and downloaded 1445 times.
This dissemination activity has had         several impacts.
The Scottish Government commissioned a briefing paper         on Writing and Talking About Poverty from McKendrick         for the Scottish Centre for Regeneration.
This has heightened         practitioners' awareness of the negative impact of using pejorative         terms in relation to lower income groups; e.g.
it was highlighted in         Edinburgh Capital City Partnership's Social Inclusion News (2011, Issue         78, p.10).
The briefing also informed the Outer Hebrides Working Group         on Poverty and Welfare Reform's communication plan:     http://ohcpp.org.uk/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=116&amp;Itemid=234              Our findings informed the revised media engagement strategies of several         poverty campaigning organisations: For example, in 2009/10 the Poverty         Alliance prepared a contact list of journalists with an interest in         poverty, and provided media training to local community representatives         and activists who are now able to satisfy journalist's requests to         interview people with experience of poverty.
Findings from the media project have been used by the 'Stick Your         Labels' campaign developed by an Anti-Stigma Working Group:         https://en-gb.facebook.com/StickYourLabels.
This campaign secured a         public commitment from the leaders of all the main Scottish political         parties to avoid stigmatising language in relation to those experiencing         poverty, and to challenge unrepresentative negative portrayals of low         income communities: http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/fm-and-party-leaders-sign-anti-stigma-commitment-shocking-%E2%80%98state-nation%E2%80%99-poverty-report-laun           (17th March         2011).
This research and the related Poverty in Scotland 2011 book were         referred to in Scottish Parliament debates; and the Scottish Government         affirmed its support for the campaign in its Child Poverty Strategy         (2010, p.11).
The legacy of these public commitments is reflected in the         lower prominence within mainstream Scottish political discourse of the         divisive rhetoric of 'scroungers' and 'skivers' prominent elsewhere in         the UK.
The continued impact of our research is reflected by reference         to it in the UK Church Action on Poverty report, The Blame Game Must         Stop (2013,         p.10).http://www.church-poverty.org.uk/stigma/report/blamegamereport              The JRF's own evaluation of the PIPI programme (see Section 5) includes         testimony from a government policy maker describing the project's impact         on her professional activity as 'factoring attitudinal work into policy         formation [and] facilitating greater contact with the third sector' (p.         4).
Similarly, a Northern Ireland government policy maker described the         project's impact as ensuring that the Northern Ireland Executive's         review of its ageing strategy reached 'beyond the "usual suspects" to         those who may not be automatically sympathetic'.
In particular our         project's evidence on how damaging stereotypes can be reproduced         unthinkingly had 'alerted her to the danger of using the language of the         "underclass" - it's always "somebody else", people in poverty are         different from "us"'(p. 21).
The importance of the Community Regeneration and Tackling Poverty         Community of Practice (the former name of the Employability and Tackling         Poverty Learning Network), which has drawn upon the analysis, advice and         guidance provided by the GCU team is referred to in the Scottish         Government's Child Poverty Strategy (2010, p.51), which described it as         'a well used resource across the Scottish public sector'         http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/03/14094421.
The Scottish         Government's 2011 Child Poverty Strategy Annual Report reiterated this         impact (p. 3) and testified to the value of the Child Poverty Online         Resource, Poverty-Sensitive Decision-Making Guide and Guide to Effective         Local Measurement of Poverty, produced by McKendrick         as part of Tackling Child Poverty Locally project.
Evidence of this         impact is the increased sophistication of the child poverty measures         included in Community Planning Partnerships' Single Outcome Agreements,         as documented in a report commissioned by Save the Children: http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/local-action-tackle-child-poverty-scotland.
Stephen Sinclair drew upon both projects while Chairing the Tackling         Poverty Stakeholder Forum (TPSF) (2009-12).
The Forum was established         with Scottish Government support to enable dialogue between policy         makers, representatives of deprived communities and other stakeholders,         and to scrutinise the Achieving Our Potential strategy.
The Forum         facilitated sustained engagement between poverty campaigners and senior         Government officials, and had a direct influence on policy; particularly         tackling the 'poverty premium', fuel poverty, and mitigating the impact         of UK welfare reforms.
The Scottish Government Europe 2020: Scottish         National Reform Programme 2012/13 described the TPSF as an 'effective         and efficient model of good practice on the issue of participation in         national policy development' (p.42).http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00392200
