     The research has led to the commercialisation of new pest-control         products.
Biological       pesticides must be registered and approved by regulatory authorities       (e.g., UK Chemicals       Regulation Directorate) before they can be sold, and must demonstrate that       they adhere to a large       number of criteria (including fate in the environment, impact on       non-target organisms), and safety       requirements before being registered for use on an industrial scale in       food production.
Prior to the       work outlined in Section 2, companies developing plant protection products       did not have complete       data on the risks posed by insect-killing fungi to support their       application for registration and       regulators had no information on the risks these new products posed.
As a       result, food producers       and consumers had few alternatives to chemical pesticides.
The research       findings have informed         the European Commission on the risk assessment of BCA metabolites       generated by insect-       killing fungi, enabling the registration of M. anisopliae and       other insect-killing fungi, leading to their       commercialisation and use as an alternative to chemical pesticides.
International reach is evidenced through impact on regulatory       authorities: RAFBCA [G2] data       demonstrated that by focussing on the crude and selected metabolite       extracts the risk assessment       process could be simplified, impacting Directive 91/414/EEC and Directive       2001/36/EEC for the       registration of biopesticides.
The RAFBCA risk assessment strategy for       entomopathogenic fungal       metabolites, endorsed by REBECA [C2], accelerated the registration process       and reduced       registration costs by removing the need to test hundreds of metabolites       produced by fungal BCAs.
This research led to Draft Assessment Reports in 2007 (on Lecanicillium)       and 2008 (on       Metarhizium), with European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) conclusions         approved in 2009         and 2011 [C3, C4].
The EFSA conclusions have directly enabled the       economic impacts described       below.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was       tasked by its 34       member countries to harmonise risk assessment and registration       requirements for BCAs.
Its       recommendations are usually accepted by the 70 non-member partner       countries.
A 2010 meta-       analysis review [C5], which concluded that spores of insect-killing fungi       did not persist in the       environment, was adopted as a position paper by the OECD BioPesticide       Steering Group, which       decided to:     "refer directly to your work that is contributing to further         international harmonization in the         assessment of microbial biological control agents"       Head of OECD Pesticides Programme     The OECD proposed the review be used as a waiver for the data requirement       usually needed for       registration to show that fungal biopesticides do not persist in soil       [C6], reducing registration time       and costs for companies developing fungal BCAs.
"We believe your work has helped our members to make considerable         progress in the         development of entomopathogenic fungi for pest control"       Head, International Biological Manufacturers Microbial Professional Group.
Economic impactshave been achieved through the         research's benefits to businesses and food         producers: M. anisopliae strain Met52 (=F52, BIPESCO 5) was       registered by Agrifutur and       Novozymes BG in 2008 using RAFBCA [G2] data on the risks of metabolites       (including the type,       quantity and stability in different production systems).
It is currently       registered for use to target the       black vine weevil (which feed on a wide range of soft fruit and ornamental       plants causing damage       globally of &#163;several hundred million annually) in 11 European countries,       USA and Canada       (registered in the UK in 2010) [C10].
Met52 represents 20% of the UK       market for the control of this       pest in containerised hardy nursery stock, bedding, indoor ornamentals and       soft fruit.
As a result:     "annual European sales increased from $100K in 2010 to $900K           in 2012"       Regulatory Specialist, Novozymes BG     "Over 60,000 m3of growing           mediain the UK was treated (with Met52) in 2012"     Technical Manager, Fargro Ltd     During the assessment period, Novozymes BG and Fargro Ltd have invested       resources and       created jobs, expecting increased sales, more pests targeted for control       and registration in more       countries (exact figures on jobs and global sales is commercially       sensitive information but can be       confirmed by C10 and C11).
Total investment has "to be counted in           millions of $US" [C10]     Research findings arising from [G2] (i.e.
metabolites do not pose any       risks) were cited in Draft       Assessment Reports for the registration of the insect-killing fungus Verticillium         lecanii       (Lecanicillium muscarium) [C4], whilst data on metabolites produced       by [G1] resulted in the       registration of B. brongniartii.
The research has provided an         alternative to chemical pesticides       that have been withdrawn by the EU, helping growers to comply with new       legislation that obliges       member states to implement the principles of integrated pest management       with preference given to       benign alternatives such as insect-killing fungi.
In addition to reducing       overall pesticide usage and       helping food producers to meet supermarket requirements on minimal       chemical residues, Met52 is       approved for use in organic systems by the Organic Farmers and Growers       (reg.
UKE0650, 2013).
