     Fulvestrant: Development and introduction into worldwide use       [text removed for publication] [a] [b] [c].
Since registration in 2010,       fulvestrant 500mg has become the treatment of choice for second-line       endocrine therapy in       post-menopausal women, and it is now used as the standard arm in new,       on-going Phase III registration studies (e.g.
FGFR inhibitor [AZD4547       AstraZeneca], Pi3K inhibitor [BKM120, Novartis], CDK4/6 inhibitor       [Palbociclib, Pfizer]) [d].

Improving treatment for breast cancer patients: [text removed for       publication] [b].
Fulvestrant has not only provided another therapeutic       option to keep BC controlled for longer, but the 500mg dose is also better       than current options, providing improved treatment outcomes in the second       line setting &#8212; both in terms of disease progression (HR=0.80; P=0.006) and       overall survival (HR=0.81; p=0.016) [e].

The impact is also       increasing year on year (shown by commercial sales) and is expected to       further increase based on the FALCON trial.
