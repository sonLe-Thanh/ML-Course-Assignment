     Rhythm Changes has capitalised on jazz's centrality to European       cultural discourses, using theoretical and practice-led research methods       to answer questions about the changing Europe, inherited culture and       national identity.
Graded 'outstanding' by HERA evaluators following each       of their reporting cycles, Rhythm Changes demonstrates the       following impact:             Rhythm Changes has provided a voice for jazz research at the         European level, developing several collaborations and public engagement         events with high profile national and international organisations: In         addition to JazzDanmark, Bimhuis Amsterdam, MaiJazz Stavanger, Jazz Fest         Wien and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival; Serious/London Jazz Festival has         been a Knowledge Exchange partner of Rhythm Changes since 2010.
Rhythm Changes hosted a public event at the Barbican in London as         part of the main programme for the 2010 Serious/London Jazz Festival         entitled `Another Place?
Why Jazz Festivals Matter', which         included contributions from a range of international festival directors.
The Rhythm Changes project contributed to new programming         directions and enabled the organisation to secure additional funding:         Serious received funding from the EU Culture Fund in 2012 to curate a         `Jazz and the New Europe' strand as part of the 2012 London Jazz         Festival programme.
The central themes of the strand mirrored the work         of the Rhythm Changes research and Whyton was invited to chair         the first public debate on Jazz the New Europe at the Royal Festival         Hall.
Joint funding was received in August 2012 to develop a festival of the         humanities in London, in June 2013.
This event, entitled `The Time           and The Place', provided a new opportunity to build capacity,         commission new works and develop pan-European collaborations.
The         three-day festival showcased the work of the first HERA Joint Research         Programme, developing insights into cultural dynamics and questions of         inheritance and identity in Europe, and reached new audiences through         combining the themes of leading European humanities research projects         with new arts commissions, public events and high profile concerts.
The         success of the Rhythm Changes' ongoing Knowledge Exchange         activities has led to a partnership with the London Jazz Festival for         its 21st anniversary year in November 2013.
The 2013 Rhythm Changes Conference, `Rethinking Jazz Cultures'         celebrated the cross-disciplinary strength of international jazz         research.
Perrier Jazz Award and BBC Innovation winner Matthew Bourne         was featured as artist in residence for the event and the 2009 National         Portrait Photography prize winner Paul Floyd Blake was commissioned to         respond to the core questions of Rhythm Changes through 3         European festivals associated with the project, with work premiered in         Manchester in April 2013 as part of Rethinking Jazz Cultures in London         in June 2013.
In 2011, Salford-based Rhythm Changes post-doctoral researcher         Dr Christophe de Bezenac participated in the prestigious Take Five         professional development programme led by Serious and funded by the Arts         Council and Jerwood Foundation, which was used as a case study and model         of good practice in the Europe Jazz Network study.
In partnership with Music Centre Netherlands (MCN) Rhythm Changes is         developing an online resource of jazz works composed in the Netherlands,         the `Dutch Real Book' with the objectives of making historic and         artistic important material available and visible, facilitating the         performance of Dutch jazz compositions, new research, analysis, and         educational resources.
In 2012, the Europe Jazz Network (EJN) undertook a social and economic         impact study of its membership, covering over 80 organisations in 22         countries.
The EJN is the principal Network for the professional jazz         community in Europe and includes members ranging from Music Information         Centres, National Jazz Agencies, large scale international festivals         (such as North Sea, Copenhagen and London), famous venues and promoters.
As a member of the Europe Jazz Network steering group responsible for         designing and implementing the study, Whyton wrote the foreword to the         final published report.
'Strength in Numbers: A Study of Europe Jazz Network' 		represented a         significant step change in the Network's ability to build capacity,         enabling the network to make the case for jazz across the European         cultural industries and to make the case for jazz in their national         settings as well as benchmark their activities against other members and         share models of good practice.
The report offers a strategic overview of the contribution in economic         and social terms of members' activity to national policy makers and the         European Union, drawing directly on Rhythm Changes interview         data and project findings.
Whyton provided advice and guidance on the         design and content of the survey.
The report is currently being used by         the network and its members as a key strategy document, enabling         organisations to make the case for jazz in their national settings,         benchmark the activities of organisations against other members and         share good practice.
Rhythm Changes research, and the subsequent         Strength in Numbers report, marks a sea-change in European collaboration         and a blurring of boundaries between academic and non-academic         communities.
Moreover, the report and Rhythm Changes data is         currently being used by the network in its bid for future EU network         funding.
