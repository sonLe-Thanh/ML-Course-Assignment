     Up until 1999, whilst Software Migrations Ltd. (SML) was located at       Durham, the company employed around 6 people.
In early 2002, SML was       bought by the current owner.
The company is based in St. Albans and at       this moment in time employs around 24 people [S4,S5] (20 of whom are       technical experts).
All of SML's business is based on two core products [S1]:            The FermaT Workbench, a set of software tools that can manage and         maintain Assembler-based systems.
The product is available for purchase         from SML or can be used as part of a joint SML-customer project.
The FermaT Migration Service, which uses technology that can transform         Assembler into a more manageable language, is a service performed by SML         consultants working with the customers' programmers.
SML's skill, expertise and product portfolio enable the re-engineering of       crucial legacy codes so that these codes might be translated into a more       structured style in a more maintainable programming language without       affecting the program semantics.
From [S4]:     "Therefore, we can confidently state that our core competency is         detailed and precise analysis of Assembler and migration of Assembler to         modern languages (C, COBOL and Java), based on a sound mathematical         framework supported by considerable peer-reviewed research."
From [S1]:     "Software Migrations Limited [SML] is the world's leading expert in         legacy Assembler comprehension and migration.
We help companies to get         their core systems working for them, enabling clients to regain control         of the technology which supports their business, improving the clarity,         simplicity and flexibility of legacy Assembler systems."
SML is uniquely placed in this regard and as such is in high demand.
SML's customer base is composed of a combination of very large public       corporations and government agencies in Europe and the USA (examples       follow).
SML saves its clients vast amounts of money by protecting them from       potentially catastrophic failures and deriving structured codes, from       their legacy codes, in a form that is amenable to improvement and       extension and so that these more structured codes are much easier to       maintain.
Whilst the financial savings of such protection are notoriously       difficult to quantify, it is widely accepted that failure to protect can       result in monumental costs (financial and otherwise).
From [S1]:     "Forward thinking companies who address their core Legacy Assembler         systems are finding that the benefits include:            Easier compliance with corporate governance regulation       Improved response to business development demands       Reduced IT costs and improved productivity       Improved new product time to market        Increased system flexibility"          The largest project SML has undertaken comprised of over 15 million lines       of Assembler listings representing over 9000 modules.
SML has performed       modernization tasks for over 50 customers ranging from deep analysis of       their Assembler code to full conversion to COBOL and C (which is in live       production).
SML is actively engaged in a project to produce a pseudo-Java       conversion so that full O-O Java might be produced [S5,S6].
Since 2008, clients of SML have included US Social Security       Administration and Inland Revenue Services, US State Farm Insurance,       California Department of Motor Vehicles, American Finance Credit Union,       Standard Life, HP, IBM, HBOS, EDS, Microfocus, Royal Bank of Scotland,       Tenovis and Tesseract [S2,S5,S6].
For example:            State Farm Insurance [S2,S5], USA (www.statefarm.com;         ranked 37th in the 2011 Fortune 500 list and widely regarded as the         world's largest property and casualty insurance company): the work with         State Farm Insurance, to transform Assembler code to Cobol, was done in         collaboration with HP and the payment made directly to SML by State Farm         Insurance was around $1.4 million.
American First Credit Union [S2,S5], USA (www.americafirst.com;         7th largest credit union in the US in terms of total membership and 11th         largest in assets in the US): the work with AFCU, to transform Assembler         code to Cobol, was done in collaboration with IBM and the payment made         directly to SML by AFCU was around $0.4 million.
Department of Motor Vehicle Licensing in California, USA (www.dmv.ca.gov)         [S2,S3,S5]: the work with DMV was done in collaboration with HP and the         payment made directly to SML by DMV was around $6 million.
The work was         to transform 2.8 million lines of Assembler code into Cobol but within         the 2.8 million lines of code were 1 million lines of EDL code (an         assembler language developed by IBM).
The workbench was also         successfully used to deal with the EDL code too.
SML's 2012-2013 revenue was expected to be extremely significant with       future expectations considerably in excess of this (see below) [S4].
SML       has an American office at 3 Weybridge Court, Severna Park, MD 21146, USA       [S5].
SML regularly works in collaboration with companies such as HP and IBM to       the point that when either HP or IBM are working with a client with legacy       code involving Assembler, their only real option (world-wide) is to use       SML and this is what generally happens.
No large integrator (like HP, IBM,       etc., nor any smaller concern) has the specific technical Assembler skills       that SML has, and they certainly do not have the unique products that SML       has developed and own (and all of which are based on Durham research)       [S2,S5,S6].
SML is currently responding to an IRS contract to transform 20 million       lines of Assembler code.
As of June 2013, SML has signed a partner       agreement with IBM so that SML will receive 25% of the total revenue of       the project which will amount to around $50 million.
Negotiations are       currently on-going between the IRS, SML and IBM with the eventual go-ahead       strongly expected in early 2014 [S2,S4,S5].
This contract will stretch       over 3-5 years.
Whilst any agreement with the IRS will be outside the REF       impact window, the agreement with IBM has been signed (within the REF       impact window); this testifies to the tremendously positive impact that       IBM believes SML can have on the whole project as well as the confidence       that IBM has in SML's technology.
SML has funded PhD studentships in the past and its enlightened approach       to funding academic research has meant that it is currently (widely       recognised as) the outstanding global company as regards assembler code       migration.
It plans to continue its support for academic research so that       it might develop this research into commercial tools for the analysis,       restructuring and maintenance of code written in Java and other high level       programming languages.
SML is a real success story testifying to the       efficacy of formal methods applied to modern commercial software       development.
Not only is SML generating financial profit (with this profit       highly likely to rise steeply in the very near future), it serves as an       outstanding exemplar as to the commercial benefits and rewards of       employing the principles of and research in software engineering.
