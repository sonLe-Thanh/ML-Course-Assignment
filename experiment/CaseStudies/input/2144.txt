     4.1 Stimulating practitioner and stakeholder debate and challenging         conventional wisdom     The research has stimulated practitioner debate on the purpose,       methodology and practice of assessment and its effect on student       satisfaction through a range of processes:            Contribution of the research findings to the Feedback: Agenda for           Change created by 23 researchers and writers with specialist         expertise, under the auspices of Oxford Brookes University Assessment           Standards Knowledge Exchange Centre for Excellence.
The research         influenced the emphasis on feedback as a dialogical process and on         students creating their own feedback as a process of understanding         standards.
Invited as expert contributor to Guardian Professional Development         on-line debate on authentic assessment (2012), particularly debating the         impact of a mismatch between perceptions of guidance and marking on         student dissatisfaction.

A workshop for the Northern Universities Consortium, particularly         related to the influence of this body of research on external examiners'         understanding and use of academic standards.
Commissioning by the Higher Education Academy to provide a national         seminar on the topic: Really Useful Information!
Aligning feedback with         tutors' professional judgement (June 2011).
The research evidence and theoretical conclusions have underpinned       significant discussion in these events (and in CPD as in 4.2 below) on       rarely discussed topics such as tutor differences in marking, influences       on individual judgements and the problems associated with communicating       tutor standards to students.
It has provided the evidence of a need for       further guidance on academic standards for external examiners and       therefore the Quality Assurance Agency and Higher Education Academy (HEA)       have commissioned further research on External Examiners' use and       understanding of academic standards to guide future training.
4.2.
Influence on training and staff guidance     The value to Higher Education of the insights has been demonstrated by       invitations from over 20 UK and international universities and       organisations for Professor Bloxham and the research team to contribute to       staff development.
Training events and consultancies have focused on:            Increasing dialogue between staff regarding assessment standards;       Designing assessment and assessment guidance to provide dialogical and         other opportunities for students to grasp tutor's diverse standards;       Assisting students to recognise the tacit, holistic and variable         nature of professional judgement and the limited power of explicit         information to make tacit knowledge explicit.
This practical application of the research has been valuable to staff       involved, receiving highly positive staff evaluations and reporting of       influence on practice, for example:     "I used some of your thinking in shaping some of my own work to support       the continuing professional development of colleagues in their own       understanding of assessment."
(UK, Russell Group University)     This work to disseminate the application of the research has also       specifically influenced Certificate programmes for new academic staff,       including at Aston University (2010 -2011), Northumbria University (2011),       New University of Ireland (2011-13), University of Central Lancashire       (2011), Writtle College (2011).
The research has informed institutional and national change programmes:       Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (2009), Manchester Metropolitan       (2009), University of the Highlands and Islands (2010), University of       Sunderland (2009) and the Norwegian Higher Education Learning Outcomes       Project.
The research is cited in London Metropolitan University's       Institutional University Assessment Framework in terms of       encouraging staff to develop students' understanding of quality and to       negotiate and share standards.
A marked Improvement (see 4.2) is being used to lever       transformative change in university assessment practices through the Transforming         Assessment in Higher Education Pilot scheme.
To date, 14 UK       universities have used this publication to review their assessment       practices and eight have been selected to be part of the HEA pilot scheme.
This research, amongst others, underpins universities' plans to develop       methods to help students grasp tutors' concepts of quality which mirror       the ways in which tutors learn about academic quality/ standards;       predominantly through inductive methods such as being marked, marking,       using exemplars, discussion with colleagues and peer feedback on draft       work.
The research is also cited in guidance for staff, for example, University       of Edinburgh on engaging with criteria and standards and Queen Mary       University of London on reliability in marking.
Through training and       guidance at a wide range of institutions, the insights of the research       have had a far-reaching influence on professional practice.
4.3 Development of Resources to enhance professional practice     The research has directly fed into the Higher Education Academy       publication designed to improve assessment, A Marked Improvement:         Transforming Assessment in Higher Education (HEA 2012), through       Professor Bloxham's contribution as an author (as evidenced on the HEA's       website).
The HEA publication specifically cites the practitioner book       Bloxham S. &amp; Boyd, P (2007) Developing Assessment in Higher         Education: a practical guide Open University Press, as a       "comprehensive" resource for educational developers and practitioners.
This book was written to disseminate the early outcomes of this research       to practitioners.
It is recommended in many lecturer training programmes       nationally and internationally (e.g.
New University of Ireland, London       Metropolitan University, University of Westminster, Queen's University       Belfast, University of Bradford, Bristol University, University of       Portsmouth, University of Sussex and University of York) or used to       provide advice for tutors (e.g.
Griffith University, Edith Cowan       University, Australia, Imperial College, University of Huddersfield,       Montclair State University, USA).
It is also used in policy documents, for       example the Assessing and Assuring Graduate Learning Outcomes       project of the Australian Learning and Teaching Council in 2011-2012, and       London Metropolitan `University Assessment Framework'.
Sales of 1700 books       indicate the value placed on the work.
4.4 Use of research findings by professional bodies to define best         practice and formulate policy     Professor Bloxham is a member of the advisory group revising the       assessment section of the Quality Code for Higher Education (2013) chapter       on assessment of students, ensuring that the research underpins national       guidance to staff on good practice in assessment.
The research has       contributed to a broad perception that guidance needs to be improved, has       influenced the revision of these guidelines and led to the invitation to       join the group.
The revised guidance, out for consultation between May and       August 2013, notes the interpretive nature of academic judgement; the       importance of building shared understanding between staff and students of       the basis on which academic judgements are made; and the importance of       building students' assessment literacy given the complex nature of       professional judgement: these are all insights derived directly from this       research.
Whilst activities for students such as peer assessment, feedback on       drafts and engagement with exemplars have a history of use in Higher       Education, the research here is significant in taking the use of these       participative methods into a different realm.
It challenges taken for       granted assumptions about shared standards, which are made explicit in       written documentation such as learning outcomes, assessment criteria and       statements of standards.
To date, the impact has been on teachers'       practices, mediated through training and both institutional and national       level guidelines.
It is expected that this translation into practice will       create a positive impact on student learning, achievement and       satisfaction: evaluating this represents the next stage of the research.
