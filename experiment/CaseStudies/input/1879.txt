     The domain of the impact of our research since 2008 has been in the area       of commercial forensic       science and analysis for Cellmark, and the use of these analyses supplied       by Cellmark in police       investigations and prosecutions across the UK.
The measurement protocols       based on research in       the UOA has provided a new generic capability that has been exploited by       Cellmark.
The path to impact: A legal requirement from Police Authorities is       that all Forensic Science       Providers (FSPs), and all sub-contractors to a FSP, must be United Kingdom       Accreditation Service       (UKAS) accredited for the forensic service provided.
The UOA, through its       materials       characterisation service, secured UKAS 17025 accreditation for Forensic       Glass Analysis in 2010.
Although there are 25 accredited laboratories within universities in the       UK, the UOA is the only       university laboratory accredited for Forensic Glass Analysis, reflecting       the UOA's in-depth and       scientifically-based expertise in this field.
Key factors in the successful award of UKAS accreditation are the       availability of both specialist       research-led expertise and the management structures to deliver a high       quality service within the       requirements of the UKAS protocols.
To achieve this, the UOA invested in a       JEOL VP 6480 SEM       equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-max 80 SDD detector that was       critical in meeting Cellmark       and Police Authority needs.
By then developing in-house automated       methods on this equipment to       allow reliable 24 hour operation, and drawing on new analysis protocols       based on our research,       the UOA was able to dedicate up to 60% of the time on this instrument to       Cellmark work in a cost-effective 	  manner and with fast turn-around.
The UOA also invested in a       controlled environment       room to implement robust anti-contamination and security procedures that       are mandatory to meet       the UK Forensic Regulator's and UKAS requirements for the delivery of       forensic work to the UK       criminal justice system.
Impact:     The following text describing the impact of the research has been       provided by the Commercial       Director at Cellmark.
"Cellmark has over twenty five years' experience of providing police         forces with high quality,         specialist forensic services.
Cellmark's reputation was built initially         on the quality of its innovative         DNA analysis and rapidly became one of the largest DNA testing companies         in the world.
Now         Cellmark provides a comprehensive forensic analytical service, covering         a range of biology and         chemistry scientific disciplines for the investigation of an extensive         range of criminal cases         including burglary, assault, homicide and sexual offences as well as for         the review of cold cases.
Cellmark approached Dr Crossley in 2008 seeking collaboration in the         analysis of trace evidence,         recognizing the Oxford Materials Department's internationally-leading         expertise in micro/nano         analysis and a research-led forensic analysis track record, backed-up         with appropriate equipment         dedicated to specialised analysis.
The key expertise Cellmark were         seeking was the analysis of         glass fragments using SEM/EDX for elemental composition analysis.
This         analysis is critical in both         high volume crime such as burglaries and car theft but also low volume,         serious crime such as         GBH, homicide and murder where a trace evidence match between a fragment         from a suspect and         a crime scene or victim can make a significant contribution to         Streamlined Forensic Reporting         (SFR).
Effective use of SFR, as described in Swift           and Sure Justice: the Government's Plans for Reform of the Criminal           Justice System (2012), leads to an improvement in the early         guilty plea         rate, resulting in fewer cases coming to trial unnecessarily, helping to         ease the pressure of trial         dates and associated costs.
Cellmark now sub-contracts forensic analysis work to the Materials         Department, benefitting from         the commitment of 30% of Dr Salter's time and his leading expertise in         SEM-based analysis.
Currently           the UoA provides Cellmark with the data for all our 360 forensic glass           cases each year       and an additional 60 GSR cases1.
By partnering with the Materials Department to provide research-led       analytical services, Cellmark       has been able to increase its product offering to Police Authorities and       generate new business.
Last year Cellmark was awarded the largest share of the available police       contracts for trace       evidence analysis, including 100% of the Metropolitan Police Service's       work, 90% of that of the       West Coast Consortium Police Forces (14 police forces from Cumbria to       Devon and Cornwall) and       70% of that of the South East Police Force consortium.
With the       Department's help, Cellmark were       able to gain market share over other forensic science providers, in an       overall market worth &#163;80-100M per annum.
By itself, Cellmark's provision of the Metropolitan Police's trace       evidence requirements represents       20% of the total UK police forensic spend.
In particular, Cellmark       supports the work of operation       Trident that is focused on gang-related crime and has the highest UK       requirement for gunshot       residue (GSR) analysis, which is a particular speciality of the Materials       Department's forensic       analysis provision to Cellmark.
A specific example of the impact of the Department's research and the       provision of forensic       analysis to Cellmark relates to a shooting at a London nightclub on New       Year's Day, 2012.
Cellmark received a particularly large and complex case, which involved       the submission of over       100 items for forensic analysis and interpretation.
The Department       assisted Cellmark's scientists       with the extensive GSR work involved in the case and, in the absence of       any DNA evidence, this       GSR evidence was critical to the prosecution case.
The main suspect was       convicted of murder and       sentenced to a prison term of 31 years.
There are many other similar cases       where the       Department's work has been used as key evidence in major prosecutions."
