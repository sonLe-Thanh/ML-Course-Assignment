     Since Gilbert joined LSHTM in 2002 she has presented research findings       extensively which has led to greater awareness of the public health       problem of ROP.
Dissemination has been through workshops attended by       ophthalmologists, neonatologists and neonatal nurses: 19 workshops in       Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, Panama and       Peru), and 3 in Eastern Europe.
Other facilitators are now taking over       this role to increase the reach.
Presentations have been made since 2008       to Ministries of Health (Peru, Brazil, Jamaica), at two World ROP       Congresses (India 2009; China 2012), to NGOs who support prevention of       blindness (Sightsavers; ORBIS International; Standard Chartered Bank's       Seeing is Believing programme) and at numerous international, regional and       national meetings, conferences and seminars.
Research findings have been       summarised in five textbooks (13 chapters, including updates in new       editions), one of which, The Epidemiology of Eye Disease, is the       standard textbook for several postgraduate training courses.5.1     The educational package developed for the Rio study was made available in       2013 as an online course (at http://neonatal.estacaodigitalsaude.org.br/aia/)       and over 4,500 professionals have registered.
Greater awareness that ROP is a major avoidable cause of blindness in       children has had the following impact:            ROP continues to be recognised as a major cause of avoidable blindness         by VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, which is the 20-year global         initiative of WHO and the International Agency for the Prevention of         Blindness (IAPB).
The latter is an umbrella organisation of all the         organisations involved in prevention of blindness including NGOs,         professional bodies, service providers, the corporate sector and         university departments.
IAPB currently has 155 members.
In 2009 the control of blindness due to ROP was prioritised within the         Pan American Health Organization's prevention of blindness policy for         Latin America5.2 and the Caribbean in 2010.5.3,5.4,5.5        ROP is a priority in the Chinese National Plan for the Prevention and         Treatment of Blindness (2012-2015).
In 2008, neonatologists from 8 countries, ophthalmologists from 12         countries and neonatal nurses from 6 countries in Latin America met in         Panama to develop regional guidelines for ROP programmes, which have         since been published, referencing the applicant's research.5.6         These guidelines are being updated and modified by many other countries         in the region (e.g.
Venezuela, Nicaragua).
Guidelines are being drawn up         in India.
In Peru (2010),5.7 Mexico (2013),5.8 Argentina,         Chile, Colombia and El Salvador, legislation has been passed making eye         examination of preterm infants mandatory.
Ministries of Health in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador,         Mexico and Peru have issued resolutions recommending eye examination of         all preterm births, and in Rio de Janeiro programmes are fully         integrated within state and municipal health systems.
The Pan American Ophthalmology Society has established an ROP Society.
There has been increased support for the control of ROP in Latin         America and other countries (e.g.
Pakistan, India, China, Vietnam) from         NGOs: ORBIS international (USA),5.9 CBM, (Germany), Seeing is         Believing (UK), the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust (UK), Fred         Hollows Foundation (Australia).
UNICEF has supported initiatives for         prevention in Argentina and is supporting initiatives in India.
All these factors have led to rapid expansion of ROP programmes in many       countries in Latin and Central America, and in Asia.
For example, in Rio       de Janeiro, Brazil, only 40% of preterm infants were admitted to neonatal       units with a screening programme in 2002, but this has increased so that       most government units now have programmes.
Similar expansion has occurred       in other major cities in Brazil.
Legislation in Peru has had a dramatic       impact, building consensus and leading to expansion of programmes in Lima       and many other cities across the country.
Treatment at a critical stage in the natural history of ROP is highly       effective at preventing blindness.
In the screening programme in Rio de       Janeiro 1,444 infants most at risk of ROP were examined and 118 were       treated.
The disease regressed completely in all but 5 infants.
Without       treatment at least a quarter would have become blind.
Data from Argentina       suggests that there has been a dramatic reduction in blindness from ROP,       with far fewer children being admitted to schools for the blind than 10       years ago, when almost 40% of blindness was due to ROP.5.10       Extrapolating these findings across Latin America and other low- and       middle-income countries means that many thousands of infants are having       their sight preserved.
