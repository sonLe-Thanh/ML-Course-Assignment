     4.1 Impact through transport planning software     Smith has a longstanding relationship with the developers of the       SATURN (Simulation and Assignment of Traffic in Urban Road Networks)       software suite, which is now developed and marketed by Atkins Global       ("one of the world's leading design, engineering and project management       consultancies").
Since 2008 SATURN "has been utilised to evaluate 80         significant changes to transport networks in the UK and 20 changes to         transport networks overseas.
It is currently used to some degree by 400         users in the UK and by 100 users overseas and generates an annual income         in excess of &#163;500K."
[7] (95% of the user-base is estimated to be       non-academic [7]).
Smith has a longstanding collaboration with Dr       Dirck van Vliet, the designer and developer of SATURN; Smith's       former research assistant Xiang was employed by Atkins       until recently.
The impact of papers [1,2] was to convince the SATURN team that Smith's       policy P0 and developments of "Algorithm D" should be incorporated in       their product.
Van Vliet writes in [7] that "The SATURN model has made         extensive use of the concept of Social Pressure developed from the         `Algorithm D' originally proposed in the mid 1980s by Mike           Smith.
This is used in solving the algorithmic problems         that arise in traffic assignment models where different streams of         traffic interact with one another (e.g.
traffic on a minor arm at a         T-junction giving way to traffic on a major arm).
In addition, SATURN         contains an implementation of the responsive control policy called P0         previously proposed by Smith... [The SATURN implementations of         the late 1990's] were informed and supported by the stability results         obtained by Smith and van Vuren in [1] and by Smith et         al in [2].
More generally, without the ideas of Mike the         convergence of SATURN and its ability to provide a single         self-consistent answer to traffic problems would be extremely         restricted.
Moreover, his results on the stability of these algorithms         (going beyond the previously standard work of Frank-Wolfe) allow us to         market SATURN with confidence.
SATURN is under continual development and         Mike Smith and I have had many conversations about the details of         the proportional method and about the SATURN Social Pressure         implementation.
His research continues to be a significant influence on         our thinking."
Van Vliet's published work acknowledges "ideas       pinched from" Smith.
A significant application of the SATURN suite, demonstrating its       flexibility and utility, was in the preparation for the London 2012       Olympic and Paralympic Games in both "helping to define [traffic] plans       around venues" and "to provide a strategic overview of the impact of the       ORN [Olympic Route Network], road events/management and the venues       themselves on roads in London", which was applied in particular to inform       the "Get Ahead of the Games" advertising campaign on likely road impact       [8].
More generally, Transport for London "has recently developed a       comprehensive set of new sub-regional highway assignment models, based on       the SATURN suite of software" [9].
Very recently, the Italian company SISTeMA has stated "We         propose to investigate a revised iterative process (using the P0 policy)         and we are likely to implement it within our software if that         investigation shows benefits."
[13] Crucially, their interest arises       because "Smith's mathematical analysis suggests that with this policy         the control/routeing iterations may be expected to converge both more         quickly and more reliably."
Smith's mathematical analysis is       reported in [1, 4, 5] above; [4] is cited explicitly by SISTeMA       [13].
SISTeMA's portfolio includes traffic projects in Brussels,       Bogot&#224;, London, Moscow, New Delhi and Rome [13].
4.2 Impact on practitioners and external collaboration     Smith has stimulated and informed the international traffic       planning debate and influenced traffic planners and signal engineers by       communicating his results in a wide range of forums.
Examples include: (1)       a lecture at the 17th JCT Traffic Signal Symposium (September       2012), the main forum for signal engineers in the UK, with an emphasis on       papers and presentations from working signal engineers and manufacturers       [10], where his paper Traffic control and route choice: modelling and         optimisation received a prize for "the most thought-provoking paper"       and (2) a lecture at the Modelling World conference in June 2013       (a central forum for modelling practitioners).
Smith also works to develop and test new ideas via on-road pilot       schemes locally, which he considers essential to generate confidence and       so enable on-street impact.
He has a long-standing relationship with the       City of York Council and the York-based specialist traffic control       consultants Ian Routledge Consultancy.
Smith has been       involved with various innovative modelling projects aimed at reducing       congestion, and in Ian Routledge's words "was the catalyst in bringing         together a team that led to the FREEFLOW project (2008 - 2011; funded by         DfT, TSB, EPSRC, ESRC and the project partners, including five         industrial partners, to the value of &#163;6.4M)" [11], an exemplar of       the combined "local academia/local authority/local consultancy         platform Mike had pioneered".
Routledge continues "Mike has over         the last decade shown how academic research can be combined with local         authority and local industry partners to demonstrate in major national         and international projects the potential of integrating new academic         thinking into fields that have tended in many ways to be reluctant to         try new approaches and techniques."
[11]     The FREEFLOW project (2008-2011) enabled proof-of-concept of a new       responsive gating system on the main arterial York to Hull A1079.
It       achieved significant reductions in mean and variance of bus journey times       [6].
A long-term goal is to implement it nationally and internationally       through its incorporation into standard modelling programs and bus       routeing and timetabling software.
4.3 Impact through pattern recognition software     The novel pattern matching metric of [6] has been taken up for more       general applications by Cybula, a successful company with 10       employees set up in 2000 by Prof. Jim Austin, who leads a research group       in computer science at the University of York.
Cybula licences       technology from the University and others to undertake its business;       however the University has no equity holding in the company.
The risk       capital behind Cybula comes from private investors, who evaluate       technology carefully before investing their funds and the company's       profits in the methods.
Cybula's Business Director John McAvoy       writes [12] "Cybula's main business is in high performance pattern         matching...
The cumulative encoding method described in [6] is being         used by the company within a number of projects.
It's ideal for encoding         the data in many problems prior to recognition with [the existing match         engine].
We are using it in a project with Simulation Software Ltd on         data from BP for possible detection of leaks in oil pipelines and it         also forms a part of a project with Sheffield University and Thames         Water.
We are also using it in a project with EDF Energy...
Thus Cybula         is using the technology regularly, furthermore, if the projects' outputs         are taken up by the companies, the method will also be used on a daily         basis with these companies... [this technology] is critical in making         the company competitive in the world market."
The projects in which       Cybula uses the methods of [6] are collectively worth &#163;200k per       annum [12].
