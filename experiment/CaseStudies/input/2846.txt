         Impact (1) Change in Afghan Law         Because of vested interests and complex Afghan politics, the `hybrid           model' and its key recommendations were opposed by the Afghan           government for over a year after its publication.
In 2009, the Afghan           Ministry of Justice &#8212; with the help of United States Institute on           Peace (USIP) &#8212; drafted a `National Policy on Relations Between the             Formal Justice System and Dispute Resolution Councils'.
The key           recommendations of the `hybrid model' of justice developed by Dr           Wardak were written into the draft `National Policy'.
The draft           policy, which was subjected to weekly discussions by a complex           `working group' for a very long time, was subsequently amended and           drafted as `The               Law on Dispute Resolution, Shuras and Jirgas', by the           Ministry of Justice.
The draft law includes four chapters and 26           articles.
The key objectives of this law are:                     To avoid dispute resolution between natural persons by Dispute             Resolution Shuras and Jirgas that is illegal or violates Shariah.
To provide access to easy, fair and cost effective justice for             people before their cases are officially handled by formal justice             institutions.
To improve and develop proper and acceptable local traditions and             customs.
To ensure legal and Sharia based rights of citizens especially of             women and children as they are vulnerable group in the society.
To minimalise accumulation of cases in the justice and legal             institutions especially in the courts.
To maintain relationship between Dispute Resolution Shuras and             Jirgas and Justice Institutions.
To determine duties and authorities of Dispute Resolution Shuras             and Jirgas.
The `hybrid model' and the `The                 Law on Dispute Resolution, Shuras and Jirgas', caused             some debate among national and international players tasked with             rebuilding the justice system in Afghanistan.
As the debate             continued, it has become part of a wider political debate in the             country.
Since 2008, the implementation of the law was delayed as a             result of opposition from the Afghan Supreme Court (which has vested             interests in the existing judicial/justice system) and from some             politicised women/human rights groups in Afghanistan who suggested             that the new model of justice proposals were anti-women and in             breach of human rights.
Wardak contested these criticisms and             further debate ensued.
As a result of continued pressure from             conservative circles within the Afghan legal establishment and from             some politicised women/human rights groups, the draft law has not             yet been forwarded to the Afghan Parliament for discussion and final             adoption.
Impact (2) Implementation of the `hybrid model'         Despite these concerns, ideas derived from Wardak's new model were           piloted in different parts of Afghanistan by the United States           Institute of Peace, by USAID, TLO and CPAU.
Preliminary results of           pilot studies, in selected districts in Afghanistan, indicate that the           hybrid model provides workable solutions to many of the problems that           Afghan state and non-state justice systems currently face.
[5] In           fact, in the northern Kunduz province, Wardak proposal has been given           an architectural instantiation by the UN Assistance Mission in           Afghanistan (UNAMA) Rule of Law Program, with the local shura           office co-located in the same little buildings as the Department of           Women's Affairs and the Hoquq (rights) Department of the Ministry of           Justice.
[6]         One of the main aims of the `hybrid model' and its recommendations           has been the reform of Afghanistan's justice system, so that it           provides accessible justice effectively, cost-effectively, and           transparently and in accordance to human rights principles to all           Afghan citizens.
However, political obstacles towards the           implementations, some national and international organisations           including the United States Institute of Peace, by USAID, TLO and CPAU           implemented some of the recommendations of the hybrid model at local           level in selected provinces.
The results indicate that this has direct           impact on the lives of local peoples.
A key example is that baad           (the use of women as a means of dispute resolution) as Jirga           outcomes had become increasingly rare.
[7] Also, there is indirect           evidence that as a recommendation of the `hybrid model', a recent           study indicate that an overwhelming majority of people in Kunduz           province is supportive of inclusive (of men and women) processes of           traditional dispute resolution.
[8] Also as a result of the           implementations of the ideas derived from this model, there is now           closer and a more effective cooperation among state and non-state           justice institutions in some Afghan provinces.
