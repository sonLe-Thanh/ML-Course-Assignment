     Education: enriching students' appreciation of the interpretative         nature of history Educational impact has always been the main focus       of the project [a].
Initial scoping demonstrations in Phase 1 (2008/9)       involved five teachers and 100 Year 9 students across three schools.
As a       result of noting the potential to link the project to the then emerging       Personal Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) which schools were to be       required to assess and blend into the curriculum, Chantry High School, a       mid-sized comprehensive in Ipswich, became the team's partners in:            creating and evaluating a package of learning activities for a         ten-hour Humanities programme using Bristol's virtual model to deliver         PLTS objectives [b].
developing a prototype product/service which could be made safe and         accessible to all schools and universities through migration from Second         Life (SL) to Open Sim.
In phase 2 (2010 onwards), the team has extended the trial, involving       demonstrations at two Bristol schools (Cotham and Red Maids', 80-plus       students), trials with sample groups at three schools (St Mary Redcliffe       and Temple (SMRT), Fairfield High and Redland Green, 60-plus students,       2012/13) and pedagogical discussions with local History and Classics       teachers.
They have also taken opportunities to promote the project across       the country, for example presenting at a teaching-enrichment day at North       London Collegiate Schools (2013) and various educational conferences (see       section 2).
In order to evaluate educational impact, the researchers       gather data through observation [b], group discussion with students and       teachers during and after sessions [c], written feedback gathered from       students and quantitative data collected using voting technology.
The significant impact and benefits to the students have been:            Helping students grasp the contingent nature of `interpretations' of         the past &#8212; that is to say, understanding the part that reception plays         in the construction of historical interpretation and narrative.
This is         particularly demonstrated by class discussions at SMRT, in which         students talked about how their concept of history and historical `fact'         had changed, noting, for example, `I find it quite annoying when someone         tells us that this IS what happened'; `it gives you the challenge to         peel back the layers of history... even if it gives you less of an         insight into the actual event, it can give you more of an insight on the         previous group of people looking at the event'': [c].
One student even         remarked when realising that what might be presented as historical facts         can be unreliable and open to interpretation, `It's quite scary'.
All         groups were able to transfer this experience to other periods of history         they had studied.
The SMRT team noted that the project `was able to         facilitate a debate which demonstrated thinking and reasoning skills of         a standard I have rarely seen at Key Stage 3' [d].
Commenting straight         after the lesson the teacher said `That activity on its own is         brilliant...
I can't think of anything else you could use to do it' [c].
Helping students appreciate how past events impact on the present:         students were able to reflect on the ways in which issues they had         learned about in the study of Victorian Britain might have been         influenced by ancient practice &#8212; for instance and in particular,         slavery.
Students enjoyed the opportunity to find out more about periods         they felt they knew little about beforehand, and in this sense         particularly, this project's blend of the Victorian and the Roman         allowed students to learn more about Classics than would ever be the         case on the standard curriculum [b].
Establishing a `sense of period' to provide context for larger         historical questions, particularly through the walk-through timeline         along which students first travel to the model (reckoned to have `vast         potential for the teaching of chronology' [e]) and attitudes and         experiences voiced by robot avatars.
The behaviour of students adopting         the character of the period avatars they were given, included texting in         `Victorian-ese' [b] and inventing informed back stories about         characters' relationships.
Students particularly identified with         experiences of status and gender discrimination their characters         suffered at the hand of robot avatars [c] and Fairfield High found this         the `most useful' part of the experience [f].
Giving enhanced opportunities for self-development through the         opportunity to experience a historical context for themselves.
Redland         Green noted that the model's environment `lends itself to independent         learning brilliantly' [e].
At Chantry, the team noted that the different         mode of delivery and familiarity with technology engaged a number of         boys who were usually reluctant to get involved in class [b].
One boy at         SMRT said, `this project has allowed me to come out of my shell a bit         more and it's given me more confidence' [c].
Another reflected on a         life-lesson learned: `you've got to make your own decision.
You can't         just let people give it to you and just take it because they might have         manipulated it.
You need to decide for yourself what you think' [c].
In July 2013, the team met with the teachers involved in the Bristol       trials, and some interested future partners, to share experiences and       discuss ways to develop a genuinely collaborative teaching and learning       package.
All teachers thought that their students had benefited from       participation and that their own aims had been met.
There was great       enthusiasm for continued involvement in the project.
Some particular       avenues for further exploration include:            Redland Green, SMRT and new partner Cathedral School are especially         interested in using the online environment as a space 'for developing         opportunities for valuable cross-school collaboration' [d]; a feature         that `other teachers would surely be interested in' [e].
Red Maids' are predominantly interested in the development of the         model specifically to serve the module on Roman domestic space in GCSE         Classical Civilisations.
They feel that it could serve as an `excellent         learning tool' in helping students explore the space of the Roman house         and furthermore better equip them with the skills to answer examination         questions which often ask students to `imagine' life in Pompeii [g].
Fairfield High have offered ideas for developing material that would         help extend the project from its focus audience of school students         following Gifted and Talented programmes to meet the needs of the trial         group with which the team worked there, predominantly `pupil premium         students' and `students with English as an additional language', thus         extending its impact through the school-age population of the city [f].
Heritage: supporting activities of local heritage groups in promoting         awareness of and access to archive material and knowledge pertaining to         the Crystal Palace     Since the dissolution of the GLC, there has been little investment in the       Crystal Palace Park.
In 2008, the London Development Agency produced a       white paper on the future of the park, and the Bristol project was named       as a possible partner in the development of an interpretation strategy       [h].
A much pared-down masterplan was approved in December 2010 but, due       to financial concerns, it is yet to be effected.
As a result, a DVD of Bristol's model for display in the small,       volunteer-run and donation-funded Crystal Palace Museum, which attracts       8,000 visitors annually, provides an immediate impact.
The video       fly-through, installed in 2013, is the only visualisation of the interior       of the lost Palace.
It will have educational benefit to local schools, who       use the Museum as a resource for local history, and to visitors.
It will       assist local amateur societies in their endeavours to develop the displays       at the Park and in other ways (e.g., by a mobile phone app).
The Director       of the Museum and its trustees wrote that they are `so impressed with your       efforts to date to do something that no one else has achieved'.
They have       been extremely supportive of the project throughout, sharing archive       material and discussing ideas for taking our partnership forward through       further collaboration on display material [i].
Online Presence and Dissemination: the presence of the Bristol team's         outputs on various online platforms has disseminated awareness of the         Palace and of the project's contents and aims to a global audience and         has contributed to wider online debates about, for example, the presence         of educational sims in Second Life.
The team have endeavoured to extend the reach of the project through       dissemination in a number of media.
The project has been covered by local       press, appearing in the Bristol Evening Post, Ipswich Evening         Star and Crystal Palace News (online newsletter).The team       has presented its work at a number of public events, including university       public engagement activities, talks to special-interest groups, and       large-scale public events such as the Crystal Palace Arts Festival 2009       and Discover 2010.
In 2012, the researchers were invited to California to       speak about their model at the Getty Museum as part of a public engagement       day promoting its exhibition, The Last Days of Pompeii, to 600       ticket-holders.
The model in SL is permanently open to online users and       two videos (one of them the video made for the Museum) are available on       YouTube and our website.
Although the researchers cannot track visitor       numbers to the online model per se, the optional virtual guide has been       downloaded more than 2,760 times.
Interest among the SL community is       indicated by repeated reference to Bristol's project in blogs such as Prim         Perfect (which has featured the project three times), particularly       with regard to the debate about the difficulties of sustaining educational       presence in a commercial environment like SL, and by the dedication of an       episode of Designing Worlds on Treet TV (SL TV station) to the       Bristol model [j].
Over 8,000 people visited the project blog over three       years and 65 engaged comments from readers in the UK, US and Europe were       live on the website on 31st July 2013 [a].
