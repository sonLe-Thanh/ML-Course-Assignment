     Developed initially for depression, compassion-focussed therapy (CFT) has       been applied for eating       disorders (Gale et al., 2012), personality disorders (Lucre and Corten,       2012) and psychosis       (Braehler et al., 2012), including in high security settings (Laithwaite       et al., 2009).
It was applied       and evaluated for heterogonous mental health problems in community mental       health settings       (Judge et al., 2012), and to promote compassionate self-regulation in       smoking cessation (Kelly et       al.
(2010).
Compassion-focused therapy has been incorporated into NHS       treatment services in       Coventry (Gale et al., 2012), Leicester (Lucre and Corten, 2012), Glasgow       (Judge et al., 2012),       and Ayrshire and Arran, Scotland (Braehler et al., 2012).
At the Coventry       Eating Disorders Service,       745 patients were referred for treatment between April 2002 and October       2009 (Gale et al., 2012),       and since 2008 approximately 70 patients with eating disorders receive CFT       each year.
In Scotland, group-based CFT was introduced from 2008 for patients       referred by community       mental health teams in Greater Glasgow (Judge et al., 2012), and the       Integrated Care Pathway of       the First Episode Psychosis Service covering the whole of Glasgow (pop.
800,000) is guided by       the use of compassion-focussed formulation.
In a trial of CFT for patients       with psychosis referred       from NHS clinical services in Ayrshire and Arran, Scotland, CFT was       associated with "significantly       more improvement and less exacerbation at follow-up" than treatment as       usual (Braehler et al.,       2012, p. 208).
The clinical psychologist responsible for the service       described CFT as leading to       many positive changes among the service as whole, including "increased       detection, assessment       and treatment of psychological difficulties in patients with psychosis",       "development of specialist       clinical skills in psychology staff", and "greater uptake of other       group-based social activities within       mental and social services following the groups by patients who were       previously disabled by high       levels of social anxiety and paranoia" (personal correspondence, 2013).
The Compassionate Mind Foundation UK was set up in 2006 and registered as       a charity in 2007.
The Foundation has increased the impact of research on CFT by:            Providing regional supervision groups for clinicians to come together         and talk about their         cases.
Making downloadable compassion-focused therapy materials and         resources, including video         materials, scales related to compassion-focused therapy and research,         compassion-focused         exercises, training manuals and training materials, and information         about clinical supervision,         available through its website (http://www.compassionatemind.co.uk/).
Extending the work of the Foundation internationally, by establishing         the Compassionate Mind         Foundation USA (set up in 2013) (http://compassionfocusedtherapy.com/).
There is also an active programme of training at the University of Derby       for therapists and       practitioners wishing to offer compassion-focussed therapy.
This includes:            A series of workshop events and short courses organised by the         University in conjunction with         the Compassionate Mind Foundation.
One three-day workshop event on 23rd,         24th and 25th         January, 2012, for example, provided an introduction to         compassion-focussed therapy for         shame and self-critical difficulties for 45 trainees, including 20 NHS         delegates.
Since 2012,         introductory workshops with up to 70 trainees per workshop, and advanced         workshops with         attendance limited to 40 trainees per workshop, have been held at the         University's Enterprise         Centre, and attracted trainees from NHS Trusts, voluntary sector         organisations and         independent practitioners right across the UK.
A Postgraduate Certificate in Compassion Focused Therapy, which began         in January 2012 and         is presently training the third cohort.
Over 30 individuals have         received training to date, and         seven students, including six from Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Trust,         graduated in September         2012, and 11, including nine from Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Trust,         graduated in May 2013.
The profile and reputation of CFT has been further increased by Professor       Gilbert's honorary and       visiting professorial positions.
For example, he is currently visiting       professor at the Universities of       Combria, Portugal, and Fribourg, Switzerland, and has addressed over 12       international       conferences as invited keynote speaker since 2008 (see REF5 section on       contribution to the       discipline).
Articles in general readership publications such as The         Psychologist have been used to       explain the scientific and therapeutic basis of CFT and introduce the key       therapeutic concepts.
Professor Gilbert and colleagues have also written or edited 18 books and       contributed chapters to       a further 43 books, which make the philosophy, evidence base and       therapeutic approach of CFT       widely available to academics and practitioners.
Professor Gilbert's authored books include the best-selling Overcoming         Depression (2009), and       Compassion Focused Therapy (2010), which are published in at least       12 countries, including       Bulgaria, Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Norway,       Poland, Sweden, UK,       USA and Wales (Welsh Language).
Both books are listed on Amazon       best-selling lists and have       many excellent customer reviews.
As of February 2013, Overcoming         Depression had sold 159,000       copies and The Compassionate Mind had sold 39,000 copies.
Overcoming         Depression is listed as       recommended reading in the national `Reading Well Books on Prescription'       scheme, delivered by       The Reading Agency and the Society of Chief Librarians, with funding from       the Arts Council       England.
The scheme, recently launched on 4th June 2013, provides       book-based cognitive       behavioural therapy to help people understand and manage common mental       health conditions.
The CFT approach has also been developed and adapted for the general       public and selected       groups affected by wellbeing challenges.
For example, a Leverhulme       Trust-funded 2010-11 project       evaluated a web-based `compassion game' to promote wellbeing for the       general public       (http://derby.ac.uk/news/focus-on-compassion-to-boost-wellbeing),       and an online resource for       students to promote wellbeing and reduce assessment anxiety was developed       and evaluated in       2013.
Paul Gilbert has also made a significant contribution to public       understanding and awareness of       mental health issues generally, and of the role of compassion-focused       approaches more       specifically, through national and international media events and       appearances, including on BBC       Radio 4, in The Guardian, The Independent, and The Times, and       internationally.
Numerous talks,       workshops, self-help and instructional video materials are also publicly       available on YouTube.
In January 2011, Professor Gilbert was awarded the OBE for services to       mental healthcare.
