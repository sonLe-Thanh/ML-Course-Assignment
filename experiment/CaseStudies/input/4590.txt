     Focus on ordinary bindings.
Indications of both significance and reach of this research are given by       examples of prestigious       bodies that have adopted this approach.
A major project at the Derry and       Raphoe Diocesan library       (accessible on the University of Ulster McGee Campus, funded by the HLF)       was based on this       finding (2007-2011).
National Trust libraries have adopted this finding       for more than a decade, and       Norwich Cathedral and Lambeth Palace Libraries are also undertaking       projects to describe       bindings from their collections.
Giles Mandelbrote, Librarian and       Archivist, Lambeth Palace writes       that interaction with the Centre has a `profound impact on the way in         which Lambeth Palace Library         has organised its conservation work over the past three years and on our         plans for the future.'
Complete collection surveys.
The significance of impact is given by the discovery of exceptional items       within collections as a       result of this approach, such as a page from the Codex Sinaiticus       (the oldest extant version New       Testament in the world) in the library of St Catherine's Monastery in       2009.
News of this discovery       reached a wide audience via coverage including The Guardian, The       Economist, The Independent,       La Reppublica, and on the BBC.
Further evidence of both significance and       reach is given by the       finding's adoption by a large survey of manuscripts on Mount Athos, the       largest monastic       community in the world and World Heritage site, as well as the adoption by       smaller libraries, such       as the Wellcome Trust library for the survey of their Arabic manuscript       collection.
Father Justin       (Librarian, St Catherine's Monastery) writes: 'Ligatus [...] continues         to carry out important work that         has had a profound impact in the study and appreciation of manuscripts,         their complex history and         evolution, and the implications of the study for the greater         appreciation of this and the heritage that         is preserved here at St Catherine's Monastery.'
Semantic documentation of collections.
This process informs documentation methodologies and following recognition       of its value, Ligatus       developed a network of institutions (Language of Binding Network,       funded by the AHRC) to       produce a thesaurus of bookbinding terms involving a range of institutions       in the UK and Europe       (including Det Kongelige Bibliotek, Copenhagen; Biblioth&#232;que nationale de       France, Paris; Herzog       August Bibliothek, Wolfenb&#252;ttel; Biblioteka Narodowa, Warsaw; and       Patrimonio Nacional, Real       Biblioteca, Madrid).
Ligatus has completed a project with the       International Institute for       Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), where semantic       documentation is used by IIC's       audience, contributing to a sharp increase in website traffic.
Google       Analytics reports an increase       from 45,545 unique visitors in 2011 to 65,904 in 2012.
Jo Kirby Atkinson,       IIC Secretary-General       writes: `The potential that Ligatus has opened up for the         documentation of conservation content         cannot be overstated.'
This type of documentation has also been       utilised by the Wellcome Trust       Library and described by their Asian Collections Librarian Dr Nikolaj       Serikoff as an `ingenious         design'.
Creative archiving.
Work in this area has extended reach to new constituencies within       contemporary fine art, archiving       practice and publishing, specifically the Whitechapel Gallery, the John       Latham Archive and the       publishers Book Works.
The methodology was tested during the AHRC project       on the John Latham       Archive and showcased at the exhibition Anarchive at the       Whitechapel Archive Gallery (58,472       visitors, reviewed by the Arts Forum, 09/2010 and discussed at Resonance       FM, 08/2010).
During       2010 the publisher Book Works worked with Ligatus, via a Knowledge       Transfer Partnership (KTP),       to develop an on-line digital archive utilising this methodology.
Jane       Rollo, Director of Book Works       writes we `have now built an online archive that our users find both         comprehensive and stimulating'       and that `visits to our website continue to rise each month', and       acknowledging `the huge         contribution that Ligatus has had in the conceptual development and         implementation of our         archive.'
Professional community impact.
Active community building with a wide range of individuals and       organisations has been a       fundamental aspect of Ligatus's work, and key to extending reach and       transferring knowledge       developed in the Centre.
The St Catherine's Project was the largest of its       kind, which saw 35       people from nine countries participating, Language of Bindings       involved 30 European participants,       and Ligatus Summer School has attracted 100 delegates since 2007 from       conservation and       palaeography backgrounds.
Conservators usually work alone or in small       groups and Ligatus's work       has nurtured a strong community of professionals who see the Centre as a       common reference       point for their work.
Evidence of impact is given by individuals who have       worked on past Ligatus       projects and have gone on to adopt Ligatus's approaches in new roles       outside of the Centre's       work.
The reach of this community has `made the approaches pioneered         there [Ligatus] more         easily transferable, and has led to the acceptance of these skills in a         wide range of institutions' as       Andrew Honey, Bodleian Libraries conservator who has worked on Ligatus       projects, including the       St. Catherine survey, writes and continues, `approaches to         documentation pioneered by Ligatus         have been accepted in most major museums and libraries'.
Georgios       Boudalis (Book Conservator,       Museum of Byzantium Culture,Thessaloniki) writes of the St Catherine's       project to `myself, and         many colleagues [...] the experience changed the way we perceive         and value historic books.'
Giles       Mandelbrote, Librarian and Archivist, Lambeth Palace states that working       with Ligatus has served       to stimulate `best practice among its staff and in helping to develop         fruitful new partnerships with         other institutions and groups.'
A strong indicator of significance is given by positions and advisory       roles held by Ligatus members       and recognition from the professional conservation community.
Velios       became the webmaster of       International Institute for Conservation (IIC) in 2009, a critical post       responsible for all content of the       Institute including the oldest conservation journal (Studies in         Conservation).
In 2012 he was invited       to join the Getty International Terminology Working Group, contributing to       the development of the       Getty vocabularies used by museums and libraries worldwide.
Pickwoad's       work at St Catherine's       monastery has received major recognition in his field.
In 2008, he       delivered the British Library's       Panizzi Lectures &#8212; one of the most important annual series of       bibliographical lectures in the UK.
In       2009, he received the Royal Warrant Holders Association Plowden Medal       Conservation Award, the       most prestigious award in the profession in the UK and one of the most       prestigious awards       worldwide.
He was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 2009 and       became a member of       the Norwich Cathedral Library Advisory Panel in 2009.
In 2010 he became a       member of the Library       and Collections Committee of the Society of Antiquaries.
Since 2011 he has       also been a member       of the Archbishop of Canterbury's Advisory Panel for Libraries and       Archives at Lambeth Palace.
