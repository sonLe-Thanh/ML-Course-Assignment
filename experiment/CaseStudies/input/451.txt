     In 2009, five elderly Kenyans lodged a claim against the British       government for the abuse they experienced in the Mau Mau internment camps,       where they had been tortured, beaten, castrated and subjected to extreme       sexual violence.
They were backed by the Kenya Human Rights Commission,       which considered Professor Anderson's work, alongside that of Professor       Caroline Elkins at Harvard University, as having `changed our       understanding of this period of history'[i].
Professor       Anderson joined the plaintiffs' legal team in 2010 to provide expert       testimony, alongside Professor Elkins and Dr Huw Bennett of Aberystwyth       University.
The contribution of Professor Anderson's research lay in the       documentary record of the colonial administration.
On the basis of       indications in his research that around 300 files were missing from the       archival record[ii: &#167;32], the High Court ordered the       British government to conduct a search that eventually revealed some 8,800       hidden files from 37 former British territories, concealed for fifty       years.
This public revelation has prompted a heated debate between       historians who recognise the need to reconsider the history of the end of       empire.
In July 2011, Justice McCombe ruled that the documentary research had       demonstrated `viable evidence' for a trial.
On this basis, he declared       that it would be `dishonourable' for the British legal system not to       consider a case alleging the use of torture by the British government       since `there is ample evidence even in the few papers that I have seen       suggesting that there may have been systematic torture of detainees', and       he duly refused the government plea for the case to be struck off[ii:           &#167;125, &#167;130, &#167;134, &#167;154].
In the subsequent preliminary       hearing in July 2012, the government made the historic acknowledgement       that Kenyans were indeed tortured and abused under the colonial       administration.
Professor Anderson presented further research on the       institutional sanctioning of torture and the obstruction of the judicial       process during the Emergency, research that Justice McCombe considered as       indicating `a continuing pattern of abusive conduct'[iii: &#167;128].
Justice McCombe granted the plaintiffs leave to claim compensation from       the British government, and on 6 June 2013 a settlement was announced.
Recognising the crimes of the past with statements in the House of Commons       and in Kenya, the British government will pay compensation of around &#163;13.9       million, comprising of payments of &#163;2,600 each to around 5,000 survivors       of colonial torture, and will finance the construction of a memorial in       Kenya[iv].
According to Dan Leader, lead barrister for       the plaintiffs, without Professor Anderson's identification of the missing       archive material and `meticulous' research on it, `the claims would not       have succeeded'[1, v].
The court case and Professor Anderson's research in particular sparked       significant public debates in Kenya and the UK.
British newspapers were       pressed by the publication of Histories of the Hanged to consider       the country's responsibility for extraordinary crimes and its attitude to       its own past.
[vi] Explicit parallels raised by Professor       Anderson's research were debated in the British press as challenging       lessons for the contemporary scandals surrounding British and American       counter- insurgency strategies and the use and cover-up of torture in       Guant&#225;namo Bay[vii].
Kenyan debates, meanwhile, were       prompted by the research to confront the country's own divided history       over the position of Mau Mau veterans and other nationalist movements[viii].
Inspired by the research on the Mau Mau executions, the commentator       Muthoni Wanyeki further opened the debate out to question Kenya's modern       reluctance to abolish the death penalty, its experience of extrajudicial       killings and the abuses of security services[2, ix].
Professor Anderson's research and the High Court case propelled public       reconsideration of relations between the UK, Kenya and the world.
On the       basis of the evidence of brutal torture and cynical institutional       deception, Archbishop Desmond Tutu publicly urged a moral confrontation       with the past as an imperative for the British government to set aside its       `hypocrisy' and restore its international reputation as a champion for       human rights[x].
While the controversy of the       revelations of the research and the outcome of the trial remain explosive,       the Kenyan journalist Gitau Warigi subsequently wrote of the significance       of Professor Anderson's research for the international image of the       British, since `one of their own' had pursued research that substantiated       British ideals of justice and fair play by uncovering where these ideals       had been betrayed[xi].
This research into the dirty       history of the Mau Mau Emergency drove the judicial search for justice and       involved the public in widespread debate over historical truth, guilt,       national values, and the links between Britain and her former colonies.
