     With respect to the water resources (WFD48, 2006) and hydromorphological       alteration (WFD49f, 2008) projects, the legislative obligations to       implement the WFD meant that the commissioned research was rigorously       peer-reviewed, and refined through public and stakeholder consultation,       before being transposed into legally-binding environmental standards1,2.
These are published under the auspices of the UK Technical Advisory Group       (UKTAG), which is responsible for harmonising WFD implementation across       the devolved administrations.
Rowan served as an invited       hydromorphology expert in its Lakes Task Team during the period 2006-2010.
The significance of the Dundee-based research is its adoption into       regulatory practice and how it informs on-going policy development.
In       relation to environmental flows and lake hydromorphology findings adopted       in UKTAG 2008a&amp;b: "UKTAG believes the proposals in this report are         based on the most robust assessment possible, given current scientific         understanding.
Our report aims to advise the UK administrations on the         standards and conditions that we believe the environment agencies should         use for the first River Basin Management Plans" (UKTAG, 2008b, p.       17).
These standards were used to "help guide decisions on the         management of lakes" (p. 54).
Lake-MImAS tool was adopted for       classification and impact assessment in the six-yearly cycle of statutory       River Basin Management Plans3and implemented through new       enabling legislation, e.g.
Statutory Rules Northern Ireland 2011, making       its use legally binding for all current and future lake       management activities within the devolved administrations, as well as in       the Republic of Ireland4,5,10,11,12,13.
A key element in the dissemination of the Lake Habitat Survey was the       development of an accredited training programme for environment and       conservation agency staff6.
Field-based training       workshops, typically running for three days, were held throughout the UK       (e.g.
Lake Windermere 2008, Lough Neagh 2010) as well as internationally       (Novi Sad, Serbia 2008 and Lago Maggiore, Italy 2009).
In total, more than       60 environment and conservation agency staff (SEPA, EA, NIEA and EPA) were       trained and achieved accreditation by Rowan (with inputs from       Research Assistants Bragg, Soutar and Carwardine).
A number of academics, graduate students and external commercial       consultants were also trained7.
Dissemination was also       achieved through a series of international workshops and field       demonstrations, e.g.
Rowan was invited to CEN Mainz 2011; CNR       Maggiore 2009; CEN Vienna 2008; UKTAG Dunadry 2008; JNCC Edinburgh 2008.
The international dimension of our research impact is also evident       through the translation of our lake research into the 2011 European       Committee for Standardisation (CEN) Water Quality &#8212; Guidance standard         on assessing the hydromorphological features of lakes (EN16039),       which endorsed the Lake Habitat Survey as the only internationally proven       method trialled by statutory authorities in the UK, Ireland, Netherlands,       Italy, France, Portugal, Poland, Norway, Spain, Serbia and Montenegro8.
EN16039 was ratified in 2011 through a formal weighted-voting procedure       involving all 34 CEN national member states and thereafter translated into       French and German.
Supported by the British Standards Institution, Rowan       led the development of what is now the de facto standard method       across Europe10.
The significance of standards is that       they are "...one of the most important issues for businesses...         crucial in facilitating trade... A standard represents a model         specification, a technical solution against which a market can trade.
It         codifies best practice and is usually state of the art".
The       standard is available in the UK as BS EN 16039:201, published by the       British Standards Institution9.
The research programme has generated a suite of characterisation,       monitoring and assessment tools accompanied by an accredited training       programme to promote quality assurance and the adoption of common       standards across all of the environment agencies of the UK and Ireland.
Research outputs disseminated through a series of commissioned reports,       academic papers and stakeholder engagement activities have been drawn       formally into UK and Irish statutes, and more widely proven in an       international context through the CEN Guidance Standard.
The impacts       discussed have occurred throughout the current 2008-2013 REF period, and       indeed are on-going and will be used in the forthcoming round of River       Basin Management Plans within the UK and Ireland.
