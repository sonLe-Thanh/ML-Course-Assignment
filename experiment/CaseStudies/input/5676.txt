     The impact claimed for this work, disseminated by journal papers, reports       and presentations since       2006, is the influence on practitioners and policymakers at local and       national levels extending a       critique of the practice of CLP/NP.
Specifically, it has impacted on the       development of       understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of CLP/NP as practiced since       2000, and in driving       actual practice modifications.
The research has influenced a wide range of       stakeholders such as       neighbourhoods and neighbourhood forums, local authorities, central       government, and agencies       supporting NP (such as RTPI/PAE and ACRE) as well as the public and the       planning profession       who undertake NP/CLP activity as volunteers.
This work has also informed       debates over       incentivisation and behavourial change in planning and has influenced how       CLG subsequently       linked incentivisation to NP through mechanisms such as the Community       Infrastructure Levy (CIL).
The nature and profile of CLP in the early period cited here was       relatively unrecognised.
It was a       concern for rural policymakers more than their urban counterparts and it       was not seen as a policy       priority for the then Labour government; although a stated principle of       active and engaged       citizenship by that administration clearly corresponded to such activity.
Therefore the work has       been conceived and developed from an academic research agenda operating at       a local level,       rather than a Government agenda.
The initial research had a direct impact on NP practice at a local level       in West Berkshire as it       informed the local authority's developments around NP and CLP.
As the work       was developed in       partnership with several key organizations, including the Community       Council for Berkshire (which       Parker subsequently chaired between 2007 and 2011), it informed these       organisations' plans.
Other organisations have later used this knowledge to inform their own       approaches and decisions       (for example, the Regional Empowerment Partnership in the East of England       as stated in their       2009 report `Community Led Planning National Overview (http://bit.ly/19q2dpO))     ACRE had previously designed a national toolkit to help practitioners       guide community groups       through the CLP process.
In light of new experiences in CLP, ACRE       re-shaped and updated this       toolkit.
Reading's research has influenced the development of this toolkit       by "help[ing] to reshape         the CLP toolkit and therefore influenced the individual RCCs (the ACRE         Network members) and         local communities on the ground in designing and carrying out parish and         community-led         planning".
This occurred "through [Parker's] work carried out in         Berkshire looking in depth at the         experiences and practices of Parish Planning" [5:1]     Latterly, this impact has been extended to both Government policy and       practice.
Parker has been       seconded to the RTPI/PAE in 2012 - 2014 (0.8 FTE) as their Director of       Professional Standards.
Through this role, Parker is responsible for coordinating part of the       Supporting Communities in       Neighbourhood Planning programme (http://www.rtpi.org.uk/planning-aid/neighbourhood-planning)       funded by CLG and being performed by PAE (using a total budget in the       period April 2011-March       2015 of c&#163;3.5m).
This work includes extensive use and training of       volunteers and development of       guidance for communities.
According to the RTPI, the lead researcher's       role on secondment to the       RTPI has "given a unique opportunity for academic research and learning         to feed even more         directly into the development of policy."
This has helped "shape         and give depth to the Institute's         position on NP and Localism'' and `'has guided the approach and         understanding of staff and         volunteers in PAE, as well as DCLG and other organisations, in terms of         shaping the SCNP         programme" [5:2].
The research outputs, together with the active engagement and       professional activity of the lead       researcher, have directly influenced Government.
According to the Deputy       Director of the       Decentralisation and Neighbourhood team at CLG, impacts on Government       policy linked to the       research include: "helping to shape the Policy on NP and the support         contract for communities         doing NP", extracting "the practical lessons emerging from the         early phases of NP" and providing       "a rich and considered evidence base for our considerations about how         to ensure the policy is         successfully delivered" The Deputy Director also comments that the       RTPI/PAE, under the lead       researcher's leadership, "are part of the successful consortium         alongside Locality and they are now         delivering the contract, drawing once again on the practical research         and evidence base".
[5.3] In       addition to the work for ACRE and RTPI, Parker has briefed the House of       Lords during the       passage of the Localism Bill.
The Defra/HCA funded work commissioned in 2009 has had a direct impact on       the delivery of rural       housing.
According to the HCA, it indicated to the "funders, Government         and other agencies that         on the ground engagement with communities ... could assist in opening         the way for the delivery of         [rural] housing."
This subsequently "helped support the aims and         approach taken since 2011         towards NP in England and encouraged other organizations such as the         RCCs to continue to work         with communities to set local agendas".
[5.4].
The outcome of this       work has been used by       organisations such as ACRE as stated in their briefing http://www.billingshurst-community.org.uk/Key/ACREbriefingCLPandhousingAugust2010%5B1%5D.pdf       as well as local       community groups (for example, the Hampshire Alliance for Rural Affordable       Housing,       http://www.actionhants.org.uk/index.php?id=121&amp;type=98)     The pathway to impact of this case study is soundly based in the School       strategy which identifies       collaboration with user communities, targets research on core policy or       practice areas and       knowledge exchange and capacity building.
The strategy also encourages       secondment to user       organisations.
In this particular case collaboration with industry could       not be closer with the lead       researcher sitting on the CLG sounding board for NP and on 80% secondment       to the RTPI and       PAE.
NP has become a key policy area for Government and a core area of       professional practice.
The impact on the implementation of the policy has been demonstrated and       this has also led to the       development of materials for knowledge exchange through PAE.
The RTPI       believes that these       materials, developed by Parker, and their support for the implementation       of policy have "helped         persuade Government to commit to funding NP by up to &#163;9.5 Million for         the next 2 years [2013-15],         despite the constraints on spending".
[5:2]     The reach of the work covers a very wide range of stakeholders, given the       significance of planning       policy on society.
The research has had an impact on a policy that forms a       central feature of the       Coalition government's programme under the banner of `Localism'.
It       informed ACRE, HCA and       subsequently CLG to argue for and then continue a mainstreaming of a form       of NP in England.
The       research and the researcher has had significant influence on dissemination       and implementation,       regularly briefing local authorities, communities, and others including       the London assembly and       shadow ministers on NP, with consequent impact on the wider community,       including planning and       property professionals, local government and neighbourhood groups.
