     The research described in Section 2 has directly impacted on WHO drug       policies and enabled       miltefosine treatment for tens of thousands of people with leishmaniasis       in high-incidence countries       such as India, Bangladesh and Colombia.
It has also had commercial impacts       for miltefosine       manufacturers, and led to phase III and IV clinical trials in India.
Following clinical trials in the 1990s and 2000s and the registration of       miltefosine in India in 2002       (the first new drug for visceral leishmaniasis in 40 years), the       governments of India, Nepal and       Bangladesh agreed a 10-year programme to eliminate leishmaniasis by 2015.
Miltefosine was       adopted as the only drug to be included in this VL elimination programme &#8212;       a decision in which the       research by Croft and colleagues played a significant part.5.1,       5.2 The drug has since been used to       treat about 25,000 patients per year through government-run centres &#8212; a       total of more than       137,000 between 2008 and mid-2013.
Miltefosine is also available on the       private market, although       it is not known how many patients benefit through this route.
In 2010, an application was made by the manufacturers of miltefosine,       Paladin Laboratories in       Montreal, Canada, to include the drug on the WHO's Model List of Essential       Medicines, a directory       of drugs which &#8212; according to WHO &#8212; should be available within the context       of functioning health       systems at all times in adequate amounts.
The WHO Expert Committee charged       with the selection       of essential medicines reviewed the evidence (including the Croft research       outputs) and approved       miltefosine, which has since been included in two editions of the list in       March 2011 and April       2013.5.3 The list is essential for the funding and distribution       of the drug by international       organisations such as M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;rs (MSF) who follow the WHO       list.
The list is also       used by Ministries of Health in individual countries to assemble their own       essential drugs lists.
Also in 2010, Croft was invited to serve on another WHO Expert Committee,       which produced a       technical report on Control of the Leishmaniases.5.4       This is a key public health advisory document       used by governments in countries affected by leishmaniasis, with       miltefosine treatment playing an       important part in it &#8212; again on the basis of Croft's research.
These endorsements led to considerable commercial benefits for the       manufacturers of miltefosine,       Paladin Laboratories.
(Asta Medica, originally selected by WHO for the       development process, had       sold their rights to Zentaris in 2001, and Zentaris was subsequently       acquired by Paladin.)
According to its own records, the company sold about 100,000 treatments       directly to governments       between 2008 and the middle of 2013, with the most recent sales level at       17,000 per annum.5.5       This excludes private sector sales, which are difficult to measure.
Phase III and IV clinical trials on anti-leishmanial drug combinations       which include miltefosine,       aimed at reducing the length of course of treatment and prevention of drug       resistance, were carried       out in India beginning in 2009-2010.
The phase III trials showed AmBisome       + miltefosine and       paromomycin + miltefosine combinations giving a &gt;98% cure rate.5.6       These combinations are part       of a phase IV clinical trial beginning in July 2013 and could reduce the       courses of treatment from       28 days to 8 days.
Miltefosine is also used for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis       (CL), especially in South       America.5.7 In Colombia, it has become the drug of choice for       this disease as a result of Croft and       colleagues' research, and has been shown to achieve a cure rate of 84-91%       for L. panamensis.
Argentina's Ministry of Health recommended miltefosine as the drug of       choice for CL in a 2010       guide for health professionals.5.8 The drug has also undergone       extensive clinical trials in other       countries, in particular Brazil and Bolivia5.9 against CL and       mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL)       caused by L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis.
In East Africa, miltefosine has been used in clinical trials to improve       treatment of HIV VL co-infected       patients, proving to be as effective as, and less toxic than, the standard       antimonial drugs.
Croft has worked to raise awareness and understanding of leishmaniasis       treatment among medical       practitioners and the general public in a variety of ways, including       through presentations at 12       international practitioner meetings and symposia during the impact       assessment period, and media       interviews (BBC online August 2009), as well as a YouTube video recorded       for an exhibition on       neglected tropical diseases at the Royal Festival Hall in London in July       2010.5.10
