     The impacts from the research developments at Nottingham in shape       analysis have been made       possible via a number of routes, including making the `shapes' software       [A5] freely available and       the description of the work in textbooks, such as Dryden and Mardia's book       on Statistical Shape       Analysis (1998, Wiley) and Kendall et al.
[A1] in 1999, which have sold       approximately 1800 and       760 copies respectively (as of 14/08/2013).
These have helped to create       links with users in       industry and the police, who having become aware of the research and       software via these links       have subsequently made contact with Nottingham directly or via other       academic collaborators.
The `shapes' package [A5] in particular has been one of the more popular       downloaded packages       on the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website.
Data from the       University of California       Los Angeles mirror on 30/09/2010 (http://neolab.stat.ucla.edu/cranstats/),       one of the few from the       92 mirror sites in 43 countries/regions (http://cran.r-project.org/mirmon_report.html)       that provides       download data, reported that out of 2531 contributed packages the `shapes'       package was the       112th most downloaded (520 downloads) from the 116th most separate IP       addresses (379 IPs),       i.e.
in the top 5% of downloaded contributed R packages at that time (the       most downloaded       package from the mirror had 935 downloads, less than twice that of the       `shapes' package).
Sites at       which the `shapes' package was publicised throughout the period 2003-2013       include locally at       www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/~ild/shapes       and the SUNY Stony Brook Morphometrics website       http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/.
Commercial software       One specific illustration of the impact of the research on size-and-shape       analysis [A2] is through       the work of Dr Joel Mitchelson who works for Charnwood Dynamics Ltd and       the start-up company       Ogglebox Sensory Computing Ltd. Charnwood Dynamics has an established 3D       movement       analysis brand, Codamotion (www.codamotion.com),       which is used in many settings, including       clinical analysis, mobile gait labs, biomechanics, sports, orthotics and       prosthetics, ergonomics,       virtual reality and visualisation (tinyurl.com/kr64xfw,       page 12).
The company has an average       annual turnover of &#163;713k (2006-12) and is one of 8 main global players in       the market for marker-based       3D movement analysis for life sciences (clinical and research use).
Mitchelson first confirms in his letter [B1] that: "The published         results on shape spaces from         University of Nottingham were instrumental in proving the convergence of         an algorithm for         measurement of the mean size-and-shape of a moving cluster of 3D         markers.
The algorithm and         proof have now been accepted for publication in the Journal of         Biomechanics, and are         implemented in the open source library, Open3DMotion [tinyurl.com/ldyhkkc]."
The publication mentioned here is [B2], which makes clear its reliance on       Le's work.
Mitchelson's       work arose after he contacted Le for a copy of [A3].
This led to       independent work by Mitchelson       and his team which, in particular, uses the sectional curvature       calculations for size-and-shape       space from Le &amp; Kendall 1993 in the condition for uniqueness of the       mean [A2, Condition C] to       develop further results for occluded data.
Mitchelson states by way of       clarification that:       "This library forms the basis of the calculation engine within         Codamotion's commercial ODIN         software (http://www.codamotion.com/the-odin-software-suite.html)       [Introduced in October 2011]."
He adds: "The benefit to Codamotion customers is that the method         allows rigid motions of clusters         of markers on a human body to be tracked without a calibration trial,         which can save them time.
It         also allows small portable 3D movement analysis systems to be moved         around to measure very         large volumes, using reference markers used to transform measurements         from a moving system to         a static reference frame.
This opens up new market opportunities for the         company, particularly for         analysis of sports movements in the field, and ergonomics in industrial         environments.
The         published shape space results from University of Nottingham are         important for giving confidence in         the results obtained from these new products."
That impact from this has already been realised is made explicit by       Mitchelson in an email dated       23 July 2013 (copy on file): "A beta version of the algorithm has been         in the software for some         months.
We're already able to engage with customers and potential         customers about this due to         the solid mathematical foundation, which is a result of the         size-and-shape spaces work."
Fingerprinting       A further illustration is through the work of Dr Thomas Hotz (Ilmenau       University of Technology) with       the Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany), where       Nottingham research       has led to efficiency savings after the methods were introduced into       standard operating procedure       within the Force.
Hotz describes the profound impact of Nottingham       research in [B3]:     "The aim of the study was to understand and predict the impact growth         has on fingerprints of         adolescents [B4, B5].
The difficulty automated fingerprint         identification systems face when         confronted with fingerprints of adolescents was that the points of         interest used in matching         algorithms move during growth, so that either tolerances in matching         have to be increased,         resulting in a worsened overall performance, or the fingerprint can no         longer reliably be found in         records after some years of growth.
Understanding growth firstly is a         matter of understanding         whether it occurs isotropically, i.e.
uniformly in all directions.
If         that were the case the shapes would         not change during growth.
We thus used the software package "shapes"         developed by that         [Nottingham] group [A5] as well as the methods described by the book         co-authored by Ian Dryden         in order to measure the anisotropy of growth.
We found it to occur         essentially isotropically,         reducing the task of predicting its effects to the prediction of a         single number, the growth factor,         which simplified matters dramatically."
In specific experiments, [B4], error rates on a test set of 462       fingerprints were halved by scaling;       this result was confirmed on the Bundeskriminalamt's database of 3.25       million right index       fingerprints, where nine failures to retrieve a juvenile fingerprint out       of 48 such identification       attempts could be avoided by rescaling.
Hotz notes the rescaling "...effect         had not been         understood, the European Union asked for a study to be conducted in this         direction [Official J         European Union, L131, 52, Regulation 390/2009, Annex 2, Article 2], and         decided against the use         of fingerprints of children under the age of 12 in visa applications [in         May 2009]."
This clearly       demonstrates the importance of this problem and moreover the importance of       the `shapes'       package in this context.
Further, Hotz notes: "It is worth mentioning         that, roughly at the same time,         the U.S. Department of Justice also had a study on the topic conducted         which however appears to         have failed to determine the effect of growth on fingerprints, and to         produce a useful means for         predicting it.
This study did not use any shape analysis to look at         anisotropy first, as they probably         did not know of these techniques."
Overall, Hotz summarises by saying: "...
I believe that without the         Nottingham Group's research,         making it available through software and textbooks, spreading their         knowledge through further         publications and conferences, this study could not have been conducted."
Thus Hotz's acquaintance with shape analysis, heavily influenced by       personal contact with and       publications of the members of the Nottingham group, has been key in       solving the problem at       hand.
As Hotz notes in his letter, the results of his study were       disseminated in 2011 at conferences       involving persons from academia, industry and public office, e.g.
from the       biometrics industry such       as Morpho (www.morpho.com),       representatives of security forces such as the Metropolitan Police       Service, and from the European Commission Joint Research Centre.
Other impacts of the work       There are other beneficiaries of the `shapes' package and, more broadly,       of the underlying       research undertaken at Nottingham.
These include an impact as a teaching       aid by introducing       geometric morphometrics to biologists via an on-line workbook [B6], a       face-shape study in patients       with epilepsy [B7], use in radar signal processing, and applications in       car headlight shape design       [B8].
It is thus likely that the strong interest from the groups mentioned       here and others will ensure       impact from the Nottingham research will grow in reach and significance       yet further.
