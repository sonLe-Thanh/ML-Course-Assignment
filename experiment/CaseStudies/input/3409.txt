     From its inclusion in the Arden series for the first time in March 2010,       to its staging, the first for over two centuries, in Calgary in the same       year, Double Falsehood has served to crystalise interest in issues       of authorial attribution and literary canonisation.
It has also enriched       the imaginations of audiences who have engaged with the play as text or       through its theatrical production.
Creating new cultural capital: The Arden edition of Double           Falsehood     Hammond's archival research on the provenance of Double Falsehood       convinced Bloomsbury Publishing to include his edition of the play as a       standalone volume in its world flagship Arden Shakespeare (3.1).
The       significance of this decision, of Hammond's research for his edition, and       of the academic and wider response to it was confirmed in 2011 when the       text of the single volume Arden Shakespeare Complete Works was       revised to include Hammond's text of Double Falsehood for the       first time.
Double Falsehood's inclusion in the Arden series       stimulated intense media interest and a range of activity (new editions       from different publishing houses, public engagement talks, lectures,       panels, reviews, productions, blogs) that contributed to the consolidation       of the attribution of Double Falsehood in the public       consciousness.
The play has begun to be accepted on the same terms and in       the same fora as other plays co-authored by Shakespeare.
The presence of       the play in these fora is testament in itself to the impact of Hammond's       research.
Creating wealth in the publishing sector     The publication and reception of Hammond's edition have been of both       commercial and cultural value to Arden: The wide international media       coverage surrounding the edition gave Double Falsehood currency as       a marketing tool (the play is currently advertised in a banner headline on       the front cover of the Arden edition (5.1)) contributing to `highly       unusual' sales figures for a `scholarly edition': Hammond's edition sold       6,166 copies between 2010 and July 2013; the 2011 single volume Arden         Shakespeare Complete Works, which includes Double Falsehood       for the first time, has to date sold 7,580 copies, a significant       proportion of these in the US.
The publisher of the Arden Shakespeare at       Bloomsbury Publishing PLC sums up the impact of the press coverage on the       Arden series as follows: `the coverage of the edition put Arden at the       front of Shakespeare scholarship ...
It was no doubt helpful to Arden's       general profile as the foremost edition of Shakespeare.'
(5.2) The Arden       edition has also added value to the wider industry of Shakespeare       publishing, stimulating subsequent editions of Double Falsehood by       other publishers: It contributed to CUP's decision, in July 2010, to       reprint a facsimile of the 1728 edition by Theobald (5.3) The play has       been included in the new AHRC-funded RSC Collaborative Plays by         Shakespeare and Others, eds.
Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen       (forthcoming Palgrave, October 2013) (5.4), thus consolidating Hammond's       findings and attribution within a major new collection from a rival       publisher.
The entire Arden edition, including all introductory and       annotatory material, was translated and published in Italian in 2012, with       Hammond's role in the play's recovery and attribution explicitly       referenced by the publishers.
(5.5) These publications are all part of the       international on-going scholarly and public debate around the shape and       extent of the Shakespeare canon and attest to the pivotal role of       Hammond's research within that debate.
Both Hammond's Arden edition and the subsequent editions it has       stimulated have made Double Falsehood accessible to a wider       public.
The `highly unusual' sales figures for Hammond's edition       demonstrate that public engagement with the research that underpinned the       play's rediscovery (through the edition's introduction and its extensive       textual apparatus) and with the play itself is extending significantly       beyond the audience who normally purchase scholarly editions (confirmed       also by its inclusion in public libraries in cities and counties including       Birmingham, Derbyshire, Devon, Hampshire, Nottinghamshire and Somerset,       showing diffusion of the text through the national library system, whose       demographic is largely extra-academic).
(5.6)     Creating cultural capital by adding to and informing theatrical         repertoire     The `interest generated by [Double Falsehood's] ... partial       acceptance into the Shakespearean canon has ... led to modern revivals'       (5.3): Amongst these, Hammond's Arden edition received its world premiere       in Calgary (Shakespeare in the Park, August 2010) and was the basis for       further productions by The Classic Stage Company in New York (March 2011,       audience 2,202), Maddermarket Theatre, Norwich, (March 2011), the KDC       Theatre (2011, audience 330), MokitaGrit in London (2011, audience 2440)       and theatterkikker (Utrecht) in 2012).
Hammond's research informed the RSC       staging of Cardenio directed by Greg Doran (3.4, and was       acknowledged in Doran's Shakespeare's Lost Play (5.7)).
Doran's       production was watched by an audience of 26,000 between April-September       2011 with 9,200 programmes featuring a centrepiece by Hammond.
(5.8) This       (rapid) translation of the play from page to stage has expanded theatrical       repertoire and by extension, stimulated new activity for actors and       directors.
In turn, it has enriched the imaginations of audiences who have       engaged with the play through its performance.
(5.9) Double         Falsehood's continued influence on the staging of `lost' plays is       shown by its being referenced in publicity for the production of the       `disputed Shakespearean comedy' Fair Em (Union Theatre, 2013; 	  http://www.fairem.co.uk/).
Raising public awareness of collaborative authorship, canonisation and         attribution     The media reception of the Arden publication - of an extent rarely       accorded to scholarly volumes &#8212; and penetration of the story into popular       culture focussed public attention on the underlying scholarly issues of       collaborative authorship, canonisation and attribution and as such stimulated         new public awareness and discussion:            Hammond was interviewed on the BBC Today programme (15.3.10),         one of over 30 radio interviews he gave to stations in UK, USA,         Australia, India, Canada and Colombia, simultaneously translated into         Spanish, including contributions for American National Public Radio         (18.3.10), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (18.3.10) and         Deutsche Welle (24.4.10).
The interest generated by the story was demonstrated by its being taken           up by major print media in the UK and internationally: articles,         many on the front page, appeared in inter alia, Guardian,         Times, Daily Mail, Telegraph, New York Times,         Wall Street Journal, Philadelphia Inquirer, Boston           Herald, San Francisco Chronicle, Chicago Sun-Times,         China Post, Straits Times.
Significant European coverage         included: Corriere della Sera, La Reppublica, El           Pais, Frankfurter Allgemeine, S&#252;ddeutsche Zeitung,         Dagbladet.
More locally, Radio Nottingham, the Nottingham           Post and later, the glossy Nottinghamshire Today featured         Hammond's work on the play, the last in a 4pp photographic spread.
At the intersection of academic and public reception are the positive           reviews given to the edition in TLS (21.5.10) and LRB         (2.12.10).
Public interest in and engagement with Hammond's findings and the         issues they raise is further shown by the research's penetration of           popular culture beyond interviews given by Hammond or syndicated         by media outlets.
For example, the story featured in columns by Frank         Skinner (The Times 19.3.10; reprinted in Dispatches from the           Sofa: The Collected Wisdom of Frank Skinner (Century, 2011),         169-71) and David Mitchell (The Observer 20.3.10; the online         version attracted 173 comments); a question on the play appeared in the         weekly news quiz featured in The Times and was even a prompt for         Radio 4's Thought for the Day.
Time Out covered the play         in both their London and New York editions.
(5.9)       The impact of the Arden edition on a range of audiences is further         demonstrated by the demand for Hammond to participate in local,           national and international public events relating to his research         on Double Falsehood.
This engagement activity was both unusually         extensive and continued well beyond the publication of the Arden edition         in March 2010, suggesting continued public interest: Talks by Hammond to         schools (e.g.
Oakham School), to local groups and audiences (e.g.
the         University of Nottingham Women's Social Club, the Nottingham Shakespeare         Society, the Lowdham Book Festival), to national special interest groups         (the Shakespeare Club of Stratford-upon-Avon, the oldest amateur         Shakespeare society in the UK, and the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust),         and international activity including lecture tours to Spain and to         Norway took place throughout the assessment period.
(5.10)       Public experience of and engagement with the play was enriched by dedicated           events for theatre audiences in which high-profile scholars and           intellectuals debated the issues raised by Hammond's research: The         Classic Theatre Company off-Broadway production (March-April 2011) was         accompanied by a Symposium in which well-known speakers (James Shapiro,         Stephen Greenblatt, Harold Bloom) engaged the theatre audiences in         post-show discussion; Hammond concluded the series.
In October 2011,         Nottingham Playhouse devoted a day to the play, opened by a talk from         Hammond and featuring a directed reading by Michael Fentiman of the         National Theatre.
