The impact of the ECU research is rooted in the fact that it was       commissioned by the ECU which works to further and support equality and       diversity for staff and students in higher education across the UK, and in       colleges in Scotland.
From its inception, therefore, the research was       fully engaged with and responsive to, the policy development needs of both       the ECU itself and of the wider sector that it serves, especially in terms       of evidence-based guidance to meet legal obligations and develop best       practice in the light of the new requirements relating to religion or       belief of the 2010 Equalities Act.
56 sector stakeholders engaged       with the project's report at a launch seminar held in London on 11.7.11.
Since publication on the ECU website, up until the 17th October       2013, there had been 1,351 unique views of the full report and 523 visits       to the Executive Summary.
In a statement on the launch of the report, the       ECU stated it would be "prioritising areas recommended within the         report for future work" A specific example of this was the project's       research into the acceptability among higher education staff and students       of religion or belief data monitoring questions; its inclusion in its own       survey of the category option of "spiritual" and the ECU's consultative       work with the Higher Education Statistical Agency that was informed by the       research.
The resulting impact of the research can be evidenced in the       current form of the HESA staff and student record religion and belief data       fields which include the UK National Censuses' data categories, but with       the addition of the category of "spiritual" used by the project.
This is       significant in that it goes beyond the categories used in the UK National       Censuses, while through HESA standards the reach of its impact extends to       the policy and practice of universities and higher education colleges       throughout the UK.

The "Religion and Belief, Discrimination and Equality" project       includes impact on policy development and understanding through Weller's       (2011) commissioned report for the EHRC on Religious Discrimination in         Britain: A Review of Research Evidence, 2000-2010 (Manchester:       EHRC).
Both this report and the wider project were cited (pp.
8-9) in The         Impact of AHRC Research 2010/11 - the AHRC's first annual Research         Performance and Economic Impact report for the Department of       Business, Innovation and Skills which, in its section on "Interaction with       Policy Makers" states that: "A research team at the University of         Derby, for example, is looking at religion, discrimination and equality.
The project team informed a new report for the Equality and Human Rights         Commission (EHRC)" and that "The project is also more widely         engaged with practitioners, government bodies, religious groups and         lawyers."
On Weller's EHRC report, the AHRC report quotes Dr. David       Perfect, Research Manager at the Commission who stated that it: "provides         new evidence about the nature and extent of religious discrimination in         Britain.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission will be using the         report to increase its understanding of this important issue and to help         guide its future work on religion or belief more generally."
A key       part of the project's research process involved five Knowledge Exchange       Workshops (Derby, 19.9.12; Oxford, 5.10.12; Manchester, 11.10.12; Cardiff,       25.10.12; and London 7.11.12) and involving 211 practitioners from       organisations in the religion or belief (106); voluntary and community       (45); public (40) sector; legal (12); private (8) sectors.
At these       workshops, the project's interim summary findings were presented by Weller       and discussed in plenary and breakout groups facilitated by Weller,       Contractor; the project Co-Investigators and the project's partner       organisation, the Multi-Faith Centre at the University of Derby.
On       feedback sheets, participants identified up to 3 hopes/objectives for the       workshops and whether these had been "surpassed", "satisfied", "not fully       satisfied", or "disappointed".
In total participants identified 263       hopes/objectives of which 23% were "surpassed" and 56% were "satisfied",       providing evidence that the workshops met many of the needs of a broad       range of practitioners/research users, while also contributing further       primary research data to the finalisation of the project's results.

As a result of a competitive application process, in which the       University's Centre for Society, Religion and Belief's Centre's research       leader in this field cited his research on religion and belief,       discrimination and equality, Weller was in 2010 appointed and served       (until the Panel's abolition by the present Coalition Government) as one       of 13 members of the expert panel on Faith providing confidential advice       to the Secretary of State, other Ministers and Civil Servants in the UK       Government's Department of Communities and Local Government on "engagement         with faith communities, and the impact of Communities and Local         Government policy on faith communities."
