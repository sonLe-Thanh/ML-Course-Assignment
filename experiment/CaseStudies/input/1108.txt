     Over the census period, the reach and significance of the       CTA/CTS research programme have been global.
The importance of the       Canterbury Tales project to cultural heritage preservation       is acknowledged by the National Library of Wales, the repository of the       Hengwrt Chaucer, the earliest extant Chaucer manuscript.
A digitised       version of the manuscript was prepared with DMU, using the techniques       developed in the CTA/CTS, and enabled the Library to better understand and       preserve the fragile parchment of one of its greatest treasures, providing       the widest textual archaeology of the Hengwrt manuscript and its scribe       explicitly for `the benefit of the public'.
Visitor numbers now total       approx 100,000 annually with over two million remote visitors to its site.
Building on the CTA/CTS research, the Library is now established as one of       Europe's leading centres for digitisation, and its three-year strategy for       agile electronic access 2011-14 is recognized as a model for facilitating       access to recorded cultures.
In the census period, the CTA/CTS work on a standardized system called       MASTER for manuscript description achieved catalogue integration across       the holdings of the Royal Library in the Hague, the Arnamagnaean Institute       in Copenhagen, L'Institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes in Paris,       the National Library of the Czech Republic, Prague, the Bodleian Library,       Oxford, the British Library, the Vatican Library and the Biblioteca       Ambrosiana, Milan.
This amounts to 61,000 manuscripts &#8212; the core of       Europe's rare manuscript holdings &#8212; being combined into a single       searchable catalogue using the CTA/CTS standard.
The latest manifestation of this is the EU-funded 5.57M euro ENRICH       project (2007-09), which explicitly builds on the basis of the CTA/CTS       achievement in this field.
This created a base for a digital library of       European cultural heritage, which made available more than five million       digitized pages for a wide range of non-academic users, including       `libraries, museums and archives, policy makers and general interest       users'.
Examples include the National Library of the Czech Republic,       Prague, Centro per comunicazione e l'integrazione dei media, Florence,       SYSTRAN S.A., Paris, and Biblioteca Nacional de Espa&#241;a, Madrid, Spain.
The XML-based Anastasia system enabled scholars working on       manuscript-based historical and literary projects to publish their       editions without additional technical support, and it has been adopted by       those working on ancient Biblical manuscripts of major theological         significance.
These include Digital Nestle-Aland, which is an       electronic version of the standard scholarly edition of the Greek New       Testament published in Stuttgart 2012 (ISBN 978-3-438-05140-0), and the       online edition of the Codex Sinaiticus, one of the most important       books in the world, produced in 2009 in an international partnership       between the British Library, the National Library of Russia, St       Catherine's Monastery and Leipzig University Library.
From 2007, this CTA/CTS standard for manuscript description officially       became the whole world's standard.
The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is       an affiliated organization of the International Standards Organization       (ISO) &#8212; itself a body with consultative status on the United Nations       Economic and Social Council &#8212; and it has adopted the CTA/CTS standard.
In       2002, the P4 version of the TEI guidelines (an interim release) adopted       the CTA/CTS approach to produce its first systematic instructions on       encoding manuscript descriptions, and the latest version, P5 published in       2007, fully incorporates the CTA/CTS work.
The CTA/CTS-initiated MASTER       project thus became the model for other projects attempting to build       inter-library union catalogues.
Because virtually all commercial publication of scholarly works uses the       TEI guidelines, the CTA/CTS standard has become ubiquitous in commercial       publications based on manuscript sources.
Virtually every publisher uses       TEI encoding when handling complex manuscript materials.
Typical examples       include Cambridge University Press, which used the CTA/CTS standard to       publish two volumes of the letters of Samuel Beckett in 2009-11 (ISBNs       978-0521867931, 978-0521867948).
In 2009, Leo Jansen, Hans Luijten and       Nienke Bakker edited the artist's letters using the CTA/CTS standard for       the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (ISBN 978-0500238653).
2,000 pages of       Isaac Newton's manuscripts have been digitized using the CTA/CTS standard       as part of Indiana University Press's `The Chymistry of Isaac Newton'       project.
Between 2009 and 2011, AMS Press of New York published three       volumes of the work of James Fenimore Cooper using the CTA/CTS standard       (ISBNs 978-0404644673, 978-0404644666 and 978-0404644796).
A full list of       projects using the TEI standard is given in section (5) below; all those       involving manuscript work use the CTA/CTS standard developed at De       Montfort.
