     The nature of our work on seabed and near surface imaging and       interpretation provides us with       wide reaching and significant impact across national and international,       commercial and       government sectors including: sonar product development; marine cultural       heritage management;       mineral resource management and assessment; expert analysis to major       offshore infrastructure       projects; military and law enforcement support; and commercial and       military sector training:     a.
Commercial: Technological Development 2D &amp; 3D Chirp Systems:       The work on 2D and 3D       Chirp systems have been subject to a commercialisation agreement [5.1]       best summarised by the       President of Kongsberg Geoacoustics Ltd. [5.2]: "The         developments in 2D Chirp technology         undertaken by UoS and feedback from their research projects using the         systems, have been         integral to the ongoing development of our leading sub-bottom profiler         products (c.&#163;2 million       income), whilst our current agreement with them to commercialise their         3D Chirp system is now         coming to fruition with the first systems being delivered to clients         (first sale to China in 2013).
Their         academic expertise in sub-bottom data processing and interpretation are         world class, helping us to         keep our products competitive in a truly global market and our         development grounded on cutting         edge but solid science".

Government Statutory Advisors &#8212; Heritage: Building on       HEFCE, Government and industry       funded research, UoS researchers have established an international       reputation for setting       standards for best practice in marine high-resolution geophysical surveys       for the investigation of       archaeological sites, with national and international heritage managers.
As recognised by the Head       of Marine Archaeology at English Heritage [5.3] "In terms of         impact on knowledge and innovation,         (the work of UoS) has significantly increased our knowledge and         understanding of marine         archaeological sites including historic wrecks and prehistoric         landscapes which are now         submerged.
The research has reached many sectors including marine         development environmental         impact methodologies."
EH have called on this expertise frequently,       most recently in the       development of their Marine Geophysical Guidance [5.4]       which "has been well received by         curators and industry" [5.3] and the inclusion of Dix on       both EH's Historic Wreck Panel and the       Expert Panel specially convened to advise the MOD on the sensitive site of       the Victory 1744       (2012-present).
Dix was also brought in by EH to deliver the UK       contribution, of regional and local       scale sediment transport models, to an EU web-based heritage management       system.
c. The Crown Estate Advisors &#8212; Geological: In addition to       work on archaeological sites our       expertise in near surface imaging and analysis of mineral resources has       been strongly endorsed       by the Head of Mineral and Infrastructure at The Crown Estate [5.5]       who summarised our impact       as follows: "When I took on the role of Head of Minerals and         Infrastructure at The Crown Estate         they (UoS) were the natural choice to bring into our network of         experts to provide rapid and         professional advice on all aspects of seabed geology.
The recent work         they have undertaken on         the sand resources of the Thames Estuary [5.6] currently         underpins our internal strategy of         resource management for this critically important area".
Marine       aggregate resources represent       revenue of c. &#163;15-20 million per annum to the Crown Estate.
d. Offshore Marine Infrastructure Development and Resource           Assessment: approaches to       the acquisition and analysis of geological and geophysical data for       cultural heritage management       have been adopted by two major environmental and engineering consultancy       firms AMEC Ltd. (a       FTSE 100 company with offices and projects in 40 countries) and Ramboll       Ltd. (190 offices in 21       countries).
With AMEC, Dix and Sturt have led the marine archaeological       component of two major       nuclear power station re-developments (Hinkley Point C and Sizewell,       client EDF, 2009-2016), and       with Ramboll they are responsible for the entire marine archaeological       component of the largest       UK offshore windfarm which is currently being built &#8212; the London Array       (Dong Energy, EoN and       Masdar).
When fully operational this windfarm will represent 7% of       Government's 2015 targets for       renewable sources.
As stated by an Associate Director of AMEC Environment       and Infrastructure       UK [5.7] "The approach to environmental impact assessment for         the marine archaeological record         developed by the UoS and used in collaboration with AMEC on the Hinkley         Nuclear Power Station         has been very well received by both the client (EDF) and the regulator         (EH).
The success has         been such that we are spinning out the approach to projects not just in         the UK but across our         global company."
In addition, Dix and Sturt have also provided       expert marine archaeological       support to major submarine pipelines and telecommunication routes (e.g.
the GLO-1 Cable route       Britain &#8212; Nigeria 2007-2008 and the Coots pipeline to the North Sea Carbon       Storage facility off       Teesside, 2008, both with METOC Ltd) and international power cables (e.g.
Britned, 2004-2005:       Britain &#8212; Netherlands).
In 2013, Dix and Sturt established a spin-out       group (Coastal and Offshore       Archaeological Research &#8212; Southampton) with c. &#163;320k of projects already       in place.
Dix and Sturt also led the geological and archaeological component of the       Outer Thames Regional       Characterisation project.
This was one of four Regional Environmental       Characterisation projects       commissioned by DEFRA as part of the Marine Environment Protection strand       of the ALSF.
These       developed understanding of the seabed geology and the biological and       historic environment assets       of the most intensively used stretches of water on the UK shelf.
This work       resulted in a publically       available report and WebGIS [5.8] which has had 830,750 hits since       June 2011.
This work also fed       into the Marine Aggregate Regional Environmental Assessment initiative,       that provided a strategic       view of future marine aggregate extraction activities and their potential       cumulative and in-combination       effects to ensure that individual dredging permissions are suitably       informed.
This       strategy has been endorsed by The Crown Estate and the Marine Management       Organisation.
e. Military and Law Enforcement support: following the       initial success of the 3D Chirp we were       approached by the Ministry of Defence in Salvage &amp; Marine Operations       to undertake a buried       object detection (including Unexploded Ordnance) survey in 3 Basin,       Devonport dockyard, prior to       its potential use as the storage site for the UK, decommissioned, nuclear       submarine fleet.
This was       fully accomplished and a pre-use dredging strategy was successfully       derived (permission was       granted for this data to be used for publication [3.5]).
Bull and       Dix were commissioned by the       Royal Navy (2002-present) to train staff and advise on the operations of       the Royal Navy's       hydrographic vessels.
This included attending sea trials, teaching at HMS         Drake and onboard the       vessels, and the writing of the Standard Operating Procedures for Chirp       systems on the RN's fleet.
Dix has also modified the techniques developed at UoS for the       investigation of marine       archaeological sites for the underwater detection of buried cadavers in       response to requests from       both UK and international law enforcement agencies.
As a consequence he       was made an Expert       Adviser for Hydro-Forensics for the Serious Organised Crime Agency [5.9]       and has, since 2008,       provided expert advice on 15 criminal cases both in the UK and abroad.
He       has been an invited       speaker at the Police National Diving and Marine Symposium (2012) and has       provided on-going       advice on underwater search strategies to the Home Office Science UK's       Centre of Applied       Science and Technology, the Australian Federal Police and the Netherlands       Police Agency.
f. Training and Personal Development: Since 2008 more than       180 people have been trained in       high resolution seafloor surveying, many of whom have entered the marine       surveying sector and       extended the reach of the techniques developed at UoS.
As stated by the       Managing Director of       Fugro-EMU Limited [5.10] "We have found the skills base in high         resolution marine geophysics of         the marine science students coming out of Southampton University to be         at the very highest level.
Consequently, the Fugro EMU Ltd Geosurvey group (as well as the wider         Fugro Offshore Survey         divisions and many of our competitors) has been, and continues to be,         underpinned by         Southampton graduates".
