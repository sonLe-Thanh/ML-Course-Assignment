    The findings of the Shakespeare and Keats food security project enhanced     public discourse by bringing back to the public's attention two well-known     English writers in a renewed context.
This generated public discussion of     current economic, political and cultural debates about sustainability and     resource distribution.
The international media attention generated by the     research also enhanced the cultural life of the wider public not only by     educating but also by encouraging creative responses to the subject of the     research.
The key finding from [3.1] that the site of Keat's cornfield in 1819 now       lies under a multi-storey car park (which was discussed with John       Humphreys on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme [23/3/12], and on BBC Radio       Solent's Julian Clegg Breakfast Show [23/3/12]), generated an impact on       the public's creative (cultural) lives such that Clegg remarked, `the       phone lines have been jammed all morning with callers ringing in with       their self-composed "Ode to an NCP Car Park" odes' [5.1].
The Telegraph       printed the editor's own `Ode to a Car Park' [5.2], and numerous websites       multiplied the story, enabling the wider public to reacquaint themselves       with the poem and to find an imaginative way into debates around food and       environment that were, this research finds, as relevant to the Romantic       period as to our own.
Newspaper coverage in the Guardian [5.3],         Telegraph and other nationals revolved around educational debates       about environmental and conservation issues.
This included The Daily         Mail's discussion of council planning and the loss of the Keatsian       cornfield and its attention to Winchester Tourist Board's `Keats Walk'       which prompted the Winchester City Council to consider revising the walk       to take in St Giles's Hill.
Head of Winchester City Council Ellen Simpson       said in response, `People are not being duped....but it is quite possible       that St Giles Hill was part of the walk, and that's where these       stubble-covered fields were' [5.4].
The research into Shakespeare's involvement in grain hoarding [3.2, 3.3]       generated significant worldwide media coverage (31/3/12-1/4/15), following       a front page lead column feature on the research in The Sunday Times       (31/3/13) [5.5].
Research findings also featured in four news bulletins on       BBC Radio 2 and on Terry Wogan's Easter Sunday Radio 2 Breakfast Show.
Evidence for Public Discourse is found in secondary media coverage and in       digital media: the critically framed `Voices' commentary by Howard       Jacobson in The Independent states that, `Piffle, too, is the       suggestion that Shakespeare is made more understandable by our seeing his       accounts' [5.6].
This indicates that the educative role of the study's       research was queried by some in a way which gave the general public access       to ideas about what is (or is not) educationally beneficial thereby       informing the public in a way that is enhancing to its cultural life.
A       blog entry from History Today, by contrast, accepted the findings       of the research in order to assert that, `A recent study of Shakespeare's       life outside the theatre provides another, much more compelling, solution       to the problem [of food-related "peculiarities" in Shakespeare's plays']       [5.7].The `sustainability and the literary imagination' element of this       research also reached a specifically arts-focused public through The         Telegraph Hay Festival (23/5/13) [3.4], with further media coverage       and interviews of Archer on BBC Radio 4's World and One (24/5/13) and BBC       Radio Wales's Louise Elliot Afternoon Show (28/5/13).
The wide range of national and international coverage and responses       indicates the media's perception of this research as marketable to a wide       public.
There was coverage and commentary in English German, French,       Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Taiwanese and Mandarin Chinese, including: The         Daily Mail (123 comments); LA Times (including an `opinion       piece'), El Mundo, History Today, The Mirror, BBC         Online, Huffington Post (600 comments), Telegraph, Independent,       Tagesspiegel, Forbes, Le Nouvel Obs, MSN, China         Daily and Shanghai Times.
Indicative headlines include `Was       Shakespeare a tax dodger?'
The Daily Mail, Bard was `ruthless       businessman who exploited famine and faced jail for cheating revenue'       [5.8] and `Forscher: Shakespeare war ein Gauner' (Researchers: Shakespeare       was a Hoarder), Der Tagesspiegel Welt [5.9].
The authors were       interviewed on BBC World Service's Newshour, featured on a Fox News       podcast and on American Public Radio; their research was used to create a       question to contestants on `Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'
USA (9/4/3)       [5.10]; and Russia Today TV financial commentators tweeted Marggraf       Turley: `Do you want to be interviewed on #KeiserReport       about the bankster bard?'
(31/3/13).
Blog responses to this coverage are indicative of the impact the research       has had on Public Discourse.
The role of academics and educators in public       intellectual life is discussed by KM (UK, 31/3/13) in response to The         Daily Mail article [5.8], with, `Yet another attack by academia on a       British icon.
Always be careful not to judge the past by our current       standards.
Who says we're the ones who've got it right?'
and by GoTerps       (1/4/13) in response to a Huffington Post article on the subject       [5.11], with, `A word of caution: When you see an article, such as this       one, with this attribution "according to a group of academics," there's       always reason to doubt the validity of the findings!
[...]'.
Others       comment on how to approach learning from the past for the benefit of       contemporary life.
With `Given they got this info because he was       repeatedly taken to court by the government for hoarding food while people       were starving, which was very much against the law... it seems he was       being judged for it by his contemporaries, no?'
[Kowtow (31/3/13)] [5.8]       and `What about our modern day Shakespeares?
Is this not part of our       current problem?
Except for us it is corporations and one single       entities.'
[AgingLady (2/4/13)] [5.11].
And there is also discussion of       the interrelation of literary creativity and material history, such as       `Oh, our cult of celebrity.
I love that the authors say no one wants to       think of a creative genius as having self-interest, yet I'm not supposed       to judge him harshly for being a profiteer, loan shark tax cheat because       he's a creative genius.'
[Brothaman2k (1/4/13)] [5.11].
These examples demonstrate that the research prompted individuals to       think and comment (negatively and positively) about historical issues,       favourite iconic authors, and current issues of concern like taxation and       food security.
All of which demonstrate that Remembering the Land has had       an impact on the cultural life of a wide public audience alongside       enhancing public understanding of major issues and challenges faced by       individuals and society.
