     Over many years the IBC has developed its portfolio of industrial users,       with bespoke processes       developed to meet the needs of the industrial customer.
Users for the IBC       facilities now come from       the UK and Europe, USA, Japan and Australia.
Work initiated at Surrey       generates millions of       pounds for the EU economy and contributes to cultural and societal issues       throughout the world.
In 2002 the University of Surrey was awarded the Queen's Anniversary award       for Ion Implantation       and Optoelectronics.
The citation reads;     "For over thirty years the University has been recognised as a           pre-eminent institution in the           field of ion implantation and optoelectronics.
Its innovative research           into these key           technologies has had an outstanding impact on the development of the           modern electronics           industry worldwide."
Work on silicon photonics led to the formation of a Surrey spinout       company SiLight Technologies       and a prestigious ERC grant, augmented recently by an EU commercialisation       award.
In 2008       Surrey took the lead role in &#163;5M EPSRC UK Silicon-Photonics-Consortium to       work on advanced Si       integrated optics.
Surrey's work has included joint patents with Intel on       ion-implanted erasable       Bragg-gratings, a technology that allows a route to full wafer device       testing methodologies at the       production level, which is now being implemented by Intel.
The IBC works with industry world-wide developing bespoke processes.
Much       of this work is       carried out via non-disclosure agreements.
Below are examples of the work       undertaken by the       IBC between 2008-13 for industry and the public sector, which reflect the       impact the IBC has       made.
Twin Creeks Technologies (USA) manufacture a new material for       solar-cell applications using a       technology devised by IBC (2008-2011).
This method can produce       solar cells for about 40 cents       per watt, half that of even the most cheaply produced cells coming out of       China.
Twin Creeks         Technologies believe that at 40 cents a watt, solar could quickly       become as profitable as       conventional fossil fuels.
Element6 collaborate with the IBC in       the fabrication of photonic structures       (2004-13) to produce commercial devices for quantum information       processing.
Coherent also use       the IBC for processing key enabling components for laser products.
They       say;     "They draw a direct competitive advantage from having the full           control over the processing           of these components, which they believe is only available at the IBC.
The ability to control           and tailor the implantation process to specific requirements enables           Coherent to offer           products with superior performance and reliability".
They also say           that "around a third of           their staff hinge on the products enabled by ion implantation at           Surrey".
They plan to           double their business over the next 3 years.
"Having access to the IBC           in the UK has           proven to be an immense advantage during the product development           phase."
For the past 10 years (2003-13) the IBC has been providing RFMD       and its predecessor Filtronic (a       manufacturer of RF integrated circuits) with ion implantation for their       optical modulators for high       frequency communications (up to 100GHz).
The IBC is also working with Raytheon         UK (2009-13)       to provide ion implantation processing for CMOS on silicon carbide high       temperature devices.
They       are in the process of providing commercial devices operating at 400&#176;C for       use in the oil, gas and       geothermal down hole electronics and aerospace markets.
In addition, over       the past 5 years       (2008-13) the IBC has provided ion beam facilities for 42 other Companies,       as well as 15 National       Centres and other publicly funded bodies.
DataFurnace is one of only 2 algorithms recognised by the International       Atomic Energy Agency       (IAEA) and is licensed to 23 laboratories world-wide.
The IBC uses its       analysis techniques and       DataFurnace to work on a variety of problems which impinge on the economy       and society.
These       include working with NASA, ESA and the Natural History Museum (NHM)       (2010-2013) to       determine the origin of craters on material retrieved from the Hubble       space telescope.
Interestingly,       most (&gt;80%) are found to be extra-terrestrial in origin; this has       impact on the planning of space       clean-up projects and long-term space missions.
The NHM said;     "With the help of the expertise and equipment at the IBC we have           been able to provenance           the origin of a much greater number of impacts on samples returned           from low Earth orbit           than would have been possible with more conventional techniques.
The           extra sensitivity           that has been obtained has helped us to identify which ... were           created by collision with           natural asteroid or comet dust particles, and which by orbital debris,           the result of human           activity in space."
The IBC has also worked with conservators at the Rosslyn Chapel in       Scotland (2010-13) to help       them re-create the original colours of the stained glass in the Chapel.
The Scottish Glass Centre       says;     "Without the help of the IBC we would have only been able to use           traditional and at times           conjectural techniques to establish missing detail but their           painstaking analysis has helped           us accurately re-create the windows and to return them to their former           glory".
The IBC has also analysed Jane Austen's hair (2010) and, although it       contains more arsenic than       would be expected in the current day, it seems unlikely that she was       deliberately poisoned!
In the       field of biomedical applications a Network led by the IBC played a vital       part in making the case for       proton beam therapy (PBT) in the UK (2004-13).
This involved bringing the       clinical community       together and making a case for its adoption to government.
The Chair of       the National Cancer       Research Institute's CTRad Working Group, says;     "The work of the IBC was instrumental in bringing the community           together, ....
The           foundation provided by the Network facilitated the early work of           developing the case for           PBT, and through the Network the IBC can legitimately take some of the           credit for the           government announcement in January 2012, that two PBT centres would be           developed in           England."
