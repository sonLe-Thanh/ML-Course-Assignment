     In recent years, there have been major changes in both Japanese central       and local child welfare       policy and legislation, culminating in 2010 in the publication by the       Ministry of Health, Labour and       Welfare (MHLW) of the `2010 Vision for Children and Childrearing' which       advocates: much greater       use of adoption and fostering, greater investment in keeping birth       families together, and the       massive reduction in the average size of residential units for children in       care.
The impact that the       research undertaken by Goodman had on the debates which led to these       reforms was due to the       fact that his was the only research written by a foreign scholar on this       topic (foreign scholars are       often drawn on in internal policy debates in Japan) and that it became       widely disseminated in       Japan after it was translated by one of Japan's leading child welfare       policy-makers, Tetsuo       Tsuzaki.
Beyond its policy impact, Goodman's book Nihon no Jid&#333;y&#333;go       (see above) has become a       textbook on many social work courses in Japanese universities[1,           2], and his research has helped       raise public consciousness in Japan on the rise of reported rates of child       abuse (see for example:       Roger Goodman, 2000, `Jid&#333; Gyakutai no "Hakken" to Senmonka no Fuzai' [The       `Discovery' of       Child Abuse and the Shortage of Specialists], Asahi Shinbun, 29       May, which was a specially       invited column in the Asahi newspaper, daily circulation 11.4 million.)
1 Political, administrative and practical impacts     Since its publication in Japanese, this research has been drawn on in     relation to a number of major     recent changes in Japanese state policy for looked-after children and young     people.
Collectively,     these reforms presage a radical change from the situation described in the     research in the late     1990s where 90% of children lived in children's homes with, on average, over     sixty residents.
In     future, one-third of children and young people in state care will be placed     in foster homes, one-third     in community group homes and one-third in children's homes[i].
In relation to the last of these, the     Ministry also determined that, within a decade, no children's homes will     house more than 40     children in total.
Several local governments have recently set up local     initiatives to increase the     number of placements in fostering while reducing those in children's homes;     the proportion of     looked-after children in foster homes in Fukuoka, which was only 6.9% in     2004, had increased to     24.8% by 2010.
Many MPs and local politicians in Japan have begun to argue for greater       opportunities for this       disadvantaged group in Japanese society and for an improvement in       provisions for care leavers,       including housing, training and income maintenance.
Until recently,       children have had to leave care       homes as soon as they left full-time education (which can be as young as       16).
Recent policy now       defines `looked-after children' as under 18 years old, which can be       extended to under 20 years old       if it is necessary, and a ministry administrative notice states that       children with disability can stay       longer than 20 years old[ii].
Greater awareness of all the above issues has been aided by the Japanese       version of Goodman's       book published in 2006.
MPs from the Social Democratic Party (when it was       in opposition) referred       to the work as evidence in the Committee Session on Children's Social       Care, including Hosaka       Nobuto who is now the Mayor of Setagaya Ward in the Tokyo Metropolitan       Council, which has       taken a lead in this area.
Tetsuo Tsuzaki is a member of numerous government advisory panels on       child protection issues       and probably the best known scholar in Japan working on issues of Japanese       child protection.
He       has stated that:     "Professor Goodman's social anthropological work on Japan's orphanage         system has had         enormous impact on child welfare policy as well as on academic world.
Prior to his work academic         research into indigenous management of orphanages was virtually taboo in         children's social care         field across Japan.
His work set out a sort of climate in which more         open discussion and research         should be undertaken amongst people concerned.
His elaborate research         into what went on in         Japan's orphanages was shocking as well as revealing not only to         academics but also to         administrators in central and local governments.... To sum up, his work         has been widely or         universally cited in any serious research into Japan's children's social         care policy and practice and         it shall be providing the lasting impact on policy and researches of         child welfare, particularly of the         best interests of children and young persons deprived of normal family         life in Japan for at least next         quarter a century"[3].
According to Toshikazu Takahashi, Chairman of the Japanese Society for       Residential Child Care:     "Professor Goodman's work, especially the book, Nihon no Jid&#333;y&#333;go         (undertaken from the         perspective of an external and neutral observer), has been widely read         and had a major impact on         the way that both practitioners and policy-makers in Japan have looked         at the system of child         protection.
It significantly influenced the terms of the debate which         led, most recently, to the 2010         policy changes in Japan for children in care"[4].
The Japan Bar Association drew on Goodman's research in their argument       for the better treatment       of children in care and for the need for Japan to sign up to the UN       Convention on the Rights of the       Child.
The work has also been referred to in many blogs and on-line sites,       for example where local       councillors have described how it was the first time they became informed       of what has been going       on in Japanese children's homes[iii].
Impact on Training and Research       The main Japanese publication from this project, Nihon no Jid&#333;y&#333;go,       is currently used, according       to web searches, in over 200 Japanese universities and colleges who       specialize in child protection       (including major programmes at Kyoto Furitsu University[iv];       Shukutoku University[v]; Japan College       of Social Work, Senshu University, Rikkyou University, Dokkyo University)       as a text on       programmes for training social workers.
Moreover, the use of the       ethnographic method and the       idea that social problems are to an extent socially constructed &#8212; a       methodological approach and a       theoretical innovation first introduced into the literature on       looked-after children in Japan via this       research project &#8212; can be seen in projects which are currently being       undertaken in Japanese social       policy by Japanese researchers and which are having a direct effect on       social work training and       research.
Examples of major works published in Japanese on looked-after       children, which       acknowledge a debt to the approach pioneered in this research, include Children's         Homes and         Social Exclusion[vi] and The Process of         Children's Lives in Children's Homes[vii] both       published in       2011.
The research has also been widely presented in social policy and       social work departments in       universities in the UK, US and Hong Kong as representing an example of       this approach as a mirror       in which to examine local practices (see Goodman, 2008, above).
