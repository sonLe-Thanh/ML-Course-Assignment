     The series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 (5a).
It was split into       three segments of 30       programmes, each of which aired over six weeks, Monday to Friday from       3.45pm to 4pm (15 Sept.       to 24 Oct. 2008, 19 Jan. to 27 Feb. 2009 and 1 June to 10 July 2009).
The       five programmes from       each week were condensed in an hour-long Omnibus edition, broadcast on       Fridays at 8pm.
The       weekday programme attracted some 350,000 to 400,000 listeners; the figure       for most of the       Omnibus programme was close to 500,000.
BBC Radio 4 audience research centres on the `Audience Index' (AI).
This       measures the degree to       which people make a special effort to listen to a programme.
The first       series scored 82, the second       86 and the third 85 &#8212; giving an average for the whole run of 83.
`Very       good' is defined as 75; the       average for the Radio 4 is 79 (5f).
In the week of 16 Feb. 2009, for instance, the series America, Empire         of Liberty was rated 3rd       among BBC programmes across all BBC radio stations.
Its AI of 86 placed it       above `Wake Up to       Wogan' on BBC Radio 2.
`The Archers' was in 22nd place (5g).
The `tab cloud' showed that the most frequently used words in listeners'       responses were       `interesting', `informative', `excellent' and `fascinating'.
Specific       comments on the final omnibus       programme included: `This has been an unexpected joy to listen to .
.
.
If       someone had told me I       would have found the history of American politics so fascinating I would       have laughed in their face'       (Female, aged 47); `A masterpiece: accessible to general listeners or       those with a sound       knowledge of American history (Male, 61); `Excellent and informative       program.
It is so good that I       bought the book' (Female, 68) (5f).
The series won the Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer Award for       Excellence in Broadcasting, 2008, for       the Best New Programme or Programme Series.
These awards are based on       voting by members       of the VLV, which represents ordinary listeners and viewers rather than       the media industry, and is       therefore indicative of public outreach (5b).
The series also received a SONY Radio Academy Nomination, 2009, for the       Speech Award.
The       SONY awards are judged by media professionals.
The judges commented: `This       programme       brought out some of the inherent contradictions and ironies in American       society.
The judges felt       that it offered them a lot that was new about America and helped them to       see the country with       different eyes' (5e).
Because of his series Reynolds was also short-listed for the Orwell Prize       in 2010, given to those       who come closest to George Orwell's ambition `to make political writing       into an art'.
Reynolds was       short-listed for the Orwell Journalism Prize, one of 7 finalists from the       original 85 entrants and the       only academic on the short-list (5c, 5d).
The impact of Reynolds' work was demonstrated by the BBC's decision to       re-broadcast ten       programmes about the American Civil War in April 2011 to coincide with the       150th anniversary of its       outbreak in 1861.
These were also re-issued separately as a BBC CD.
The Controller of Radio 4 (from 2004-10), wrote that the series `had a       dramatic impact not merely       on its audience &#8212; but for Radio 4 as a whole'.
It was commissioned to show       that radio could       produce `ambitious multi-part series...authored and presented by       historians at the top of their       profession' such as television had featured since the 1990s.
Its       `combination of academic rigour       and accessible production created a new grammar for Radio 4 &#8212; and one that       has been emulated'.
`There is very little indeed which made me more proud at Radio 4 than this       series.'
