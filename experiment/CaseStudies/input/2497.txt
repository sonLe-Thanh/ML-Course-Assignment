Operational decision making during the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull 2010 eruption         (Primary Impact)     Pathway, significance and reach: Thordarson and Icelandic       colleagues (Gu&#240;mundsson, H&#246;skuldsson of U. of Iceland) led the team       collecting samples and on-site observations during the E2010 eruption       (funded by a NERC Emergency Grant, as listed in Section 3).
The on-site       results collected by Thordarson's team were delivered, via the U. of       Iceland and the Icelandic Met Office [A,B], to the London Volcanic       Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) based in the UK Met Office.
The VAAC forecasts       the movement of volcanic ash plumes in the UK, Iceland and the       north-eastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean, aiding flight safety.
The       particular observations made by Thordarson's team on 21 April 2010 showed       that the level of ash generation had diminished significantly [A,B]       and hence provided material support for the decision by Civil Aviation       Authority, informed by VAAC, to relax airspace restrictions over Europe on       23-24 April 2010.
This led to a shortening of the period and extent of       closed airspace, which independent sources estimate was affecting up to       ten million travellers and costing the airline industry up to &#163;130M per       day [C].
Strategic planning for future volcanic hazards (Primary Impact)     Pathway: Thordarson's research on historical Icelandic eruptions       has underpinned advice to UK Government on the economic, health and       environmental impacts that may arise from future events that are much       larger than E2010.
In particular, Thordarson was invited to join the UK       Cabinet Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE), chaired by the       Chief Scientific Adviser, during the E2010 eruption.
As a member of the       SAGE Volcanic Hazards Assessment Subgroup, Thordarson contributed to the       indicative scenarios for the Volcanic Ash Planning Assumptions paper in       April 2010 [D] and meeting minutes from SAGE in May/June 2012       evidence interaction with the Civil Contingencies Secretariat to develop       planning assumptions [E].
Thordarson was also "a key person" at       The Cabinet Office workshop on `Effusive Eruption Source Characterisation'       (May 2012), contributing to the evidence base for a 'Laki-type eruption'       scenario [F].
The outcomes of this workshop led to the inclusion,       later in 2012, of such eruptions in the UK National Risk Register of Civil       Emergencies (NRR).
Advice and data provided by the Edinburgh team has also       influenced the work of specialists involved in hazard prediction,       mitigation and health assessments.
Significance and reach:            The 2012 NRR document states: "Following consultation with           geological and meteorological experts [...] the assessment is that           there are two main kinds of risk from volcanic eruptions.
The first is           an ash-emitting eruption, similar to that in 2010.
The second [...]           which could have widespread impacts on health, agriculture and           transport, is an effusive-style eruption on the scale of the 1783-84           Laki eruption in Iceland.
This second type of eruption is now one of           the highest priority risks in the NRA and the NRR."
[G].
This is the first time that the UK NRR of Civil Emergencies has included         volcanic risks and the first instance of a European register ranking         flood lava eruptions as the principal volcanic threat.
Thordarson and Stevenson advised the Met Office on changes to the         input parameters to their atmospheric dispersion model during the May         2011 Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn eruption [H].
Stevenson's work during E2010 paved the way for the development, with         the British Geological Survey (BGS), of a citizen-science sampling         programme, which was trialled during the Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn eruption and allows         for much improved constraints on distal tephra dispersal, as can be         corroborated by the Head of Volcanology at the BGS [I].
Public engagement with, and understanding of, volcanic hazards         (Secondary Impact)     Pathway, significance and reach: Between the onset of E2010 and       May 2013, Thordarson provided &gt;20 solicited media interviews and was       cited in &gt;60 on-line articles (&gt;20 countries), with combined       circulations &gt;50M [J].
Stevenson's popular science blog       Volcan01010       (http://all-geo.org/volcan01010/)       had 1,200 views per day (from 94 countries) during the Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn eruption,       with content extensively used in news sources such as the Economist       and Guardian [J].
