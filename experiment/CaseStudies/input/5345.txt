     Impacts include: health and welfare, economic, public policy and       services, practitioners and services       Main beneficiaries include: patients, NHS, GUM clinics/professionals     The concern in the United Kingdom and Europe was that an unidentified       pathogen(s) playing a role in NGU might cause disease in women.
No       clinical distinction was made between asymptomatic and symptomatic       urethritis and the risk of having a sexually transmitted infection.
It was       assumed that the risk in all men with NGU was similar, irrespective of       clinical presentation.
Thus, it was common practice in the UK and Europe       for all men requesting screening at a GUM or Sexually Transmitted Disease       clinic to be tested for urethritis using a urethral smear.
Those       identified with urethritis, irrespective of symptoms, were informed they       had a sexually transmitted disease, given anti-microbial therapy and       advised that their partner(s) needed treatment and they needed to       re-attend for a repeat smear, after completing treatment.
If urethritis       was again detected, further treatment was administered and a further visit       advised to confirm resolution of infection.
As a result of our work (research references 1, 2, and 5), the 2008 UK       and 2009 European NGU guidelines advised that only men presenting to GUM       clinics with symptoms or urethritis i.e.
discharge, dysuria and penile       irritation or testicular pain should be tested for urethritis by urethral       smear and that asymptomatic men do not need a urethral smear [1, 2].
Consultations for asymptomatic men are now shorter and can be undertaken       by more junior staff (therefore, are less expensive) using non-invasive       testing for chlamydia and gonorrhoea by nucleic acid amplification tests,       enabling many more men to be seen using existing facilities.
The 2008 UK       and 2009 European NGU guidelines advised that asymptomatic men       post-treatment of NGU are not required to re-attend for a repeat urethral       smear and that follow-up can be undertaken over the telephone [1, 2].
Impact on the economy:     In 2007 890,000 men attended GUM clinics of whom 66,000 had urethritis.
By 2012, this increased to 1.7 million men, of whom only 2,500 had       urethritis [3].
Approximately 50% of men with symptoms have urethritis       diagnosed microscopically from a Gram stained urethral smear, thus the       total number of men receiving a urethral smear in 2012 was approximately       105,000.
The number who potentially would have been offered a urethral       smear using the guideline prior to 2008 would have been 1.7 million.
If we       assume a 75% uptake (conservative estimate) in the remaining 1.6 million,       this would equate to an estimated 1.2 million urethral smears that would       have been unnecessarily carried out annually.
The impacts of this are:            Lower cost of a male consultation, as a urethral smear is no longer         required.
A smear takes 2 minutes for a band 7/8 nurse or a doctor to do         at a cost of &#163;1.45 per minute = &#163;2.90.
It takes 5 minutes for a band 5/6         nurse to stain and read the slide at &#163;0.75 per minute = &#163;3.75.
Costing a         total of &#163;6.65, excluding materials, per patient i.e.
&#163;7.98 million       Fewer men diagnosed with asymptomatic NGU.
Previously, they would have         been given a diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection and their         partner would have needed to be treated.
Before the guidelines were         changed in 2008, approximately 66,000 NGU cases in men were diagnosed         every year.
In 2012, these numbered 52,500, a reduction of 13,500 (18%).
By comparison, diagnoses of other STDs in GUM clinics either remained         the same or increased.
Assuming a partner notification efficacy of 40%,         this means that there were 5400 fewer women treated as a result of being         in contact with men with asymptomatic NGU.
Each new patient costs &#163;150,         saving &#163;810,000.
Figures calculated from R &amp; D costs.
Prevention of pain in men, which likely has contributed to higher         attendance, as fewer men are put off attending for screening.
A urethral         smear can cause pain in some men equivalent to that of childbirth in         women [4].
Prior to 2008 66,000 men were diagnosed with acute NGU and all would have       been asked to re-attend [3].
In 2012, 52,500 symptomatic men were treated       for acute symptomatic NGU of whom 15% would still have symptoms       post-treatment [1, 2, 3] i.e.
7875 of the remainder approximately 75%       would have returned, if instructed to do so.
Thus, approximately 33,500       re-attendances have been avoided which at &#163;100 for a follow-up visit would       have saved &#163;3.35 million.
Thus, cost savings now compared to prior to 2008 when urethral smears       were carried out on men without symptoms of urethritis:       &#163;7.98 million + &#163;0.81 million + &#163;3.35 million = total &#163;12.14 million     Savings would have been re-invested in GUM services, enabling more people       to be seen for a given departmental budget.
Thus, the research       significantly contributed to helping clinics in the UK achieve and sustain       the government`s 48-hour access target for GUM clinics (2008) [5].
