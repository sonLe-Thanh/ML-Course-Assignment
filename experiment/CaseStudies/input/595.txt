     Young Lives research is conducted in partnership with independent and       government research organisations in each country.
This collaborative       approach enables direct involvement by policy-makers in the whole research       process, allowing them to influence research questions, and to directly       use findings in national and sub-national policies.
The initial results of the Young Lives project led to more specific       policy advisory requests, including: Plan International: `Because I am         a Girl' reports 2010-11 (&#163;4,000) and 2012 (&#163;3,000); DFID for World       Bank: World Development Report 2011 (&#163;18,000); UNESCO: Global         Monitoring Report on skill development 2012 (&#163;6,000), and effects of       educational opportunity and inequality on learning outcomes 2013 (&#163;6,000);       Save the Children UK: impact of environmental shocks on children for Rio         Summit on Sustainable Development 2012 (&#163;6,000), on stunting and       education outcomes for Food for Thought report for G8 Summit       pre-meeting 2013 (&#163;1,600), parents' views of school quality for report on       accountability 2013 (&#163;1,200); Oxfam GB: climate shocks and food and       nutrition security 2013 (&#163;2,200).
SCUK and OSI/PERI also co-funded the       Young Lives school survey in Ethiopia (2012 and 2013).
World Vision UK       commissioned advice and training on research on children's work (2013) [see         Section 5: C1].
Poverty and inequality:     Dercon was commissioned by the World Bank to produce a background paper       (since published as [R4]) for the World Development Report         2012.
Gender Equality and Development and the report draws on the       paper to illustrate gendered effects of nutrition, income reversals and       family aspirations [C2, pp 41, 85, and 116].
This, and other Young       Lives research [R2], was summarised for a policy audience in a       2013 report by Martin Woodhead, Paul Dornan (Young Lives policy officer)       and Helen Murray (former Young Lives policy officer) What Inequality         Means for Children: Evidence from Young Lives.
This report was       submitted to the UNICEF/UN Women thematic consultation on inequalities for       the Post-2015 Development Agenda (and ranked fifth out of 180 submissions       for downloads).
A substantial part of Woodhead et al (2013) was       incorporated into the UNICEF/UN Women submission to the UN       Secretary-General's High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015       Development Agenda [C3, pp 44-6].
Young Lives analysis of inequalities was further developed in a paper       based on children's accounts of living in poverty published with Save the       Children and launched at the UN High-level Panel meeting in Bali [C4].
Understanding children's perspectives is essential in shaping polices,       particularly for those seeking to deliver on the post-2015 agenda.
Young       Lives research has been used by UNICEF for their forthcoming contribution       to the UN Secretary-General's Report on the Girl Child (2013) and       contributed more broadly to consultations on the post-2015 agenda:       according to the Director of the UNICEF Office of Research and the UNICEF       Senior Adviser Post- 2015 Agenda: `Young Lives' analysis directly informed       the global UN Consultation on Inequalities which was part of the       consultations for the Post-2015 Development Agenda, showing how multiple       disadvantages in early life have been undermining children's lives' [C6].
Save the Children have also incorporated Young Lives analysis into their       briefing for the IF Hunger Campaign (June 2013) [C5, pp iv, 5, 10,         17-18].
Inequality is increasing within all four of the Young Lives study       countries, and the programme's model of research on poverty and inequality       has been replicated at country level.
According to the Director of the       UNICEF Office of Research and the UNICEF Senior Adviser Post- 2015 Agenda:       `Young Lives research ...[provides] important insights for UNICEF       advocacy, policy and programme design, and...[is] especially valuable at       national level in the 4 countries...' [C6].
In Peru, effective use       of communication channels allowed Young Lives findings on inequalities in       children's cognitive development to feed into the development of Cuna         M&#225;s, the new early childhood programme.
Findings on the Juntos       conditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme `confirmed the assumptions of our       technical team on several variables' and fed into improvements developed       by the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion, according to the       Executive Director of Juntos [C7].
Furthermore, the       Director of the Poverty Reduction and Equity Department at the World Bank       confirmed that `the fact that Young Lives has three rounds of survey       available, plus comparative data for four countries makes it incredibly       valuable for the development community ... its current and potential       impact on policy is each time [therefore] more powerful'.
This led the       Peru office of the World Bank to utilise Young Lives data for a report on       inequality [C8].
Internationally, Young Lives research       on inequalities in school systems [R5] is informing DFID's       programming [C9], Save the Children advocacy [C10, pp 12, 13,         28-9] and UNESCO monitoring [C11, pp 2, 52, 56, 189].
Child protection:     Orphanhood: Young Lives analysis was used as part of the       consultation on a new policy framework for orphans and other vulnerable       children in Ethiopia, and formed the basis of a further study which       challenged the assumption that parental death alone results in poorer       outcomes for children (Crivello, G, and N Chuta (2012) `Rethinking       Orphanhood and Vulnerability in Ethiopia'.
Development in Practice       22 (4): 536-48).
This work led to the foundation of the first       child-focused research-to-practice forum in Ethiopia, supported by UNICEF       and hosted by the Ministry of Women, Children and Youth Affairs.
Child labour: This research led to an invitation to an       International Labour Organisation- International Programme on the       Elimination of Child Labour (ILO-IPEC) meeting in Turin in February 2010       on hazardous child labour, and information gathered there fed into       development of further research on children's agricultural work (Morrow,       V, and U Vennam (2012) `Children's Responses to Risk in Agricultural       Work'.
Development in Practice 22 (4): 549-61).
Harmful traditional practices: following Boyden et al.
(2012)       (`Child Protection and Harmful Traditional Practices'.
Development           in Practice 22 (4): 510-22) and continued efforts to influence       policy in this area, Young Lives was involved in drafting the new       `National Strategy on Harmful Traditional Practices against Women and       Children in Ethiopia' with the Ministry of Women, Children and Youth       Affairs, and in drafting the new national Child Protection Strategy in       Ethiopia in April 2013.
The Oak Foundation sponsored a Child Protection Colloquium in Oxford in       May 2011, at which the key principles of empirically grounded policies       relating to child protection were elaborated.
A special issue of Development         in Practice based on papers presented at the colloquium was       published in 2012, and has informed a consultation on child protection       policy at the UNICEF Office of Research, Florence, and UNICEF New York,       which will reshape global approaches to child protection [C6].
Young Lives research on children's work is being incorporated by World       Vision UK into revised programming on children's work [C1]; and       used by Save the Children Canada and Plan International to promote a focus       globally on eliminating hazardous child work rather than prohibiting all       forms of work by children.
Young Lives child protection research has been       incorporated into a UNICEF report on social protection and child       protection (2013) [C6].
The Bond Child Rights Group (formerly DFID/CSO child rights working group       of 20 UK NGOs and research organisations working on child rights in       international development and foreign policy) uses a model Young Lives       piloted in 2012, bringing researchers together to discuss their work to       strengthen the use of evidence and best practice.
This process of building       capacity of researchers and practitioners for evidence-based policy-making       was documented by Gina Crivello and Helen Murray in 2012 (`Why       Strengthening the Linkages between Research and Practice is Important:       Learning from Young Lives'.
Young Lives Policy Brief 19),       highlighted on DFID's Research to Action Global Guide to Research Impact.
Young Lives was shortlisted for the `Analysis and Use of Evidence' award       in the UK's 2013 Civil Service Awards, one of three nominees in its       category.
The awards recognise outstanding teams or individuals who have       `innovated, impressed and made a difference in their area'.
There were 570       entries, of which 39 were shortlisted [C12].
