     Our meta-analysis of early feeding in 2001 was the first level 1a       evidence to show there is no benefit in keeping people "nil by mouth"       after gastrointestinal surgery.
The British Medical Journal commissioned a       lead editorial in the same issue, by two internationally renowned       nutrition experts, who commented: `What impact could the findings of         this systematic review have on daily surgical practice?
The review shows         that there is no clinical benefit to starving patients in the early         postoperative period after gastrointestinal resection.
Further, the         finding that postoperative infections can be reduced and hospital stay         shortened by starting early postoperative enteral nutrition should         challenge clinicians to consider this treatment.'
[a] Guidelines       followed and the original meta-analysis and Cochrane review are widely       cited in Nutrition Policy documents [b, c].
Guidelines in Europe and the UK &#8212; Enhanced Recovery of patients       After Surgery (``ERAS'') is now the focus of perioperative management and       key aspects of perioperative care include re-establishing oral feeding as       soon as possible after surgery.
In the UK in 2009, The Association of       Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, issued guidelines for       implementation of enhanced recovery protocols [d].
`Patients should be         allowed oral fluids as tolerated on the day of the surgery and built up         to an oral diet over the next 24 hours.
Patients who are not meeting         their nutritional requirements by 72 hours after surgery should be         assessed by a dietician'.
This recommendation is based on our       meta-analysis of early enteral feeding [1,2].
In 2009 [e] and 2012 [f] the       ERAS group cited the meta-analyses [1, 2] as evidence for post-operative       nutritional care in an `evidence-based protocols for optimal perioperative       care'.
Early post-operative nutrition is now embedded, as a key element of       ERAS programmes in the UK and the meta-analysis [1, 2] was a key motivator       for the adoption of early feeding.
Researchers at the University of       Bristol and Peninsula Medical School had highlighted the benefits of       post-operative nutrition prior to the implementation of ERAS programmes.
The multimodal nature of ERAS now makes it impractical to assess the role       of nutrition alone, so our evidence describes the key role of early       feeding.
A recent study of an ERAS programme showed 57% of patients now       take feed within 24 hours of their surgery (Gustafsson U. et al Arch         Surg.
2011; 146: 571-7 DOI: 10.1001/archsurg.2010.309)     Uptake projects internationally &#8212; The reach of the work [1, 2] to       other countries can be demonstrated, where it has translated into everyday       practice and justification for changing national perioperative care       policy.
People in the Netherlands remained exposed to unnecessarily       prolonged starvation after abdominal surgery and The Dutch Institute of       Healthcare Improvement intervened in 2009 [g].
They made an explicit link       to our work as a justification to change practice: `The most recent         scientific evidence regarding early nutrition is summarized in a         Cochrane review, [2] which shows unequivocally that early feeding is         feasible and safe.
This is translated into useful recommendations that         link up with everyday practice in the Guidelines on Enteral Nutrition of         the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition [c] and the         consensus review of clinical care for patients undergoing colonic         resection of the enhanced recovery after surgery group [b]' They       successfully introduced early feeding to over one quarter of all Dutch       hospitals in a nationwide collaborative project &#8212; patients were eating 3       days earlier and 65% were eating a normal diet after only 2 days [g].
In       2009 they concluded: `The present nationwide collaborative effort was         successful in implementing a change towards an early start of oral         nutrition after abdominal surgery'.
So, as a result of the research       [1, 2] they have achieved a change in practice.
The beneficiaries of the impact are patients and the health service       &#8212; `Traditional nutritional management of patients undergoing major         abdominal surgery has involved a period of ``nil by mouth'' with         nasogastric decompression followed by a clear liquid diet that gradually         progresses to regular food on the 4th to 5th day post- operatively.'
Although the evidence `for the safety, feasibility and benefit of         early postoperative nutrition, surgical patients in the Netherlands'       (had remained) `exposed to unnecessary post-operative starvation [g, h].'
How have patients benefitted?
&#8212; Early postoperative nutrition       helps decrease the negative impact of the metabolic response to surgery.
The re-establishment of oral feeding as early as possible has become one       of the key aspects of modern multimodal recovery programmes [b, g].
Trials       of ERAS showed (that included early feeding as a key component) show that       ERAS programmes reduce length of stay and are safe [i].
Work on       peri-operative feeding [3] has shown that even when small amounts of feed       are consumed surgical patients have metabolic benefits, which is reflected       in improved physiological measures and indicate fewer post-operative       complications.
How have Health Services benefitted?
&#8212; Overall the reduction in       hospital stay among people fed within 24 hours corresponds to about one       day, which is economically important.
Reduction in complication rates may       explain this observation, as might a faster return of gastrointestinal       function.
The reduced number of infections is also important in regard to       costs of interventions.
Perioperative feeding supplements reduce weight       loss and complications and are cost effective [j].
In the wider context,       studies of the economic impact of ERAS (including early post-operative       feeding) have shown a reduction in costs associated with ERAS [k] and a       Norwegian study has found that `nursing care time per day was reduced       after implementing the ERAS protocol' [l].
The economic benefits of ERAS       are thus substantial.
