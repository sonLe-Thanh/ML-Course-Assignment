     Bringing in political-administrative context to improve regulatory         impact analysis in the OECD and World Bank:     The research findings showing that regulatory reform produces       dysfunctional learning when it is insensitive to administrative and       political context shaped policy and practice in the OECD and World Bank       (Radaelli 2004; 2009, Dunlop and Radaelli 2013).
CEG has a long term       relationship with regulatory policymakers in these organisations through       which research findings have been communicated.
The CEG research informed       training programmes for regulators in Exeter, Portugal, Italy and       Washington DC over the period 2009-13.
Officials participated in other       workshops and seminars at Exeter including the ECPR Regulatory Governance       Conference in June 2012 which had more than 200 participants from academic       and policy-making organisations.
Researchers in CEG published their       findings and the implications for policy makers in accessible diaries and       regulation tales, for example:       http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/ceg/research/ALREG/presentations.php       http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=197638080284796     The research findings changed OECD's policy to embody a more       context-sensitive approach to regulation rather than assuming a one size       fits all approach.
CEG research is specifically referenced in two OECD       strategic publications.
The first, 2008's Building an Institutional         Framework for Regulatory Impact Assessment: Guidance for Policymakers,       cites two of Radaelli's papers and notes how `OECD countries have gone a       long way reflecting on institutional and contextual components of       regulatory decision-making'.1 Chapters 4 to 6 of the document       set out ways in which different political, legal and administrative       structures should be taken into account by officials undertaking       regulatory impact analysis.
The second, 2009's Regulatory Impact         Analysis &#8212; A Tool for Policy Coherence,2 cites Radaelli's       `better regulation tales'.
The `tales' about impact analysis contain       narrative depictions of a range of potential future regulatory landscapes.
The framework helps improve policy analysis by policymakers identifying       existing patterns and mechanisms at work behind them, which helps them       learn about the reasons for previous reform outcomes and helps them plan       effective future reforms.
The research similarly influenced the World Bank to take more account of       context in regulatory quality and impact assessment.
Influence came       through publications used by the Bank, especially through papers in the       World Banks' flagship `better regulation for growth' programme.
The       papers, titled Overview of Regulatory Quality Indicators and Project-Level         Indicators were read by staff.

As well as influence through publication, Radaelli gave advice in a panel       to the Bank's Foreign Investment Advisory Service.
He helped produce a       full-length guide to impact assessment for the World Bank Institute in       June 2008 which was used in the first WBI global core course on regulation       in Washington D.C.3 Radaelli led on the course to 40       policymakers from Africa, Asia and Europe.
The Lead Private Sector       Development Specialist, IFC-World Bank, said that he learned in `subtle       yet decisive ways' (Communication to Exeter, Oct 2013) about the       limitations of conventional impact tools through CEG's events, training       programmes, informal discussions and the two Bank working papers.
He cited       Radaelli as `the political scientist with the highest impact on my own       thinking and activities' and confirmed that the research changed the way       they measured and communicated regulatory performance, as reflected in       World Bank country project evaluations of regulation.4     Improving the Netherlands Government's processes for learning about         regulation from other countries:     Radaelli and team used their research on the role of social mechanisms in       learning about regulation (Radaelli 2009, Dunlop and Radaelli 2013) in a       study, commissioned by the Netherlands Government, in 2010.
Research       findings about the most appropriate ways to learn from cross-national       transfer of instruments informed the recommendations.
The study, How         to Learn from the International Experience: Impact Assessment in the         Netherlands &#8212; final report for the Dutch Parliament (2010) http://ikregeer.nl/documenten/blg-69895       developed the implications of the findings for the Netherlands.
The study       was accepted by the Dutch government and discussed by the Dutch Parliament       before its principal recommendations were put into practice.
The key       guidance implemented was that regulatory policymakers they should identify       and understand the mechanisms that make institutions work rather than       attempting to import policy instruments and institutions as plug and play       tools in isolation from their context.
The head of the Dutch Regulatory       Reform Group, Ministry of Finance, said 'We used the report to develop a       new Impact Assessment system as part of the new regulatory reform policy       which was described in a White Paper.
'5     Developing and applying new measures of regulatory performance in the         OECD:     The Centre's research findings have changed the way regulatory       performance is measured and communicated (Radaelli and De Francesco 2007;       Radaelli et al 2012).
This is an especially important consideration at       times when governments try to cut both the direct and compliance costs of       regulation which can risk failing to fully consider the benefits as well       as the costs of regulation.
CEG researchers worked on a project jointly       sponsored by the European Commission and the OECD on regulatory measures       to assess the quality of regulations.
This research was presented to the       Commission Directorate-General Enterprise and developed into a major       research output (Radaelli and De Francesco 2007).
A senior official of the       European Commission (Secretariat General) commented `The effects in terms       of how research evidence is utilised today in my team are tangible.
His       research helped us to change prevalent beliefs about the production and       usage of impact assessment in the European Commission and more broadly the       EU.
'6     Following the interest amongst policy-makers at the European level, the       OECD Regulatory Policy Committee approached Radaelli to produce a report       developing the implications of their research on measuring regulatory       performance for the OECD's practice.
The report was the result of an       extensive exchange of communication between the OECD delegates on the       Committee and the researchers.
Radaelli and the OECD secretariat worked       for two days (in Madrid, Sept 2011) to forge consensus on the principles       and contents of regulatory indicators for measuring the quality of       regulation.
Delegates requested further work on specific indicators and       how they should be used.
Radaelli's importance in this process was noted       by the OECD Programme Coordinator for Measuring Regulatory Performance who       said `Prof. Radaelli was involved throughout the workshop to help shape       agreement among delegates on best practices in regulatory policy       evaluation.
', continuing that `The suggestions informed the development of       a framework for regulatory policy evaluation and a survey of OECD       countries on their indicator practices, paired with recommendations to       member countries on how to improve their evaluation practices.
'7       The final paper underpinning the OECD document is available at http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/2_Radaelli%20web.pdf.
The OECD secretariat then presented the, separate, formal OECD document       that came from the process, A Framework for Regulatory Policy         Evaluation, to member states in April 2012.
The Framework was       circulated as recommended guidance to OECD delegates and contains several       references to Radaelli and Fritsch's work and officially endorses their       list of indicators.8
