     Measurement of disease activity in SLE is central to evaluating the       severity of the disease and identifying patients at risk of developing       chronic damage or dying, indicating what type of treatment a patient       needs, evaluating whether or not they respond to therapy and can be used       to identify differences in disease manifestations amongst patient groups.
The BILAG 2004 index has been used increasingly worldwide for the       assessment of disease activity in lupus patients in clinical trials and       clinical practice since it was shown to be reliable, valid and sensitive       to change, as it is the only validated index that shows activity in nine       individual systems rather than a combined global score.
The BILAG 2004       index has had an impact on clinical practice, patient         management and the ability of pharmaceutical companies to       obtain approval for the use of new treatments for lupus.
Impact on Pharmaceutical Companies and Guidance for Industry       Until recently the only drugs licensed for lupus were hydroxychloroquine       and corticosteroids.
Other drugs have been used but both steroids and       other immunosuppressants cause a lot of toxicity.
Until the late 1990s       pharmaceutical companies were not keen to undertake trials in a complex       multisystem disease like lupus because of uncertainty about how to measure       appropriate disease end-points.
However with increasing need for better       therapies due to the significant mortality and morbidity of lupus,       multiple clinical trials of new SLE treatments have been conducted in the       UK and internationally over the last 10 years, that have incorporated the       use of the BILAG system of assessing disease activity (1, 2).
Many of       these trials were set up by investigators or companies that were not       involved in the design and validation of the BILAG 2004 index.
Recommendations produced in 2009 by international members of the SLE Task       Force of EULAR included the use of the BILAG system for the assessment of       activity in clinical trials (3).
Furthermore, guidance relating to the use       of the BILAG 2004 index has also been incorporated into the US Federal       Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry: Systemic Lupus       Erythematosus &#8212; Developing Medical Products for Treatment, which was       published in 2010.
On page 7 of the document (4) it is stated: "Several         indices exist that mirror the assessment of experienced clinicians and         are sensitive to changes in disease activity.
The BILAG is the preferred         index to study reduction in disease activity in clinical trials.
The         BILAG scores patients based on the need for therapy; therefore, the         clinical interpretation of a change in score is apparent."
This       document goes on to discuss how the BILAG indices can be used in clinical       trials in more detail (4).
Over the last 5 years there has been increasing use of composite       end-points in lupus clinical trials using several disease activity       instruments so that efficacy of treatment is demonstrated as improvement       without worsening by more than one instrument (2).
The BILAG 2004 index       has been incorporated as the central score to show improvement in the       BILAG based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) (5).
A representative of the       company UCB wrote (5) "It was important to have a sensitive efficacy         assessment instrument, endpoints that are clinically meaningful to the         treatment of this patient cohort and a placebo response which is limited         enough to reveal the response of an effective treatment...Composite         endpoints have greater power than individual tools to identify         differences between treatment groups, which is particularly useful in         SLE, where patient populations are heterogeneous and disease progression         is unpredictable.
The BILAG-2004 index was selected as the central score         on the basis of its comprehensiveness, ability to capture partial         improvement, incremental changes in disease activity, changes in         individual involved body systems and the clinical relevance of its         scoring system...The positive results of EMBLEM&#8482; study proved BICLA as a         robust, sensitive, composite, endpoint incorporating multiple disease         activity indices, each of which emphasises different aspects of SLE         activity....
The BILAG-2004 index, used as the key compartment of BICLA         in EMBLEM&#8482;, is a comprehensive validated tool for assessing disease         activity in all organ systems, and is capable of measuring incremental         improvement."
The BILAG index is also a component of the SLE       Responder Index (SRI) that was set up by another independent panel of       lupus investigators.
The SRI is based on showing improvement in the SLEDAI       without worsening by the more comprehensive BILAG index or physician's       global assessment.
Landmark trials with the SRI were published in 2011       (and tested Belimumab, the first drug licensed for SLE in 50 years) (2).
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) draft guideline on clinical       investigations of medicinal products for the treatment of SLE, cutaneous       lupus and lupus nephritis was published in early 2013 and recommends the       use of the validated composite indices that incorporate the BILAG indices,       both the BICLA and the SRI (6).
To promote optimal clinical trial data       collection using the BILAG 2004 index and the SLEDAI, the Lupus Foundation       of America (a charity supporting lupus research and education) has set up       a training and testing site which is available for the training of       investigators worldwide and for pharmaceutical company staff involved in       clinical trials; reflecting the impact of these instruments on lupus       research (7).
This provides further evidence of impact that BILAG 2004       index has had on investigators and pharmaceutical companies wanting to       demonstrate outcome of the disease and efficacy of new drugs for lupus       which will benefit patients as they gain access to new drug options.
Impact on Clinical Practice       In 2010 the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), an organisation       representing patient, healthcare professionals and scientific societies       across Europe, recommended the use of such a disease activity instrument       for routine monitoring of lupus patients (8) and in 2011 it was       recommended as a quality indicator (9).
The NHS England Clinical Reference       Group (CRG)for Specialised Rheumatology has recommended the BILAG 2004       system specifically in 2013 as a pre-requisite assessment for both       eligibility and outcome assessment for SLE patients being considered for       high cost drugs in the UK (10).
The Rheumatology CRG Chair wrote "The         impact of the BILAG indices also extends directly into improving the         routine NHS clinical practice and care of our patients.
For people         living with lupus, which can follow an unpredictable course, including         the risk of major life threatening disease in any organ system, the         ability to accurately assess disease activity and severity is a         paramount importance to routine clinical care" (10).
Thus the BILAG       2004 index is becoming a routine assessment for patients with this       complex, life-threatening multisystem disease in UK clinical practice and       abroad, as well as a tool for clinical trials and observational studies on       disease outcome.
