     "I thoroughly enjoyed playing 'Hide in the Attic' by Piers         Hellawell at Kings Place although I was a bit scared performing in front         of the audience.
I loved the piece and the way that Piers Hellawell         created loads of spooky sounds using different techniques.
I learnt so         much from the experience practising with professional musicians and         loved being part of the quartet."
Dominic Bury, Year 6     The musicality of a group of young people was transformed by Hellawell's       work in the project Chamber Music 2000, to which he has contributed four       works, played by school ensembles across England and as far away as the       USA.
Two concert events have been the focus of this 365) included       Hellawell's A White Room for four young players and the       world premiere of his new piece for very young musicians, Hide In           The Attic; ii) on 9 March 2013 the latter piece was given       again, by another team of young players, from Forest School, as part of       events curated by The Schubert Ensemble at King's Place, London (420       seats).
The main circle of impact from Hellawell's work has been on the       young players themselves: "On stage it was amazing, because the actual         concert hall had a great atmosphere and I felt like I was a proper         musician.
That will be a life time memory for all of us."
Angelo       Donovan-Maddix, Year 5     The core of the impact was to widen the children's experience of what       musical material can offer and their expertise in performing it: as they       responded to the interactive environment of small ensemble work, they used       their instruments for material that was timbral, percussive or semi-       improvised for the first time.
The research in these pieces opened the       children to the many different constructions taken by music &#8212; a revelation       usually given (when at all) to more advanced learners.
"My favourite         part of the piece is my improvisation section at the end."
Danny       Drennan, Year 6     In 2010 Hide In The Attic was studied by 8-year-olds from       Hampstead GS Junior School, before they gave its world premiere at the       concert.
Teacher Sarah-Jane Gibson reports: "As an educator I observed         them change from young girls who enjoyed playing their instruments into         young performers, and the memory of that still warms my heart today.
Soon after the event one of the young girls returned to Japan.
Last         year, I received a brief message from her through a friend who had been         to visit her.
She said that she still remembered her experience at the         Southbank Centre."
A White Room had been workshopped in 2010 at both King's       College School, Cambridge and at the Junior Royal Academy of Music, London       with members of the Lawson Trio, and was then performed by the King's       group at the concert.
Teacher Simon Brown (KC School) reported: "I         liked the way in which every instrument had to "lead" from time to time         - it was an excellent piece for teaching the reality of balance within a         mixed chamber group."
The young players were thus highly receptive       to their encounter with new materials; these mixed standard (coordinated)       time-keeping for four diverse individual parts with more experimental       sections.
Even the younger age-group of Hide In The Attic       responded to these new techniques: "The syncopated rhythm kept         changing so required the utmost concentration.
I was nervous when I got         on stage but when we started it was fine and flew by."
Will Telling,       Year 5     Beyond the immediate circle of impact on these young musicians a wider       legacy has been delivered to other performing groups, since, by the time       of the February 2010 London showcase, the work had already reached as far       away as Boston, U.S.A., where (in 2009) Rodney Lister wrote "I teach         at the New England Conservatory.
I have a little chamber music group         that I coach.
They're all nine years old.
They just played (25-1-2009)         at the NEC Prep School Chamber Music Festival and, a week later, at its         contemporary music festival, A White Room by         Piers Hellawell."
Positive impact from this research reached beyond the young generation of       musicians via the context of these performances; these were heard by a       large adult audience with many players and composers from the scheme       present &#8212; both those acting as workshop facilitators in this project and       those engaged in writing themselves &#8212; to whom Hellawell's achievements       demonstrated what is possible in this simple framework.
Indeed his works       have become canonic as instruction on the scheme: founder William Howard       wrote "We play A White Room ourselves whenever         we do a seminar for composers about CM2000.
The last time was Sept 25th         (2012) at Birmingham Conservatoire, where we were launching a CM2000         project for composition students."
Bernard Hughes, reviewing the       2010 event at http://www.bernardhughes.co.uk/?tag=chamber-music-2000, wrote     "The composer who has contributed most to Chamber Music 2000 is Piers         Hellawell, and he was represented by two pieces for students and two         full-scale concert works....
Hide In The Attic was         the most successful of the pieces for students, played with impressive         self-possession by a very young quartet from GSJ School in London.
The         piece cleverly mixed notated and aleatoric passages without the joins         showing, and the young pianist Mina Masuda gave a brilliantly assured         performance."
