     The impact of the research was apparent in the influence upon policy       debate and decision-making at various levels within the Department of       Health (source 1, 4ii), Monitor (the FT regulator) (source 4iii), and the       wider NHS (source 4).
The research was a unique academic contribution to       the public understanding of autonomy of FTs (source 3).
Beyond academic       dissemination, it achieved reach and significance in shaping debate and       influencing policy towards further development of FTs.
The Health Select Committee held an inquiry into FTs hearing in 2008,       just after the 100th FT was authorized.
It deemed that it was       important to appraise this reform and its contribution to NHS performance,       especially given the "surprising lack of published evidence" (source1i       p.5).
Exworthy (the only academic to give evidence) spoke to MPs about       organisational autonomy and the emerging impact of the government's policy       on FTs.
The Committee heard that the research had revealed various       dimensions of autonomy (such as the distinction between freedom from       government and freedom to innovate), and had exposed the caution       which many FTs were displaying (despite the apparent entrepreneurialism       and innovation which was supposed to be engendered).
This evidence shaped the Committee's conclusions regarding the extent of       autonomy in the NHS and the impact of FTs' decisions upon neighbouring NHS       organisations.
The research was cited 12 times in the Committee's report       (source 1i).
Further, three of its recommendations were linked to       Exworthy's evidence:     #20: The Department of Health should, as a priority, commission research       to assess FTs' performance objectively.
This will require access to FT       data.
Researchers have found it difficult to access such data.
This should       be centrally collected by Monitor and published.
(source 1i paragraph 113)     #23: Unfortunately, there are persisting concerns about what level of       government intervention in FTs' affairs is legitimate.
We recommend that       the Government clarify what the appropriate levels of intervention are.
(source 1i paragraph 116)     #24: FTs' use of their autonomy and the relationship between FTs, their       regulator, and Government should be included in the Department of Health's       evaluation of FTs' progress which we have recommend above.
( source 1i       paragraph 117)     Exworthy's contribution to the Committee's inquiry received comment from       the leading trade journal (source 2).
The Director of Delivery and Development, NHS Trust Development       Authority, and former DH civil servant responsible for the design and       implementation of Foundation Trust policy says of the Exworthy research: "His         research was crucial as it shed light, for the first time, on the ways         in which NHS Foundation Trusts were using (or not) using their new found         autonomy and crucially explained the reasons for this" and "His         research proved very instrumental in the development of the policy up to         and beyond the 2010 general election in terms of shaping the evaluative         criteria for Foundation Trusts, considerations about the speed and         impact of extension of the FT policy to poorly performing Trusts and the         stronger emphasis on the subsequent `private income' cap for Trusts (as         an incentive for further improvement)".
(source 4 i)     According to a Managing Director, NHS Leadership Academy (and former CEO,       Sheffield PCT, a participant in the process of impact delivery: "His         results were striking...
I am confident that Mark's results will prove         vital to Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in developing their new         roles of the local commissioners of health services."
(source 4 ii)     Senior Fellow at King's Fund and Director, Global Healthcare Group at       KPMG and former Director of Policy at the NHS Confederation (NHS       employers' organisation) says of the evidence arising from the research: "This         evidence was important to the decision-making of FTs themselves but also         to Primary Care Trusts (the then local commissioners of services from         FTs), other NHS Trusts, Monitor and the Department of Health.
...this         contributed significantly to the decisions about the speed and impact of         extension of the FT policy to poorly performing Trusts and the stronger         emphasis on the subsequent `private income' cap for Trusts."
