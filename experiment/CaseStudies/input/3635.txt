     Recent German history continues to arouse strong emotions.
Fulbrook's       work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding       among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government       representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,       families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public       nationally and internationally.
Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and         in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little         discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the       role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,       as well as later self-representations.
This impact was conveyed through       the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances       (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several       million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1].
In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December       2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold       5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook).
It received acclamatory       reviews in the international literary press.
The New York Review of         Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June       2013; circ.
135,000).
The Times Literary Supplement (15 February       2013, circ.
100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the       personal into such compelling conjunction'.
Jonathan Yardley, reviewing       what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December       2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account       is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their       wider significance.
The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)       stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for       `complicity in evil acts' [1].
The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in       several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;       1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);       Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000       daily listeners);.
Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition       to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly       readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History         magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are?
Magazine       (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323).
Cross-media posting further       widened visibility e.g.
the Washington Post review was posted on       the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and       included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom         and Resistance (January-February 2013).
An interview with Marshall       Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times       between December 2012 and July 2013.
Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks       at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at       Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and       included members of the general public, along with historians, educators       and people with personal connections to the Holocaust.
Other events were       organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro       Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies.
In New       York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book       Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March       2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,       where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present       [4].
The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.
Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world       have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of         themselves, their families and communities.
In the German press, for       example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her       for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was       ever possible for the "Third Reich" to have developed in what was a       "Kulturnation"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled       relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.
Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails.
One German wrote: `On a       personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have       rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'.
An       American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very       uncomfortable question.
Where in 2012 are our blinkers?'
A child of       survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should       generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure       that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with       bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making.
And then convinced       themselves that they were innocent.'
Many more could be quoted [5].
Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the         legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.
Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo       Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first       post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine       Westphalia 1954-1975).
On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture       at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives       of the Rhineland Regional Council.
As a result of Fulbrook's research the       Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory       biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].
Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and       media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.
These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University       Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in       a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on       `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7       November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000).
The significance of Fulbrook's       work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings       and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,       including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14       Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)       and the Institute for Civic Education [7].
Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German         history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely         used educational resources.
In 2007, she released a documentary film       on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,       based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using       archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews.
1,000       copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching       and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres       in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London       (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to       learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8].
Sections of       the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level       history syllabus.
Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and         Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,       2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText       materials and CD Rom.
These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR       research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under       Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised       syllabus.
Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and       the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary       educators for The Historical Association [9].
Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign       Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level       students and teachers.
Sovereign Education state that her presentations       `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and       that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has       made to their A level understanding and performance'.
Indeed, `many go       away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'.
Their       evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged       the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'       [10].
