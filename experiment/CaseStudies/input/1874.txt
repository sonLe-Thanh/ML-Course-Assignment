     Heritage's work brings culture to the centre of the agenda... Heritage         is well known across Brazil as intellectual, teacher, researcher,         international mediator and creative artist, whose engagement to the         nation's social development... is recognised by his wide circle of         interlocutors with admiration, solidarity and gratitude.

In his stagings of Shakespeare in slum areas in the middle of         tremendous violence where different groups of heavily armed drug         traffickers confronted each other on a daily basis, art brought peace to         the region.
It was enough for many to realize that it was a concrete         possibility worth fighting for.

I and other senior colleagues have been actively engaged in debate, in         reading your papers, in exchange with this programme [Points of Contact]         that aims to increase the capacity of artists, policy makers and funders         to realise the full potential of dynamic and transformative cultural         actions.
Partly as a result of this engagement, we designed and launched         a new 10 year programme, Creative People and Places which seeks to         engage communities in the UK in new and radically different approaches         to develop inspiring and sustainable arts programmes.
- Moira       Sinclair, ACE Executive Director London and the South East [see section 5]     Heritage's research seeks contemporary purpose in creative practices, and       insists that social justice, development and enterprise are only possible       through the inclusion of those who are behind the `doors on the       peripheries' (Soares).
His influence on new thinking in cultural policy       and new forms of artistic practice is evidenced through inter-connected       research projects.
From dance projects with marginalised communities in       the Amazon and a music-theatre production at London's Young Vic (Amaz&#244;nia       2008-09) to the curation of a three-year programme of youth leadership       with five major UK cultural institutions (Cultural Warriors       2009-12), Heritage's ongoing and deep-rooted contribution to the       development of the cultural dialogue between the UK and Brazil has been       recognised by Arts Council England with funding of over &#163;410k to `support       both the research and the practice that is informed by that research'.
Moira Sinclair, ACE Executive Director London and the South East, cites       the ways Heritage's work influences and informs thinking and policy       development `in arts, culture and social development and in the growing       understanding of Brazilian culture and the deep networks that are being       established as a result between UK and Brazilian artists and policy       makers'.
David Lan, Artistic Director of London's Young Vic Theatre,       positions Heritage as `a passionate and intensely imaginative       collaborator, adding immensely to our theatre vocabulary and ambition'.
The capacity of the UK arts sector has been developed by the support       Heritage's research has offered in identifying/programming/curating       Brazilian artists at British institutions including Barbican (2006, 2008,       2010, 2011), Young Vic (2008-present), Southbank Centre (2010, 2012),       Salisbury International Arts Festival (2010-12), Liverpool Theatres       (2010), Dance City Newcastle (2009), The Globe (2000/2012).
Heritage's       production of Rio Occupation London brought &#163;600k of Brazilian       economic investment in the UK's London 2012 Cultural Olympiad Festival.
30       young and emerging artists representing diverse cultural territories from       Rio de Janeiro presented more than 250 new works of art and performances       in over 50 cultural and public spaces across London reaching over 37,000       audience members, spectators and participants.
The project generated c.125       articles [print/broadcast/ online].
Social media reached 382,209 and the Occupation's       Twitter feed had 513 followers.
The production's overall Klout score of       52.87 in 30 days was a `significant achievement.
This qualifies @RioOccupy       London as a specialist with a highly engaged audience' (PR analyst Mark       Borkowski).
`It is unarguable', states Graham Sheffield, Director of Arts       at the British Council, `that without the work of Heritage, the cultural       relationship between UK and Brazil would be nowhere as well developed or       mature as it is now' [see section 5].
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg invited Heritage to join a delegation of       political, business and cultural leaders to Brazil in June 2011.
Heritage       briefed Jeremy Hunt (then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport)       on key aspects of Brazilian cultural policy and practices in advance of a       signing of a Cultural Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and       Brazil during the ministerial visit.
In 2012, Heritage co-created a project in partnership for People's Palace       Projects, Battersea Arts Centre, Contact Theatre and the Ag&#234;ncia de         Redes para a Juventude (Rio de Janeiro) which was awarded the annual       Gulbenkian Prize - described by the Independent and the Huffington         Post as `the world's largest arts prize' (&#163;175,000).
Andrew Barnett,       Director of Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation UK sums up Heritage's       contribution as `instrumental in the formation of important work being       progressed by the Gulbenkian Foundation... none of these developments       would have been possible without the inspirational leadership and       knowledge of Professor Heritage'.
