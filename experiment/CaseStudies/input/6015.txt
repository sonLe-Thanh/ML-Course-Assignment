     The impact of the research reaches to international levels and national       and local levels in the UK, and has significance for the allocation of       funding for NGOs in Western Europe, national-level policy priorities in       the UK, and service delivery at regional-level in the UK.
The changes       resulting from the research include:     Impact on funding for NGOs in Western Europe for action against racist         violence and support for victims     Iganski's research on the harms of hate crime led to a commission for a       cross-national EU study of racist violence which in turn led to the       allocation of funds to NGOs by the Open Society Foundation.
The impacts of       the research on the allocation of funding and support for victims at       international-level is described by testimony provided for this case study       by the Director of the European Network Against Racism (ENAR):     "ENAR...the largest European advocacy network on racial equality &#8212; has       been collaborating with Dr Iganski since 2009, when ENAR decided to become       more active in advocacy in the field of racially motivated hate crimes and       enlisted his expertise.
ENAR had been impressed at the time by Dr       Iganski's book Hate Crime and the City and his sensitive approach       to victims, which takes into account the reality of the perpetrators as       well.
First, we invited Dr Iganski to speak at an ENAR seminar on       supporting victims of racially motivated hate crimes.
ENAR members       provided extremely positive feedback to his presentation and work.
As a       consequence, ENAR decided to cooperate with him further.
In 2010, the Open       Society Foundations commissioned ENAR to compile a trend mapping report on       racist violence and crimes in Europe.
Dr Iganski was offered the       coordination role of the research, guiding and overseeing the national       authors, and drafting the final European report (Iganski 2011 Racist         Violence in Europe, Brussels: ENAR, launched at a meeting       held by the European Parliament's Anti-Racism and Diversity Intergroup in       March 2011.
This report had a tremendous impact both for ENAR's future       funding as well as on the funding policies of the Open Society         Foundations.
It confirmed that anti-racist activities and       organisations in Western Europe need to be supported to compensate for the       sharp decrease in public funding, on the one hand, and the dramatic surge       of anti-democratic political parties and movements, which had an impact on       victims of racist violence, on the other hand.
As a consequence, the Open       Society Foundations commissioned further studies that led to the       establishment of the Xen Fund for anti-racist organisations working in       Western Europe in late 2011."
Impact on national-level policy for tackling hate crime in the UK     Iganski's research illuminating the psychological and emotional impacts       of `hate crime' upon victims has informed national-level policy in the UK       as testified by the Hate Crime Programme Manager at the Ministry of         Justice, UK, who has written that:     "My personal view is that hate crime tends to cause more harm than       comparable `random' crimes, that they have a broader effect on communities       and create an enhanced fear of crime.
Whilst these views were commonly       accepted, it was important that they could be substantiated and for that       we relied on the research of key academics.
Amongst the most valuable was       the research of Dr Paul Iganski from Lancaster University.
His work to       understand the findings of the British Crime Survey was invaluable to us       because it was the most definitive evidence that hate crime did have a       greater psychological impact on the victims."
(Giannasi, P. [2014]       `Academia from a Practitioner's Perspective: A Reflection on the Changes       in the Relationship between Academia, Policing and Government in a Hate       Crime Context' in Neil Chakraborti and Jon Garland (eds.)
Responding         to Hate Crime: The Case for Connecting Policy and Research, Bristol:       Policy Press).
And in testimony specifically provided for this impact case study Paul       Giannasi states that:     "Since I came into post in 2007, his (Iganski's) influence has been       significant on a formal research basis but also on a collaborative and       informal level.
Most notably, though, his analysis of the British Crime       Survey has underpinned policy.
It provided us with conclusive proof that       hate crime 'hurts more' than similar non-targeted crime, a principle that       has motivated government and CJS agencies and was cited in Government       Action Plans."
Impact on service delivery at regional level in the UK     Following a commissioned evaluation of their Race Hate Awareness         &amp; Prevention service, Iganski joined with the Preston &amp;         Western Lancashire Racial Equality Council and Lancashire Constabulary       to apply his research findings on the impacts and consequences of hate       crime to developing the design and delivery of their `Effective       Interventions in Addressing Hate' training in 2012/13, for staff and       patients at Lancashire Care NHS Trust's medium secure forensic psychiatric       hospital, Guild Lodge.
In the sessions Iganski presented his key research       findings on the harms of hate crime and also understandings of how       perceived hurts can provide the contexts for offenders' actions.
Informed       by these understandings, in group work exercises and discussions involving       case studies of incidents that have occurred in the hospital, participants       discussed how they might support staff and patients who are victimised in       hate incidents.
Evaluation comments provided by participants demonstrated       the impacts of the understandings shared, and changes in thinking among       participants, about the harms of hate crime:            `Affects the person internally as it is about their personality &#8212;         something they can't change'.
`Understand definitions and psychological impact more'.
`Helpful to understand legal and psychological aspects of hate crime &#8212;         a learning curve for me'       `More empowered how to intervene if patients are abusive'          In testimony provided for this case study, the manager of the Race         Hate Awareness &amp; Prevention service has noted that "Dr Paul       Iganski's evaluation of our project has been invaluable in further       highlighting the harms caused by hate and the vital role NGOs play in       supporting victims of hate crimes.
The evaluation has allowed victims'       voices to be heard and this will undoubtedly shape future policies and       service provision in this area.
Dr Paul Iganski's wider work on the harms       caused by hate is firmly embedded within the psyche of many practitioners       and policy makers in this field and it continues to inform both strategic       and grass roots responses, as there is an enhanced understanding of why       hate hurts more".
