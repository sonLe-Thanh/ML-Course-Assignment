            Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 0.5-1.0% of the population and         causes significant pain, debilitating fatigue, joint deformity, and         psychological distress.
It affects people's abilities to perform         everyday activities and causes work disability, which can reduce         financial status.
"Approximately one third of people stop work           because of the disease within 2 years of onset, and this prevalence           increases thereafter.
The total costs of RA in the UK, including           indirect costs and work-related disability, have been estimated at           between &#163;3.8 and &#163;4.75 billion per year."
NICE           Clinical Guidance 79        Supporting people with arthritis in managing their pain and fatigue,         and supporting Occupational Therapists (OTs) to develop effective         self-management and joint protection methods for people with arthritis         when taught using educational-behavioural approaches, significantly         reduces pain, improves functional ability, and in the long-term, limits         hand deformity development.
Self-management education is a key approach used in Rheumatology by         OTs and other team members to help people with arthritis practically         manage symptoms, improve psychological outlook and maintain ability to         perform everyday home, work and leisure activities.
The OT and         self-management education research led by Hammond, has addressed three         key areas helping:            People with arthritis manage their symptoms and everyday activities         more effectively;       Developing patient reported outcome measures, from the patients'         perspective, to enable patients and therapists identify problems and         find solutions together, and;       OTs to deliver more effective OT and self-management education to         people with RA.
The LMAP trial contributed to the evidence for effectiveness of OT,         included in the NICE RA Guidelines (2009.
), Hammond was a member of the         NICE Guideline Development Group: The Management of rheumatoid           arthritis in adults, offering best practice evidence on the care         of adults with RA, which included the recommendation that people with RA         should have access to specialist Rheumatology OT for assessment,         provision of comprehensive OT and periodic review if they have problems         with either everyday activities and/or hand function; including joint         protection and hand exercises taught using educational-behavioural         approaches, not just simple advice.
Rheumatology OT departments now set         standards of service delivery based on these guidelines.
Hammond has trained over 200 OTs in delivery of LMAP modules in         practice.
The programmes are provided in Rheumatology OT departments         across England, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, the Netheralnds and         Turkey.
OTs are provided with a detailed leader manual and audio-visual         resources to facilitate delivery; and patient workbooks support         learning.
Course evaluations have consistently shown that the training         programme increased confidence in teaching using cognitive-behavioural         approaches.
OTs also incorporate the training approaches when teaching         self-management to individual patients.
Patients have found the LMAP highly beneficial.
An independently         conducted focus group study at Wishaw Hospital (Scotland) included the         following comments:       "I had been terrified of damaging my joints and was scared to do           things &#8212; I got more confidence about what was safe/ unsafe to do, and           finding alternatives."
"I went from trying to discover what I could do for myself, by           seeing how sore it was, to being shown other methods."
"I get through more &#8212; I take micro-breaks and I am not so tired at           the end."
"I accepted my limits but learnt how to work round them."
"I was coming home from work exhausted, but now I can do &#189; hour           ironing or go to the gym."
"It got me walking again."
"I started walking every morning."
"Doing a little then a little more...... culminating in climbing           Goat Fell."
"Through one of the discussions, I made an appointment with the           podiatrist and got insoles &#8212; my ankles are now behaving themselves."
"I am able to relax better."
"When you've got information, you are in control more about what is           happening with the disease and that makes it easier to accept."
"Information shared within the group and experiences.
We learnt a           lot from each other."
"Having a laugh about our ability or inability to do things, had a           therapeutic effect, it was fun."
At Hairmyres Hospital, East Kilbride: "We use the LMAP and find the           outcomes that patients achieve excellent outcomes."
Service         Manager (Jane-Marie Stobie)       Prof Hammond was the lead author for the Arthritis Research UK advice         booklet "Looking after your joints when you have arthritis"         (2011) for people with inflammatory and osteoarthritis, provided free to         arthritis patients in the majority of Rheumatology and Rheumatology OT         departments in the UK.
It is used as a key element of teaching joint         protection by OTs and one of the core information booklets provided to         people newly diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis in Rheumatology         departments and freely available as a download from the Arthritis         Research UK website.
