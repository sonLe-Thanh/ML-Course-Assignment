     Standardised Ambulance Design [G3.1-G3.5]     Reach and Significance: Before 2006 NHS Ambulance Trusts       produced their own vehicle specification resulting in over 40 different       designs of emergency ambulances in the UK.
This presented an increased       risk to patient safety as the location of equipment and consumables, and       interior layout varied in each vehicle which impacted on safe systems of       work and the efficiency of clinical care.
In 2005 the Dept.
of Health set       out a vision for the provision of future ambulance services by 2010 to       increase the range of quality mobile healthcare services for patients with       urgent and emergency care needs.
It was identified that the demand for       ambulance services was rising by about 7% per annum (approximately 250,000       extra calls) and that the role of the ambulance service was changing, with       only 10% of calls relating to life threatening emergencies (many of the       residual 90% having primary care or social needs).
The results of G3.1-G3.5 were presented to the Chief Executive       Officers of the UK ambulance Trusts and used to develop the national       specification for emergency ambulances.
Six of the 11 NHS Ambulance Trusts       in England now purchase ambulances to this specification: `achievement         of the single specification ambulance.... was as a result of a very         successful collaboration and I was delighted to note that over &#163;2.5         million has been saved over the past 3 years' (Chair National       Ambulance Fleet Strategy Group 5.1; 5.2, 5.3, 5.4).
The outputs of G3.1-G3.5 have also informed manual handling       guidance for staff and patient safety at national [5.5] and       international [5.6] levels through an ISO TR (International       Standards Organisation Technical Report).
Dr Hignett was the first       academic member to be invited to join the National Ambulance Fleet       Strategy Group.
Standardised Community Urgent Response Kit [G3.6-G3.9]     Reach and Significance: In May 2004 the Department of       Health commissioned a strategic review of NHS ambulance services in       England, focusing on how the ambulance service could shift from providing       resuscitation,         trauma and acute care towards "Taking heal thcare to the patient:       transforming ambulance services in the community".
The aims were for       patients to receive improved care by consistently receiving the right       response, first time, in time and that more patients would be treated in       the community, resulting in more effective and efficient use of NHS       resources.
Emergency and urgent care services were faced with the triple       hurdle of delivering a service that was more responsive, more resource       efficient, and that also used the latest medical technologies.
In 1999 the       role of emergency care practitioner (ECP) was introduced with training but       with no new technology to support the changes in clinical services.
The designs and prototypes were developed and tested with The WAS Group       (Europe's leading supplier of ambulances, 5.7) and Openhouse       Products Ltd (UK preferred supplier to the Emergency Services and Health       Sector, 5.8) and Yorkshire Ambulance Service in an EU procurement       process [5.9].
Dr Hignett has recently been invited to join the       NHS Supply Chain Mobile and Relief Clinical Services Consultation Group.
