     Local level impacts     The research `provided the evidence base that directly underpins' a new       low carbon economic       strategy for the Leeds City Region Local Enterprise Partnership [A].
It `strongly informed' the       development of an EU Structural Funds Programme for the Leeds City Region       which has led to a       minimum &#163;66m of funding for a low carbon development programme, and it was       `the primary       evidence' used for a Leeds City Region Revolving Investment Fund which has       initial funding of       &#163;10m and is set to grow significantly [A].
It `informed the       development, and provided the business       case' for, the Leeds City Region Green Deal Programme which will deliver       energy efficiency       interventions to at least 12,000 homes across the city region [A]       at a value to Leeds of c.&#163;44m [B].
It was `used as the evidence base' for the City Deal for Leeds, where       central government devolves       powers and funding to local government.
As a direct result of this, almost       &#163;4m of funding for direct       delivery of local low carbon interventions has been secured in the last 12       months [A].
It was also       "`one of the catalysts for' the establishment of the Leeds Energy Forum, a       private sector grouping       which has successfully paved the way for a &#163;2.5m bid for European funding       which if successful will       aim to attract c.&#163;65m in capital investment in low carbon energy       infrastructure projects" [B].
At a strategic level, `by providing an economic case for investments in       the low carbon economy, the       research has moved the climate change agenda ... beyond its traditional       territory in environment and       sustainability and into the mainstream of policy making on employment,       economic development,       business, finance, energy and urban regeneration' within Leeds City       Council [C].
`This has enabled       the city to ensure that carbon related issues are given a higher priority       in decision making generally       and in mainstream decisions on economic development in particular' [C].
It has led supported the         development and guided the activities of new `Green Commissions' and       `Low Carbon Roadmaps'       in Birmingham [D], and it directly informed a new energy strategy       for Calderdale [E].
National level impacts     The research has directly informed the strategic guidance on low carbon       transitions issued to local       authorities by the UK Committee on Climate Change [F].
International level impacts     The research is now being replicated by researchers from the University       of Leeds in Kolkata, India;       in Lima Peru where it is supported by the Inter American Development Bank,       the Peruvian       Ministries of Environment and Energy, the Municipal Government of Lima and       the Foreign and       Commonwealth Office; and in Johor Bahru, Malaysia and Palembang, Indonesia       where it is       supported by the Malaysian and Indonesian national governments, by the       regional development       agencies and city governments and by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth       Offices [G].
Because       the research led to Gouldson being appointed as international       advisor to the project team, the       research directly fed into a China Council for International Cooperation       on Environment       Development (CCICED) Special Policy Study on environmental strategy and       the transformation of       the development mode in Chinese cities and regions.
The results of this       study were presented to       senior Chinese politicians including Li Keqiang (recently appointed as       Chinese Premier), Zhou       Shengxian (the Minister for Environmental Protection) and Xie Zhenhua       (Vice Chairman of China's       National Development and Reform Commission) in December 2012.
With the       small number of       CCICED reports commissioned in 2012, the research helped to reinforce the       strategies and targets       for strategic transformation and green growth that have now been       introduced in the 12th five year       plan for China [H, I].
