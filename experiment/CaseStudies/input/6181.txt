     The HEAL network at Southampton has over 70 members, comprising one third       healthcare and law practitioners.
Using research expertise developed by       Montgomery, Jones and Biggs, HEAL has made a substantive impact on       policymaking and professional guidance in the UK.
HEAL's responses to public consultations are often quoted.
The Department       of Health highlighted HEAL's conclusion that a relevant governance       structure for prescribing was already in place in Summary of Public       Consultation on Proposals to Introduce Independent Prescribing by       Physiotherapists [5.1].
The equivalent report for podiatrists cited HEAL's       view that proposals provided "good opportunities to ensure and enhance       responsiveness to patient need" [5.2].
Liberating the NHS (2010 para 4.79)       [5.3], quoted HEAL to support its policy that "consortia should have a key       role in helping improve quality of GP services".
The Nuffield Council on       Bioethics cited HEAL's response in Human Bodies (2010 p.88) [5.4], noting       "the demand for female egg donation is potentially limitless".
Jones was a       lead reviewer for the legal aspects of the NCoB's report Novel Techniques       for the Prevention of Mitochondrial DNA Disorders (2012) [5.5].
Montgomery's research on bioethics governance (2002 ch 21; 2013) has       informed the strategic plans of three key bodies that he has chaired,       appointed in open national competition: the Human Genetics Commission       (2009-12), Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2012-) and Health Research       Authority (2012-) [5.6].
His work with the latter was commended by Lord       Turnberg in the second reading of the Care Bill 2013 [5.7].
Montgomery has       shared best practice with organisations overseas.
Representing the NCoB,       he spoke about the UK's approach to public ethics at a WHO meeting in       Tunisia and to the Italian National Bioethics Commission [5.8].
HEAL hosted Robert Francis QC, within a month of his report on NHS       failures in Mid-Staffordshire being published (in conjunction with law       firm Hickman Rose and the Centre for Law, Ethics And Globalisation).
This       brought Southampton researchers and students together with senior NHS       regional leaders to discuss the issues with Francis, and was used by       Montgomery to provide a confidential briefing on what had been learned to       senior civil servants and legal advisors supporting the formulation of the       Government's response [5.9].
Montgomery's research on NHS law (2002 chs 3-5) and board-level       experience in NHS organisations led to invitations to discuss legislative       reform; including a keynote presentation to 250 opinion formers at Age       Concern Hampshire's AGM, regular briefings to the Hampshire Senate on how       changes would impact locally and participation in a "health leaders'       roundtable", organised by Beachcroft Solicitors and Health Investor       Magazine [5.10].
Southampton's research has informed professional guidelines.
Biggs drew       on her research to work with the General Medical Council on its Treatment       and care towards the end of life (2010) [5.11], the most significant UK       guidance on this area.
Montgomery drafted the legal sections of the       revised British Society for Human Genetics guidance Genetic Testing of       Children (2010) [5.12] based upon his research into parents' and       children's rights.
This guidance is accepted as good practice and was the       basis for the court's decision in X CC v Y &amp; Z [2013] EWHC 953 (Fam)       [5.13].
Biggs and Montgomery have researched when `broad consent' might be       legally effective.
This led to Montgomery (with Professor Lucassen, HEAL       member from Medicine) presenting proposals to the HGC in 2010, the       Government's Human Genomics Strategy Group in 2011 [5.14], drafting       chapter 8 (Developing the legal and ethical framework) of the latter's       report, Building on our inheritance: genomic technology in healthcare       [5.15] (2012) and participating in the group advising the Chief Medical       Officer on ethical and legal issues of the 100,000 genome project       (announced by the Prime Minister in December 2012) [5.16].
Biggs is Ethics       Advisor to the Wales Cancer Bank Advisory Board [5.17].
Part of HEAL's impact strategy is to promote rigorous and informed public       debate.
The HEAL blog and Twitter feed [5.18] cover current issues,       drawing on the members' research.
Its 130-plus followers include the Daily       Telegraph medical editor and sixth form students at a Leicestershire       academy.
The blog is designed to attract media enquiries.
During the REF       period, HEAL members have given interviews to Radio 4's Today programme,       Radio Five Live, Sky and BBC News, as well as local television and radio.
The front page of the Times on November 24, 2009 [5.19] quoted Montgomery       discussing the HGC's report on the forensic DNA database (also covered in       the Guardian).
The Daily Mail quoted from Biggs' Today Programme interview       on 12 July 2013 [5.20] In March 2012, Biggs took part in a public debate       on euthanasia at the Brighton Dome, with an audience of over 120 [5.21],       and Montgomery gave a public lecture at Portsmouth Cathedral on how faith       groups could respond to the changing architecture of governance in       bioethics [5.22].
