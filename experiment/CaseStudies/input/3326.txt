     The identification of a tumour field effect on mitochondrial DNA in       prostate tissue resulted in the development of a commercially available       test (launched in the USA in March 2011) that has benefitted men at risk       of prostate cancer.
This test works by: (i) reducing the need to have a       second prostate biopsy by confirming their disease-free status, and (ii)       identifying malignant disease in biopsy samples that appear healthy       visually (www.mitomicsinc.com/prostate-core-mitomic-test/).
A further       impact is the expansion of a private company co-founded by Birch-Machin,       in which Newcastle University is a shareholder.
Pathway to impact: Newcastle influence on product development     The chief executive officer of Mitomics says of Birch-Machin's       contribution that:     In his role as chair of the company's Science Advisory Board and the         science management committee, Birch-Machin was able to advise the         background development of the science that eventually led to the         prostate cancer test, drawing on his work on skin cancers and the         correlation with mitochondrial DNA deletions.
(Ev a)     The design of both the mitochondrial DNA sequencing and analysis       strategies was led by researchers at Newcastle University and based on       Birch-Machin's approaches in skin cancer research.
Birch-Machin also       provided specialist advice on the review of mitochondrial DNA data that       led to the final version of the diagnostic test (Ev a).
The test was       validated by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology under       the Early Detection Research Network of the National Cancer Institute,       following an external study conducted by them on 108 prostate biopsy       samples in 2008 (Ev b &amp; Ev c).
Patents     The technology underlying the final test has been protected by patents,       on which Birch-Machin and Harbottle are named co-inventors.
Filed in 2006       and granted in 2010, European patent number EP1877559B1 `Mitochondrial         mutations and rearrangements as a diagnostic tool for the detection of         sun exposure, prostate cancer and other cancers' protects the       technology behind the methods and kits used to reveal mitochondrial DNA       deletions and permit the early detection, diagnosis and progression of       prostate cancer, sun exposure and non-melanoma skin cancer (Ev d).
A       patent (US8008008B2) filed in 2007 covering the specific mitochondrial       biomarker and its application for the detection of prostate cancer was       granted in the USA in 2011 (Ev e).
The Prostate Core Mitomic Test and patient benefit     As noted earlier, confirming a diagnosis of prostate cancer relies on a       pathologist identifying the disease in one or more of 12 needle biopsies       as shown in Figure 1.
It is estimated that in 2011 there were 1,498,000       prostate biopsies performed in North America.
On average, 70% of biopsies       (around 1 million) show a negative result, and around 30% of these will be       false negatives (Ev f).

Using the same samples taken for pathology examination, The Prostate         Core Mitomic Test makes use of the tumour field effect (shown in       Figure 1) by identifying a particular mitochondrial DNA deletion in       visually benign cells (Ev c).
It is sometimes the case that men whose cells appear disease-free on       pathological examination still have raised levels of prostate-specific       antigen (a protein in the blood associated with prostate cancer).
However,       in a clinical study involving 101 patients, the Prostate Core Mitomic         Test identified those men who were truly free of disease with a       negative predictive value of 91% by confirming the lack of a tumour field       effect, and identified patients at high risk for undiagnosed prostate       cancer at a sensitivity of 84% (Ev g).
As the test is successful in       identifying men at low risk who would otherwise require a follow-up biopsy       procedure in the short term, there is an important patient benefit.
The       test's use of existing samples reduces stress and the risk of infection as       no further biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis.
The test also       identifies high risk patients undiagnosed with conventional biopsy; it       identified 17 of 20 patients who were later diagnosed with prostate       cancer.
Financial investment and commercial impact following product launch in         2011     The chief executive officer of Mitomics has confirmed in July 2013 that:     As a private company, we do not disclose financial information         publicly.
However, Mitomics has invested significant sums into the         development of Prostate Core Mitomic Test...
The launch of the product         required the hiring of a sales and marketing team, as well as the         establishment of a commercial laboratory for test processing.
The         combined peak staffing of the USA team is fifteen people.
(Ev a)     The product development phase was funded by multi-million dollar       investment from existing shareholders and private equity management       companies.
Following the launch of the test onto the American market,       sales of the Prostate Core Mitomics Test have grown in line with       forecasts and have reached several million dollars (Ev h).
Mitomics has entered into licence agreements with six companies       with established networks of urologists in private and public healthcare       (Ev i).
These include LabCorp (one of the world's largest clinical       laboratory providers, which has an annual revenue of $5.7 billion) and CML       HealthCare (recently the subject of a takeover, in which the company was       valued at $917 million).
Mitomics has twice (in 2007/8 and 2010/11) been selected as one of       Canada's top 10 private companies in the life sciences sector.
Winners of       this competition are chosen by an independent expert panel of leading       Canadian and US venture capitalists.
Competition winners participate in a       series of investment forums across the USA, providing access to potential       strategic partners (Ev j).
