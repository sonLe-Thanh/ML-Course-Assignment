     Davidson's research on sexuality and sexual relations in Ancient Greece       presents a different understanding of Ancient Greek society and culture,       feeding into public discussions about the nature of homosexual relations       in Ancient Greece, and about the relationship between Antiquity and modern       society.
It has been adopted by members of the GLBT community and       advocates for legalising same sex marriage as illustrating the historical       precedence for same sex relationships.
The book and its US edition (Random       House, 2009), were published during the height of debate about same sex       marriage in a number of US states.
An article in the popular American       online magazine Slate (4 million readers a day) made explicit the       connection between Davidson's research and the debate about whether       homosexual relationships should be afforded the same status as       heterosexual ones.
Greek Love is described as a `landmark study'       and recommended as `required reading for anybody curious about the       antecedents of the current impasse' in American state legislatures.
It       `provides an important invitation to open our eyes to the multiplicity of       ways in which people loved one another in Ancient Greece.'
Michael Dirda       in the Washington Post (2009) claims that `though Davidson never       says it outright, The Greeks and Greek Love tacitly validates       modern same sex marriage.'
References to the book also abound in blogs       posted around the world on the classics and Ancient Greece, books and the       publishing industry, gay rights and popular media.
The UK policy think       tank Policy Exchange referenced Greek Love for its exploration of       the historical case for gay marriage in Ancient Greece in its 2012       publication recommending that the government legislate for equal marriage       (`What's in a name?
Is there a case for equal marriage?').
The impact of Davidson's research in the United States on the publishing       industry and the reading public is further evidenced by public       recognition.
Greek Love received the Mark Lynton History Prize       (2010) from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism and the Columbia School       of Journalism awarded to the `book-length work of history on any subject       that best combines intellectual or scholarly distinction with felicity of       expression.'
The book was also awarded the Randy Shilts Award for Gay       non-fiction by Publishing Triangle, a New York based organisation which       promotes books and other written materials by LGBT authors or with LGBT       themes.
It was one of three Stonewall Honour Books in Non-Fiction in 2010       which is sponsored by the American Library Association; and was the winner       of the Lambda Award for LGBT non-fiction (2010) which honours books on any       subject written for the general reader.
The reach of the impact is       evidenced by the number of copies of Davidson's books sold worldwide,       selling more than 20,000 copies combined (Nielsen Bookscan).
His books, Courtesans         and Fishcakes and Greek Love have been translated into       German and Greek, further demonstrating the significance of Davidson's       impact and extending the impact internationally.
The books were reviewed       extensively in national newspapers in the UK (Daily Telegraph, The         Guardian, The Independent), Canada (The Globe and Mail),       Australia (The Australian) and the USA (New York Times, Washington         Post and Washington Times) and in British, Australian,       American and French magazines (Spectator, Prospect, The         Monthly, Slate, L'Economie Politique).
There has       been a great interest in Davidson's books in online forums and blogs,       including the BBC TV blog (2013) and the newspaper Frankfurter         Allgemeine Zeitung's blogs (2009).
As well as print media and popular online interest, Davidson's research       has also been featured on radio and television programmes.
He was       consulted and interviewed for the television programme `The Bible: A       History' about St Paul and sexuality (Channel 4, Jan 2010, avg 1 million       viewers).
He contributed to the BBC Radio 4 programme `A History of the       World in 100 Objects' (May 2010, avg 4 million listeners per episode); Greek         Love is also referenced as further reading for the Warren Cup on the       British Museum website.
Davidson was consulted for the BBC Radio 3       programme `Out in the World - A Global Gay History' which aired in 2011       and 2012 (approx.
listening figures per episode 78,000).
A reading from Courtesans         and Fishcakes was featured on `Something Understood', BBC Radio 4,       2008 (estimated figures 441,480).
Greek Love also led to Davidson being invited to write a series of       pamphlets on Greek Mythology for The Guardian in January 2008       (daily paper circulation 378,394), still available on the newspaper's       website (4 million unique visitors per day).
Davidson has been a       contributor to the London Review of Books since the early 1990s,       writing over 20 articles on Greek mythology, politics, social life,       literature and art.
Since 2008 Davidson has written two book reviews (Atlantis         Story, 2008; Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, 2010) and an       exhibition review (Bronze, Royal Academy, 2012).
His podcast `Sex in the       Ancient World', recorded in 2009 and available on Warwick's iTunesU       channel has received 89,747 downloads (figures available to 02/12).
His       public appearances include a talk about Greek Love at Gay's the       World Bookshop in London (admission free; 29.01.2009) as part of its 30th         anniversary celebrations.
The event was included in The         Guardian Saturday Review: Events (24.01.2009).
He       participated in a discussion panel on `The Greeks' for the Hay-on-Wye       literature festival in June 2012 which had a sold out audience of 50.
