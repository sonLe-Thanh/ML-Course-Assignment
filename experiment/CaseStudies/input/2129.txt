     The work undertaken at Newcastle has had impact in linking together the       human and the technical aspects of information-sharing.
It has been       particularly significant in two ways: changing the practice of       practitioners who work with each other and with each other's information       systems; and developing the governance relationships between       practitioners, information systems and service users.
Improved information-sharing and governance       The findings from the AMASE and VESCR projects allowed a wide range of       practitioners to address both the human and the technical aspects of       information-sharing in the area of electronic social care records.
For       example, the Director of the Regional Youth Work Unit confirmed that the       research has "contributed to stimulating thought across the sector in         the North East.
It has inspired deeper thought about the issues and         implications of information-sharing, not just the delivery of services.
It has enabled practitioners to be able to have conversations with those         who are having the new ideas.
The key contribution of Rob's [Wilson's]         work is that the systems and technology are of less importance, it is         about the governance of the information, this has to be the starting         point of conversations about information-sharing."

The growing reach of the research impact is demonstrated through the       Newcastle team's collaboration with Socitm, the national professional       association for ICT and related professionals in the public and third       sectors.
Their Director of Policy and Research commented that "in May         2011, Socitm published Planting the Flag, a strategy document         for the reform of public services enabled by information and         communication technology.
Of the six key issues identified, the first         three have drawn on the research of Rob [Wilson] and the team,         specifically relating to information governance, information management         and transparency, and digital access and inclusion.
Additionally, Socitm         collaborates with the Cabinet Office and the Data Handling       Guidelines produced with the Cabinet Office have been influenced by         the research of Rob and the team."

The influence of this       work has been confirmed by influential policy think-tank DEMOS, in a 2012       report which makes direct reference to the Newcastle work: "Wilson et         al.
[(4)] outline how reconciling real-world identity         with its data representation can strain relationships between a service         user...a large VCS organisation and the social care system" (IMP3p59).
Enhanced inter-agency working and information governance       The importance of FAME (IMP4) as a means of facilitating       inter-agency working and information governance has been recognised at       national policy level.
It informed the plans of the Office of the Deputy       Prime Minister (ODPM) for co-ordinated services, with a specific       endorsement as follows: "We recommend that further work be done by         ODPM and local authorities to develop more protocol agreement frameworks         for local partnerships along [the lines of] the FAME ... model" (IMP5p61).
Although this was published in 2005 and there has since been a change in       government, FAME continues to influence the extent and nature of       integration across the public services.
This can be seen in a current       national exemplar programme, Improving Information Sharing and Management       (IISaM), established for organisations supporting families with complex       needs.
The IISaM website states: "Throughout the IISaM project, we have         been keen to learn from the experiences of others, whether to understand         and share good practice or to develop case studies.
Indeed, the         `information sharing journey' framework which we have used as a basis         for the toolkit came from research undertaken on behalf of DCLG a few         years ago.
We have picked up learning from the FAME project, which         provided a framework for the development of multi-agency collaboration"       (IMP6).
At the local authority level, FAME featured in the Newcastle Plan for       Children and Young People 2006-2009 (IMP7p51) and the Lead       Specialist Children's Health at Newcastle City Council commented in 2013       that "I think the work with the FAME toolkit meant there were         individuals committed to the partnership agenda.
We have since added the         voluntary sector and now have a real culture of partnership working         across children's services.
Now the Wellbeing for Life Board is gaining         from the lessons learned from the Children's Trust about how to make         things work" (IMP8).
Commissioning and personalised care       The OLDES project (Grant 5) aimed to improve the efficiency and       effectiveness of support services for older people.
CUP2000 S.p.A is an       industrial company, a market leader in Italy in electronic healthcare and       Internet networks.
Its General Director wrote to Wilson et al.
following the project to recognise the impact of their work: "OLDES         was a very important project for CUP2000 and our partners...as it helped         us to improve our knowledge of the ICTs and information-sharing needed         for the quality of life for frail elders in managing at home.
Your team         at Newcastle University did fantastic work on the analysis of the         situation, and assured that the OLDES developments were close to the         workings of people and organisations of the social and health care         system in Bologna including helping us with issues of         information-sharing and the use of the federation in ICT to help         agencies co-ordinate for older people.
This meant that we were able to         continue and expand the work of OLDES in following developments...funded         by the Regional Government and the EU" (IMP9).
On the basis of an action research project (Grant 7) Wilson and Martin       made recommendations to the North East Procurement Organisation (NEPO) as       part of the national framework for developing e-marketplace platforms for       personalised care budgets.
NEPO is using the project's findings to make a       case to government on the commissioning of services in relation to the       current White Paper, Caring for Our Future, which sets a mandate for       better information to be provided by local authorities on their social       services by 2014/15.
NEPO's Senior Regional Category Specialist commented:         "[Wilson's] research has changed the thinking of NEPO &#8212; from a system         approach (basically buying a system that can become an e-marketplace)         compared to now a system architecture approach where you have a much         broader view of the challenges involved in developing an e-marketplace         and now consider what the solution should look like (rather than         previously had been focused on buying an off the shelf solution)" (IMP10).
