     Pathways to impact       The founding by Ghazal of a cross-disciplinary research Centre (ScGTI) to       facilitate and foster multidisciplinary interactions within and between       academia and industry was essential to generate innovation within a       rapidly emerging yet poorly served field.
Ghazal identified the biological       applications and, with the founding team, enabled determination of the       essential set of materials and processes needed to convert this early       technology (developed with UoE) into a working commercial product.
Using       experience gained from founding an earlier microarray-based company in       Scotland, Ghazal with the founding team secured initial first-round       funding to form a spin-out company to attract private investment and to       develop the technology.
The company, Lab901, was formed in 2002 with       initial investment contacts provided by Ghazal and commercialisation led       by Fearnley and Polwart.
From the outset Lab901 established research       facilities and a development team at an industrial park.
The founding patent for the company was granted in full in 2012.
Lab901       initially secured &#163;0.23M funding in 2002 with further rounds in 2003       (&#163;0.56M), 2004 (&#163;0.34M), 2006 (&#163;1.34M and &#163;1.5M), 2008 (&#163;3.6M) and 2009       (&#163;2.4M).
Lab901 worked collaboratively with UoE, especially in the early       phases of its development, but this reduced as the business started to       develop and market its products.
From 2007, Lab901 employed between 40 and       50 people and this employment has been maintained since its acquisition.
Currently there are approximately 160 employees at the Edinburgh facility;       this includes all of the original employees of Lab901.
Impact on commerce and the economy       The first product sales of ScreenTape&#8482; were in 2008.
From 2008-2013,       product sales reached over &#163;[text removed for publication].
In February       2011, Lab901 was acquired by the US multinational company, Agilent: the       world's premier measurement company and a technology leader in chemical       analysis, life sciences, diagnostics, electronics and communications       [5.1-5.3].
The acquisition price was &#163;[text removed for publication].
Agilent's 20,000 employees serve customers in more than 100 countries, and       it had revenues of US$6.9B in fiscal 2012.
The acquisition resulted in       UoE-generated IP being preserved and maintained, 50 employees from Lab901       securing continued employment with Agilent, a further 110 jobs being       created, considerable inward investment and wealth creation in the UK and       beyond, and global market opportunities for the product [5.4].
Impact on practitioners and services       The product, ScreenTape&#8482;, has been bought and used by a wide range of       practitioners, including research and diagnostic laboratories.
Applications of the microfluidic ScreenTape&#8482; tool were developed by Lab901       for DNA and genomics analysis [5.5], including workflows for next-       generation sequencing, for rapid high-sensitivity quality-control analysis       for RNA, and for proteins and antibodies.
Impact on health and welfare       ScreenTape&#8482; has been used by both academic and diagnostic laboratories       around the world, and has recently secured a global market presence       through the acquisition of Lab901 and sales by Agilent [5.4, 5.5].
