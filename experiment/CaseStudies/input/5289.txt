     The development of the Imperial deconvolution algorithm represents a       major milestone in well test analysis, and the first game-changing       development since the introduction of pressure derivatives in 1983.
It       allows better identification of reservoir characteristics and a better,       more confident evaluation of reserves.
The Imperial algorithm was implemented by BP in 2004 in their well test       analysis software product (PIE) which they share with Total.
It was       subsequently implemented in commercial software packages such as Saphir       from Kappa Engineering (2007), Pan-Systems from Weatherford (who purchased       the algorithm from Imperial in 2007 and implemented it in 2008), FAST from       Fekete (2009).
The availability of deconvolution in commercial software       made it easier for operators to incorporate it in their well test analysis       process.
Its use typically increases the verifiable estimate of reserves by 20%,       and by more than 50% in the case of BG Group in the Santos Basin, offshore       Brazil.
In the latter case, the increase of the aggregate of proved and       probable reserves plus discovered resources and risked exploration, that       can be credited in part to deconvolution, was estimated at 3 billion       barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with a value of approximately USD 300       billion [A].
In addition to benefitting oil and gas operating companies [A-D], the       Imperial deconvolution algorithm has been adopted by software and       consulting companies in the oil and gas sector, strengthening their market       position and increasing revenues [E,F].
The following companies have provided testimonies on the impact of       deconvolution on their business:     Oil and gas operating companies       BG indicated a 50% increase in reserves in their share of the Santos       Basin, offshore Brazil, due to deconvolution combined with other       interpretation techniques [Ai] and they state "This research was         instrumental in solving the deconvolution problem and the paper by von         Shroeter, Hollaender and Gringarten (SPE 77688) is the industry         reference.... we now use deconvolution as standard practice.
"[Aii]     BP's published evaluation of the algorithm states "We have found         deconvolution analysis to be extremely useful for early detection of         closed reservoir behavior.
Pressure/rate deconvolution also opens new         opportunities for analysis of permanent gauge pressure data.
It is a         valuable addition to the suite of techniques used in well-test analysis."
[B]     Shell uses deconvolution to support de-risking of major gas developments       in Europe.
[C]     Petro SA were able to book additional reserves by applying deconvolution       to the E-M highly compartmentalized gas condensate field in South Africa       The project economics indicated an NPV of $300MM.
they state "Based on         the success of the 2 wells, the financial impact was huge for the         organisation because additional reserves were booked and the positive         NPV is being realised.... Due to new knowledge, we could history match         the models better, and predict well performance.
This allowed us to plan         better and estimate reserves better."
[D]     Software vendors       Kappa Engineering is a petroleum software company that holds approximately       70% of the market share in Pressure Transient Analysis, with over 10,000       users worldwide.
Responding to clients' requests, they were the first to       integrate the Imperial algorithm in the software in 2006 in a Beta version       with an official release in 2007.
They state "it proved to be a very         efficient tool combining successive build-ups into a larger equivalent         test period.... As long as the engineer understands the limitations of         the process, substantial engineer time can be saved for an overall         analysis that is compatible with the long term behavior of the well in         its drainage area.
In the past, only very experienced engineers could         reproduce, with a lot of trial and error, the diagnostic process that is         now provided within a few seconds using the deconvolution....
It is now         part of our users' day-to-day work.
As the Managing Director of KAPPA         Engineering I confirm that this work has been, to my opinion, by far the         most important methodology development in PTA in the past twenty years."
[E]     Fekete Associates Inc state "Alain Gringarten and his team (von         Schroeter) at Imperial College overcame this problem by developing a         stable Deconvolution algorithm.
Since then, all the major software         vendors, including ourselves, have implemented an adaptation of that         algorithm....While there are still some issues with data quality, which         can result in false analyses, the value of the von Schroeter-Gringarten         algorithm is unquestionable.
It has resulted in a better interpretation         of reservoirs and quantification of reserves.
Because it extends the         interpretation to encompass the "total" flow duration rather than a         "specific" flow period, it often translates into increased proven         reserves (equivalent to 100's of millions of dollars).....Of all the         attempts at Deconvolution since the 1970's, the von Schroeter-Gringarten         implementation is the only successful one, and the authors deserve the         full credit and recognition by the industry, and all the encouragement         to continue development in this field of knowledge."
