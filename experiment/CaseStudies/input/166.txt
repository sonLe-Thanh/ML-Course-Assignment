     The impacts of this programme of research have been evident in       influencing the evolution of wider public debate on issues of employee       voice, and shaping the development of policy frameworks and particular       policy initiatives in the UK and abroad, as well as employment practices.
Beneficiaries have included policy makers, human resource practitioners,       businesses, unions and ultimately employees.
The impact of scholarly research on whistleblowing has been evident in       specific lines of policy thinking, as well as the wider policy climate,       among politicians, academic and practising lawyers, employers, trade       unions and voluntary organisations (1).
These impacts have been       incremental and cumulative.
The 1995 Modern Law Review article,       standing alone at the time as an academic study on the subject, influenced       the decision to make protection for whistleblowers a UK employment right.
This approach has been subsequently adopted in many countries, and the EU,       through recognition of a need for whistleblowing procedures as an       anti-corruption tool.
Findings of this empirical research have contributed to wider public         debate over the last decade that effective whistleblowing       arrangements are vital both to private and public interests, following       health and safety disasters and the exposure of financial scandals.
Subsequent to the presentation of written and oral evidence by Lewis and       Homewood to the Committee on Standards in Public Life in 1997, research       findings have influenced the development of the UK policy environment,       contributing to a process of reform and innovation which resulted in the       production of a Publicly Available Specification Code of Practice on       Whistleblowing in 2008 (BSI).
In developing policy frameworks further,       Lewis has acted as a part-time academic expert to provide policy advice to       the National Audit Office on the development of whistleblowing       arrangements (2), devising a checklist of good practice principles and       using these to evaluate the current whistleblowing policies of government       departments.
Policy impacts have also been evident internationally.
In 2009, Lewis was       invited to provide oral evidence to the committee reviewing the impact of       the Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act 2005.
In a similar context of       public policy review and formulation, he provided oral and written       evidence to the Budgetary Control Committee of the EU Parliament (18/5/11)       on the need for EU measures to protect whistleblowers along the lines of       anti-discrimination Directives already in place, influencing the       production of amended guidance on whistleblowing within the EU's own       institutions (3).
In 2012 Lewis was appointed as a member of Transparency       International's committee of experts charged with formulating principles       on which national whistleblowing laws should be based and was an invited       expert at the Council of Europe's consultation with stakeholders on       whistleblowing in 2013 (4).
Research findings on whistleblowing have contributed to a shift in employment         culture and practice with a wide range of organisations adopting       good practice (5).
Impacts have been both directly upon the behaviour of       human resources/industrial relations practitioners, and as a result of       this, upon employees and workforces.
Processes through which research       findings have been incorporated into practice include commercial       organisations, which have directly made use of Middlesex data in promoting       consultancy packages promoting improved corporate governance and integrity       (e.g.
see the websites of Sai Global and Expolink), and commercial       training for senior human resource and legal practitioners run by Lexis       Nexis (2009 &amp; 2012) which have called on Lewis to present his findings       and outline practice implications (6).
The reach of this impact was       further extended in 2012 when Lewis was commissioned to produce a detailed       guide to good practice by Xpert HR (2012).
The impacts of research into new forms of employee representation and the       development of sustainable work practices have been evident in influencing       wider public debate and the development of union strategies and employers'       practices.
The research undertaken into new ways of working in high       performance and workplace partnership led to the publication of six       reports by employers and unions in case studies, including Prudential       Insurance, Bristol and West Building Society, Rolls Royce and British       Aerospace.
This was further progressed through an examination of       industrial relations and sustainable work practices at British Airways       (BA) during the 2010/2011 cabin crew dispute.
This work became influential       in the resolution of this dispute and the wider public debate over the       issues it raised.
The critique developed by Upchurch and others of BA's       practices was endorsed by the British Universities Industrial Relations       Association which took the (then) unprecedented step of writing to the       national press to express concerns at the future sustainability of BA as a       result of its deteriorating industrial relations.
Following this, the       union Unite commissioned Upchurch to examine issues of employee voice and       the work environment.
The resulting report (Upchurch, 2010) was widely       publicised by Unite and other unions both in the UK and abroad (e.g.
the       International Transport Workers' Federation) and informed their campaigns.
This research impacted on a range of stakeholders central to resolving       the BA cabin dispute and wider public debate arising from it.
These       impacts included:             Informing BA share holders: The Upchurch report was formally         presented to the top five investors in BA and used by Unite to influence         other investors and board members (7).
Influencing the political debate: The report was the basis for         a Parliamentary Early Day Motion (EDM) raised by Jim Sheridan MP, which         received the support of 115 MPs from the Labour Party, Conservative         Party, Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party and SDLP in the House         of Commons.
The summary and introduction to this EDM, cited the Upchurch         report (8).
Shaping public perceptions of the dispute: The research         received widespread comment in both the national and trade press,         including the Guardian, the Independent (29/5/10), the Daily           Mirror (4/6/10) and Travel Weekly, prompting debate about         the strategy pursued in the dispute by the Chief Executive Willy Walsh         (9).
A video produced by Upchurch received over 1200 downloads on         YouTube (10).
Shaping the strategy of Unite and other unions: the Unite union         recognised this report as an important contributing factor in improving         and stabilising industrial relations at BA and the restoration of a         negotiating relationship with the cabin crew's union (7).
The         international impact was enhanced through ESRC funded work considering         aspects of global labour regulation, which led to collaborative work         with the major Global Union Federations.
This resulted in the         publication by Croucher and Cotton of Global Unions, Global           Business: Global Union Federations and International Business         (Libri, 2011) and further commissioned work on employee voice from the         International Labour Organisation.
