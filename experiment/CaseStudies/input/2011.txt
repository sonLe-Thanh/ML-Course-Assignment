     The impact of the research falls into the category of economic benefit       which we illustrate through the benefits realised by UCB Pharma.
Other       pharmaceutical companies such as Crysalin Ltd and InhibOx have also       benefited.
The research also has downstream impact on patient health.
Pathway to impact       pyFREAD has been made accessible through three different routes:            the direct implementation in 2010 of the software by UCB Pharma, who         were industrial partners in the research project.
The Director of         Computational Structural Biology at UCB Pharma states [A] "...
Professor           Deane kindly provided to us at no charge the software pyFREAD, which           was developed in her laboratory"       a web-based computational tool (http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/sites/fread/).
The Head of Computational Chemistry, Crystalin Ltd, states in a letter         in October 2013 [E] "I downloaded it from your website ... last           August".
a freely downloadable version of the FREAD software, published in         2010,         (http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/fread/php/)          Nature and extend of the impact       The impact of pyFREAD is most readily measured through its use by UCB       Pharma.
They, as well as other major pharmaceutical companies, use X-ray       crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations to guide `lead       optimization' in an iterative fashion.
Atomic interactions between each       compound and the target protein are analyzed and chemical modifications to       the lead compound are designed accordingly to improve potency and       selectivity.
However, X-ray structures of the compound-protein complex       often have undefined residues due to experimental limitations; such       residues must be modelled before dynamic simulations can be carried out.
The Director of Computational Structural Biology at UCB Pharma states [A]       "We used to rely on the software Prime from Schrodinger Inc to model         the undefined residues in X-ray structures.
[...] This software       [pyFREAD] was at least 1000 times faster than Prime and also produced         more accurate results!
For example, to model a stretch of 14 undefined         residues, it took 50 CPU hours with Prime but less than a minute with         pyFREAD.
In another occasion, we tried to reconstruct 7 stretches of         undefined residues within the same X-ray structure; Prime crashed after         running for 3 days without producing any useable results, while pyFREAD         managed to generate accurate models in merely 3 minutes.
Pleasantly         surprised by the lightning speed and accuracy of this software, we         immediately switched to using pyFREAD for such tasks and have not been         disappointed."
He further summarises the immediate financial benefits [A] "It is         immediately clear that pyFREAD saves us not only &#163;45,000 in annual         license fee for Prime, but also thousands of CPU hours for each lead         optimization campaign."
UCB Pharma operates in 40 countries worldwide and had a global revenue of       &#8364;3.4 billion in 2012.
They identify (in [A]) that lead optimization is one       of the most costly steps in drug discovery and development, requiring on       average &#163;6 million per campaign (just one stage of the drug discovery       process).
In order to bring an approved drug onto the market, typically 15       lead optimization campaigns have to be carried out, costing a total of &#163;90       million.
The Director of Computational Structural Biology at UCB writes in       [A] "... that switching to pyFREAD shortened each lead optimization         cycle by an average of 3 days.
A typical lead optimization campaign         lasts 2 years, the cost is &#163;3 million per year, or &#163;58,000 per week.
Shortening each optimization cycle by 3 days translates to &#163;35,000 in         direct savings per iteration, or &#163;350,000 for a 10-iteration campaign.
As 15 campaigns are needed to put one drug onto the market [6], the         total savings per drug approval achieved by using pyFREAD is expected to         be over &#163;5 million."
This corresponds to saving UCB at least 5% for       each programme in which it has been used.
The impact for UCB of this research goes beyond the financial savings.
UCB state that [A] "The research work at Professor Deane's laboratory         has generated significant economic value for UCB Pharma through the         acceleration of the drug discovery process.
More importantly, faster         drug discovery means that patients receive better treatment sooner.
While the impact on patients' quality of life is hard to quantify, it is         what matters most".
Evidence of wider, less quantifiable, impact of the FREAD methodology is       seen from its web-based computational version.
The data available for 2013       show this has performed on average over 60 predictions per month and was       visited by over 200 unique users per month from throughout the world [B].
As exemplars of the reach of FREAD, the Chief Executive Officer of       InhibOx, who have been using the software since 2011, states [C] "I am         writing to confirm that InhibOx has used the program FREAD to support         our drug design work.
The program was used primarily by one of our staff         to assist in a project to build homology models of a malaria parasite         serine protease, which we have been working on as a novel anti-malarial         drug target", while the Head of Computational Chemistry at Crysalin       Ltd says [D] "Thank you for permitting me to use FREAD at Crysalin....       [it] is providing to be an invaluable addition to our existing tools."
