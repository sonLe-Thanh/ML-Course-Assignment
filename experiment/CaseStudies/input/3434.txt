     Local elections in Scotland: the research on the collection and       analysis of local government election results in Scotland has in many       respects become the standard reference work on the subject, so much so       that the Electoral Commission has facilitated and supported this work for       the 2007 and 2012 elections(1), while the Scottish Government itself       purchases copies of the report, together with many Scottish councils.
The       research has been used in several Scottish Government and Scottish       Parliament reports and analyses, including the National Survey of         Local Government Candidates, in relation to who stands, the gender       of candidates, and turnout(2).
Findings in relation to candidate ordering       on the ballot paper featured in the Scottish Government's response to the       independent review of the 2007 elections(3), and recommendations in       relation to turnout and the `decoupling' of local and Scottish Parliament       elections have been cited in debates in the Scottish Parliament (for       example, (4)), with decoupling being introduced for the 2012 elections.
Political representation and careers in local government: related       research on local councillors has had a particular impact in relation to       findings regarding the under-representation of women and the barriers to       their election and career progression.
C. Bochel and H. Bochel's research       has been cited in reports by bodies such as the Office of Deputy Prime       Minister, the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the       Commission for Councillors.
It has also been taken up by groups       campaigning for better representation of women.
For example, their       explanation for the low numbers of female councillors formed part of the       evidence base for the Institute for Social Change report on civic life for       the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and their research was cited       extensively in the Centre for Women and Democracy's examination of Leadership         and Gender in Local Government 2009(5).
This research has also had       international impact, featuring in a study of gender quota systems by the       European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality,       while the work of Bochel and Briggs has been cited by groups promoting       greater political participation by women, including One World Action,       around women transforming political spaces, and the Initiative for         Inclusive Security, on promoting women candidates in local       government in Rwanda(6).
Petitions and petitioning: research has fed into debates about the       future of the e-petitions system introduced by the Coalition government,       with C. Bochel being invited to participate in a Backbench Business       Committee/Hansard Society seminar on this topic at Westminster.
Her       research featured prominently in the Hansard Society's interim report,         What next for e-petitions?, which referred to her conclusions in       relation to the potential benefits, but also the challenges of using       petitions to empower individuals, as well as her work on the use of       petitions in the Scottish Parliament(7).
She submitted evidence on       petitions to the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform       Committee's inquiry, Revisiting Rebuilding the House: the impact of         the Wright Reforms, and was invited to give oral evidence to the       Committee.
Her evidence also informed parts of the Committee's questioning       of others, including Tony Wright, and featured prominently in the       Committee's report, which accepted and made a number of recommendations in       response to her criticisms of the current system(8).
This research has       also had significant impact beyond Westminster.
It has been used in       reviews into the use of petitions in local government, and the National       Assembly for Wales.
It is now generating international interest, featuring       for example, in a guide for the development of e-petitions by America         Speaks, a long-established Washington-based NGO which promotes       participation and deliberative democracy, and in an article by a Canadian       Member of Parliament, supporting a motion in the Canadian House of Commons       to introduce an electronic petitions system, in an in-house journal for       Canadian legislators(9).
Citizenship and participation: Kisby submitted evidence to the       Youth Citizenship Commission, established by the UK Government in 2007 to       promote youth participation in the political process, and participated in       a one-day conference on `Revitalising Politics' held in Parliament.
He has       also, for example, established links with Shout Out UK, a national       media social enterprise run by and for young people, and was influential       in persuading them to pursue a campaign to make political education a       compulsory part of the national curriculum'.
His work (with Sloam) on       citizenship education featured in a report on student participation       commissioned by the library of the Canadian Parliament(10).
Locally, the       School has a long-established relationship with the democratic       participation teams in local government within Lincolnshire, and, for       example, Briggs has worked closely with Lincolnshire County Council's       Participation Team for a number of years, including part of the Council's       Participation Conference to an audience of local government officials,       policy makers and representatives of pressure groups.
As part of an       ongoing project, staff in this research group, together with others from       the School, have been working with Lincoln City Council on a number of       projects on enhancing democratic accountability and participation within       the City, the area in which the University arguably has its most immediate       and daily impact.
