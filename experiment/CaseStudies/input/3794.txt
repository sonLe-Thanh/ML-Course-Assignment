     The purpose of Professor Bartlett's activities throughout has been to       expose a wide audience to historical documentary about the Middle Ages and       this has been achieved.
Historical knowledge is of value not only for its       intrinsic interest but also in shaping perceptions of humanity and       society.
A person with no knowledge of his or her past may be viewed as in       some sense deficient; the same is true of society as a whole (on such       impact, see e.g.
Tusa, `A deep and continuing use of History') (Source 10       below).
Professor Bartlett's prominence as a medievalist, together with the range       and character of his work (see above, section 2), led to a telephone       request from the Controller of BBC 4, asking him to write and make the       series Inside the Medieval Mind, four one-hour episodes first       aired in 2008.
The response to this series led the former Controller of       BBC4, now Controller of BBC2 to commission a series on The Normans,       three one-hour episodes which first aired in 2010, for that more         widely viewed channel.
Its success has in turn led to the completion       of a third series, on The Plantagenets, to be screened on BBC 2 in       November 2013.
The wide diffusion of the earlier series has led to the       completion of a different version (formed of six linked segments) specifically         aimed at secondary schools.
Professor Bartlett's research has reached ever-widening audiences.
His work on the natural and supernatural in particular underpins Inside         the Medieval Mind: organized around the broad themes of "Power",       "Sex", "Belief" and "Knowledge", it discussed medieval views of issues       such as miracles, they way medieval people thought about the physical       world and the nature of human society.
The Normans was informed in       part by his earlier work on medieval colonialism and conquest, in part by       his England under the Norman and Angevin Kings.
The originality of       the research in primary sources was evident for example in the frequent       use of quotations from chroniclers, theologians, and others in Inside         the Medieval Mind.
Some of the methods used, including what amounts       to on-screen footnoting, have been adopted in other historical       documentaries.
The BBC assesses its programmes through viewing figures, impact         groups and reviews.
They were very happy on all three counts.
The       Controller of BBC4 said: I'm delighted by the success of 'Inside the         Medieval Mind'.
Just as the 1.4m viewers who recently watched 'Steptoe         and Son' showed that the channel can deliver record breaking audiences         for drama, this demonstrates that the channel can attract equally high         audiences to the very best of intelligent, public service broadcasting       [S1].
The Normans was mentioned by the BBC Director General in his       James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the 2010 Edinburgh International       Television Festival: [Audiences] want the best and they want it all         year round, which is why nowadays at the BBC we play pieces like         Sherlock, The Normans and Rev in high summer [S2].
Viewing figures       for both series were high.
Inside the Medieval Mind was watched by       over three times the average for that BBC 4 slot.
The Normans       attracted around three million viewers (Guardian, 5 August       2010) [S3] and the BBC has since taken this figure as a benchmark for         documentaries.
Both series have been repeated and broadcast via       satellite in eastern Europe and Scandinavia, and are still more widely       viewed on-line.
The documentaries were also widely and very favourably reviewed in the       Press [S4]:     Inside the Medieval Mind: four corking documentaries       (Guardian, 17 April, 2008); Bartlett has been &#8212; or, rather, has         been allowed to be &#8212; a tremendously thoughtful, provocative and         entertaining guide to the period, and this has been one of the most         enjoyably intelligent things I can remember in, gosh, years (Independent,       9 May, 2008).
The Normans: excellent television that educates,         enlightens and entertains (Observer, 1 August 2010); stirring         and atmospheric (Metro, 4 August 2010); telly education         at its best (Independent, 5 August 2010); riveting (Times,       5 August, 2010); a splendid programme (Guardian, 5 August,       2010); one of those history things that give you hope (Observer,       8 August 2010); rivetingly good (Sunday Telegraph, 8 August       2010); superlative history (Observer, 15 August 2010); erudite         and accessible (Daily Mail, 15 August, 2010); gripping         television (Daily Express, 19 August 2010).
Evidence of cultural, educational, and other impact is further apparent       from the active engagement of viewers, large numbers of whom have written       to professor Bartlett (a selection of emails is on file) [S5].
The         Normans is available commercially on DVD, while Inside         the Medieval Mind can be purchased through the Open University,       which jointly commissioned the series:       http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1tror/OUWBroadcastCatalogu/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ouworldwide.com%2Ftv_buyer.asp.
On Amazon.co.uk, The Normans DVD has had 32 customer reviews and       an overall 4.5* rating (out of 5) [S5]; in Germany, Amazon.de gives it a       5* rating.
In the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the DVD of The         Normans has been rated by 39 users, and it has an average of 8.2       (out of 10); one user review says Well researched and highly         recommended.
There's [sic] not enough of these tremendous programmes on         TV today [S6].
Inside the Medieval Mind has been rated by 70       users, and it has an average of 7.8 (out of 10).
On Youtube, a       site including the `Sex' episode of Inside the Medieval Mind has       over 100,000 hits, whilst others are over 10,000.
The popularity of `Sex'       is not an accident produced by people seeking something less academic, as       it is outdone by the segment on the Battle of Hastings from The         Normans (e.g., on one site, over 130,000 hits) [S7].
Google trends showed a peak of interest in `the Normans' when the series       was broadcast.
Likewise, for Professor Bartlett's other series, there is a       spike in searches of the term `medieval mind' in April 2008 (that this is       linked to Bartlett's documentary is supported by analysis of subsidiary       search terms) [S8].
The blog `HBB Free Music' has a presentation of the documentary.
Its       conclusion reads: Inside the Medieval Mind is one of the best         introductions into the world of thought of an often misunderstood period         &#8212; misunderstood because it is so foreign to our own way of thinking at         the beginning of the 21st century, more than half a millennium after the         Middles Ages gave way to the Modern era [S9].
Equally well       encapsulating the cultural and educational impact of the series, and       completing the loop between impact and underlying research is an Amazon       reviewer who advised viewers of The Normans: having seen this,       read his 'The Making of Europe' which helps to show the         continuity between Norman colonisation of Europe and the cultural,         ideological and political roots of Europeans colonisation of the world         in later times [S5].
