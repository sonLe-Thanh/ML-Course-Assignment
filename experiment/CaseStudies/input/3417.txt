     The research helped shape the EMDA's Regional Economic Strategy (RES)       [5.1] and to direct public investments based upon it, in particular, the       allocation of structural support for small and medium enterprises,       specific investment strategies for different types of towns, and       investment in skills and rural broadband.
It formed the basis for two of       the ten strategic priorities in the RES: `Enterprise and Business Support'       (p64) and `Innovation' (p75) and provided data on the background,       challenges and barriers to entrepreneurial activity in the area.
Studies 1 and 2 were well received, prompting EMDA to fund Study 3 to       explore the economies of smaller settlements across the East Midlands, the       outputs of which were included in an update of the RES published in 2009       [5.2] and 2010.
The revised RES [5.2] drew directly on the research       findings in its chapters on productivity and the spatial economy.
The 2010       RES revision reiterated the significant contribution of the research       (citing [interim 3.3], [3.4] and 3.5]), including to the analysis of       regional structure; the concept and measures of an entrepreneurial region;       and the significance of investing for growth in the role of secondary       centres.
The research made a significant contribution to the approach taken in the       RES, and hence to the overall impact of the RES [5.3].
The approach       adopted by the RES was stated as contributing &#163;10 billion to the regional       economy over its 10 years of operation, and creating or supporting more       than 81,000 jobs and 95,000 businesses.
Gross Value Added output was       calculated as between &#163;9 and &#163;15 per &#163;1 invested.
Specific to the       contribution of this research to impact, &#163;294 million was invested by EMDA       in the two strategic priority areas over 4 years, 2007-8 to 2010-11, being       51% of total investment in 2007-8 and 61% of investment in 2010/11,       implying a GVA generation of between &#163;2.6 billion and &#163;4.4 billion       (source: EMDA Annual Report 2008-9 p44 [5.4] and EMDA Corporate         Plan update 2009, [5.5] Annexe 2, p1).
It was also used in the NUTS3         Sub-Regional Profile for the East Midlands 2011, produced by EMDA       for the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) to provide a       better understanding of the regional labour market to UKCES commissioners       [5.9] (p19 and p58).
Across the East Midlands region the research was also used in five       different counties.
Nottinghamshire County Council's analysis of the       area's economic geography and connectivity (transport infrastructure) is       based on the research findings [3.3, 3.5], which are cited and partially       reproduced in the County Council's own document [5.6] p7-13.
The Council       also used the research to understand the challenges for each town in       Nottinghamshire and the appropriate policy responses.
The Assessment       [5.6], and the twin focus on concentrated growth in the City of Nottingham       and clear roles for the market towns, is reflected in resulting 2010       economic plans for the region and the 2012 Growth Plan, which       cited the research as a framework, and reflected the research's       `entrepreneurial activity' and institutional structure approach [5.7].
In       Derbyshire, the research was also used by the Centre for Cities report, Safeguarding         Derby's Economic Growth, to inform a number of recommendations,       including addressing `weak ties' through university-industry collaboration       and prioritising the needs of high growth firms (p3).
Derbyshire used it       as the key framework for the Derbyshire Market Town Investment Plan       [5.8] (pp11-14), while Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Rutland also made       use of it, with, for example, a member of the Lincolnshire and Rutland       Employment and Skills Board commenting, `The report [is...] of value when       putting together a case for funding or additional support to those who are       not as familiar with the challenges faced by rural communities'.
The research findings have also been used at the city and town level,       including as evidence in the Wellingborough Property and Services Plan       to demonstrate the importance of small and medium towns in       Northamptonshire to the rural economy and to underpin five policy       objectives, and by East Lindsey District Council, to develop a better       understanding of the economy of Louth (Lincolnshire), in Louth -         Business Profile 2010.
With the establishment of new government policy through the development       of the Local Enterprise Partnerships, the broadband research [3.6]       underpinned a successful bid to government for &#163;14.3 million further       investment in `superfast' broadband in Lincolnshire by providing key       evidence of the economic impact of Lincolnshire County Council's first       broadband investment (2003-8), with evaluation metrics to support the bid.
Lincolnshire's Policy and Research Manager observed that the research       evidence strengthened the bid by providing a greater level of confidence       that the estimated impacts would be achieved (see letter from Policy and       Research Manager, Lincolnshire County Council [5.10]).
Wider impacts: at national policy level, the research was cited in the       Government Spatial Analysis Unit Analysis of Place Newsletter, Issue 1,       November 2009, where some of its recommendations were identified as good       practice.
The research findings have also informed debate through       presentations to professionals and practitioners at, for example, RuralNet       Conference, Harrogate October 2006 (200+ delegates); Annual Action for       Market Towns conference, Melton Mowbray October 2009 (200+) and a       dissemination event at EMDA, 10 May 2011 (c. 50 representatives of       Chambers of Commerce, Business Link and local authority planning and       economic development officers).
