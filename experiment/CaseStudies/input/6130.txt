     A number of impacts arose within the communities of practice and       appreciation of British alternative poetries as they have developed since       the 1980s.
These poetries, which are constellated around the term       `linguistically innovative poetry', have been shaped by changes in the       environment in which British poets have developed, produced and performed,       and are marked by an increased willingness of poets to operate       theoretically.
Within these communities the work of Sheppard has       had significant impact between January 2008 and July 2013.
Impact 1: Sheppard's poetic practice and poetics have contributed       to the formal development of linguistically innovative poetry, via       publishing and solo presentations and in collaboration with practitioners       of other art forms and performance.
Sheppard publishes (in       magazines as well as in volumes listed in Section 3) and reads/performs       work widely, including Bluecoat, Chapter and Verse Festivals (2008 and       2011), Liverpool, Tate Gallery, Liverpool, London literary venues, such as       The Blue Bus, Crossing the Line and The Flat Time Gallery, as well as       launches of his books for Shearsman; in Manchester at The Other Room and       at several Knives, Forks and Spoons readings in the North West.
He is       well-known for his forceful spoken delivery.
Recent performances have       included revivals of work written with the concrete poetry pioneer Bob       Cobbing (1920-2002).
The revival of Cobbing's work generally owes much to       Sheppard's championing of him, most notably through the special edition of       The Journal of British and Irish Innovative Poetry (vol 4, no 2,       Sept. 2012).
Collaborative work (with the painter Pete Clarke) has been       exhibited at Dundee Arts Centre, Scottish Royal Academy, the Scottish       Poetry Library, as part of the `Text Beyond Poetry' project, Kunstraum       Dreizwanzig, K&#246;lnand, and as part of the `Re:Location' project in Novi       Sad, Serbia, between 2011-13.
One print was runner-up for the 2013 Adrian       Henri Prize.
He has collaborated on texts with Zoe Skoulding and Jeff       Hilson, both performed at `Camerades' events at the Cornerhouse,       Manchester (2013) and Rich Mix, London (2012).
Of Sheppard's performance of his work, Warrant Error, in Litter,       (Other Source 1) Alan Baker writes `Introducing Sheppard at a reading         in London, Tony Frazer said something to the effect that his work shows         that political poetry can still be written in our times.
I'd certainly         agree; there's something liberating about reading poetry like this, in         which the clich&#233;s and lies we're daily subjected to are appropriated,         satirized and exposed, and yet which still finds space for the small         human lives caught in these processes.
It's political poetry of the         first order'.
The same critic writes of The Given, `This         is an impressive piece of work, but it's only one small piece of the         output of this prolific and inventive writer, who is always looking for         new ways to extend poetic expression, and whom most contemporary poets         could learn something from'.
(Other Source 2).
Writing in The Wolf, Christopher Madden (Other Source 3) remarks:       `He read with startling velocity, manifesting all the assurance of         technique and voice of a poet who can add a substantial body of critical         work to the armoury of his practice as a poet.
None of the energy of his         performance is lost when reading the poems yourself on the printed page;         Sheppard is an astute technician of the performed and written voice, his         poems crafted meticulously as if they were musical scores.
But when the         reader glances over these pages, it is not intimidation at the challenge         of reading them that is keenly felt; rather, it is the openness of the         lines, gesturing beyond their materiality to the world of the reader in         ways not always evident in contemporary poetry'.
Impact 2: Sheppard's work as critic and reviewer has contributed       to greater awareness of the tenets of LIP.
Sheppard, in addition       to texts listed above, reviews poetry books and co-edits the Journal         of British and Irish Innovative Poetry, which has a readership       within poetry communities, and (by title and contents) fosters       understanding of literary innovation.
He has spoken at academic       conferences with a cross-over into the poetry world, such as The Small       Press Conference at Salford University in 2012, but also at the Hay Poetry       Jamboree in 2011, an independent gathering.
A fellow poet-critic Scott Thurston confirms Sheppard's influence and       contribution, stating (Other Source 4) that `Robert Sheppard ... is a         key figure in the development of Innovative Poetry in the UK through his         work as a poet, critic, editor, reviewer, publisher and lecturer.
His         critical study The Poetry of Saying: British Poetry and its       Discontents 1950-2000 (2005) offers the most theoretically         sophisticated account of the history of Innovative Poetry, including         detailed examinations of the work of Roy Fisher, Bob Cobbing, Lee         Harwood, Tom Raworth, Allen Fisher, Adrian Clarke, Ulli Freer and Maggie         O'Sullivan.... Aside from his critical work, Sheppard has also been         influential in the use of the term poetics in literary-critical         work....Sheppard's major achievement as a poet is his long work       Twentieth Century Blues'.
Alongside influencing the work of fellow poets, Sheppard's poetry has       shaped the work of artists including one who works collaboratively with       Sheppard on a regular basis.
This artist was invited to take part in a       project looking at the relationship between how we read poetry.
Artists       and writers were commissioned to work together and this show `Poetry       beyond Text' went out in Dundee and then in Edinburgh in 2011.
The artist       confirmed he got this work as a result of previous work with Sheppard.
(Statement 1)     Impact 3.
Sheppard's work as poet-critic and poetry organiser has       fostered the careers of a number of established and emerging poets, small       press publishers and events organisers, all working on or with linguistically         innovative poetry.
The Poetry and Poetics Research Group (PPRG) at       Edge Hill, which Sheppard initiated, has engendered, nurtured and       facilitated the development of poets well-known and active in the poetry       community.
Publications and organising by members include Joanne Ashcroft       winning the Purple Moose Prize 2012, the prize being that her chapbook Love         Songs for Mina Loy was published by Seren, a follow up to her 2011       KFS book From Parts Becoming Whole; Matt Fallaize's Delete       (KFS, 2011); Andrew Taylor's myriad of pamphlets collected in Radio         Mast Horizon (Shearsman, 2013); Tom Jenks' Items (if p then       q, 2013); and Lindsey Holland's Particle Soup (KFS, 2012).
Much of       this work has been discussed in terms of practice and poetics at PPRG       meetings.
Taylor co-edits Erbacce Press and magazine (and occasional       readings).
Michael Egan runs Holdfire Press (and occasional readings).
Jenks co-runs The Other Room reading series.
Holland runs North West       Poets, an umbrella group for poets in the region and co-edited its       loco-specific anthology Sculpted (North West Poets, 2013).
The       PPRG organised the April 2013 one day conference on Literary Collaboration       which drew in poets and artistic collaborators from the region and enabled       them to further the poetics of their collaborative work.
The PPRG works in       tandem with the reading series Sheppard has been running at the       Rose Theatre since 1997.
A number of people interviewed to inform this case study confirmed the       contributions that Sheppard and his work have made to the vitality       of the field and the work of those active within it.
An editor of an       independent press in Bristol notes: `Since relocating to the         north-west, a lot of people have gravitated towards Rob and the region         and he has provided validation for people who might have struggled in         this genre otherwise [...] Unlike other poets Robert doesn't seek to         promote clones of himself.
Work that has come out of his students has         been startlingly good and original and has moved the agenda commercially         and artistically &#8212; see people like Scott Thurston for example.
Rob has         given these people an example of where they would like to go with their         careers.
Rob provides an example for young poets such as these [...] Rob         influences the industry through various events and conferences,         including those held at The Bluecoat and various readings in Wales that         often attract 40 to 50 people'.
(Statement 2).
A fellow poet-critic reported of Sheppard: `I would not have         pursued my career had it not been for Rob, it is no overstatement to say         I would not have become the writer I am [...] Rob taught me how to         approach publishers, he taught me what I need to do to be a commercial         writer &#8212; he is very good at bridging the gap between academia and         commercial activities [...] The events held at the Rose Theatre within         the Ormskirk campus of Edge Hill have been very influential on the         industry.
Anybody who is anybody within the genre has been to these         readings &#8212; I include Alec Newman of Knives Forks and Spoons Press in         that.
Rob, in terms of stimulating public debate, is highly influential.'
(Statement 3)     A poet-editor remarked that Sheppard has, `Certainly had an         impact on my life as a poet.
Rob has been highly influential by         introducing me to writers and other individuals who are interested in         innovative poetry (note: within REF impact time frames) that have shaped         my career [...] It is not an overstatement to say that I have the career         I have as a result of my relationship with Rob.'
(Statement 4).
A survey of members of the Poetry and Poetics Research Group, past and         present 1999- 2013 (11 respondents of 14 group members)     Members of the Poetry and Poetics Research Group, past and present (from       1999-2013) were surveyed.
Nine agreed that being in the Group had made       them more aware of the tenets of linguistically innovative poetry and that       they had a better understanding of British poetry.
The writings of Robert Sheppard were well known to the       participants both creative and critical.
`From the creative texts I         learned about contemporary linguistically innovative poetry in relation         to one writer's practice and output.
The critical texts increased my         knowledge of the history (literary, social and cultural) and practices         in what has come to be called linguistically innovative poetry.'
Another wrote: `Robert Sheppard is at the forefront of British poetry.
His cataloguing of important poets is much needed and will be vital for         future generations.'
Another wrote: `They (the outputs) have         significantly widened my awareness and appreciation of innovative         British poetry and have had an important influence on my own work as a         poet.'
Asked about the significance of the term linguistically innovative       poetry, at least four members defined themselves as linguistically       innovative poets, one noting `integral to my practice', another, `shaped         my own practice'.
`It's given me more possibilities,'       reflected another.
All members agreed that attendance at the PPRG had       affected or changed their writing practice; `a forum to explore and         experiment to develop my practice as a writer (poetry and poetics)'       as one put it.
`I have presented work at a developmental stage at the         PPRG that has since been published in book form', and another: `Robert         Sheppard has been influential in the way I write poetry.'
