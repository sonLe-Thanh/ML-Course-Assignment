     On April 26th 2013 the Department of Health published the "Caldicott 2"       report (formally, the Information         Governance Review, 2013) (henceforth, `the Review'), the most recent       systemic overview of patient       information governance in the NHS.
One member (Richard Wild) of the Steering Group that selected the Panel       which in turn conducted the       Information Governance Review, has noted in correspondence with Grace and       Taylor that:     "Grace and Taylor's work changed the perspective of the review panel on       the issue of patient objection to the       use of confidential health information for purposes beyond direct care."
The Review, published by the Department of Health, duly highlighted the       piece published by Grace and       Taylor in the Medical Law Review, stating (p.79):     "The Review Panel noted with interest the argument that the law requires       any reasonable objection to the       disclosure of personal confidential data to be respected".
This argument was put forward by Grace and Taylor in their published       piece, as cited above etc..
The research by Grace and Taylor therefore can be said to have influenced       to an extent the Information         Governance Review, which included the following pertinent       recommendation in relation to the work of the       new National Health and Social Care Information Centre:     [Recommendation 11, Information Governance Review, 2013]     "The Information Centre's code of practice should establish that an       individual's existing right to object to their       personal confidential data being shared, and to have that objection       considered, applies to both current and       future disclosures irrespective of whether they are mandated or permitted       by statute...
Both the criteria used       to assess reasonable objections and the consistent application of those       criteria should be reviewed on an       ongoing basis."
In a press release on 26 April 2013, the Department of Health noted that       at a conference used to launch the       Information Governance Review report, "[Health Secretary] Jeremy Hunt said       that while effective sharing of       patient information has enormous potential to improve patient care,       services and treatments, this can only be       done effectively if patients are given a say over how their personal       information is used."
"[Hunt] announced that:            any patient that does not want personal data held in their GP record         to be shared with the Health and         Social Care Information Centre will have their objection respected       where personal data has already been shared from a GP practice to the         Information Centre, a patient will         still be able to have the identifiable information removed..."          With a statutory Code of Practice now under development by the Health and       Social Care Information Centre       of the NHS, the impact of the research by Grace and Taylor has already       affected the legal rights of each and       every person whose medical or patient data is held by some part of the NHS       (that is, the vast majority of the       population in the UK) , but more specifically, it will have benefited the       informational privacy of those who       seek to object to the proposed, non-consensual use of their sensitive       personal data in health research       programmes and projects, as follows:     Recently, Grace and Taylor (2013), as mentioned above, influenced the       eleventh recommendation of       the Information Governance Review report &#8212; and this       recommendation, centring on the right of patients to       object to the sharing of their confidential information where this is       feasible, can be acknowledged as now       comprising part of Department of Health policy in their response to the Information         Governance         Review report (Department of Health, 2013, p.29-30).
Whilst the statutory Code of Practice on the use of confidential       information in health settings (to be       promulgated by the Health and Social Care Information Centre) might not be       published within the REF time       window for impact (as publication is currently stalled), the Health and       Social Care Information Centre has       published interim guidance on the issue, to which organisations in the       health sector must have regard, and       which organisations are now following as a result.
The right of patients       to object to the sharing of their       sensitive confidential information in particular circumstances is       described on pp.
24-26 of the main part of the       interim guidance, and forms 'Rule 4' within the guidance (Health and       Social Care Information Centre 2013a)       and in Section 18 of the supplementary interim reference guidance from the       Health and Social       Care Information Centre (2013b).
