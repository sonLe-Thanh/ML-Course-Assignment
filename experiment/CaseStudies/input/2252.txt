     Empowering people and communities to gain confidence in         self-expression:             Between 2009 and 2012, 78 people have attended the creative writing         workshops and 89 have attended the children's book-making activities.
Cr&#232;che facilities were provided, enabling opportunities for cultural         engagement and creative self-expression that would otherwise not have         been available to parents with young children.
Participants range from         young mothers to those over 50, with multi-cultural and multi-national         membership, some with English as a second language, or with literacy         issues, and some with mental health issues or physical disabilities.
One         participant said: `I'm a single mum from Salford who has got three           poor GCSEs, but that's my work and I am proud of what I have done and           achieved.'
This intervention has enhanced existing literacy and English         provision at the Broughton Centre in Salford, Greater Manchester,         developed participants' critical thinking and practical writing skills,         and provided the opportunity for participants to build social         relationships and feelings of trust.
12 members of the group have         entered paid employment, and over 50% of the original members have moved         on to other unaccredited or accredited courses.
One participant said: `I           would like to continue with the classes as my life has changed though           them and they help with my confidence.'
Access to University         resources continues to be provided via invitations to visit events on         campus, for example, the World Book Night celebration, 23 April, 2013,         at which participants read their work to an audience of students and         academics (transport for participants is provided from project funds).
Such interactions raise awareness of the relevance of the University to         local communities and possible routes into higher education.
One member         of the Mocha Parade group said: `I particularly enjoyed the trip to           the Art Gallery at Salford University.'
Two former members are         currently in higher education and another has become a qualified         counsellor.
One participant said: `With this, it was about me.
I           learned a lot about myself.
It re-affirmed my feelings and passion for           community work and I now want to get a job in community work.'
Developing a listening and responsive model of participation, which         ensures participants feel ownership over their engagement, which is         tailored to meet their objectives, rather than being pre-structured and         `imposed':             The project design was informed by Hurley and Kendall's work in         inclusive community arts practice.
Participants are self-selecting.
There is no attendance or registration fee, and people are welcome to         `dip in' to sessions without making a formal commitment to attend         regularly.
The researchers worked in collaboration with locally-based         writers to shape provision according to participants' expressed needs         and ambitions (for example, working with a book artist to create work to         share with their children).
One participant said: `I've never           thought I could see it in black and white.
A book I have done for my           own son.'
The evaluation of the project was also participatory.
For example,         participants volunteered to receive training in the use of hand-held         video cameras, and then negotiated what, how and who they would film.
Participants were also invited to join a focus group, and to sit on a         project steering group.
The researchers only attended group sessions         when invited to do so by group members.
At all times the ownership and         development of the writing groups was firmly with the participants         rather than the researchers.
Dr Danijela Bogdanovich, the sociologist         commissioned to evaluate the project, states:       [Participants] valued being engaged and consulted, being asked about           their experiences of attending Writing Lives and their views about how           those experiences can be improved.
This demonstrates that the group           members are active contributors to the programme, with their           contribution extending beyond their creative output.
(Bogdanovich,         2012)        This sense of collective ownership and self-determination can be seen         in entries to the participant-maintained blog, `Writing lives: fragments         of imagination in words'         (http://broughtonwritinglives.blogspot.com/):         `We meet once a week to share written treats, try new poetic rhymes           and memories of old times, pen short fiction as well as fact - all           this and that - and whatever else, creative and written, that takes           our fancy.'
Supporting a diverse range of voluntary sector organisations in         engaging people and communities:             Partnerships have been established with the Embrace project (Salford         Museum &amp; Art Gallery), Manchester Art Gallery, Martin Harris Centre,         Refugee and Asylum Seeker Participatory Action Research (RAPAR), Salford         Ethnic Minority &amp; Traveller Achievement Service, Salford Library         Service, START in Salford, Contour Housing Group, The Hive in the Cliff,         Salford Women Writers, The Duchy of Lancaster, Symphony Housing, Women         Working Together.
These partnerships have been centred around the         Broughton Trust in Salford, Greater Manchester, whose objectives are:                 To get more local people into paid employment;          To raise aspiration and participation in adult learning programmes;          To strengthen community infrastructure, resilience and           sustainability;          To create developmental and diversionary activities for young           people.
Participation in adult learning in East Salford has quadrupled over         the past five years.
Workshops have brought about interactions between         people from diverse ethnic, social and age groups who may not otherwise         have met.
Workshops and evaluations are co- led by Writing Lives         members, demonstrating that participation in this project is empowering         participants to undertake leadership and mentoring roles within their         communities: `Belonging to a group gives you a lot of confidence and           you make friends that way'.
Evolving partnership models which do not end abruptly with the         research but endure and deepen beyond the research grant period:             Writing Lives workshops are now a recognised part of the Broughton         Trust's education programme and the `Broughton Wordsmiths' has become an         established group, meeting weekly at Mocha Parade, with a core         attendance of 8-9 participants from diverse backgrounds.
In 2010, due to         local demand, two more writing workshop programmes were set-up.
A         Children's Story Writing &amp; Book Making Workshop meets weekly on         Wednesdays at St Sebastian's Community Centre, Lower Broughton with         single parents as the target participants and a core membership of 13.
In September 2010, in spartnership with Contour Housing Group, a         developmental group of 5 local residents began meeting weekly at St         James' Church Hall.
All 3 programmes of writing workshops continue to         attract enthusiastic attendance from self-selecting participants.
Writing Lives is also a partner in the following projects and bidding         activities :        The Broughton Trust's Towpath funded InterActive Arts Programme         provided 2 x 10 week courses exploring personal and community         histories/stories.
`Put a Plug in it', intergenerational project on the heritage of         communication technology: gained &#163;4,500 funding from Wigan Leisure and         Culture Trust, 2010.
The Hive in the Cliff bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Gypsy Storytelling Project for Roma women, hosted by Women Working         Together (predominantly South Asian membership).
Story Exchange for National Refugee Week, June 2011.
`World in a Box' cultural exchange with the Embrace Project Jan -         April 2011.The Broughton Trust is involved in the British Council's         Active Citizens project, which has twinned them with the Israeli         organisation SPARK PRO.
Writing Lives is to be used as a model for the         provision of conflict resolution training for young people via the         medium of story-telling.
