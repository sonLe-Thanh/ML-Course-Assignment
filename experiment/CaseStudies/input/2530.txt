     The Homelessness Act 2002 obliged all local housing authorities in       England to implement a       strategy for preventing homelessness.
By 2006, while this had led to a       reduction in the number of       homeless individuals and families, it was felt that implementation focused       too much on what the       Housing Minister criticised as "gatekeeping... that discouraged people         from applying for         assistance".
By setting out a radically different approach to       homelessness practice, based on       improving the options for people who seek help, the Pawson-led study for       ODPM enabled local       authorities and their partner agencies to fulfil their obligations more       effectively.
In the period       2006-2009, following implementation of the study's Guide to Good         Practice, homelessness, as       officially measured in England, declined by 48%.
Directly arising from the research recommendations, a new official       framework for monitoring       homelessness prevention activity was put in place in 2008.
In April that       year, data collection on       local authorities' actions under legislation was expanded to include       figures for homelessness       prevention and relief taking place outside the statutory framework.
2011/12 was the fourth annual       release of statistics by the Department for Communities and Local       Government, reporting       199,000 cases of extra-framework homelessness prevention or relief (a 5%       increase from       2010/11; see 5.1, below).
Additionally, the release noted that the data       series was no longer       considered `experimental', due to confidence in the response rates and       quality of the figures.
In May 2008, the study was cited, in support of UK Government measures       and statistics, in the       `Models of innovation and good practice' section of the Australian       Government's Green Paper       Which Way Home?
A New Approach to Homelessness (see 5.2).
In the       USA, its Guide to Good         Practice has been described as "the inspiration" for the Creating         Programs that Work toolkits       produced by the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH), with [text       removed for       publication], Advisor to NAEH, saying "I suggested that NAEH develop         these guides, based on         Hal's previous work" (see 5.3).
In 2009, the study informed US       Federal Government activity,       undertaken within the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing       Programme championed       by President Obama.
Focusing on at-risk individuals and families, this       $1.5bn programme has       been credited with helping to prevent US homelessness "soaring"       during the recession (again,       see 5.3).
In the UK, with an increase in homelessness since the recession,       particularly in England,       preventative work continues.
People affected by `multiple exclusion       homelessness' (MEH) are       one of the most socially marginalised groups, experiencing the sharpest       end of problems such as       poverty, substance misuse and engagement in damaging `street' activities.
High proportions have       been a victim of violent crime (43%), have attempted suicide (38%) or have       self-harmed (30%).
The Alliance's MEH study has already had demonstrable impacts in this       field, as described       below.
The MEH study has had particular input into the work of the Ministerial       Working Group (MWG) on       Preventing and Tackling Homelessness, established by [text removed for       publication] the then       Housing Minister in 2010.
Following high-level briefings to the MWG's       Officials Working Group,       researchers were informed that "the MEH work is very much informing the         direction of travel for         the MWG's second report" (source at Department of Work and Pensions)       and Fitzpatrick was       invited to speak directly to Ministers at the House of Commons.
This       briefing resulted in Ministers       deciding to "re-shape" the national strategic approach to       homelessness prevention in England       around the study's identified intervention points, with Fitzpatrick's       assistance.
A representative of       the Government's Homelessness and Support Division describes the influence       of the MEH       research, in this regard, as "fundamental".
Published in August 2012 as Making every contact count: A joint         approach to preventing         homelessness (see 5.4), the Government's report makes extensive       reference to the MEH       research and replicates one of its data tables in full.
In particular, the       focus on early intervention       points owes much to Bramley's sequencing analysis, which demonstrates that       `visible' forms of       homelessness are typically rather late signs of MEH.
This insight has been       of particular value in       emphasising the need for schools, drugs and alcohol services, and the       criminal justice system, to       play a central role in preventative interventions.
A Specialist Advisor to       the Department for       Communities and Local Government (DCLG), has said "on every occasion,         whenever I'm talking         about tackling single homelessness I mention your conclusions; both         local authorities and third         sector providers seem very interested".
The MEH study was described by [text removed for publication] the Joseph       Rowntree Foundation       as "utterly game changing" and of having "reversed the view &#8212;         strongly held over decades by         most in the field &#8212; that homelessness itself contributed to the other         features of exclusion" (see       5.5).
It has influenced service planning for distinct segments within the       MEH population,       prompting national and local service providers to consider how best to       design tailored services for       different subgroups of users with specific combinations of experiences and       needs.
Users of the       research to date include major service providers, umbrella bodies at a       range of scales, from the       European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless       (FEANTSA) to the       Glasgow Homelessness Network, and local authorities.
In December 2011, The       City of       Westminster Council, which has by far the largest concentration of rough       sleepers in the UK,       arranged a bespoke seminar on the MEH findings for its commissioned       service providers.
[text       removed for publication] Thames Reach has described the study as "required         reading" (see 5.6)       and [text removed for publication], Homeless Link, has said "I use it         on an almost daily basis in         meetings and in consultation responses.
[I've also] given it to         Ministers in [the] Home Office and         DWP and to senior health officials."
In addition to high-level briefings, the research has been disseminated       to stakeholders via       concise `Briefing Papers' (freely downloadable from the Heriot-Watt       website).
Findings were       presented at a National Launch event chaired by journalist Jon Snow in       September 2011 and to       more than 120 local policy makers and practitioners in feedback seminars       across all seven case       study cities (between July and October 2011).
In Australia, 200       stakeholders &#8212; mostly       practitioners &#8212; attended a plenary address on the research in Melbourne in       May 2013 at the       Council to Homeless Persons conference.
Homelessness agencies in Victoria       have also       promoted the work internally.
Due to interest in the research in Australia, Fitzpatrick was invited to       submit an article to PARITY,       the national magazine for Australian homelessness professionals (published       June 2013).
In       addition, tweets and blog posts have generated coverage in The         Observer, Inside Housing,       Community Care, Third Force News, Professional Social         Work, Drink and Drugs News, Health         Service Journal, and The Psychologist.
In October 2013,       Fitzpatrick gave a plenary presentation       on MEH to an International Symposium on Health and Homelessness in London,       leading to       interdisciplinary work with medics and clinical psychologists.
In       September 2013, she gave the       keynote address to the Glasgow Homelessness Network conference, briefing       150 delegates from       across the statutory and voluntary sectors in Scotland's largest       metropolitan area.
The LankellyChase Foundation is using the work as the evidential basis       for a &#163;5M programme of       investment in interventions, as well as research, to address severe and       multiple disadvantage       across the UK (see 5.7).
The research is also central to the Disadvantaged       Groups element of       the Glasgow Community Planning Partnership's `single outcome agreement'       with the Scottish       Government: a ten year `plan for place' that sets out some of the shared       priorities for service       provision in the city over the next decade, including those related to the       priority areas of alcohol,       youth employment and vulnerable people.
It has been used by the Economic       and Social       Research Council to bring housing research to practitioners, most recently       in the newsletter of the       KE project, Evidence (June 2013).
On the strength of its major       impact on policy and practice, as       well as its scientific quality and exceptional research contribution, the       study achieved       `outstanding' status in its final impact assessment by the ESRC.
