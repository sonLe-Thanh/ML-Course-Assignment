     There are &gt;2,100 new cases of thyroid cancer each year in the UK,       &gt;48,000 in the US, and &gt;213,000 worldwide.
It is the most frequently       occurring endocrine tumour, and one of the few cancers where the incidence       is increasing [a].
Thyroid cancer, unlike most other cancers, is       common among younger people (&lt;50 years) who are still in work, and       particularly women (many with children).
Most cases are       well-differentiated thyroid cancer (85-90% of new cases), in which the       cure rate is already high; therefore new treatments that are safer,       cheaper or easier to administer are the research goals.
The results of the HiLo trial provided clear evidence for a shorter and       safer treatment for thyroid cancer.
Cancer Research UK commented that the       results of this trial "have set a new gold standard for treating         thyroid cancer, reducing radiation doses to just one third of the         current level... patients taking the lower dose capsule can be treated         more easily as an outpatient in hours and experience fewer side effects"       [b].
The HiLo trial collected data on clinical efficacy, patient safety/harms,       NHS resource use, and societal costs, allowing a comprehensive assessment       of the impact in the clinical setting, as well as on healthcare costs and       people's lives.
Overall, the research described above showed the following       benefits to patients and to the economy:     Benefits to patients:            New treatment can be delivered as outpatient treatment which is         quicker and easier for patient       Fewer side effects (e.g.
nausea and neck pain)       Reduced chance of developing a new tumour in the next 10-30 years,         which can often be more difficult to treat than the original thyroid         cancer       Improved quality of life, as THST does not need to be suspended (of         particular relevance to those of working age, or caring for children &#8212;         which is a relatively high proportion for this type of cancer)          Economic benefits:            Reduction in side effects is associated with lower costs to treat         these side effects.
Shorter hospital stay also reduces costs       Overall 14% reduction in NHS costs using low dose radioiodine plus         thyrotropin alfa compared to the previous standard of high dose plus         thyroid hormone withdrawal.
Many thyroid cancer patients are in employed work, and the average         number of days taken off work during the 2-4 weeks before radioiodine         treatment is 1 day (low dose) compared to 5 days (high dose).
We have disseminated the results of the HiLo trial through presentations       at several international conferences in countries planning to change       routine practice (including Europe, Israel and Korea) [c].
Our       results were also widely reported in the medical press and in       patient-facing resources on thyroid cancer treatment [d].
In 2012, the trial findings were used to change the European licence       indication for Thyrogen (thyrotropin alfa), so that it can now be used       with low dose radioiodine (the previous licence was only for use with the       high dose) [e].
New guidelines are currently in preparation in both the UK [f]       and US [g] to recommend low dose radioactive iodine and       thyrotropin alfa for routine practice.
In the meantime, this treatment.is       already being adopted; the NCRI Clinical Studies Groups 2013 annual       report, impact section, states: "The HiLO study published in the New         England Journal of Medicine is now significantly changing the clinical         practice of oncologists and endocrinologists giving post-operative         radio-iodine ablation to thyroid cancer patients.
The dose has now been         decreased considerably as a result of this study and adoption has         proceeded rapidly in the UK" [h].
An informal survey of clinicians has shown that 16 centres in the UK have       implemented the HiLo trial protocols since the publication.
Responses       included:     "I am routinely using HILO doses as per study in my practice ever         since results were confirmed."
"Our policy...is to stratify patients needed I131 post thyroidectomy         who would have fit the criteria for the Hi-Lo into 2 groups low risk or         higher risk.
Those patients in who remnant ablation is the aim of         management (i.e.
well differentiated node negative disease T1-3) are         considered low risk and are treated with Thyrogen priming pre ablation         and 1.1 GBq I131 as HiLo study" [i].
"We have been using lower activity RAI for about 18 months" [j].
"I can confirm that I have implemented one element of the HiLo study         before 31/7/2013...Specifically this is the lower dose of I131" [k].
Following on from the HiLo trial, a new trial &#8212; ION &#8212; is underway to       determine whether thyroid cancer patients, in whom the risk of the cancer       coming back is low, need radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation at all, given       that they have already had a total thyroidectomy and are being given       thyroid stimulating hormone suppression (TSHS) therapy [l].
The       control arm for this trial uses low dose radioactive iodine, demonstrating       that this is now entering accepted standard practice in the 35 centres       participating in the trial.
