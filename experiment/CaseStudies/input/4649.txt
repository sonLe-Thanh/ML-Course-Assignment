     In 1995, and almost overnight, Montserrat became dependent on       volcanological expertise, with       authorities needing advice to determine warning levels, travel       restrictions and evacuations.
Prior to       this "there were no contingency plans on Montserrat or with         the UK Government" for dealing with       volcanic crises on the Island [a].
Sparks and Aspinall provided       direct counsel, and it is their       expertise and quality of research that continues to underpin the emergency       management of the       ongoing volcanic activity at Soufri&#232;re Hills.
Nearly twenty years on,       socio-economic impact is still       being felt from both their early developmental work and in their       subsequent roles, both on       Montserrat and in the wider world.
Both Sparks and Aspinall contributed to the establishment of the MVO and       were appointed as       Chief Scientists from 1996-1998.
Sparks and Aspinall were later       commissioned in 1997 by the       Governments of Montserrat and the UK to form a Risk Assessment Panel       (RAP), which       transformed into a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) in 2002,       established by the Overseas       Territories Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office [a].
The SAC is a group of       independent international volcanologists whose role is to (i) evaluate       evidence framed by the       understanding of volcanic processes, (ii) forecast future activity, and       (iii) assess hazards and risks       with uncertainties by adopting a fully probabilistic approach.
To do this,       the SAC works with the       MVO to provide advice to the UK and Montserrat Governments, and Civil       Protection Groups, on       long-term hazard and risk assessment and emergency management [b].
Sparks was the chair of       both the RAP and SAC from 1997 until 2003 [c], and later re-joined       in 2011-present.
Aspinall has       been the facilitator of the risk assessment work by the RAP and SAC from       1997 until present [c].
Both Sparks and Aspinall "have been in the vanguard of the scientific         response and assessment of         risk and both have provided invariably sound advice and calm         professionalism on which GoM and         UKG have based their decisions, initially for the protection of the         community during the main         eruptive stage (1995-98) and subsequently for the re-development of         housing and key facilities to         enable the community to remain on island" [a].
For instance,       their expertise has been used to       quantify volcanic risk which "enabled the UK and Montserrat Government         to start a more rational         plan for responding to the volcano, and in particular it assisted the         early stages of planning longer         term facilities in the North of the island to enable those who did not         wish to evacuate to remain on         island" [a].
These decisions can be attributed directly to       Bristol researchers and continues to have       a  "profound impact on the safety of the island's inhabitants" [d].
Indeed, the Head of Disaster       Management for the UK Overseas Territories has stated; "I have no         doubt that the hazard maps,         educational programmes, daily scientific reports in language that the         community understood and         close co-operation with the Government of the day, resulted in scores or         more of lives being         saved" [a].
There are multiple lines of evidence of how Bristol's research is linked       to policy and decisions on       Montserrat.
One current example is sand mining [d,e].
In the last       few years, sand mining has       become an important source of income for Montserrat.
However, these       activities have caused       some environmental concerns, including destruction of the main roads from       truck movements, road       safety, and noise and dust nuisance to residents.
One solution is to       develop the port at Plymouth       for export, however this brings workers into a potentially hazardous       region, despite volcanic activity       being classified as `low' for the last 2 years.
Consequently, the SAC and       MVO were commissioned       by the Government of Montserrat National Disaster Preparedness and       Advisory Committee to       assess risks in relation to airport operations and commercial mining in       order to establish whether or       not various options were feasible.
The SAC used knowledge of empirical       pyroclastic flow models       [6], and statistical frequency-magnitude relationships of dome       collapses to assess the risk and       quantify attendant uncertainties [5], using the formal expert       elicitation methods developed by       Aspinall [8].
Key research involving both current and former       Bristol PhD students supervised by       Sparks has also directly informed the estimates.
From this work,       occupational risk levels to workers       were assessed and found to be 8-20 times higher than UK workers in the       extractive industries,       thus requiring additional efforts in monitoring and worker safety [b,e].
"As a result, controlled export         of volcanic sand now takes place from the jetty in Plymouth" [d].
The advice of Sparks and Aspinall through the RAP and SAC led to the       permanent establishment       of MVO with a dedicated building, employment of fifteen technical and       scientific staff and also       supports eight off-island administrative positions [a].
"In a         population of only a few thousand, MVO         is a significant employer and a critical resource for the island and its         long-term sustainability" [a].
Furthermore, the on-going monitoring and publicity around the Soufri&#232;re       Hills eruption has led to       this eruption being incorporated into the UK National Curriculum as a       G.C.S.E Geography case       study.
The eruption and its mitigation policies have been studied by up to       962,238 school children       between 2008 and present [f].
The combination of volcanic process fundamentals (under Sparks), and       modelling of risk (under       Aspinall), provides the foundation of the risk assessment methodology that       has been applied       successfully on Montserrat since 1995.
The MVO has established a testbed       for new monitoring       tools, including those that measure volcanic gases, deformation,       seismology and strain.
More than       that, its management and decision making processes (designed and       implemented by Aspinall), are       still being used today, and tested and trialled worldwide in volcanic       settings as diverse as       Guatemala and Tristan de Cunha.
This underscores the importance (and       ethos) of knowledge       sharing and risk reduction worldwide that is a leitmotif throughout the       work of Sparks and Aspinall;       "the University of Bristol volcanology group have led some of the major         research themes globally         that feed into the day-to-day operations of volcano observatories.
For         example, the work of         Professor Steve Sparks... has led to improved knowledge transfer on         volcanic hazards and risk         assessment tools" [g], and "the research performed by the         group has led to improved decision         support and information transfer for the world's volcano community"       [g].
To that end, as well as setting up MVO and facilitating its growth into a       world-leading observatory,       Aspinall and Sparks have co-authored a substantial report (2011)       describing where this very       knowledge is most needed, as part of the Global Facility for Disaster       Reduction and Recovery       (GFDRR) [h].
The GFDRR was launched in 2006 by the World Bank as a       partnership between the       UN, donors and developing countries.
It was established to help developing       countries, particularly       those identified as the most vulnerable natural disaster `hotspots', to       build their capacity for       disaster prevention, emergency preparedness, response, and recovery.
The       report [h] presents       the results of a pilot study on the risk posed by volcanoes in the       priority countries of the GFDRR       and the World Bank and helps unveil how volcanic risk can impact the       social and economic profiles       of vulnerable countries; "The aim of the study was to establish         science-based evidence for better         integration of volcanic risks in national Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)         programmes in priority         countries, as well as regional cooperation in DRR programmes for all         countries supported under         GFDRR" [i].
Since its launch, GFDRR has responded to the       growing needs and demands of       countries, currently funding more than 120 disaster risk reduction (DRR)       and inter-related climate       risk management programs in many disaster-prone low and middle income       countries.
GFDRR has,       according to their website, spent over $197M in overseas programmes since       its inception and this       aid has been guided, in part, by the report [j].
The World Bank       states, "the findings of this study         have been important in informing the continued development of the GFRDD         country programs,         which guide our interventions in 31 priority countries around the world.
Through this study we have         been able to more accurately reflect volcanic risk in our programmatic         approach" [j].
The GFDRR       report, specifically the methodology highlighted within it, has also       shaped the thinking, and actions,       of the United Nations itself; "This evidence, and the method developed         is study, has been critical         for the development of the next Global Assessment Report (GAR15)...This,         in turn, will have a         direct impact to national governments, decision makers and         practitioners, as well as         implementation pathways for mainstreaming volcanic risk reduction into         policies and practice" [i].
The work of Aspinall and Sparks in volcanic risk reduction has had impact       worldwide.
Through the       MVO, they have developed an exemplar of both monitoring capability and,       critically, effective       decision making [a,d,g].
Through their work with the World Bank       and the United Nations they have       delimited the countries most at risk and, therefore, most in need of an       understanding of the best-practices       of an exemplary volcano observatory such as MVO [i,j].
The report       [h] "has been a         timely contribution to our continuous efforts to reflect the latest         scientific understanding of disaster         risk n the programming of our funding to vulnerable countries.
This         supports our efforts to build         increased capacity and expertise in understanding risks from natural         hazards in countries around         the world" [j].
Through a better understanding of both risk       and decision making, hazard managers       are better armed to make good, effective choices that reduce exposure to       volcanic hazards even       during crises and in periods of great uncertainty.
