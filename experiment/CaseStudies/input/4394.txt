     This research was crucial to the initial development of Birmingham's care       home closure methodology, with the summary of good practice provided by Le       Mesurier and Littlechild (R1) directly influencing the subsequent design       of local policy and procedures.
After this, the subsequent evaluation by the University of Birmingham was       specifically designed to report interim findings part way through the       closure process so that any emerging lessons about outcomes for older       people (positive or negative) could be directly incorporated into       subsequent closures.
This provided a crucial form of external,         independent scrutiny and meant that the research findings would       directly influence policy and practice.
In the event, the research found       improved outcomes as a result of the closure process and so Council       procedures were confirmed and continued.
Had mortality increased, however,       there would have been a major opportunity for the City Council to rethink       its approach and change its methods/working practices.
The impact of the       research then was the provision of a `sense check' and safeguard in       the process for Birmingham's older people and their families.
The research was also key to securing buy-in from the people of         Birmingham (including the affected older people and their families)       ahead of a controversial closure plan.
The commissioning of the evaluation       demonstrated the commitment of Birmingham City Council to ensuring they       carried out their closures in a responsive way and that their decisions       were transparent and robust, being endorsed by verifiable research       (indeed, the Birmingham study is believed to have provided the most       extensive publicly available data on care home closure in the country).
As       part of this process, the studies produced by the University of Birmingham       (R1 and R2) were made publically available and the process and findings       held to scrutiny.
As a result the research also contributed to the         smooth continuation of the closure plan, in conjunction with the       positive experiences of those moved in the closures (source 1).
In 2011, towards the end of the study, the high profile news story on the       financial problems in Southern Cross began to emerge.
The University of       Birmingham was commissioned by ADASS to produce high quality but rapid       guidance (a 2 month project from start to national dissemination) for all       local authorities in England based on their research.
This was carried out       in very difficult media and political circumstances owing to the very       large nature of Southern Cross, the significant distress being caused to       older people and their families and political pressures on the then Health       Secretary (who was facing criticisms of potential privatisation around the       Health Bill just as a major private company was in trouble in adult social       care).
The situation was also made more complicated by media stories about       the quick wins/high risk nature of venture capital investment in Southern       Cross, the complexity of understanding the various holding companies and       off-shore banks involved, and the fact that one of the investors that       might have withdrawn money and triggered bankruptcy was RBS (a bank owned       by the tax payer).
It was for this reason that the University of Birmingham was approached       to conduct the research in the first place &#8212; given its longstanding       reputation for `rigour and relevance', its ability to conduct confidential       research quickly and discretely, and its role as a critical friend to       health and social care policy.
In addition, the University was already       collecting important outcomes data into the Birmingham home closures       process, and was therefore able to draw on original research findings as       well as a detailed knowledge of policy and practice in order to produce       the subsequent guide.
The guidance was made publically available in June       2011       (www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2011/06/08JuneCareReport.aspx).
The former President of the national Association of Directors of Adult       Social Services is clear that the research, and the guide in particular,       was of great benefit through the process.
For him, it not only `proved         crucial during negotiations with government and with Southern Cross       [and] helped to ensure a smooth handover to new providers without       the major upheavals that might otherwise have occurred', but it aided his       work with the media `helping [him] to summarise the evidence base and       explain what [ADASS] were doing to protect the older people involved'.
The       findings were also used by ADASS and others in their negotiations with       Southern Cross and its landlords to make sure that no homes closed quickly       (given a key finding about the importance of time and space to plan       closures well and work at the pace of individual older people).
Eventually       all homes were transferred to alternative providers without any older       people being forced to leave their home.
In addition to this, the guide itself received exclusive coverage from The         Guardian (source 2), as well as being featured by ITV News, The         Telegraph, the Today programme and a range of other outlets.
The       lead author, Professor Jon Glasby, was subsequently invited to a private       briefing with journalists at the BBC to help them understand the       implications of long-term care funding &#8212; speaking alongside the chair of       the Social Policy Association and Andrew Dilnot (author of the recent       Dilnot review on the funding of adult social care and now Chair of the UK       Statistics Authority).
The impact is ongoing as closures continue around the country.
More       recently (in early 2013), Glasby worked with Surrey County Council to       develop their revised Community and Care Home Provider Closure Protocol.
The Council drew on the Birmingham good practice guidance and evaluations.
They are clear that the documents were `vital...in shaping and defining         SCC's protocol and in particular formed the basis of the chapter on       best practice, which was to be applied to all potential closure scenarios'       (source 3).
By July 2013, the protocol was already `in full use by         practitioners' and part of Surrey's core training.
In summary, the research contributed to the design of effective local       policies and procedures, helped to ensure that local practice was safe for       frail older people and contributed to national policy, public and media       debates about care home closures in the wake of the Southern Cross       scandal.
