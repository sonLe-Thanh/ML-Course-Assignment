     The main impact of this research has been to enable a multi-national oil       company (Shell) to       apply evidence-based research results to the major problem of           predicting the long-term           integrity of geological storage sites.
Our detailed and ground breaking research on the Green River site clearly       demonstrated to       Shell the value of research on a geological analogue for CO2       storage and was critical in       establishing the site's suitability for extensive investment.
Shell Global       Solutions International       reallocated internal budgets to fund work on the Green River site and to       redeploy company       scientific staff to work on the project.
Their commercial investments to       develop and research this       bore-hole site, providing them with a geological analogue for CO2       storage, have already       amounted to direct expenditure of over &#163;1M, including &#163;330k on the       drilling and &#163;750k on       associated research.
The work has allowed a new and improved assessment       for use in the       evaluation of risk in storage sites.
In particular, the results of           the research have been used           to test and verify Shell's in-house reactive-transport modelling codes           which have           increased understanding of long-term CO2           plume migration e.g.
for storage in the           Goldeneye field from the Peterhead project being assessed in the UK           North Sea as part           of the DECC-funded &#163;1 billion CCS Commercialisation Competition.
The unquantified risks of ensuring that `that the stored CO2         will be completely and         permanently contained' (DIRECTIVE 2009/31/EC) have been previously       cited as key obstacles       to implementation of geological carbon storage.
The costs of such risks       include the significantly       enhanced insurance premiums against leakage from storage, a high cost/low       risk event, the       costs of mitigating such leaks, as well as public opposition, engendered       by the concern that the       CO2 stores may leak.
All the major reports on implementing CCS       published in the UK during       2011 and 2012 identify security of storage including caprock (geological       seal) behaviour as a       key uncertainty which should be a high priority for research.
The DECC CCS       Roadmap, 20122       lists `Improve understanding of geological seal integrity and         subsurface CO2 behaviour' as a       high priority under R&amp;D needs for storage.
The APGTF Report, 20117       (Table 4) cites caprock       integrity as a high priority for immediate research.
The FEED Report       (20118 ,Table 7.1.4-2),       the most authoritative assessment of a commercial storage site to date,       lists `post-closure         consent uncertainties' as risk No.
4, `adverse public reaction'       as risk No 9 and `migration of         CO2 from storage site' as risk No.
17, in       the list of the top 50 Post-FEED risks.
Each of these       depend on demonstration of caprock and seal integrities.
The outcomes of       the FEED report       are particularly important as this establishes that the long term risks       were one of the causes of       the failure of the first DECC &#163;1 billion CCS program.
The eventual importance of carbon capture and storage to the UK economy       has been       estimated at &#163;42 billion a year by 2050 (DECC interim report `The         potential for reducing the         costs of CCS in the UK', DECC, November 2012).
Shell now leads one       of the two proposals for       major government-subsidised storage schemes currently being evaluated in       the UK under       DECC's &#163;1 billion CCS Commercialisation Competition.
Our           work on caprock integrity is           a fundamental element in the risk assessments necessary for this           scheme to go ahead       and these new and improved methods of risk assessment and management have       been crucial       to ensuring the mitigation of potential future losses.
The Manager for CO2 Storage Technologies at         Shell Global Solutions         International will verify that "the extensive field and         laboratory work on natural CO2 analogues         in Utah, together with an advanced process understanding, has led to the         decision by Shell         management to invest into drilling a research well into the CO2-charged         formations in Green         River" and that the data generated "will be used to test and         verify in-house modelling codes"       for industrial scale CCS operation.
He will also corroborate the level of       the company's financial       investment.
The initial dissemination of our research, which impacted on Shell, was a       presentation at       the Department of Earth Sciences in Cambridge to the Earth Sciences       Industrial Associates at       our annual meeting.
This was followed by several meetings and       presentations to Shell Global       Solutions International BV in Rijswijk, the Netherlands.
A further impact of this research is the contribution to the UK       industrial sector of an on-       going, regular supply of highly trained post-doctoral students and       researchers.
Three of the       post-doctoral researchers are now either employed by major oil companies       (Becker, Exxon) or       have permanent academic research positions, in the UK (Kampman) and France       (Dubacq).
