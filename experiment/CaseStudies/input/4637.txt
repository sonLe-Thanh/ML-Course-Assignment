     Despite initial scepticism, the importance of the MPTP in a range of       pathologies has now been confirmed in many laboratories.
This has resulted       in a paradigm shift in cardioprotection research, where drug development       and clinical trials are now focused on the MPTP as a key therapeutic       target [a] &#8212; a shift in which Halestrap and Griffiths are widely credited       as being pioneers [a, pg 160].
Industry invests in research and development:       The pharmaceutical industry has been consulting Halestrap since 2000       regarding the exploitation of the MPTP as a therapeutic target.
Bristol       has entered into formal contracts (Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) and       Confidentiality agreements) with several pharmaceutical companies       including MitoKor, Novartis, DebioPharm, Hoffman-Laroche and most recently       with Trophos (2010) and Congenia (2011).
The French clinical stage       pharmaceutical company, Trophos, views the collaboration with Bristol as "mutually         beneficial" and credits it for enabling them to "bring the         concept of MPTP inhibition and cardioprotection from bench to bedside"       [b].
Halestrap's research was a "major influence in [their] decision to         focus on inhibition of MPTP opening as the most promising target for         protecting the heart from reperfusion injury" and it is currently       the principle target of all compounds being developed by Trophos, with 21       R&amp;D employees and 27 employees in total dedicated to this area of       research [b].
In 2011, Trophos was awarded a US Patent for their novel       cardioprotective compound TRO40303 [c].
In March 2013, the Swedish-based company NeuroVive Pharmaceutical AB,       which specialises in the commercialisation of cyclosporine-based drugs,       acquired a portfolio of novel cyclophilin inhibitors from the UK biotech       company Biotica Ltd.
The financial figures for this investment are       confidential, but the strategic acquisition will "allow NeuroVive to         broaden and deepen its pipeline of novel mitochondrial medicines",       including those that reduce reperfusion injury [d].
Government and industry invest in clinical trials:       Since 2008, seven clinical trials involving over 2,000 patients in nine       European countries, have been initiated to investigate drugs that target       the MPTP either directly or indirectly [e-h,j].
In January 2011, the       European Commission awarded a grant of &#8364;6 million for a 2.5 year       international, translational medicine project led by Trophos.
Professor       Halestrap acts as a work package leader on this project to investigate the       efficacy and safety of TRO40303, which was shown to be cardioprotective in       a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and has successfully       completed Phase I clinical trials and is now in Phase II with 180 patients       [e].
Trophos is also testing their neuronal active drug (Olesoxime), which is       another MPTP inhibitor.
This drug is in Phase II/III, multicenter,       randomized clinical trials to assess its safety and efficacy in treatment       of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients [f] and in Phase II trials       for Spinal muscular atrophy [g].
Neurovive Pharmaceutical AB began clinical trials of their novel       formulation of cyclosporine, CicloMulsion&#174;, in 2008.
They began a Phase       III clinical trial with 1,000 patients in 2011 [h].
NeuroVive entered a       collaboration with Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd in 2012 to       develop and commercialise CicloMulsion&#174; and another CsA formulation,       NeuroSTAT&#174; [EudraCT Number: 2012-000756-34], in China.
The launch of these       products could generate more than 2 billion Chinese Yuan annually [i].
In 2009, a clinical trial involving 96 patients began in Bristol to       investigate the cardioprotective effect of the anaesthetic propofol when       added to the solution used to induce cardiac arrest during heart surgery       [j].
Halestrap's research was a "major stimulus" for Antipodean       Pharmaceutical's decision to develop the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant       drug MitoQ [k], which is a good candidate for protecting the heart and       other tissues from reperfusion injury through reducing mitochondrial       oxidative damage.
A clinical trial in Bristol has been agreed with Antipodean       Pharmaceuticals to test the efficacy of MitoQ in protecting the heart from       reperfusion injury during complex cardiac surgery that involves stopping       the heart and using cardiopulmonary         bypass (a heart-lung machine) to maintain blood flow [k].
Though the details of investment costs for each drug and each company are       commercially sensitive, recent estimates have suggested that the       out-of-pocket costs for industry to take a single drug from Phase I to       Phase III clinical trials is around US$215-220 million (in 2011 USD) [l].
This suggests a significant investment since 2008 by the pharmaceutical       industry in the development of drugs that target the MPTP.
