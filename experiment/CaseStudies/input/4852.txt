     The research described above has produced several kinds of impact:     (a) impact on policy debate within Government     (b) impact on specific policies     (c) impact on other policy stakeholders     (d) impact on national media debate     (a) Impact on policy debate within Government     Blanden has provided reviews of her work and policy advice to a number of       organisations.
As [C2]       reports, in January 2008 she was invited to 10 Downing Street to explain       her findings at a meeting       including Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband (Cabinet Office       Minister); [C1] notes that       this input "helped to fashion the [2009] White Paper".
In the same year       she gave evidence based       on the above research to the Children and Families Select Committee and       the Liberal Democrat       Social Mobility Commission.
Blanden advised meetings about the Cabinet       Office Discussion       Paper `Getting On, Getting Ahead' [C4].
In 2011, she advised officials at       the Cabinet Office on the       Government's Social Mobility Strategy and was a member of Alan Milburn's       advisory group in his       capacity as Independent Reviewer on Social Mobility.
In 2013, she used       paper (5) to advise       officials from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission about the       content of their annual       report &#8212; see [C3].
(b) Impact on specific policies     The last two Governments have prioritised improving intergenerational       mobility, as confirmed in the       2009 Social Mobility White Paper and the 2011 Social Mobility Strategy.
It       can be clearly       demonstrated that Surrey research influenced this: [C3] describes the work       as "very influential in       getting mobility onto the Government's policy agenda" and "is drawn on       heavily in the       Government's social mobility strategy".
It features eight times in the       2008 Cabinet Office       Discussion Paper which preceded the White Paper (see [C4]) and papers (1)       and (3) are "heavily       referenced" according to [C2] in the recent Social Mobility Strategy [C5].
As a particular example,       the chapter on `Foundation Years' recognises the findings that       socioeconomic differences in child       development appear early (paper (1)) and that poor non-cognitive skills       diminish mobility (paper       (2)).
In turn, the Strategy uses these findings to justify two other "specific       instances of [this] research       influencing Government policy since 2008" (quoted from [C2] &#8212; see also       [C1]): (i) an expansion of       Family Nurse Partnerships, which increases the number of families       benefiting from 6000 to 13000       by 2015 (costing &#163;17.5m) and (ii) an increase in the number of 2-year olds       benefiting from free       nursery places to about 20% of the cohort by 2015 (ultimately costing       &#163;760m).
In addition, the       importance of the findings on mobility drawn from the 1958, 1970 and 2000       cohorts has led to       Government funding of &#163;33.5m for a new birth cohort study (from 2012),       offering wide benefits for       social science and policy (see paragraphs 6.17 and 6.18 of [C5]).
(c) Impact on policy debate within other policy           stakeholders     Surrey's work has also influenced groups outside of Government.
It       warranted six references in       the National Equalities Panel report (see [C6]) and received international       attention in the OECD's       `Growing Unequal' (see [C7]).
Blanden has spoken about the work to the       Bridge Group, Into       University and Universities UK.
Two particularly strong examples of the       research generating       impact beyond Government are two conferences held in Summer 2008.
The       first was the Sutton       Trust-Carnegie Foundation Transatlantic Summit where Blanden presented the       opening paper on       international comparisons of mobility (now paper (3)); this conference was       designed to promote       policy debate and a broad spectrum of US and UK policy makers attended;       [C1] describes the       importance of the conference, and notes that "[this] work in particular       helped to set the future       research priorities for the [Sutton] Trust".
The second conference, held       at LSE in Summer 2008,       was organised by Blanden and Kirstine Hansen (Institute of Education).
This included a policy       round table involving Lynn Featherstone (then Minister for Equalities),       David Willetts (Minister for       Universities and Science), Polly Toynbee (The Guardian) and Lee Elliott       Major (the Sutton Trust).
The attendees ranged across academia, Government, think tanks and policy       bodies and Toynbee       explicitly referred to results in papers (1)-(4) in a subsequent article       [C8].
(d) Impact on media debate     The research in Section 2 has attracted extensive and continuing media       attention; [C2] places it "at       the heart of the lively media debate" on intergenerational mobility, and       the research's "frequent       mentions in the press have raised public awareness ... and served to       develop the debate in       Government".
As a result, CEP has recorded more than 10 media reports       which explicitly       mentioned this research in both 2010 and 2011.
In addition, Blanden was       interviewed on BBC       Radio Five Live (2010) and BBC Radio 4's World at One (2013), and was       consulted about the       preparation of the BBC documentary in (2011) [C9].
The controversy between       the work of       economists and sociologists (paper (4)) has also attracted media attention       &#8212; see [C8].
