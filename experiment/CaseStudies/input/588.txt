     Economic impacts            Over the previous five years, this group's research has led to         improved performance and the development of new technologies for         business (e.g GDM Rugeley; Woodwaste, Stafford; and ALSTHOM) [1-10].
Research expertise has been central in securing and leading an         INTERREG IVB biomass for energy project (Accelerating Renewable Energies         through Valorisation of Biogenic Organic Raw Materials - ARBOR) [1,4,5]:         a partnership of thirteen organisations [1,4,5] in Belgium, Germany,         Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.
Its aim: to accelerate the         sustainable development and use of biomass in the region in order to         facilitate the achievement of EU 2020 energy objective related to the         introduction of renewable energy sources and their utilisation.
One of the main impacts is the development of 5 industrial scale         demonstrator units (UK, UK, NL, NL, BE circa &#8364;3million) whose designs         are influenced, heavily, by this group; but which in turn will heavily         influence the EU biomass industry [1].
Working closely with innovative energy businesses, research led guidance       to bodies such as small leisure centres to governments [1-10] has been       provided or conducted.
The research group conducts biomass fuel quality testing for European         industry and government bodies (circa 100 batches per annum) [1,4,5].
The technical knowledge and experience has been recognised by the EU         with the newly formed European Centre of Excellence for Biomass [1].
To date several institutions have taken their advice and have changed       practice or have invested in new facilities for example Eccleshall Biomass       [2], Agripellets [1,3], and Staffordshire County Council.
Directly this group has influenced the products of 14 regional and         international industries: Four Ashes, Agripellets, Eccleshall biomass,         Green bio-diesel, Talbott Energy, wood waste Stafford, Lower Reule         Bioenergy, GDM, Institute for Future Energy Systems (DE), Inagro (Be),         Zero Head Turbine (UK), BioGas hub (NL), Agri-Park (NL), Short Rotation         Coppice (BE) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].
The work conducted by this group has influenced the work of other         researchers; to date 29 publications have been produced [9].
The research has been cited in over 47 other publications.
Impacts on public policy and services            Members of CEES are providing the Secretariat for the Energy and         Environmental Technologies Cluster [7] as well as academic         representation on the National Physical Laboratory Thermoelectric         Materials Industrial Advisory Group.
79 scientists, engineers and politicians (including the Egyptian         Under-Minister for energy) trained in Energy Auditing and Renewable         Energy Strategies [7]       6 country's MEPs and [1,2,3,4,5,7,8];       4UK and 3 EU local authorities/regions have received training and         advice [3,4,5,7,8];       This group has also provided technical tendering support in the area         of renewable energy councils and authorities in Staffordshire.
Impacts on society, culture and creativity            The research team have provided training for countries as well as         local regions; notably including advising the local MP (the then         Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Energy and         Climate Change), and the Egyptian Under Minister for Energy [8].
Pre 2008 they were senior advisors for founding of Stafford SRB       Beginners guide to renewable energy practice [2,6,7,8]          Impacts on Health            Learning guides have been developed for Senior Citizens [6]       Working with social care groups for renewable energy updating [6]       Senior Engagement in the Green Economy -SEE Green, c &#8364;400k [6] -         (Grundtvig, Lifelong Learning Programme), aimed to improve the knowledge         of energy efficiency practice and schemes amongst Europe's senior         citizens;          Impacts on practitioners and professional services            A new handbook for energy audits has been published by J Wiley &amp;         Sons Ltd [9].
Directly influenced universities, for example: UCD Dublin, Harper         Adams, Aston, Swansea, NL, Gent (BE), Saarland (DE) [3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
The research is interdisciplinary and several cross-university projects       use the expertise of this group.
This group supports RESCO (Renewable Energy Supply Chain Opportunities         managed by the University's IESR), an ex-poste evaluation of the project         has shown that it successfully provided a forum for helping business to         develop and change their relationship with renewable energy         opportunities [3].
Impacts on the environment     The group have contributed to:            RETS (Renewable Energies Transfer Systems) project [7] - an INTERREG         IVC programme (&#8364;2million) - focused on specialist knowledge transfer in         renewable energy for small to medium-sized municipal authorities across         the EU;       and SHAP (the Sustainable Housing Action Partnership) [8].
Finally, CERES (an EU TEMPUS Programme &#8364;1.1million) whose aim is to         assist in the development of a higher education renewable energy centre         of excellence in Egypt [7].
The group has completed over 100 energy audits for businesses across         Europe.
6 Best Practice Case studies for the UK developed by this group.
The group measures the quality of biomass fuels for the EU biomass         industry [1,4,5].
