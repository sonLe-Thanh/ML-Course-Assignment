     The primary intention was to raise awareness of young people's       perceptions of the impact of       school exclusion, vulnerability and risk on their lives.
It was envisaged       that the research would       inform the evaluation and development of policy and practice across both       the secondary sector.
Impact details are presented below.
Evidence cited relates to matters       concerned with behaviour       referral and school exclusion, pastoral curriculum policy and practice,       the development of active       learning opportunities and the provision of appropriate personal support       mechanisms.
At a national level, following a request from the Children's Commissioner       for England, the Titan         Partnership pupil behaviour and school exclusion report was       submitted as evidence to the Schools       Exclusion Inquiry Year 2 (Children's Commissioner for England, 2013,       Appendix B).
The National       Association for Pastoral Care in Education (NAPCE) in reviewing the       research outputs associated       with the case study said that they provided `valuable guidance to         schools on how to establish a         culture and ethos where children have confidence in adults that they         will listen to their concerns',       and that `the outcomes from the research were thought provoking for all         professionals interested in         how giving young people a voice can ensure they are safe in school'       (Mr Phil Jones, Chair of       NAPCE &#8212; letter: 01/06/2013).
At an international level, Trotman and Tucker have used their research       findings to shape policy       and practice developments for serving teachers and school managers in       Sibiu, Romania.
Following       the delivery of a series of linked training sessions on behaviour       management, risk and special       educational needs, the Inspector General Constantin Gorun wrote: `the         presentation of your         research findings on behaviour management, change management and Special         Educational         Needs has been well received by teachers....
Your work is now making an         important contribution         to helping teachers in Sibiu re-examine their approaches to these areas         in their schools.'
(Letter:       12/06/2013).
An audit of records of attendance reveals that over 200       people attended the training       sessions.
At a regional level, the evidence cited below lends support to the       assertion that the impact of the       research has been significant in changing specific policies and practices       at both regional and       individual school levels.
A view endorsed by the Executive Director of the       Titan Trust; the       commissioning organisation for the research report entitled Titan         Partnership pupil behaviour and         school exclusion:     Research undertaken by Newman Colleagues has contributed significantly         to the understanding of         behavioural issues and has presented us with an opportunity to review         our strategies.
Also, as a         result of the research accredited professional development has been         introduced... the research         report was also shared with colleagues from the Local Authority         Behaviour Support Service.
(Letter: 16/04/2013)     The research finding were presented to 15 behaviour co-ordinators from       Titan partnerships schools       in November 2012 and to their head teachers in December of the same year.
Following the       presentations, Joanne Mawby, Director &#8212; North West Network Behaviour       Strategy, Birmingham,       made further comments on the regional impact with reference to the 15       secondary schools in the       network.
She argued that the research was `pivotal in instigating a         discussion about the place of         pastoral care, the impact of exclusion, and the development of a more         effective approach to         transition... the research has `kick started' a process of analytical         reflection amongst key leaders         from those schools'.
(Email: 25/02/2013)     At a school level, the article on perceptions of risk has proved to be       particularly influential.
For       example, Kevin Rodgers, the Senior Vice Principal at Shenley Academy       Birmingham, points out       that, `in response to this article we have expanded our active         learning opportunities which address         such issues as bullying, gender issues, stereotyping, homophobia and         racism through our Learning         for Life programme and immersion days....
The pastoral and welfare teams         [now] take a proactive         approach in researching how best to support students with complex or         potentially isolating issues'.
(Letter: 17/06/2013).
While Gordon Higginson, the Deputy Headteacher from       Holte School in       Birmingham, acknowledges that `pupil voice generally is an area of         school that requires on-going         attention and development to empower young people' and notes the       impact of the research as it       relates to `facilitat[ing] hearing, listening, and responding to the         things that people say so that they         feel comfortable, cared for.... confident' (Letter: 07/06/2013).
In reviewing the overall impact of the research it is essential to       acknowledge how a research       methodology underpinned by `pupil voice', can be used to significantly add       to professional       understanding of pupil exclusion, vulnerability and risk.
The strength of       the case study lies with the       way in which the collective voices of young people have been used to       influence educational       evaluation, policy formulation and pedagogic practice and innovation.
