     European Union (EU) legislation and policy has powerful repercussions for       national governments and their people.
The European Federation of Public       Sector Unions (EPSU) recognised more than ten years ago that many of the       problems faced by workers in the social service sector were common across       Europe and were being exacerbated by EU policy.
Research by Jane       Lethbridge, presented during four seminars between 2005 and 2009, led EPSU       affiliates to realise that EU public procurement rules in particular,       which require governments to open up public services to competition from       profit and not-for-profit providers, were having a negative impact on       employees.
They began to understand that quality services depended on       improved working conditions, training and registration.
Supported by       Lethbridge's research at each step, EPSU is now exploring how it can       support a Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee (SSDC) for the social       services sector.
SSDCs are an important governance tool and pillar of the       European social model: the European Commission (EC) established them to       promote dialogue between employers and workers in order to agree social       policy.
An SSDC can improve terms and conditions for social care workers       which will benefit recruitment and retention in the sector and in turn       drive up standards of care.
In short, Lethbridge's research has exerted a       pull on the levers that slowly but surely turn the great wheels of       European governance, which affects the lives of millions.
EPSU moves to strengthen industrial relations and social dialogue       This awareness by EPSU affiliates informed motions and subsequent       decisions at the 2009 EPSU Congress, which agreed that EPSU priorities       should include organising, lobbying, mobilising, policy development and       social dialogue in several areas of social services.
Congress agreed       specifically to:     10: "Strengthen industrial relations in the health care and social         services sectors at European, national, regional and local level, and         set up joint activities and projects with relevant employer         organisations."
11: "Promote the implementation of cross-sectoral and sectoral         European Social Dialogue texts."
14: "Build on the existing work and networks in the area of social         services and develop further activities to strengthen trade union and         EPSU involvement in the area of social services".
This was the first time an EPSU congress had given such specific emphasis       to working with different types of social services.
Congress         resolutions were translated into a work plan for social services work,         which union officers had to implement.
The resolutions changed the way         EPSU operated in relation to the social services sector.
More staff       time and resources were devoted to working with social services affiliates       and collaborating with non-governmental social services organisations.
To inform the development of the EPSU social services strategy, in       November 2009 Lethbridge presented a review of EPSU's actions on social       services since 2005.
She stressed the importance of developing a European       strategy which recognised some sub-sectoral differences, eg childcare and       social care, and that development of social dialogue should be the next       priority, which would have to involve identifying and working with social       partners.
Research on care for older people makes case for European-level social         dialogue       In April 2010, following the EPSU Congress recommendation for work with       specific social services, Lethbridge was commissioned to research social       services for older people, mapping types of social services and providers       for older people by country; identifying employment trends and industrial       relations, and identifying issues for trade union strategies.
In October       2010 she presented results of the research: `Care Services for Older       People in Europe - Challenges for Labour'3.4 to both the EPSU       Local, &amp; Regional, Government Health and Social Services Committees,       with EPSU affiliates from across Europe attending.
She recommended that       EPSU should explore the development of social dialogue in the care sector       at European level, building on national and local arrangements.
EPSU plans a Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee       In 2011, EPSU became part of the EC-funded project PESSIS (Promoting       employers' social services organisations in social dialogue), working with       partners in the non-governmental sector.
This was a significant step in       establishing partnership working in social services, with the potential       for social dialogue.
The PESSIS project contracted Lethbridge to       coordinate national researchers mapping social dialogue in the social       services sector in 11 European countries.
Lethbridge presented the results       to the EPSU Health and Social Services Committee in October 2012, which       then discussed the options for a future European social services dialogue       committee.
This represented an important development in EPSU social       services work.
EPSU has moved from raising awareness with affiliates about       the need for work on social services, to discussing how to support a       European level sectoral social dialogue committee where it will be the       trade union social partner.
