     The research at Newcastle has influenced the way that the global       petroleum industry models and       predicts exploration, production and drilling issues associated with       mud-rich sediments.
It is used       to predict pore pressure pre- and post-drill, has been incorporated into       industry-standard, basin-       scale fluid flow modelling software and has reduced exploration risk by       improving seal risk/column       height prediction.
Context and an overall assessment of how the research       has influenced BP's       work on exploration risk is given by a Senior Petroleum Systems Analyst at       BP [E1]: "The research         has improved our understanding of fine grained lithologies and provided         scientific breakthroughs,         and software which is now used routinely by a wide range of users across         the world.
These         mudrock concepts have been integrated into BP workflows and hence used         to influence business         decisions.
The monetary value of research is always difficult to         quantify; however, clearly the         mudrock concepts have been used to reduce exploration risk and to avoid         drilling dry holes and         unnecessary sidetracks.
Given the cost of an exploration well, which is         often $100million, then the         value resulting from this work is very considerable and obvious to         geoscientists".
Below, representatives of some of the major companies who use the       research state how it has       impacted their business in terms of (a) Pore Pressure Estimation, (b) Seal       Risk and Column Height       Prediction, (c) Petroleum Systems Modelling and (d) Training.
Pore Pressure Estimation     Pore pressure prediction for well design is a critical activity within       petroleum companies, firstly to       ensure the safety of drilling operations and secondly for financial       reasons.
Maersk's Team Lead for       Global Pressure Prediction Team [E2] points out that typical UK       HPHT wells cost in excess of       $100 million, so that "accurate pressure prediction for well design and         to limit non-productive time         during drilling has huge cost implications".
When Maersk "works         on pressure prediction and basin         modelling studies the starting point for the shale rock property models         used are those developed at         Newcastle University.
These models underpin our assessment of pore         pressure generation and         retention and form an integral part of the final pressure predictions         made".
Representatives of other international petroleum companies give similar       testimonies.
BG Group's       Technical Authority on Petroleum Systems [E3]: "predicting         subsurface pressures ahead of drilling         is of extreme importance in the safe drilling of wells; "the research         undertaken in GeoPOP made         huge advances in our ability to do this".
A Geoscience Fellow and       highly respected pore pressure       expert at ConocoPhillips [E4] states: "the basic research of         GeoPoP has......improved our drilling         efficiencies by avoiding pressure related problems which can run into         tens of millions of dollars per         event and in some cases can increase the risk of a release of high         pressure fluids at the surface".
Seal Risk and Column Height Prediction     Seal failure is one of the main reasons why petroleum accumulations are       lost and expensive dry       holes drilled.
A Principal Geologist at BHP Billiton [E5] points       out that "the Caprocks consortium         has helped us tremendously in understanding sealing rocks, including         column height potential, and         is used constantly by us to evaluate top seal risk in our multi-billion         dollar oil and gas exploration         programs".
Likewise, ConocoPhillips' say that its seal       evaluation process "has largely adopted         workflows and concepts based on Caprocks research and the mud rock data         base developed in         the GeoPOP program.
ShaleQuant is one of our standard tools for         assessing mud rock properties         that lead to column height prediction for our exploration risk         assessment of plays and prospects"       [E4].
And at BP, "much of the research has formed the         foundation of our own internal research       efforts.
The technology is currently used to assess hydrocarbon column         heights, helping us to         make informed decisions to select prospects where our exploration wells         do not fail due to column         height prediction" [E1].
Petroleum Systems Modelling: Pore Pressure, Charge and Retention     Many petroleum companies use sophisticated software to model fluid flow       and thus to predict pore       pressure and petroleum charge before drilling wells.
BG's Technical       Authority on Petroleum       Systems states that the Newcastle research has impacted that process and       points out that the       methodology is widely accepted by the industry in that it has been coded       into standard, basin-scale       fluid flow simulation software: "A key paper published by the         Newcastle Group (P6) led to         widespread awareness of the (mudstone) methodology and soon resulted in         it being incorporated         into high end Petroleum Systems Modelling software.
Thus it became         possible to predict pore         pressure more accurately ahead of drilling" [E3].
BP's Team Leader in Petroleum Systems comments on how the research has       helped exploration       in particularly challenging geological settings: "The use of the basic         approaches inspired by         Newcastle research helped us to build and populate complex 3D basin         models to predict pore         pressures in new areas such as beneath salt canopies in the Gulf of         Mexico, and at great depths in         the Caspian Sea.
Without (Newcastle's) reliable lithological inputs to         basin modelling we would be         unable to unlock the significant resources we believe exist in these         settings" [E1].
Training and Knowledge Dissemination within Companies     Both BP and ConocoPhillips have indicated that they use the Newcastle       research routinely for       training purposes, thus spreading the impact widely within their       organisations:     BP [E1]: "The technology is taught routinely in BP as part of         the petroleum systems and PPFG         courses and an overburden characterisation course."
ConocoPhillips [E4]: "Materials that have been generated by GeoPoP         and more recently         Caprocks have been an exceptional resource for developing our training         courses for seal         evaluation and overpressure.
Publications by Caprocks and GeoPoP workers         are now         recommended readings for our new Geoscience employees and references for         experienced         employees.
I would like to particularly refer to the impact that has         been made by publications by         Yang and Aplin on clay rock porosity and permeability (P2, P6), and seal         bypass and injectites by         Cartwright, Huuse and Aplin (P5).
Training in seal evaluation at         ConocoPhillips is based largely on         concepts and materials generated by the Caprocks research which has been         provided to over 200         people in our organization over the last 5 years".
