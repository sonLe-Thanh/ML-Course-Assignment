     The key impacts are as follows:     Impact on public policy       NICE guidelines are the accepted standard for determining the management       of hypertension in UK       primary care.
As a result of this research, the National Institute for       Health and Clinical Excellence       (NICE) has published a new guideline for the Clinical Management of       Primary Hypertension in       Adults (CG 127; 24 August 2011).
The guideline reported the inaccuracy of       CBPM using this       research: "these findings suggest that the current practice of using a         series of CBPM alone for the         diagnosis of hypertension can lead to inaccurate diagnosis" and that       "this detailed analysis         suggested that the current practice of using CBPM to define hypertension         will lead to drug         treatment being offered to a substantial number of people who are         normotensive according to         ABPM".
The Guideline Development Group "thus recommended that         ABPM should be         implemented for the routine diagnosis of hypertension in primary care"       [1]     Impact on clinical practice and health       The key to the success of implementing the recommendations of the review       is buy-in from       clinicians.
The original research was widely reported in the national       press, including the Daily       Telegraph, the Guardian and the GP publication Pulse [2].
At the time of       the full publication of the       NICE guidelines, it was again widely reported, including on BBC national       news and on the BBC       website [3].
To encourage adoption, the British Hypertension Society has       made a series of videos       covering key aspects of the guidance [4].
These, along with the NICE       implementation materials       (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG127),       are helping to facilitate dissemination and implementation of this       evidence-based evolution of the NICE hypertension guidelines.
As the NICE guidelines are relatively new (2011) it is not possible at       this stage to specify impact in       terms of changes in patient outcome, however the NICE Primary Care Quality       and Outcomes       Framework Indicator Advisory Committee recommended that an indicator be       piloted to ensure       practices use ABPM for all new diagnoses of hypertension; the proposed       wording of the indicator       is: `The percentage of patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension after       1 April 2012 whose       diagnosis was confirmed following ABPM.

Economic impact       The cost-effectiveness analysis of ABPM conducted by the University of       Birmingham was reported       by the full NICE clinical guidelines "This analysis suggests that ABPM         is the most cost-effective         method of confirming a diagnosis of hypertension in a population         suspected of having hypertension         based on a Clinical BPM screening measurement &gt;140/90 mmHg, compared         with further CBPM or         HBPM.
This conclusion was consistent across a range of age/gender         stratified subgroups."
and       impacted on the NICE guideline [1].
The research has also influenced the South African Hypertension guideline       of 2011 which       recommends that ABPM should be encouraged for clear indications, quoting       the economic       evidence generated in this research as evidence for this guidance [5]: "In         patients with a raised         clinic BP, ABPM was shown to reduce misdiagnosis and save costs         (reference, Lovibond et al)".
Impact on education and CPD       The research is influencing medical education.
Members of the research       team (Hodgkinson,&#160;       McManus,&#160; Martin, Wood) have       completed the setting of a Continuing Medical Education version       of the BMJ article [6] to support practitioner learning in:     1) Appraising the relative effectiveness of different indirect methods of       monitoring blood       pressure in diagnosing hypertension;     2) Evaluating the strength of evidence for these findings; and     3) Recognising the potential implications of the study's findings for       clinical practice.
Following the publication of the main research study, they have also been       commissioned and will       provide a further in-depth learning module for the BMJ, to be published       shortly [7].
BMJ Learning       offers high-quality (peer reviewed, up-to-date, and evidence-based)       continuing medical education       in an economical and time efficient manner, for general practitioners,       hospital doctors and other       healthcare professionals such as practice nurses and practice managers.
The modules are       accredited by colleges, associations, and authorities from around the       world.
Other educational impacts have included the commissioning of an article       for The Practitioner (a       monthly peer review clinical journal for GPs) on diagnosing and managing       hypertension in primary       care [8] and an international commentary [9].
