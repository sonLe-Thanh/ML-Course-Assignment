     Attempts to use automated formal verification in industrial-scale       examples go back several       decades, the motivation being that bringing verification into the software       engineering process       should ultimately replace most or all testing, create more reliable       systems, and save both costs       and time.
This has proved a more challenging activity than was first       hoped, though improvements       both in verification technology such as model checkers (tools which       explore a system's reachable       states and report any errors found) and the computers available for       running this technology are       now enabling real progress.The innovative reasoning technology developed       in the UoA offers       significantly enhanced accuracy in computation and has resulted in       important benefits to the       transportation sector, particularly in the areas of verification and       validation (V&amp;V) of embedded       systems and safety certification.
CBMC, an existing tool developed by       Kroening, has been       substantially upgraded in the UoA to support the new reasoning for       floating-point operations and is       now used extensively in the sector.
V&amp;V of embedded safety-critical software is a crucial but expensive       step to ensure safe operation       in the transport sector.
The industry estimates it to account for 50-80%       of the sticker price of an       aircraft, for example.
Existing technology yields error reports for some       software artefacts that are       in fact safe; the inspection of these by engineers is costly and time       consuming.
In addition, the test       patterns prescribed by industry safety standards previously had to be       engineered manually,       incurring delays and further cost.
The reasoning technology described       above aids V&amp;V processes       in two ways: by eliminating `false alarm' error reports, and by generating       software test patterns that       satisfy industry requirements.
The novel bit-accurate precision of the new       method enables, for the       first time, proof of those software artefacts that could not be shown to       be safe with existing       technology.
This reduces the cost of V&amp;V of embedded systems, as well       as the time required to       carry out the V&amp;V necessary to obtain the final certification and       validation required for operation       [A].
This time-saving can translate into substantial time-to-market       advantages and has resulted in       very significant benefits to the global transportation sector including       reduction in recall rates for the       automotive industry and reduced testing times for embedded systems       reducing the need for costly       traditional code testing methods.
Safety certification cases can be based either on engineering and       validation processes, or on       evidence.
The software technology developed at Oxford University is unique       in that it can support       both styles.
It has been applied in numerous use-cases supporting safety       certification, including       those listed below.
Other key benefits unique to this software technology       include:            the ability to generate evidence in the form of test inputs that can         be validated independently;       the ability to determine whether necessary test evidence exists; this         saves time and effort in         cases where a particular test input does not exist;       the bit-precision of the approach avoids the frustrating experience of         test inputs that fail to         deliver the desired outcome when applied to the actual car or airplane.
Since late 2009 the new technology in V&amp;V and safety certification       has been adopted by a number       of major systems vendors, especially in the automotive sector, as follows:            Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), based in India, is the largest IT         employer in the world and         primarily targets the automotive market.
TCS has integrated the enhanced         CBMC into its         AutoGen test generation tool, and states that `to the best of our         knowledge CBMC is the only         tool that supports floating point operations that match the precision of         the target platform and         yet scales to industry size code'.
They also confirm that CBMC has         enabled them to identify         bugs and unreachable code that would otherwise have been missed, and         save `a large amount         of time'.
Additionally TCS has used CBMC to improve the precision of         static analysis, reducing         around 68% (and in one case 100%) of false positives generated, and         leading to `a substantial         saving in manual efforts overall' [A].
General Motors in India has used the reasoning technology available         via CBMC to validate C         programs generated from Simulink diagrams.
CBMC has been integrated into         GM's in-house         verification tool [B].
[text removed for publication]       More recently (May 2013) a German automotive supplier, BTC-ES, has         used the reasoning         technology to make significant improvements to the V&amp;V tool that         they market; a BTC-ES         research engineer reports that `specific floating-point issues were not         taken into account within         the BTC-ES internal tool chain and in the internal formats, among them         floating-point casts,         rounding modes, exact string representation of floating-point numbers.
The latter circumstance         establishes a clear and evident argument for the inconsistent tool         behaviour since the         semantics of the original C program was not accurately reflected within         the data structures and         algorithms of the BTC-ES tools.
With the expertise of the Oxford team         all these issues could be         resolved such that sound analysis results are now obtained.'
[D]       In the aeronautics sector the technology has been applied by Airbus         where, during the CESAR         project (`Cost-efficient methods and processes for safety relevant         embedded systems' funded         by the EU and Uk Technology Strategy Board), the CBMC tool was used in         the X-man Verifier         to verify models in the avionics industry.
The project team, including         staff from the UoA and         from Airbus, conducted a case study on a representative avionics         application &#8212; the Ground         Fuel Transfer function of a large transport aircraft.
It models the         specific behaviours of the fuel         management system when the aircraft is physically on the ground, as         opposed to behaviours         while the aircraft is in flight.

Impact on industry standards       The research described above has led to the new IEEE SMT-LIB standard,       devised and written by       Kroening's group, and the only one that exists in terms of floating-point       reasoning.
The standard       was informed by the demonstrated capabilities of CBMC, and has had       significant impact; for       example, it has been implemented in Microsoft's Z3 SMT Solver, a       high-performance theorem       prover.
Kroening and colleagues extended Z3 to support the theory of       floating-point arithmetic with       an implementation consisting of two components: an SMT-LIB 2 front-end       tailored to the floating-       point theory, and a theory solver for bit-precise reasoning about       floating-point arithmetic.
The       theory solver makes use of techniques such as mixed abstraction,       rewriting, and bit-blasting (via       the theory of bit-vectors), and is now an integral part of Z3, developed       by Microsoft and available       for sale on Microsoft's webpage [F].
Other applications       Other areas of industry have also used CBMC which has the new reasoning       technology embedded       within it to perform V&amp;V and safety checking &#8212; e.g.
South Korea's Advanced Power Reactor's Reactor Protection System is         concerned with         safety-critical systems in nuclear reactors.
Research published in 2011         showed that `the         HW-CBMC reduces cost by providing automated way of establishing the         consistency of         HDL implementation using the ANSI-C implementation as a reference,         because debugging         and testing cost of the ANSI-C implementation is usually lower.'
[G]       The Air France crash of 2009, when AF447 crashed into the Atlantic         killing all on board,         was caused by an airspeed measurement malfunction.
Researchers at Galois         (a US high         assurance R&amp;D software company) and the US National Institute of         Aerospace have shown         that, in relation to airspeed measurement systems, CBMC can prove that         the C code is`         memory-safe, including proving there are no arithmetic underflows or         overflows, no division         by zero, no not-a-number floating point values, no null-pointer         dereferences, and no         uninitialized local variables.'
CBMC thus provided further reassurance         about the safety of         such airspeed measurement systems [H].
To give an indication of how widely available CBMC is, it is contained in       the standard distribution of       the Ubuntu, Fedora and Debian versions of Linux.
Debian alone has over 10m       installations [I].
