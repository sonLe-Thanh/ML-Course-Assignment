     The York research created impact by: (a) measuring changes in       stratospheric atmospheric       composition and determining lifetimes of ozone-depleting substances; these       results are needed by       UNEP in order to make decisions, especially to provide evidence of policy       effectiveness and a       more robust prediction of the likely timescales for ozone hole recovery;       (b) revealing natural       halogenated emissions that close the gap between modelled and measured       stratospheric BrO       concentrations, providing confidence in the models used to inform UNEP of       stratospheric halogen       changes; (c) by serving on the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP) that       advises UNEP; (d) by       proving the value to the UK of long-term background tropospheric       measurements of trace gases       and enabling the UK to fulfil its international obligations.
The SAP is charged with the periodic updating of the scientific       understanding of the depletion of       stratospheric ozone as summarised by A.R.
Ravishankara (co-Chair of SAP).
"The assessment is         written and reviewed by leading         experts in the international         atmospheric sciences         community at the request of the         Parties to the U.N. Montreal         Protocol [197 countries].
It         forms the scientific basis for         decisions that the Parties reach         with regard to the phaseout of         ozone-depleting chemicals such         as the CFCs and other matters         related to the long-term         protection of the stratospheric         ozone layer.
As you may know,         all previous Montreal Protocol         decisions have been based on         the science findings of the         Scientific Assessment Panel....         For previous assessments, it         has proven true that the         participants have found their         efforts rewarded with increased         stature and recognition in the         scientific community.
Likewise,         their supporting institutions         have received recognition for their leadership in providing world-class         scientific expertise to the         international effort.
"5 The Assessment process       involves scientific research and stakeholders       including governments and their agencies, research managers, industries       and the public.
The 2010 Ozone Assessment,6 and two earlier reports, make     significant reference to the original     underpinning research undertaken in York, which contributed to a better     understanding of the     observed behaviour of ODSs and ozone in the stratosphere and thus to     continued international     acceptance of the Montreal Protocol.
Bernath and Carpenter also contributed     substantially as both     reviewers of the 2010 report and members of the 2010 Scientific Assessment     Panel.
York impact on Scientific Assessment Panel &#8212; stratospheric ozone.
The projections of different       ozone depleting gases restricted by the Montreal Protocol including CCl4,       CH3CCl3 and CFC-11,       and their photochemical products have been evaluated through the ACE       measurements.
In the 2010 report6 it was noted that CCl4         declined more slowly than predicted in the 2006         report; these predictions are very sensitive to the assumed atmospheric         lifetime.
The new         stratospheric lifetime contributed to the assessment that the problem is         due to unreported         emissions, rather than an erroneous lifetime.
The end product of the destruction of chlorinated gases in the         stratosphere and lower         mesosphere is HCl.
Observations of HCl reduction in the lower mesosphere         by ACE contributed         to the overall assessment of the success of the Montreal Protocol in the         2010 report.6        In relation to natural brominated compounds, the research provided         emissions estimates,         hitherto unidentified species, and new understanding of the         halogen composition and chemistry         of the stratosphereand troposphere.3,4 The major         impact is that inclusion of such natural         bromine species and their chemistry in global models has led to better         agreement of the model         with inorganic bromine measurements in the stratosphere, as detailed in         the 2010 report.6 This         provides evidence that the policy is effective and improves the robust         prediction of the         timescales for ozone hole recovery.
York impact &#8212; tropospheric ozone.
Whilst the role of halogen         chemistry in controlling stratospheric         ozone has been well known for several decades, the impact on         tropospheric ozone has been less         understood.
Ozone in the troposphere is important for several reasons;         it is an air pollutant, a         greenhouse gas in its own right, and indirectly it controls the lifetime         of methane, another important         greenhouse gas.
The roles of both ozone and methane as greenhouse gases         are increasing in         importance.
The new knowledge of halogen-tropospheric ozone processes         reported by the York         scientists4 has contributed to policy recommendations; the         Royal Society Ozone report (2009)7         used the research to highlight the need to understand and control         background ozone         concentrations in relation to air quality.
The research was also         reported widely in the media and         led to public debate on the potential of natural processes to mitigate         against air pollution.8       The research programme4 has achieved long-term impacts         through the building of experimental         infrastructure.
The proposal for a tropical ocean atmospheric         observatory was driven by Carpenter         (York) with Leeds colleagues and resulted in the construction of an         observatory in Cape Verde         (www.ncas.ac.uk/cvao).
The         research demonstrated the value of long-term monitoring of the         tropical atmosphere.4 As a result, the observatory is now         supported as a permanent UK         contribution to the World WMO Global Atmospheric Watch programme (www.wmo.int/gaw);         it is         one of 28 stations worldwide and the only station supported by the UK         Government.
It employs two         permanent Cape Verdean technicians (one of whom is now enrolled on an         MSc in Chemistry at         York) as well as UK researchers.
The data generated from it now form         part of the UK capability to         meet its obligations on climate change detection under UNFCCC.
The         research continues to         generate long-term observations of trends in ozone and other gases, and         these data are         disseminated to academic and Government users via agencies such         as the Department of Energy         and Climate Change (DECC), UNFCCC and WMO.
The data alerts the         government to changes in         the Atlantic atmosphere arising from pollution episodes or long-term         changes.
Quotation from L. Jalkanen Chief, Atmospheric Environment Research         Division, World         Meteorological Organization,9 "The University of York,           with support from other UK and German and           Cape Verdean partners, created in 2006 a new observatory in Cape           Verde.
This observatory           helped GAW fill in an important gap in global observations, providing           information on changes           occurring in the tropical North Atlantic marine boundary layer, a           region sensitive to both natural and           anthropogenic change.
...
The global reach of the GAW programme, and           its contributor scientists,           allows it to also influence governmental understanding and policy on           atmospheric change.
