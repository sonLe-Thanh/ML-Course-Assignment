     Since 2007, over 80,000 Bhutanese refugees have been re-settled from       Nepali camps to several Western countries including the UK and US under       the auspices of a dedicated International Organisation for Migration       re-settlement programme.
As a consequence of this dispersal, the plight of       the refugees has come to the attention of an international audience for       whom Hutt's research, and particularly his Unbecoming Citizens,       constitutes a rare and valuable source of expert yet accessible       information for those seeking to understand the Lhotshampa and how they       came to be exiled.
The impact of this research has been felt on a wide       array of individuals, sometimes in unanticipated ways.
The value of Hutt's research is confirmed by Kanak Mani Dixit, editor and       publisher of the influential Himal Southasian magazine and       prominent public figure in Nepal, who has written extensively on the       refugee crisis himself (1, below).
Dixit considers Hutt's book crucial to       improving public understanding of the long-neglected Lhotshampa and       motivating global actors to improve the situation of the refugees:     "The issue of Bhutanese refugees has been neglected by civil society,         the media and academia and thus I salute Michael Hutt's commitment to a         humane appreciation of a neglected people.
He has done what all scholars         should do: explore neglected matters, especially if they involve human         lives and suffering (...).
The book itself has played an important role         in the on-going development of an understanding of the issue of         Bhutanese refugees, as a resource used worldwide.
It has helped to         produce an international response to the refugee situation, keeping the         issue on the diplomatic and scholarly table, and also helping push the         resettlement programme as a humanitarian response.
Additionally, though         difficult to quantify, I feel that the book has helped to improve the         treatment of the Lhotshampa in the refugee camps".
Matt O'Brien, a San Francisco-based journalist who has written no fewer       than 6 articles and broadcast reports on Bhutan, one of which received a       South Asian Journalists Association award, cites Hutt's work as the       definitive source for those wanting to better understand the crisis (2,       3):     "Michael Hutt's book is the most thorough account and one of the only         objective sources of information on the little-understood Bhutanese         refugee crisis that emerged in the 1990s (...).
Hutt's work is essential         reading for anyone trying to understand what brought these Bhutanese         refugees to unlikely places such as Fargo, North Dakota and Laconia, New         Hampshire in the past few years."
Hutt's work has also had an unexpected impact on creative endeavour, as       an inspiration for the short story, "No Land is Her Land", included in The         Gurkha's Daughter by acclaimed Nepali-Indian author Prajwal Parajuly       (4, 5).
A reading of Unbecoming Citizens motivated Parajuly's       visit to the refugee camps and his fictional story about a refugee family.
Parajuly affirms that the story was "triggered by a reading and       re-reading" of Hutt's book:     "It was the first time that I had read a well-written,         well-researched, well-edited book about the refugee situation in Bhutan.
All the books I had read on Bhutan before read like propaganda pieces         written by royal apologists.
Michael's book is by far the best on the         subject; his work is very accessible and has the academic stamp of         approval.
Upon reading it, I went to Bhutan and travelled to the refugee         camps of Nepal."
The Gurkha's Daughter is a bestseller in India and South Africa,       it was critically acclaimed in several countries and has been nominated       for the Dylan Thomas Prize.
The impact of Hutt's research is also evident in the controversy and       derision it has produced, particularly among the Bhutanese government.
A       pro-government blog, The Story of the Bhutanese Refugees,       prominently features `5 Reasons Why Not to Believe Michael Hutt',       vehemently criticising Hutt's research and inciting readers to `expose his       lies' (6).
Aforementioned Matt O'Brien witnessed first-hand a charged       reaction to Hutt's work:     "I brought a copy of the book [Unbecoming Citizens] with me to         Bhutan in 2009, and raised some of its arguments in an interview with         Prime Minister Jigme Thinley, who bristled at some of the questions.
Thinley's familiarity with the research &#8212; even though the book appears         to be (...) banned in the country &#8212; (...) is more evidence of its         impact."
In shedding light on an under-researched and little-discussed subject,       Hutt's research has made a significant contribution to raising awareness       of the Bhutanese refugee crisis, enabling the refugees' story to be told       on the world stage (7).
His thorough yet accessible writing on a sensitive       and controversial issue has resulted in multifaceted impact on a diverse       range of people, thus confirming Parajuly's statement that "Hutt is the       kind of writer whose work resonates far beyond academia".
