     Shaping national and international policy and policy guidance on         grammar in the curriculum and the teaching of writing:       The two ESRC studies by Myhill and Jones have helped steer the development       of the revised National Curriculum for English.
Myhill led the advisory       group of four writing the Grammar Annex of the Primary English curriculum       and advised on the Composition strand1; Myhill and Jones were       invited to present Study 2 at a DfE1 seminar in 2011 to the       English Curriculum Team and the KS2 English Test team; and Myhill provided       expert testimony in two round table discussions of the English curriculum       revision with the Minister of State for Schools (Oct 2012 and Dec 2012).
The draft Curriculum, published in January 2013, is evidence that Myhill's       input, drawing on Studies 1 and 2, had mitigated ministerial desire for a       reductionist list of grammar terms.
Although a grammar annex is counter to       Myhill's advice for a wholly contextualized grammar strand, it is       developmental in its progression, signalling contextualizing       possibilities, and the preamble to the Grammar Annex includes two       sentences written by Myhill, drawing directly on the research: `Explicit         knowledge of grammar is, however, very important, as it gives us more         conscious control and choice in our language.
Building this knowledge is         best achieved through a focus on grammar within the teaching of reading,         writing and speaking' (http://bit.ly/1bi2eQN         p66).
Myhill was also one of only two academics invited to a       seminar, hosted by Sir Michael Wilshaw, marking the publication of the       Ofsted report, Moving English Forward.
She drew on both studies to       inform understanding of the concern noted in the report about poor       standards in writing.
Study 2 is cited by the DfE in a summary of research       evidence on writing (http://bit.ly/1fHYnMo)       and was also cited by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of the `promising         approaches' in their review of interventions informing their Transitions       projects: (http://bit.ly/1eowsDf).
In       addition, Study 1 `provided invaluable evidence of students' writing         development, particularly in relation to the linguistic demands and         expectations of the writing curriculum' for the new Australian       National Curriculum2.
Myhill was a member of the DfE       Test Review Group1, and provided critical feedback on the       design of the new grammar tests for KS2 English, drawing on research       evidence from both studies.
Myhill's `detailed report' and her `concerns         with the nature of testing grammar out of context as well as the         identification of some technical issues with the content being assessed'       is acknowledged in the Technical Report (http://bit.ly/10e5ue2).
Developing teachers' understanding and practice in the teaching of         grammar and writing:       Study 2 secured ESRC Impact funding to develop Research Action       Partnerships (RAPs) in 9 schools, where teachers developed their own       teaching materials, and their linguistic subject knowledge.
As a result of       the RAPs, 92% of participating teachers have altered their professional       practice in the teaching of writing.
One of the teachers disseminated her       work through an article in Classroom (Shallcross 2012 Classroom       18: 49-51) and the revised teaching materials have been produced by NATE       on a webpage dedicated to our research (http://bit.ly/115ln2j)       with 11,315 downloads at the end of August 2013.
The research team has       written 14 articles in professional magazines, providing evidence-based       practical guidance for teachers (http://bit.ly/19sHgfY).
An ESRC Society Today article reporting Study 2 was reproduced in       the GTCNI's termly magazine and circulated to 27,000 teachers in Northern       Ireland; and news articles outlining the research have been published       throughout the period, including the Daily Telegraph       (07.09.11;09.07.12), the TES (12.11.10; 27.07.12; 9.11.12) and       internationally, the China Daily (20.10.11) and Illawarra         Mercury (14.04.11).
One article published in the New South Wales       professional journal for English teachers was subsequently reproduced in       the Western Australian equivalent and finally in the national journal (English         in Australia).
As a consequence, the English and Literacy Team from       the New South Wales Curriculum &amp; Learning Innovation Centre have used       the teaching materials as part of their response to grammar in the       Australian National Curriculum; and in January 2013, Myhill was keynote       speaker for a Teachers' Summer School on grammar and literacy in       Wollongong, Australia.
Keynotes given to English professional associations       in Australia (Perth 2011) and New Zealand (Auckland 2012) led to requests       for access to the teaching materials from the research and in July 2013,       Myhill and Jones hosted a visit from a teacher from Western Australia to       visit local schools to see the research in practice, with another visit       from a New Zealand teacher planned for 2014.
In Sept 2013, the University       of Cape Town3 used the materials for CPD with local teachers       and reported it `a phenomenal success', and now wish to roll it out       on a larger scale, with our support, in South Africa.
The active       dissemination of the research through these multiple outlets has led to       unanticipated impact, such as an article4 by an unknown LA       adviser about a project successfully using the approach in a cluster of       schools.
These professional publications and news reports have led to numerous       requests for the teaching materials and invitations to lead training       workshops.
A speech and language therapist in NHS Lothian, Edinburgh used       the research to support writing in secondary schools.
Myhill and Jones       have led more than 60 practical training workshops for teachers between       2008 and 2013, (including one in Switzerland) involving over 2250       participants and often in co-operation with Local Authorities.
For       example, in summer 2012, Myhill led two CPD days (attended by 120 primary       and secondary teachers) organized by Worcester LA, and a grammar workshop       for the Hampshire LA Primary Literacy Conference; and in Spring 2013, two       full day workshops involving 125 primary teachers and an advisory meeting       with headteachers were organized by Bolton LA.
Course evaluations of these       events and unsolicited testimonials consistently record better       understanding of how to embed grammar purposefully within the teaching of       writing: for example, the teacher who wrote that she found a CPD workshop       `inspirational and have discussed it, and the changes I am making to my         teaching, with many members of my school'5 .
Teachers using our materials and pedagogical approach report wider       acknowledgement of the impact of their usage: two teachers were given       Outstanding OFSTED grades when observed using the teaching materials.
One       London teacher reported that she `was observed today by the Federation         Head and Head of School using the project materials and was given a         resounding 'outstanding' from both of them.
It was agreed that these         plans very definitely modelled the sort of practice we'd like to see         throughout the school'5 (email: 14.06.13) and a       Birmingham teacher reported that `We also had our writing moderated by         the local authority.
They were particularly impressed with my grammar         knowledge and took photos of my marking as they said it was the best         they'd seen.
It's great to know the project has already had an impact'5       (email:16.06.13).
Further evidence of the impact of these CPD events is in       the number of follow-on requests for additional in-school training       requested by delegates at these events (eg in Bromsgrove, Portsmouth and       Winchester schools) and the number of CPD schools willing to become       project schools for our current EEF-funded study into year 6 FSM writers.
Rapporteur C, in the ESRC evaluation of Study 2, noted `the real         difference made to classrooms and the teaching of English' as a       highlight of the research, noting that research presentations rarely have       the same impact as practical CPD workshops, such as these.
Influencing the work of a commercial organisation, developing new         materials and CPD:       Pearson Education have adopted the research findings and associated       pedagogy `as its defining pedagogical method for improving literacy         standards'6, resulting in a new series, Skills for         Writing (SfW &#8212; http://bit.ly/12vUaZL).
Myhill and Jones are acting as research consultants in the development of       these teaching materials, ensuring that the materials accurately reflect       the research findings.
The Pedagogy Guide, outlining the research       findings, was post mailed to 4762 Heads of English (almost all in the       country) and a digital version emailed to 190,000 English teachers.
A       video clip outlining the research received 1893 hits (http://bit.ly/YafH7u),       with 13,373 hits on the SfW webpage.
268 English departments requested to       pilot the materials and 1561 teachers have registered interest in       evaluating them.
Pearson anticipate that a minimum of 1000 UK secondary       schools will adopt SfW, and the International division has also received       interest in SfW: two very large schools in India will join the pilot next       term, followed by schools from Latin America and the Middle East.
Cybergrammar (www.cybergrammar.co.uk)       developed by Myhill to support teacher knowledge of grammar and       incorporating the findings of both studies 1 and 2 is being redeveloped by       Pearson as part of their ActiveLearn materials.
Pearson have commissioned       two CPD contracts with Exeter, (for KS3 Writing and Literacy in Science),       to develop teachers' confidence in teaching grammar in the context of       writing, and Myhill and Jones are `training the trainers' to develop       capacity within Pearson.
In 2014, it is anticipated that approximately 800       teachers will participate in this SfW CPD.
Pearson have also funded two       research studies, (&#163;77K) investigating the impact of the research approach       on weaker writers, (with 463 downloads of the research report) and on GCSE       writing.
The primary English team have produced a series of video clips       drawing out the implications of the research for the new primary       Curriculum (http://bit.ly/1eoAU5b).
This adoption of the research to inform a programme of teaching materials,       CPD and research represents an investment of approximately &#163;750,000 by       Pearson.
Stimulating practitioner and public debate about grammar and writing:       The findings of both studies, but Study 2 in particular, have stimulated       debate about the role of grammar in the curriculum, particularly given the       contested nature of traditional approaches to grammar.
Myhill was invited       to contribute a position piece on grammar for the June 2011 edition of English         Drama Media magazine, considering the future of English, and to the       Heart of English (www.heartofenglish.com)       discussion pieces on the proposed National Curriculum.
She contributed to       a United Kingdom Literacy Association position paper on writing and the       research is cited in the UKLA Writing Fact Cards, designed to support       practitioners in understanding the debate about teaching writing (http://bit.ly/1aV0mPC).
Better, a UK/US magazine publishing plain English summaries of       research, featured Study 2 in 2011 (http://bit.ly/14sCgdh).
A hotseat discussion was hosted by Myhill and Jones for the National       College for School Leadership in March 2012, answering teachers' queries       about the research.
A stakeholder conference involving teachers, teacher       educators, researchers, examination boards, and professional associations       was held in February 2012 to discuss the implications of Study 2, which       resulted in follow-up requests for CPD or further keynotes with specialist       groups (eg OCR; NAAE).
A public lecture was given at the University of       Oxford in October 2012 and the DfE Team Leader for English &amp; Foreign       Languages cited Study 2 in a Westminster Forum discussion of the draft       English Curriculum to counter the perception that the curriculum advocates       teaching `grammar in isolation' (http://bit.ly/13ryKwS).
The Chair of NATE referred to the Exeter research in his counter-response       to Gove's criticism of the English subject association: (http://bit.ly/1cRE4g6)       and Michael Rosen cited it in his critique of Gove's grammar policies (The       Guardian 10.05.13).
