     Process from research to impact       Duncan's research has been disseminated at several practitioner/academic       events: International       Association for Media and Communication Research, Dublin June 2013; Future       of Humanitarian       Reporting, London March 2013; Institute of Communication Ethics, London       October 2011 and       October 2012; Future of Journalism, Cardiff 2009; and Association for       Journalism Education,       Liverpool 2008 and Preston 2012.
Also, in June 2012, she led a roundtable       discussion of her co-       authored research with a group of practicing journalists and trauma       charity directors for the       renowned DART Centre Europe, a global network for journalists who cover       trauma and violence.
Their director said: "[Dr Duncan's] research on media intrusion,         interviewing technique and the         reporting of bereavement offers insight that is useful for both academic         researchers and journalists         working in the field.
It comes at a time of great ferment within UK         journalism and it makes a         valuable contribution to any coherent programme that seeks to raise         professional standards within         journalism and to make reporting both more ethical and more relevant to         its public" (Source 1).
Duncan's research on journalists' reporting of the bereaved prompted the       National Union of       Journalists (Scotland) to commission her to revise and enhance their       existing media guidelines on       the reporting of mental health and suicide.
Her research informed       revisions to the improved       guidelines which were re-written between June 2012 and March 2013.
Specifically, the revised       guidelines address vital issues in contemporary journalism ethics by       including new sections       offering advice on best practice in interacting with the bereaved and       appropriate use of social       media in mental health and suicide reporting.
Research findings described       in Section 2 appear       specifically in the following sections of the new guidelines: `Digital       Media Reporting of Mental       Health and Suicide'; `Interviewing a Person with a Past or Current Mental       Illness'; `Working with the       Bereaved'; `What it's like to be a Bereaved Person'; and `Interview Tips       and Appropriate Angles to       Pursue: During the interview; After the interview'.
Duncan also organised an event `Reporting Mental Health and Suicide by       the Media' as part of the       University of Strathclyde's `Engage with Strathclyde' week between April       29 and May 3, 2013.
The       event brought together a range of people with interests in media reporting       of mental health and       suicide (editors and journalists, health professionals, mental health and       suicide prevention groups       and academics) to discuss the implications of media reporting of mental       health and suicide, forge       relationships between mental health and suicide groups and journalists and       the NUJ, and       encourage dialogue about how the revised NUJ guidelines will affect       current practice.
Description of Impact       Improvements to existing ethical guidelines for journalists in         Scotland: The revised       guidelines are now completed and are due to be published in late 2013.
They have already       assisted the NUJ in achieving a more comprehensive product based on       current best practice and       academic research.
The guidelines have enabled the Journalist's union to       demonstrate their       commitment to strive for the highest professional and ethical reporting       standards, particularly in       regard to vulnerable members of society.
They provide a tangible artefact       of ethical intent towards       best practice at a time when journalism ethics are under great scrutiny.
Duncan's work on the       revised guidelines enables the NUJ to provide journalists with an       accessible, single source of       substantial current advice on appropriate procedure in the aftermath of       the Leveson Report, to be       used either during the reporting process or as a training tool.
The NUJ's       Scottish Organiser said       that through her "many hours of work on revising the NUJ guidelines Dr         Duncan has made a         meaningful contribution to a wider understanding of mental health and         suicide.
Her research has         had a significant impact on the NUJ's desire to improve media reporting         in these areas and to         promote ethical journalism" (Source 2).
Impact on professional standards of reporting suicide and bereavement:       The Assistant News       Editor at The Scotsman, who attended the `Engage with Strathclyde' event,       has commented       (Source 3), "From my own experience, I know that her [Dr Duncan's]         research has formed a crucial         framework on how to report suicides and mental health issues in a         sensitive manner.
I have related         the points she has made to dozens of colleagues both on my own newspaper         and I have         discussed its merits with editors of other publications, including the         Edinburgh Evening         News...Before her research, there was an ad hoc approach to the         reporting of suicide, but she has         brought an order and structure to the issue which allows journalists to         refer to the key points each         time they are about to write an article on this difficult subject         matter."
A multimedia journalist from       the Press Association news agency noted the direct impact that the Engage       event had on her       work.
"A short time after I attended the event a man took his life at a         Glasgow shopping centre.
Given the very public nature of the suicide and the disruption and alarm         it caused, the decision was         made to report on the man's death.
As a result of the seminar I felt         comfortable advising the         reporter responsible for covering the story" (Source 4).
The BBC College of Journalism, part of the BBC Academy, approached Duncan       and Newton in       March 2013 to write an online blog on best practice for working and       aspiring journalists based on       insights gained from their research.
This advice specifically focussed on       positive approaches to       reporting bereaved families and negative effects of the interaction;       advice for trainee reporters on       approaching the newly bereaved, including the use of social media;       professional consequences of       becoming too personally involved in the families' distress; and the effect       on the journalist of       reporting bereavement and how best to manage that trauma.
The Editor of       the BBC's College of       Journalism blog stated that "[Duncan and Newton's] blog post was         exemplary in that it both drew         on extensive original research and was able to translate that into         useable guidelines for journalists         tackling stories about bereavement.
We were lucky to be able to publish         the advice of two people         who were able to combine the academic and the practical in such a vivid         and useful way" (Source       5).
Increasing awareness and stimulating debate on ethical reporting of         suicide and         bereavement: Impact has arisen from discussion generated at the       `Engage with Strathclyde' event       attended by 25 representatives from organisations such as the British Red       Cross, the Choose Life       campaign (the Scottish Government's suicide prevention strategy which is       delivered nationally by       NHS Health Scotland), Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH), The       Scotsman and the       NUJ.
The NHS Scotland Communications Manager noted: "We are grateful to         Dr Duncan for         organising [the event] to contribute to the wider understanding of         mental health and suicide, and         keep the momentum going in this area of suicide prevention work"       (Source 6).The External       Communications Assistant for SAMH added: "These important discussions         would not have taken         place without Dr Duncan's commitment to researching media reporting of         mental health and         suicide.
This work will contribute to challenging stigma and ensuring         that journalists understand         their role in changing attitudes and ultimately behaviour in society,         which, in turn will significantly         increase the quality of life of those experiencing mental health         problem."
On May 1, 2013, journalist Roy Greenslade previewed the "Engage with       Strathclyde" event in a       blog for The Guardian, titled `Suicide Reporting Guidelines to be Revised'       (Source 7).
After reading       Greenslade's article, the Director of Services of Console, the National       Suicide Charity in Ireland,       contacted Dr Duncan.
The organisation, which is considering revising their       own media guidelines,       invited her to be a key speaker at their conference in September 2013,       which was attended by the       President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins (Source 8).
In May 2013, the Director of Standards of the Australian Press Council       asked for a recording of the       `Engage with Strathclyde' event (Source 9) in order "to ensure that their       standards remain current       and reflect best practice".
In June 2013, Dr Duncan was contacted by the       Project Officer at the       Mindframe, the government-funded national mental health promotion and       suicide prevention       organisation in Australia, stating that Mindframe would like to work with       her in order to continue       building on their current evidence base, as well as learn more about the       outcomes from the       `Engage with Strathclyde' event.
Consequently, an on-going dialogue has       been established.
Duncan and Newton's chapter `Hacking into Tragedy' [2] attracted       considerable attention in the       media, the journalism trade press, funeral care websites and on Twitter.
The Senior Media       Relations Officer for the British Red Cross (Scotland) stated: "Without         the kind of research carried         out by Dr Duncan, a wider understanding of mental health and suicide         would not be possible.
Her         evidence-based conclusions allow the NUJ to offer constructive,         realistic and practical guidance to         journalists who, through their writing, have the power to influence         society's attitudes, to destroy         myths, remove taboos and to educate" (Source 10).
Impact beyond journalism: The reach of the revised NUJ guidelines       also extends to the Scottish       Government Engagement process.
They are devising a new ten-year suicide       and self-harm       strategy to replace the current `Choose Life' campaign.
The guidelines and       associated research       have the potential to form part of a media awareness element to this       proposed strategy.
Health       organisations and vulnerable people also benefit from reduced stigma and       increased awareness       through responsible media reporting.
NHS Scotland's Communications       Manager, who works with       Choose Life, said: "Choose Life relies on robust media guidelines to         challenge and educate the         media, using them to reinforce concerns and provide practical tips for         producing articles that are         newsworthy, yet responsible.
That's why we welcome the revised NUJ         guidelines on reporting         mental health and suicide, with a new, contemporary section on using         social media as an         information source" (Source 6).
