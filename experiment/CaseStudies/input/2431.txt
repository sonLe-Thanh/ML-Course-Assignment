     Impact on health and welfare     An international comparison of preterm birth using the UoE data [3.3]       together with data from Europe, the USA and Canada confirmed that higher       rates of elective preterm birth are associated with lower rates of       stillbirth and neonatal death [5.1].
The work is partly responsible for the fall in stillbirth and perinatal       mortality rates in Scotland from 5.3 and 7.36 per 1000 (respectively) in       2009 to 4.9 and 6.94 per 1000 in 2010 [5.2].
Women can now make a more informed choice about the timing of birth.
Additionally, there is an emotional benefit of early induction if the       woman requests it, rather than waiting until spontaneous labour starts.
Impact on public policy     Reference [3.1] was cited in the 2013 RCOG Scientific Impact Paper, which       endorses elective induction of labour from 39 weeks' gestation in pregnant       women of 40 years of age and older [5.3].
Routine induction of labour at       39 weeks for all women is calculated to prevent the perinatal death of 500       babies per year.
The RCOG guidelines suggest the strategy of elective       induction at 39 weeks should be targeted to those at highest risk (women       of 40 years or more) and calculate this will prevent the stillbirths of 17       UK babies per year.
The research led to appointment in 2012 of Jane Norman as Chair of the       Guideline Development Group [5.4] for the National Institute for Health       and Care Excellence (NICE) Guideline on Preterm Labour and Birth.
Impact on clinical practice     Despite its very recent publication (May 2012), the compelling data have       resulted in an immediate change in practice internationally, as attested       by leaders in the field from, for example, Canada [5.5].
The paper [3.1]       has been downloaded approximately 25,000 times from the BMJ website,       confirming both the interest generated among obstetric clinicians of       targeting elective induction and the early impact on management.
Impact on society     Public awareness and public involvement in research has been increased by       reference to the work in the media including Scottish Television, BBC       Scotland, BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 5 Live,       BBC Radio Scotland and Radio Forth, Daily Telegraph in September 2009; and       the Scotsman, Daily Mail, The Herald (combined circulation over 2 million)       and the BBC news website [5.6] (all on 11th May 2012).
Additionally, the data were referred to in a public lecture given by Jane       Norman "The mysteries of birth &#8212; far from elementary my dear Watson" in       October 2010, which has been accessed over 2,700 times on YouTube [5.7].
