Impacts on public audiences:     Public performances, broadcasts and recordings of musical compositions       have had an impact on       performance bodies, and concert and festival programmes, attracting media       attention, including       commentaries by enthusiastic audiences who have been able to experience       Fischman's       compositions directly.
This has led to the creation of cultural capital,       enriching and expanding the       lives, imaginations and sensibilities of such audiences.
For instance, &#191;Te         Acuerdas Hijo?
is       regularly performed to diverse viewers worldwide at concerts (since 2008),       and excerpts have       been published in non-academic venues accessed by the general public, e.g.
Animation World       Magazine and Network Television (Section 5, item 1).
Inclusion of       Fischman's works in commercial       recordings, curated online channels (e.g.
the YouTube channel Cl&#225;sicos         Peruanos, which features       a historic repertoire of significant Peruvian classical composers) and       archives (e.g.
Daniel Langlois       Foundation Latin American Electroacoustic Music Collection, Digi-Arts       UNESCO knowledge portal)       is testament to the significance of his compositions to a broader public:       Fischman's output has       been recognised as part of the historical patrimony of Peruvian       composition as evidenced in the       collections above.
Furthermore, his compositions have enabled audiences to       gain new       interpretations of cultural heritage: `influences from dance forms in       Fischman's works have       involved the reconstruction of a basic paradigm of a rumba polyrhythm in       his acousmatic work Kol         HaTorr and the "proprioceptive" characteristic of relating musical       gesture to physical movement,       resulting in a particular kind of expression that is linked to the       experience of dancing genres.
This       latter influence cannot be considered as a direct reference to any       particular genre, but instead,       generative of a Latin American flavour personal to Fischman's own musical       language' (Blackburn,       2010, Section 5, item 2).
For instance, a new interpretation of the       integration of Afro-Peruvian       folklore in &#161;A Que No Me quemas!
has been disseminated thanks to       performances worldwide,       including the London Sinfonietta Latin American tour, featuring in       two high profile Mexican       festivals: Visiones Sonoras, Morelia (full house at MUAC hall,       capacity 220) and Festival         Internacional Cervantino, Guanajuato (full house at Auditorio de       Minas, capacity 420), described       as `the most important festival in Latin America' and `one of the premier       arts and cultural festival in       Mexico and Latin America'.
This prompted media attention in the form of       interviews (Radio of the       State of Michoac&#225;n, M&#233;xico.
Interviewed by Yasmin David in Reflejos,       27/10/11 and Radio of the       National Autonomous University of Mexico) and reviews (e.g.
Notimex and       Globedia): `audiences       were enticed to appreciate different musical aesthetics through sound       exploration and erratic       rhythms'.
Following the 2009 Ohrid Summer Festival in Macedonia       (full house, Museum of the City       of Skopje hall, capacity ca.
300), the music critic Dr. Marko Kolovski       wrote in the Skopje Summer       Festival Bulleting (circulation 50,000) and Morning News (circulation       100,000): `it was clear that       Rajmil Fishman is a master of his art'.
Another illustration of this       impact is found in the integration       of traditional Jewish and Middle Eastern musical materials with       contemporary art music and       electronics, providing a contemporary interpretation of the expulsion of       Adam and Eve from the       Garden of Eden in the context of Middle Eastern conflict; as realised in Ets         HaDa'at.
Its premier at       HaTeva (full house, Museum of the City of Skopje hall, capacity ca.
120), Contempo festival (Tel-Aviv, 	  2009) prompted a full page interview in Israeli broadsheet Haaretz,       (Galeria arts supplement,       20/02/2009: article No.
148498, 770 words, including photos &#8212; weekend       circulation: 100,000 &amp;mdah; Section       5, item 3) and a follow-up review: `Ensemble Meitar performed subversive,       modern and       political music in front of an audience that saturated the hall in Hateiva       Studio.
The works Ets         HaDa'at by Fischman, and Amalek by Arel Paz and Ran Kasmi       Ilan brought to the fore the voice of       conquered and occupied Palestinians' (Noam Ben Zeev, Haaretz,       23/2/2009).

Opening new ways of creative thinking and professional practice:     Through published writings referenced in professional composer websites       and the distribution of       developed software (e.g.
free through General Public License), composers,       time-based artists and       digital developers have benefited from Fischman's research insights       (sample evidence:       correspondence with software user, Section 5, item 4, 29/8/2013).
From       2002, AL &amp; ERWIN       software has been downloaded extensively and used by professionals,       students and general       members of the public: the number of registered downloads surpassed 4800       by 2011 (Section 5,       item 5), in addition to over 3500 additional downloads from other public       websites (Section 5 item       6).
It was reviewed in the popular magazine Electronic Musician:       `Rajmil Fischman's new software       takes a unique approach to computing the data needed to create sound using       granular synthesis...
Whether you mastered physics in school or not, give Al and Erwin a try.'
(Section 5, item 7).
Fischman's writings are recommended reading in professional and       self-teaching web resources       (2008-present): e.g.
The Phase Vocoder Theory and Practice in ralemagik.com       and E Giordani's       Italian translation downloadable as a PDF in Italian (Section 5, item 8):       together with the article       Analysis of Crosstalk, a work by Michael Vaughan and other       writings, it is included in the       recommended bibliography on the ElectroAcoustic Resource Site (EARS).

Informing the design and delivery of curriculum and syllabi in         other institutions         worldwide:     Fischman's writings and musical works have become essential reading and       listening, and have       influenced the design of teaching at higher education institutions, as       illustrated by the following       selected examples: A Tutorial Survey of "Classic" Synthesis Techniques,       which applies the results       of investigations into audio processing using CSound to the development of       skills using this       programming language, is used as a textbook in institutions other than       Keele, such as Yale       University (Section 5, item 9, 23/9/2009) and the University School of       Music, Montevideo.
This       book chapter condenses the contents of a previous manuscript which has       been used in other       institutions such as the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Section 5       item 10, 14-15/4/2010), and       is presently available at the professional musician's site the Peruvian       Circle of Composers       Circomper (Section 5, item 11).
The Italian translation of The         Phase Vocoder Theory and Practice       is used at present as text in the syllabus of the Electroacoustic       Programme at the Music       Conservatoire Domenico Cimarosa, Avelino.
The article Analysis of         Crosstalk, a work by Michael         Vaughan, is currently part of the recommended bibliography at the       University of Helsinki.
Fischman's acousmatic work Kol HaTorr is taught and analysed as       repertoire at the Jerusalem       Academy of Music and Dance (Section 5 item 13, 10/11/2009).
Mekorot         Hamuzica Havisualit:         Perspectiva Muzicalit (forthcoming) is already used as text for       courses in visual music at the       Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design and &#191;Te Acuerdas Hijo?
(2006)       is used as recommended       work here too (Section 5 item 13, 10/1/2012).
