     The research on OLEDs including device fabrication capabilities provided       the opportunity to make compact wearable light sources for skin cancer       treatment.
In order to realise this vision (as mentioned briefly above) we       applied for and received a "proof of concept" grant from Scottish       Enterprise to make a demonstrator device whose initial evaluation was       conducted at Ninewells Hospital.
Further support from Scottish Enterprise,       led to the fabrication of further devices in St Andrews, which were used       in a pilot trial demonstrating the potential of OLEDs for the photodynamic       therapy of skin cancer.
In order to enable the above research to be widely used, the prototype       devices made in the research outlined above needed to be developed into a       form suitable for regulatory approval and manufacture.
The regulatory       approval of a medical device is a major task requiring extensive design       and testing to appropriate standards and so is both expensive and time       consuming.
In order to address this, a spin-out company, Ambicare Health       Ltd was formed, and &#163;2M of venture capital raised a the start of 2008.
This funded the development of skin cancer and acne products following       the ISO13485 standards for medical devices and leading to CE marking of       both devices, thereby enabling them to be sold in all countries of the       European Union [S1].
In addition the skin cancer treatment has regulatory       approval in Australia, a major market for skin cancer treatment.
A further       &#163;2M of venture capital has been raised since to support the manufacture       and marketing of these products.
The product for skin cancer treatment is       called "Ambulight" and the acne treatment is called "Lustre" [F1].
The       official unveiling of the Ambulight product led to a wide range of press       and media interest and featured in many major UK and international       newspapers and on popular TV shows.
[S2]     The research has led to health and economic benefits.
The economic impact       to date is primarily in the form of licence, assignment and royalty fees       paid by Ambicare Health and totalling [text removed for publication].
By       simplifying treatment, and increasing the number of patients treated per       clinic (see below), there are also economic benefits to the treatment       provider (e.g.
NHS) but we have not been able to quantify these.
The healthcare benefits of Ambulight are described in a letter by the       Joint Head of Photobiology at Ninewells Hospital [F2], who was not       involved in the development of the device, but has been performing       research on its effectiveness and is in charge of delivering Photodynamic       Therapy at the hospital.
In the letter she explains that conventional PDT       is an effective treatment, but the light sources "include expensive         lasers and relatively cumbersome static polychromatic, predominantly LED         sources".
She explains "there are limitations with hospital-based         PDT and these include the fact that only a limited number of patients         can be treated in any one clinic session because of the availability of         specialised hospital-based light sources; the patient needs to wait for         a 3 hour period whilst the cream is in place and therefore this involves         at least a half-day visit to the hospital' the high intensity of the         light delivery using the hospital sources causes pain which in         approximately 16-20% is severe........
Pain has resulted in patients         discontinuing treatment prematurely and therefore not having effective         therapy .....It also limits the wider acceptance of         PDT....Hospital-based irradiation also requires that the patient must         lie still.
Eye protection is needed for both the patient and staff.."     The Ambulight device overcomes these limitations, providing a convenient       and comfortable treatment with advantages for both the patient and the       treatment provider.
She explains "The Ambulight device has         revolutionised many of the problems we have with conventional PDT.
It is         a portable, wearable light source with battery pack.
This means that it         is ideally suited for patients who are mobile and/or keen to have         treatment at home.
It also considerably reduces the amount of time that         the patient must attend the hospital and reduces the amount of input         from staff such that the through-put of the clinic can be greatly         increased."
[F2]     She explains that Ambulight is effective and addresses the problem of       pain in conventional PDT.
For example she comments on a recent study       conducted in which "we have reported on 53 patients with 61 lesions         ...who were treated with Ambulight PDT and, again, pain scores were low,         but importantly efficacy at one year follow-up was high with 84% of         lesions being clear."
[F2]     She adds "Thus to summarise, Ambulight PDT is extremely convenient,         easy to use, associated with low levels of discomfort and is highly         effective for the treatment of these superficial non-melanoma skin         cancers and dysplasia.
The use of these devices allows greater         through-put and efficiency of the PDT clinic and thus has major benefits         both for the patients, allowing them a comfortable, portable, effective         home-based treatment, but also for the running of the PDT clinic.
The         treatment procedure is simplified and the number of patients that can be         treated in any given clinic session increased.
With regard to the bigger         picture, Ambulight PDT certainly enhances the wider acceptance of PDT in         the community as pain had been a limiting factor for some referrers to         the service.
Ambulight PDT now has a very important role in our own PDT         services and my understanding is that it has now been taken up in many         centres.
Feedback indicated that 27 centres in the Netherlands are now         using Ambulight PDT, and uptake is ongoing in the UK.
Thus, it has made         a significant impact in terms of change of practice in how we deliver         PDT."
[F2]     The Principal Scientist at Ambicare Health has also written confirming       the above points about Ambulight Multi [F1].
He also explains the Lustre       product: "Lustre is a wearable light source for acne treatment with         blue light.
Acne has a major impact on the lives of many sufferers, and         in a clinical trial we have shown that Lustre offers major advantages in         reducing lesions.
The advantage of Lustre is that it enables acne to be         treated in the comfort of the home, and without drugs or chemicals."
He adds "Blue light therapy for the treatment of acne has been around         for many years, however existing treatment typically come in one of two         forms; torches that are held to the face by the user, or lamps that         shine remotely onto the skin.
Both are highly inconvenient, particularly         in a home setting and consequently users are highly unmotivated to use         them.
This leads to low treatment compliance and ultimately poor         efficacy.
Lustre in contrast, is a light weight wearable device that         allows users to get on with their lives; this ease of use promotes         compliance and ultimately efficacy.
This is very appealing to acne         sufferers and doctors treating them.
At present Lustre is being sold         mainly in the Netherlands and the UK.
It is in regular use in over 250         clinics in the UK."
[F1]     He also comments "In 2012 the Lustre Pure Light device won the         Aesthetic Industry Awards, Product innovation of the year."
