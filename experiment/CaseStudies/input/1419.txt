     Since its inception, EPPE, led by Sylva and Sammons, has involved       collaboration with       policymakers and users in research design and application.
It has       maintained a strong media       profile and a frequently accessed website (e.g.
10,696 page loads from       4,180 unique visits during       the month of Jan 2013).
In addition, FELL researchers have engaged in       activities aimed at       facilitating impact, such as giving evidence to parliamentary inquiries       and government       consultations, delivering invited speeches to policy events, and taking on       consultancy and advisory       roles, including contribution to government spending reviews and policy       evaluations (e.g.
Sylva       was a specialist adviser to the House of Commons Select Committee on       Education, 2000-10, and       a member of the expert panels of the Good Childhood Review, 2008 and the       Tickell Review on the       Early Years Foundation Stage, EYFS, 2011; Sammons and Sylva are leading       the evaluation of the       impact and delivery of services in children's centres in England; see also       [R6-7]).
They have also       produced and refined instruments that have shaped the way early years       pedagogical quality is       measured, and have facilitated their use by Local Authorities (LAs),       practitioners, and public       bodies.
For example, the observational research tool developed by       Sylva et al, ECERS-E [R4], is       widely used by practitioners, training providers and Local Authorities in       the UK and internationally.
These activities have led to wide-ranging contributions to specific       policy initiatives, to professional       development in early years education, and to shifts in policy discourse       about early years.
The       weight given to FELL research in reviews, such as Tickell (2011, EYFS),       Field (2010, inequalities       in children's development), Bew (2011, national assessment) and Allan       (2010, early interventions),       shows the sustained relevance of this research to early years policy.
Specific initiatives, since       2008, that illustrate this wide and lasting picture of impact include:     Free early years education provision     The longitudinal research, in particular the finding that pre-school is       associated with cognitive and       social behavioural benefits up to age 11 [R1-3], influenced the       policy decision in 2010 (enabled by       the Education Act 2011) to extend free early years education to 15 hours       per week for 3-4 year       olds.
This led to take up by 1.2 million children (DfE figures, 2011).
The       National Audit Office       (NAO) notes that "in determining the expected benefits from changing         and expanding the         entitlement, the Department has set out its own analysis of the likely         educational and monetised         benefits, drawing on the findings of longitudinal research [EPPE]";       the EPPE findings underpinning       the DfE's decisions are described at length on p.13 of the NAO report [C1].
The research [R1-2, R7] was used by the government as evidence       for the investment of &#163;380m       per year to roll out the provision of targeted early education places for       disadvantaged two year olds       to cover 20% of this group (136,000 children) from September 2013, rising       to 40% (260,000       children) from 2014.
The DCSF Report [R7] was also used to guide       discussion around criteria of       quality for eligible providers; two of the 24 questions on which the       government consulted prior to       introducing the initiative, including those on quality criteria,       referenced the research [C2].
The       DfE/DH evidence pack [C3] supporting the policy statement about       early years education (2011)       draws extensively on FELL research in its summary of evidence that "underpins         the government's         vision set out in the overall families in the foundation years policy         statement", including the free       entitlement.
For example, publications based on the research [R2, R7]       are "key evidence sources"       [C3, p.17] cited as underpinning Government's decision to "offer       two year olds from disadvantaged       backgrounds the free entitlement to 15 hours early education" [C3,         p.9] and entitle 3-4 year olds to       15 hours of free early education a week [C3 p. 41].
The 2011       impact assessment document for the       2 year-old offer repeatedly cites EPPE and [R7] as core sources of       research evidence in setting       out the rationale for this policy initiative [C4], and identifies       benefits such as increased take up of       high-quality early education at 3 and 4 years of age and improved       cognitive skills among children,       leading to lifetime economic benefits.
A further impact assessment       document used evidence from       [R7] to analyse the changes to secondary legislation required for       the roll-out of the programme to       40% of disadvantaged two year olds from 2014.
The explanatory memorandum       accompanying the       resulting `Regulations for Local Authorities' states that the policy       change is "rooted" in evidence       from EPPE [C5, para 7.3] and cites [R2].
The Flying Start programme in Wales was also explicitly linked to EPPE.
The 2009-10 Flying Start       guidance states that EPPE findings led to two policy decisions: to       "provide part-time places for       children between the ages of 2 and 3 years", and to have staff in Flying       Start settings "be proactive       in helping parents to support their children's development and learning at       home" [C6, para 4 &amp; 52].
The Early Years Foundation Stage Framework     The EYFS Framework, which came into force in 2008 (based on the       Children's Act, 2006), used       EPPE findings, including the insight that "guided play" helps improve       children's literacy and       numeracy skills.
As stated in the DfE impact assessment documents, "the         EYFS was introduced in         response to evidence collected through the EPPE project which showed         that access to good         quality childcare provision has a lasting positive effect on children's         long-term outcomes" [C7, p.5].
In 2009, Evangelou was appointed by the DCSF, in view of a governmental       review of the EYFS in       2010, to lead a review of the research literature on the development of       children, carried out by a       team from Oxford University and Oxford Brookes University.
The DCSF       circulated the resulting       report [R5], with a request to share it widely among key       stakeholders (including the National Day       Nurseries Association, the National Childminding Association, the       Pre-school Learning Alliance,       the Daycare Trust, 4Children, and the National Children's Bureau), and       featured it in its information       sheet to LAs (Dec. 2009).
At the DCSF/DfE's invitation, Evangelou and       Sylva presented and       discussed findings from the report [R5] with the National       Strategies Early Years and the       Communication, Language &amp; Literacy Development teams (2010) and with       the National Strategies       Early Years regional advisers (2011).
The report [R5] underpinned the work of the Tickell Review of the       EYFS [C8].
The study was used       throughout the Review process; for example, at the interim stakeholder       conference of the Review       (Dec. 2011) it was part of the core evidence given to the participants as       underpinning the Review.
The Tickell report [C8] references the study [R5]       repeatedly, as well as EPPE research [R2].
It       also acknowledges the contribution of Sylva, who was appointed in 2010 to       the expert panel of the       Tickell Review, a role in which she drew on insights from FELL research [C8].
The evidence base from EPPE and other FELL research continues to underpin       the 2012 EYFS       framework.
The DfE/DH evidence pack for early years policy [C3]       cites [R5] as evidence       underpinning the 2012 EYFS framework.
EPPE findings are also cited at       length as evidence of the       importance of parental involvement, and of strategies promoting it; of       high-quality early education       settings, in particular for children from disadvantaged backgrounds; and       of the role of play during       the foundation stage [C3, pp.
26-27, 34-36, 41].
Developing early years professionalism     The &#163;305 million Graduate Leader Fund (GLF) was established to train and       support early years       professionals for leadership roles (2007-11).
Insights from FELL research       about children's       improved outcomes in graduate-led pre-school provision contributed to the       development of the       GLF, its precursor, the Transformation Fund (&#163;250 million, 2006-07), and       successor (LAs support       via the Early Intervention Fund, since 2011).
In 2011, a team led       by Mathers was commissioned by       the DfE to evaluate the GLF.
Their report [R6] was used as       evidence for continued investment by       Government in graduate leadership for early years [C10].
An       article in the October 2011 issue of       Early Years Update, written by a Children's Workforce Development Council       (CWDC) official, also       highlighted the importance of investing in the workforce as a direct       result of the findings of the GLF       evaluation.
On receipt of the final report, CWDC produced an action plan       based on its key findings,       which were included in the handbook and induction process for providers of       the Early Years       Professional Status programme (Jan 2012).
The 2012 Nutbrown Review, commissioned by the DfE, made recommendations       for a more       professional, Level 3 qualified early years workforce, and for high       quality early years leadership.
The recommendations stem from a strong argument, based explicitly on EPPE       findings, for the       importance of high quality early years settings to children's development.
The Review report cited       a research basis that came largely from EPPE and FELL [C9, p. 14].
The Government's case for       policy change, outlined in its response to the Nutbrown Review and in 2013       proposals for early       years education, rests on evidence from [R6] and EPPE [C10, p.         12, 15, Appendix].
A practical and discursive shift in early years policy     The impacts described are a recent selection of a much bigger picture       spanning three decades of       rigorous research and engagement, shaping policy and practice and       transforming policy discourse.
In 2008, the Children's Minister referred to Prof Sylva (OBE, 2008, for       services to children and       families) as "tremendously influential in shaping government policy in         early years education".
Since       1997, "the main source of analyses of the impact of pre-school         provision on child development in         the UK is the EPPE Project" (HM Treasury, 2004, p.65), with "significant         impact on policy         development in early years" (DfES, 2006, p.20).
In the recent words       of a former senior civil servant,       "anyone who has worked in Britain over the last ten years in the field         of early education and care         will, whether they know it or not, have been influenced by the EPPE         Project.
Indeed, many people         currently employed in early years services owe the fact of their         employment, at least in part, to the         findings from this remarkable research...
The landscape of early years         education and care has         been transformed in the last ten years.
The research eloquently         described in [R1] played a major         role in that transformation, and has lessons for us in the next ten         years" [C11].
