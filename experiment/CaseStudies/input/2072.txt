     Patient Benefits     The research at Newcastle has had a significant impact on the health and       welfare of patients with MND, and the randomised controlled trial (RCT)       has led to changes in clinical guidelines and clinical practice.
The work       has provided one of only two evidence-based treatments for patients with       MND in recent decades, with Riluzole being the other.
However, Riluzole       offers only a modest survival benefit, with no improvement in symptom       control.
As testified by an Associate Professor at the Respiratory       Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, the Newcastle studies `...have         shown that the magnitude of the survival impact of noninvasive         ventilation exceeds that of pharmacologic intervention (with riluzole),         such that future trials have to factor in the survival benefit of NIPPV       [non-invasive positive pressure ventilation]' [EV a].
The Newcastle RCT was considered Class 1 research when reviewed within       guidelines on the treatment of patients with MND, produced by both the       American Academy of Neurology [EV b] and the European Federation of       Neurological Societies [EV c], and it was the only RCT selected as       fulfilling the rigorous criteria for entry into a Cochrane review of the       subject of mechanical ventilation for MND patients [EV d].
The research       clearly demonstrated the survival benefit offered by non-invasive       ventilation to those patients with good bulbar function compared to       standard non-ventilatory treatment.
It also demonstrated a significant and       sustained improvement of quality of life for patients treated by       non-invasive ventilation.
Respiratory muscle weakness causes       hypoventilation and sleep disruption and, as a consequence, patients with       MND often suffer from morning headaches, lethargy, fatigue, poor       concentration, and poor appetite [EV e].
Non-invasive ventilation can       significantly reduce these symptoms, such that the longer survival of MND       patients given non-invasive ventilation is accompanied by improved       symptoms.
Since non-invasive ventilation is provided through a portable       ventilator, patients are treated in their own homes [EV e] with support       from specialist home ventilation services, which are available in the UK       and elsewhere.
The potential benefits of non-invasive ventilation are recognised by the       MND Association, who quoted the Newcastle-based research in a press       release [EV e] ahead of a Westminster Hall debate in 2009 on the       availability of non-invasive ventilation to people with MND.
The RCT [R4,       section 2] was directly referred to during the debate [EV f].
Specifically, it was stated that: `Clinical research published in 2006         showed that non-invasive ventilation typically increased the median         survival period for people with motor neurone disease by seven months'       and `...the typical survival period is 14 months, so seven months would         be a material change in someone's survival, and a major change in their         quality of life and that of their carers' [EV f].
Clinical Practice     The Newcastle led survey carried out in 2009 found that the number of MND       patients referred for non-invasive ventilation within the UK had increased       2.6-fold compared to the number of referrals in 2000 (from 234 to 612),       and the number of patients successfully established on non-invasive       ventilation had increased 3.4-fold (from 126 to 444) [R5, section 3].
Since the incidence of MND has remained stable over that time, these       figures indicate that there has been a substantial change in clinical       practice and an improvement in the referrals process [R5, section 3].
In       addition, the access to non-invasive ventilation services by neurologists       has improved, as 10.1% reported no service available in 2000 compared with       only 1% in 2009 [R5, section 3].
In 2010, NICE published guidelines on the       use of NIV in the management of MND, with Dr Bourke on the guideline       development group [EV g].
Within the UK, the wider implementation of these       guidelines continues to increase the use of non-invasive ventilation for       MND and addresses any current variations in clinical practice.
This is       evidenced by two surveys carried out by the MND Association on patients       living with MND in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Data from patient       questionnaires showed that NIV use by MND patients has increased from       13.2% (62 out of 469 patients) in 2009 to 24.6% (192 out of 779 patients)       in 2013 [EV h].
The clinical impact of this research is clearly evident beyond the UK;       the use of non-invasive ventilation in patients with MND has expanded in       the US, Australia and across Europe, where clinical guidelines now include       evidence-based recommendations for its use.
As identified by the clinical       and academic director of the national referral centre for chronic       respiratory failure and home ventilation at St Thomas' hospital `...the         trial by Bourke et al has driven forward the use of non-invasive         ventilation in both the European and North American Centres' [EV i].
The American Academy of Neurology cite the work by the Newcastle       group in the opening paragraph of their 2009 Practice Parameter update (an       influential US clinical practice guideline), stating that since the       publication of the previous guidelines `...there have been some         important new studies, including a randomized controlled trial of         non-invasive ventilation in ALS.2' (where `2'       refers to R4 in Section 3) [EV b].
The RCT also has an important position in the European Federation of         Neurological Societies 2012 guidelines for the diagnosis and         management of ALS [EV c], in which NIV is advised for the management       of respiratory dysfunction in all MND (ALS) patients with good bulbar       function [EV c, p.371].
The following quote and recommendation are taken       directly from the guidelines (in which `[140]' refers to R4 in       section 2): `Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation increases         survival and improves patients' quality of life and is the preferred         therapy to alleviate symptoms of respiratory insufficiency [47, 49,         137-142] (of which [140] is Class I)' [EV c, p.372].
Further, it is       stated in the recommendations that `NIPPV [non-invasive         positive-pressure ventilation] can prolong survival for many months' and         `...may improve the patient's quality of life' [EV c, p.372].
In addition, guidelines published in 2010 by the New South Wales         Agency for Clinical Innovation highlight that "...the role of NIV         remained unclear until a randomised controlled study by Bourke et al         [139]" (where [139] refers to the RCT) and that `...nocturnal         ventilation is used in patients with motor neurone disease to improve         symptoms and quality of life', (again citing R4, section 3) [EV j,       p.39-40].
The objective of these guidelines is to provide information to       optimise the management of individuals with disorders likely to lead to       the development of chronic respiratory failure and aims to assist       clinicians in informed decision-making [EV j].
