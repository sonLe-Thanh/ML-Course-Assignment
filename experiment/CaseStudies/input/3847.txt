     ConCA work has significantly improved the understanding of what really       causes construction       accidents, as a major step towards preventing their occurrence.
In 2001, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) established a ten-year       work programme to make a       significant improvement to health and safety in construction owing to the       sector's poor health and       safety performance.
HSE acknowledge that, from its publication in 2003,       the ConCA report RR156       was "particularly relevant to the establishment and development" of       this HSE programme, "leading         to a number of initiatives being taken forward to target specific         activities and risks".
The ConCA       model's high-level similarity to an influence-network model that emerged       from other HSE-sponsored       research in particular gave HSE's Construction Division confidence to take       account of       all levels in the model hierarchies.
Its synoptic sensibility has prompted       several initiatives targeting       specific risks; it persists today [C1, C2].
In 2009, the Loughborough University team's record led the HSE to       commission it to review       construction-safety research in order to inform the Donaghy `Fatals'       Inquiry, which the HSE was       supporting.
As HSE note [C2], "On these occasions it is         important that those leading the enquiries         are furnished with appropriately robust data and analysis.
Loughborough         University's work in         support of phase one of the enquiry provided a consolidated view of         previous work on causal         factors as a platform for later stages".
Loughborough University       researchers influenced the inquiry       directly through one of two foundational reports published as part of the       inquiry.
But more important       was an indirect influence through the lasting impact within HSE's       Construction Division of       Loughborough University's ConCA research.
HFACS-C, the method of examining       the underlying       causes of fatal construction accidents adopted by Donaghy draws on ConCA,       notably for the       breadth of causal factors it recognizes [C3].
The current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has said that "The         Government are         committed to addressing the heavy toll of deaths in the construction         industry which was highlighted         in Baroness Donaghy's report.
We will therefore progress those of the         Donaghy recommendations         accepted by the previous Administration", including, for example,       simplification of pre-qualification       for small firms tendering for publicly-funded construction work [C4].
HFACS-C is a version of HFACS, an aviation accident-investigation       framework first applied to       construction accidents by the HSE in 2007.
HSE's development and use of it       continues today.
HSE's Health and Safety Laboratory used it in a 2012 study, for example,       of good safety practice in       the putting up and taking down of temporary demountable structures (TDSs).
HSE commissioned       the research and published the resulting report [C5] in       anticipation of the high demand for TDSs       they knew would occur for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The London 2012       Games have since been celebrated for their exceptionally good health and       safety record (zero       fatalities and an accident rate six times better than the industry       average).
In 2009, concerned about a perceived neglect by industry of the risk of       catastrophic construction       incidents, the HSE commissioned Gibb and Loughborough University       colleagues to extend their       causality work to examine this risk with the Construction Industry       Research and Information       Association (CIRIA) `with a view to challenging industry to address issues       which appeared to offer       the best chance for improvement in performance'.
In parallel with       publication of the findings by       HSE in Research Report 834, April 2011 [R6], CIRIA published Guidance         on catastrophic events         in construction (CIRIA, http://bit.ly/1fld2SZ),       which supplemented material from RR834 [R6] with       material calculated to help practitioners respond practically to RR834.
Publication followed a series       of feature articles published in New Civil Engineer about the       catastrophe research, which helped       attract industry attention to this issue.
Recommendations from       Loughborough University's       catastrophe work "are now being taken forward by a working group         established by the Construction         Industry Advisory Committee (CONIAC) &#8212; a tri-partite committee of HSE,         industry and trades         unions" [C2].
CONIAC advises HSE on protecting people from       construction-related health and       safety hazards.
The reach of ConCA has extended beyond both the construction industry and       the UK.
For       example, after a fatality during construction of a new building in an       upgrade to its manufacturing       plant, Toyota Australia searched for a model that would best guide them       through a construction-       accident investigation, they consulted Royal Melbourne Institute of       Technology (RMIT) University       in Melbourne and were "advised that the ConCA accident causation         model... would be able to         assist [them] in [their] investigation".
They "found         the model useful in exploring both direct and         indirect causes of the accident, thus allowing better insight into how         the accident occurred" [C6].
On the strength of their reputation, Gibb and Loughborough University       colleague Haslam (DHS),       with industry subcontractor Helen Bolt, were commissioned by the Olympic       Delivery Authority's       (ODA) to document the human and organisational contributions to the       exemplary construction       health and safety performance achieved by the ODA at London 2012.
The       subsequent report       made publicly available on the ODA's Learning Legacy website, provides       examples to convey in       practical terms the key factors that contributed to the health and safety       achievement.
Howard       Shiplee, the ODA's Construction Director commented, "of all the 2012         Legacy Learning documents         I really believe this to be the most significant for the future.
May I         thank you... for doing such a         terrific job in setting out with credibility the significance of `soft'         individual and organisational issues         which can transform the construction industry".
Furthermore, "`Preconditioning         for Success' is not         just a roadmap .... provides real guidance for those embarking on any         project or programme in the         future"[C7].
