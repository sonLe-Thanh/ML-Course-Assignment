     As a specialist in modern history and propaganda with a particular       strength in relating historical examples to contemporary contexts, Welch's       work has become an important primary reference point for a number of       non-HEI agencies interested in the ever-widening public debate on the flow       of information and attempts to influence opinion.
Broadcast Media     Because of his international research profile in this area, Welch was       approached in 2010 by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) to serve       as historical consultant and on-air commentator for an ambitious       multi-series project entitled Love,           Hate and Propaganda.
Designed to showcase the role of       propaganda and war in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries within       specific contexts, three commissioned series were produced between       2010-2013 (The Second World War, The Cold War, The War         on Terror).
As Canada's state broadcaster, CBC's mission in       producing these programmes was to educate a target audience within the       17-30 age group about the role played by propaganda in modern history.
Welch's expertise shaped the programme content by suggesting that       propaganda was not necessarily a cancer on the body politic but rather a       means of persuasion practised by governments of all ideological leanings &#8212;       including democracies.
The overarching intention of the project was to       challenge preconceptions of propaganda and ensure that the audience came       to an understanding of propaganda as an all-persuasive element in public       discourse and not simply as a method of mass brainwashing.
Exhibitions     From 2008, Welch has acted as historical consultant on a number of museum       and library projects, most notably as a consultant historian for the       United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (Washington D.C.).
Welch assisted       the board of Directors and Curators in the shaping of the 2009 exhibition,       `State         of Deception: The Power of Nazi Propaganda' by interacting with the       museum's team and producing a series of recommendations based on its       initial proposal.
In 2012, Welch was approached by the British Library to co-curate a       special summer exhibition on propaganda (May &#8212; September 2013).
`Propaganda:         Power and Persuasion' was planned as `a ground breaking exhibition'       which sought to demonstrate Welch's belief that propaganda is a `much       maligned and misunderstood' concept [3.4].
Welch acted as the historical       consultant and shaped the structure and themes of both the exhibition and       book and suggested individual case studies and artefacts to be included.
The exhibition challenged previously-held assumptions about propaganda,       the media and the state.
In effect, the exhibition and the accompanying       book represented a distillation of Welch's work to date on the       relationship between politics, propaganda and public opinion, changing       technology and different types of warfare.
By exploring a wide range of       exhibits from around the world, visitors to the exhibition, and readers of       the accompanying book, were invited to look critically at messages,       methods, and media, discovering more about the use of propaganda through       time and across cultures.
In addition, the exhibition was deliberately       designed to ensure public engagement through a range of supporting events.
These included open lectures with leading thinkers on public discourse       such as Noam         Chomsky (19 March 2013) and events aimed at schools         and colleges.
Welch gave a dedicated public lecture to       schoolteachers and educators at the British Library ('Picturing Propaganda.
A Study Day', 1 June 2013) following which they were given a special       viewing of the exhibition.
Welch was also involved in a public debate with       journalists and military figures on the relationship between `war, media       and propaganda' in modern history including the `war on terror' (`Justifying         War', 21 June 2013).
Reach     In its first year the Holocaust Museum exhibition was visited by 384,000       people and has been reshaped into a permanent online         exhibition which has given it worldwide and on-going reach.
The       website is available in Arabic, Farsi, Italian, Spanish and Turkish and       received 1,659,000 visits in its first year and 900,000 visits in 2010.
[5.1]     The British Library's `Propaganda: Power and Persuasion' exhibition       (May-September 2013) had a target of 50,000 visitors, but achieved 68,250       of which 5,044 were school or HE group visits.
(Monthly average: 13,650).
[5.9]     The first series of Love, Hate and Propaganda, Selling World         War II, consisted of 6 one hour episodes and attracted 5.2       million Canadian viewers (3.76 million English-speaking; 1.5 million       French-speaking).
There were 94,981 further streams of this programme       through the digital media site and 245,170 hits on the dedicated website       related to the series.
The second set of programmes, aired in 2011 and       entitled The Cold War, featured 4 one hour television       programmes with a total number of 1,434,000 viewers (702,000 English;       732,000 French- speaking).
This series was released to international       markets in China, Finland, Sweden and Denmark.
The website streamed full       episodes a further 40,938 times, and received a total of 251, 646 hits.
In       December 2012, the third series, The War on Terror, consisting       of 2 one hour television programmes was broadcast and has been accessed by       approximately 750,000 people.
[5.5] (Work has begun on a fourth series to       commemorate the 100th anniversary of First World War).
School and college-age students were identified as a key target audience.
To date, 1.7 million English-speaking and 374,000 French-speaking students       have viewed Selling World War Two, while 870,000 English-speaking       and 191,400 French-speaking students watched the set of programmes on The         Cold War through a special agreement which saw the series streamed       to Canadian educational institutions.
[5.5]     Significance     The Holocaust Museum exhibition formed the basis for an online         workshop for teachers in 2011, and was commented upon positively       within the museum world.
A peer review site stated that it was `highly       effective, visually engaging and rigorously researched'; `a masterful       exhibition... [it] should be remembered as one of the best attempts to do       this [understand Nazi propaganda]'.
[5.2] It was also appreciated by the       wider public.
A Maryland visitor stated that the `propaganda exhibit...was       VERY informative, and generated good conversation between me and my       boyfriend'; a Rhode Island visitor stated that the exhibition `should make       everyone think', whilst a South Carolina resident recorded, `I had never       understood how the holocaust could happen, but after visiting the       propaganda exhibit I can see how something so terrible can start'.
[5.4]       The reviewer for the Washington Post (11 February 2009) remarked that `the       depth of information available is...remarkable'.
[5.3.]
The CBC series have also made a significant impact.
The Canadian journal       National Post (16 November 2011) deemed the Cold War series       `compelling', and The Globe and Mail (17 November 2011) review       concluded: `Any thinking person can see how "the global fight for your       mind" continues, using similar tactics but different media, today' thus       revealing that the intention to show continuities against different       contexts was communicated.
[5.6; 5.7]     In addition to public broadcasts, Love, Hate and Propaganda was       also presented in Canadian schools and universities as an educational       tool.
Welch helped CBC establish a state-of-the-art online         website for educational purposes aimed at schools and universities.
This contained a lively interactive content including competitions         and prizes that, for example, encouraged secondary and       post-secondary students to design their own propaganda posters.
The       British Columbia Teachers' Federation judged the learning resources as a       `highly recommended resource for educators' and added that `students in       Grades 11 and 12 are guaranteed to find the content relevant and       engaging'.
[5.8]     The `Propaganda: Power and Persuasion' exhibition produced a deep impact       provoking visitors to reconsider their preconceptions, as is evident from       reviews and tweets regarding the exhibition.
The New Statesman       described it as `provocative exhibition... [which provides a] compelling       argument'; this was echoed in the Economist, which referred to       `this absorbing exhibition', and the Creative Review, which       described it as `a vast and thought provoking collection'.
The         Exhibitionologist stated that `the exhibition changed my perceptions       and made me ask myself what I think propaganda is'.
[5.10; 5.11; 5.12;       5.13] Such responses were echoed in the tweets of visitors: `so engrossing       that I only got round the first two bits in the hour before it closed.
Return visit needed'; `I thought I knew all about propaganda but the BL       exhibition brings it to a whole new level'; `Thoroughly thought provoking,       redefined my view of what propaganda is'; `Thought-provoking, essential,       riveting, enlightening, timeless &#8212; urge you to go'.
[5.14]     Welch has therefore made a highly important contribution to education and       public understandings of a crucial method of modern communication, helping       people to evaluate its influence on their own lives.
