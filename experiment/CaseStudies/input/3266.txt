     This research has benefitted individuals and professional communities and       effected changes in policy-making in the Further and Higher education       sectors in relation to the teaching of English Literature and Creative       Writing.
It has had a formative impact on the significant expansion of       Creative Writing.
The number of UK HEIs offering undergraduate programmes       in Creative Writing through UCAS has more than doubled between 2003 (29       HEIs) and 2013 (70 HEIs) [5:1].
HESA returns indicate a dramatic increase       in the numbers of students enrolled on Creative Writing courses at       undergraduate level (from 59 in 1994-5 to 3,010 in 2011-12) and at       postgraduate level (from 73 in 1994-5 to 1,078 in 2011-12) [5:2].
The       impact of this research has taken a number of forms: it has promoted the       development of creative methodologies for the teaching of English       Literature within the context of cross sector professional communities; it       has supported and enhanced the professional development of academic       practitioners in the field of English literature, both at Further and       Higher Education levels, in the UK and abroad; it has contributed to the       integration of Creative Writing into national A Level curricula.
Knights's       appointment as Director of the Higher Education Academy English Subject       Centre (2003-2011) facilitated a national and international programme of       research and dissemination in relation to the development of Creative       Writing as a discipline.
This research has contributed to the development of creative       methodologies for the teaching of English Literature; papers, workshops       and conference panels delivered in professional development contexts have       served to promote innovative practice across the education sector.
Knights       has presented the following papers and workshops: "Intelligence and       interrogation: the identity of the English student" (Subject Centre         International Conference, 2003); "Writing as learning" (Institute         for Learning and Teaching Northern Regional Forum, 2003); "Writing       as professional development" (Institute for Learning and Teaching         Annual Conference, 2002); "Reading, writing and retention" (Institute         for Learning and Teaching Northern Regional Forum, 2001); "Talking       texts: learning as dialogue" (Institute for Learning and Teaching         Annual Conference, 2000).
A series of workshops on "Creative &#8212;       Critical Crossovers" at Renewals: Refiguring University English in the         21st Century (Royal Holloway, July 2007)       were convened by Knights and provided a forum for professional       practitioners from a range of Universities (including Bangor, Bath Spa,       Hertfordshire, Oxford, Royal Holloway, Sheffield, Southampton, University       College London) to further develop innovative pedagogic practices in       relation to creativity in the English curriculum.
The publication of       research-informed features in journals for professional associations for       teachers in both Further and Higher Education has informed ongoing       professional development: Knights, "The         Implied Aesthetic of English Teaching" (WordPlay: the English         Subject Centre Newsletter, April 2010); Knights, "Reading, Writing,       and `Doing English': Creative-Critical Approaches to Literature" (English         Drama Media, the journal of the National Association for the         Teaching of English, 12 October 2008); Thurgar-Dawson,       "Transformative Writing: Re-creating the literary text" (Emag: The         Magazine for Advanced Level English, 41 (September 2008) 25-8); Knights,         "English on the Boundaries" (English Subject Centre Newsletter       February 2001).
Professional development workshops have been delivered by Knights and       Thurgar-Dawson at national and international venues and have provided new       models for pedagogic practice: Knights (with Gibson), "Writing and the       Teacher," Higher Education Academy Conference, 2008; Knights and       Thurgar-Dawson, National Association for the Teaching of English         Annual Conference, 2006; Knights and Thurgar-Dawson, University of       Warsaw, 2005; Knights, Institute for Learning and Teaching Conference,       2004.
This research has informed the design of open access online       resources in support of professional development for teachers: Knights       served as a Project Co-ordinator for the "Adding Subject Specificity to       Accredited Programmes" (ASSAP) project which developed "The Pool," an open       access online resource for newly appointed English and Creative Writing       lecturers in Higher Education, funded by Higher Education Academy and by       the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) Open Educational Resources       project [5:3-5].
Knights also contributed to the ESRC Teaching and       Learning Research Project online database: "Discipline-based pedagogic       research: English in Higher Education" [5.6].
Knights has acted as a       mentor for Higher Education Academy sponsored teaching and learning       projects promoting good practice in relation to the critical-creative       crossover, resulting in the production of professional development       resources directly informed by the research presented in this case study       [5:7-10].
Professor Knights was invited by the Qualifications and Curriculum       Development Agency to contribute to a national sector consultation on the       review of A Level specifications following the launch of `Curriculum       2000'.
From 2008 onwards the AQA and EdExcel awarding bodies have       incorporated critical-creative elements into their English literature A       Level.
The following reviews and/ research beneficiary testimonies provide       evidence of the impact of this research:            Adrian Barlow, "The Language of the Tribe", English Association           Newsletter 185 (2007):         "[Active Reading] is an important book, valuable in the first         instance not only to student teachers and NQTs but also to those         teaching in HE who need convincing of the value of using transformative         writing as a literary tool..."       Greg Garrard, Staff and Educational Development Association           Newsletter: "Active Reading is a welcome contribution to         the transformation of English .

Ben Knights is a key figure in an         emerging pedagogical research culture in English... engrossing and         insightful."
Former Chair, Assessment and Qualifications Alliance: "Ben Knights         was, in the period leading up to A Level reform in 2010, a key thinker         in the field of expanding ways of studying literature post 16, and a key         facilitator in getting together groups of academics, teachers and         examiners to look at creative ways of thinking and writing about         literature.
His work in this area was strongly endorsed by QCA and is         now firmly enshrined in all the A level syllabuses for which I am         responsible."
Co-Director, The English and Media Centre: "Ben Knights's work looking         at the relationship between `critical' and `creative' writing and on         transformative writing has made an important contribution to work on the         teaching of literature at advanced level in schools and colleges.
It has         helped to provide a theoretical underpinning and set of practices to         inform secondary classroom approaches.

Ben was also involved in         discussions around the development of a Creative Writing A Level,         starting in 2006, when there was a symposium to discuss initial         thinking.
This early thinking has now finally culminated in the         accreditation of an AQA Creative Writing A Level, due to start being         taught in September 2013.
His paper for NAWE in March 2006 was an         important contribution to this process.
Finally Ben was also involved         with a group of university teachers and A Level teachers who met         regularly during the process of A Level curriculum reform around 2003/4,         called `The English Reform Group'.
This group shared ideas and tested         out thinking about ideas developing in schools and universities about         practice in the teaching of English across the different phases."
Research Officer, National Association for the Teaching of English:         "Ben Knights' recent work has firmly established his reputation as an         innovative and highly influential theorist and practitioner of         pedagogies that create synergies between the disparate worlds of school         and university English.
It may be seen as the culmination of a         trajectory that began when, as a member of the DUET (Development of         University English Teaching) steering group, he developed the concept of         Literary Practice into what is now called transformative writing.
His         Active Reading project (with Dr Chris Thurgar-Dawson) led to the         publication of Active Reading: Transformative Writing in Literary           Studies, a text whose theoretical frameworks and pedagogic range         and depth has the power to impact critical study and creative writing in         English departments worldwide."
Director, National Association of Writers in Education: "As Director         of NAWE, now the Subject Association for Creative Writing, I should like         to testify to the important contribution made to the development of the         subject by Professor Ben Knights.
Ben was instrumental in enabling NAWE         to work productively with the English Subject Association for many         years, ensuring that the relationship between English and Creative         Writing studies was a fruitful one.
He played a particularly crucial         role in preparing the ground for the Creative Writing A Level that has         finally this year been accredited.
He was instrumental in researching         material relevant to the proposed qualification and ensuring that         discussions involved a broad range of specialist input.
The new A Level,         in conjunction with the Creative Writing Subject Benchmark that emerged         through similar partnership work over the same period, is already having         impact on the provision of CPD for teachers developing Creative Writing         in the classroom and the ongoing support for professional writers         teaching at all levels."
