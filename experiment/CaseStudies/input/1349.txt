     The principal impact of this research has been on public policy.
Anderson's election to the Royal Society, in 2009, was a direct       consequence of the impact of his research and his influence in the field:     "He is also one of the founders of the study of information security         economics, which not only illuminates where the most effective attacks         and defences may be found, but is also of fundamental importance to         making policy for the information society."
Royal Society Election       Citation.
European Commission     Anderson and colleagues have directly influenced the implemented policy       of the European Commission.
They produced two major reports for the       European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA): the first (2008)       on consumer and single-market aspects [6] and the second (2011) on       protecting the Internet infrastructure [7].
Many of the recommendations       from the 2008 report [6] are being implemented, including uniform fraud       reporting across Europe (implemented from 2012 in the Eurozone), security       breach disclosure laws (done in telecoms, under way for other sectors as       part of the Data Protection Regulation) and better international police       collaboration (with extra cybercrime staff for Europol)[12].
"Prof Anderson's early research on security economics as well as the         two studies he has carried out for ENISA have been very inspirational         for the development of EC's regulatory and policy proposals to ensure         transparency and accountability in the provisioning security of         electronic communication services."
[12]     The 2011 report [7] has been adopted as policy in its entirety by       ENISA and thus by the European Commission.
UK Government     Anderson has directly informed the public policy debate in the UK.
He is       frequently asked to testify before parliamentary committees and to advise       EU policy working groups.
For example, he has testified in person at       Westminster to the Commons Select Committee on Scientific Advice and       Evidence in Emergencies (17 November 2010):     "As we began our inquiry, the "Stuxnet" worm had just been identified         to be circulating... We were told that it would have taken six people to         create the worm over five months, with funding to the order of &#163;1         million.
[cites Anderson's evidence]" [8]     and to the Joint Select Committee on the Draft Communications Data Bill       (4 September 2012):     "Prof. Anderson's evidence was key to the Committee reaching its         conclusions and in its subsequent opposition to the Bill.
We were         particularly struck and influenced by the novel approach of considering         the economic incentives faced by those securing and attacking digital         services."
[9]     In 2010, Anderson was invited, by the Government Chief Scientific       Adviser, to join the Blackett Review of Cybersecurity, which fed into the       National Security Strategy [10], which in turn led to the cabinet       approving an extra &#163;640m budget for cybersecurity over 2011-5:     "Ross's input occurred at a key point in the development of the         Government's Cyber security programme...
The output of the Blackett         Review meetings was very influential across a number of the programme         work streams in supporting that programme, and Ross's work on security         economics was a key contributor to this" [11]     The Chief Scientific Adviser at the Ministry of Defence asked the       Cambridge team to produce a report on the costs of cybercrime, which was       published in 2012 [5].
RCUK's green paper for cybersecurity research in June 2011 identified       nine themes.
Two were directly in security economics ("Deployment,       economics, motivation and regulation of cyber security measures" and       "cybercrime"), another in the related and derivative field of the       behavioural economics of security ("human factors and useable security"),       and another spanning both ("Global threats, `cyberwar', ethics,       regulation, policy and legality").
The first two themes grew out of       Anderson's original research while the other two have been strongly       influenced by it.
Wider impacts     Anderson has been a visiting scientist at Google, while his students and       postdocs have interned at Yahoo, Microsoft, Easynet and Scottish Telecom.
Four of Anderson's former students now work in relevant government or       industry posts: the White House (Ozment), Google (Bonneau), Microsoft       Research (Danezis, Preibusch).
