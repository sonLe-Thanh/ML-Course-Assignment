     Two strands of impact have developed from this research.
First, tailored       collaborations with specific institutions have improved the communication       of conservation messages to visiting publics.
Second, impact across the       sector has been achieved by creating new resources and training courses       for practitioners.
Improving International Conservation Education       In partnership with the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (290,000         visitors p.a.
), the research findings were used to improve the quality         of their visitor experience through better exhibition design and more         robust evaluation.
From 2011, the Trust began to implement focus         group-inspired improvements, while also continuing to monitor how these         were being received.
The Trust's Wildlife Park had previously been         over-reliant on conveying information through dense and inaccessible         texts, which failed to communicate conservation messages effectively.
The research guided numerous changes to practices and communication         content, including changes in navigation aids around the park, the         development of new interactive means of delivering conservation messages         through audio guides, video displays and other communication systems         specifically designed for younger visitors, such as free web content and         blog posts.
The new approach was light, image-rich and more         comprehensible.
In addition, volunteers and interns were introduced to         offer guidance and information about new exhibits.
To create the         impression of a natural habitat, jungle sounds and vegetation were         introduced in the reptile house.
These changes were evaluated in 2012 in         a survey of c. 200 visitors to the park that provided clear evidence of         positive responses.
Visitors demonstrated increased concern with (and         better understanding of) the importance of conserving wildlife habitats         while also showing more interest in taking action to protect threatened         species.
The Trust has also modified their training programmes for         projects around the world: changes have been put in place for projects         overseas which have led to indigenous populations taking better care of         wildlife in their respective areas.
Research with the Zoological Society of London (1.2 million visitors         p.a.)
has improved their use of systematic and high quality evaluation         techniques to determine the success of their public engagement         activities specifically aimed at children.
The wider use of qualitative         evidence, such as annotated drawings for example, has replaced         evaluations based solely on visitor numbers as the means to assess         aspects of exhibit impact.
Success is now measured in terms of learning.
Such innovations allow the zoo to understand the strengths and         weaknesses of their current public engagement practices and to take         appropriate action where needed.
Providing training resources for the conservation sector       The research has contributed to the development of best practice by not         only engaging the public with conservation messages but also developing         systems to evaluate the impact of conservation education.
Both have been         communicated to professionals in the field though presentations at         practitioner conferences and the provision of training for those seeking         to impart conservation messages to the public.
Research results have         been presented, by invitation, to practitioner audiences at over 30         conferences and workshops from 2009-2013, reaching over 2500         conservation educators directly.
Examples include the British and Irish         Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust,         European Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the International Zoo         Education Association.
Examples of impact on practice include exhibition         changes in Bioparco Roma/Rome Zoo (1 million+ visitors p.a.)
to improve         the quality of a high profile exhibition (June 2011).
The researcher(s)         worked with the zoo in advance of a major new exhibition on small         primates.
The Head of Education at the Zoo attended a training event         held at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust where findings from the         research were presented.
As a result, the Callitrichid Exhibit         was renamed The Smallest Monkey in the World, reflecting research         findings on the effectiveness of simplified messages.
Jensen was invited         to inspect the results, which focused on adjustments from technical to         more generally understandable messages to excite greater public         attention.
Equally, with reference to the research conducted for the         National Marine Aquarium in Mauritius, a redesign of their conservation         training programme created a more context-oriented understanding of         conservation of coral reefs that reached beyond scientific details and         specified practical conservation activities that could be recommended to         the island's visitors.
The research has been cited in media which reach a worldwide audience.
This included a BBC radio interview in 2010, which allowed Jensen to         share his research findings to a broader public audience.
Evidence in         blog posts and online comments shows evidence of wider impact: the         research also had an impact when the results were cited in the public         debate about zoo ethics when Born Free's CEO engaged in detailed         critical discussion (see below).
