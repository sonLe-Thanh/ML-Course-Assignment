     Between 2008 and 2012 the UK's analogue TV signal was switched off,       leaving only digital TV       available.
Millions of viewers were at risk of finding their digital TV       services difficult to understand,       or of losing access to TV.
Freeman's research played a distinct and       tangible part in the eventual       success of the vast Switchover project: since 2008 his findings have been       published in 20 peer       reviewed outputs and over ten public reports commissioned by UK Government       Departments,       Charities and NGOs.
It helped the organisations responsible for delivery       of the Switchover (BBC,       Ofcom, Digital UK, Switchover Help Scheme, and Digital Outreach) to       address as many people as       possible to overcome barriers to their use of new digital TV equipment.
Digital UK, the organisation leading and managing the Switchover, was       equipped with a &#163;201 million       marketing budget by its broadcaster members (BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Five);       Freeman's research       influenced how large portions of this were spent.
In particular, the work       described in Section 2       (references 4-7) identified who might need the most help with switchover,       what sort of help would       benefit them, and how Digital UK could communicate most effectively with       them.
Digital UK       accordingly ran targeted communications campaigns at groups that the       research identified as hard       to reach or vulnerable, such as housing tenants, minority ethnic       audiences, older people, and       disabled people.
It did so in ways recommended by Freeman: these included       partnering with       community-based support networks, schemes and groups; establishing       regional support hubs; and       using a variety of media platforms.
The communications were targeted on       the basis of Freeman's       consumer segmentation, based on the research conducted for Ofcom and       Digital UK, whose value       is emphasised in Digital UK's report summarising the switchover research [1].
It is also evident from       Ofcom's extensive reference to Freeman's research on their website [e.g.,2]         and their subsequent       appointment of Freeman (i2 media) for numerous research and       consultancy assignments.
Freeman used the findings from the underpinning research throughout the       switchover, working to       raise awareness of the research results through presentations to key       stakeholders, industry       members and Government groups.
Freeman attended working groups including       the Digital       Television Usability Action Plan Group, the Digital Television Group's       Usability Expert Group and       Intellect Seminars, emphasising and advising on matters of usability and       accessibility.
He also       undertook research projects for Digital UK that tracked the progress of       switchover, the expectations       and confidence levels of consumers, and evaluated the effectiveness of       Digital UK outreach       projects.
[3]     The greatest impact of Freeman's research, however, occurred through the       Switchover Help Scheme,       which was set up by Government and the BBC to deliver targeted help with       switchover for       older and disabled consumers.
The very establishment of this scheme was       informed by two of his       research papers based on the underpinning work described above,       identifying different kinds of       consumer and emphasising the importance of well-designed advice and       support for the more       vulnerable or isolated members of society who most value television's role       in their life.
The key role       of the reports by i2 media research is made explicit in the         `How was the Help Scheme Developed?'
pages on the DCMS         website, which cites a number of i2 media's reports for the       DTI, BERR, and       Ofcom [6].
Freeman's work at Goldsmiths was also cited by       Peter White, the Help Scheme's Chief,       in his interview for a 2011 Guardian article (`Digital Switchover       Boss pledges help to those hardest       to reach') [7].
His design checklist for easy-to-use television equipment was       incorporated into the advisory       guidelines produced by the Digital Television Group; it was subsequently       used by the Government's       Consumer Expert Group, which worked with the Departments for Trade &amp;       Industry (DTI) and Culture,       Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) to generate Core Receiver Requirements [CRRs].
The Department for       Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform [BERR] then commissioned       Freeman to conduct a       comparative evaluation, which confirmed that CRR-compliant controls were       indeed the easiest to       use [4].
These were then endorsed by The Help Scheme, which       stated on its website that "Equipment         provided as standard through the Help Scheme must meet a set of CRRs         designed to ensure it best         meets the needs of older and disabled people, such as easy-to-use menus,         remote controls,         rescanning capabilities and access to useful functions including Audio         Description and subtitling.
The CRRs are managed by DCMS and the BBC."
Manufacturers thus had       to comply with the CRRs       in designing equipment eligible for procurement by the Help Scheme for       provision to its customers.
The Switchover Help Scheme was a great success: it sold (or, in the case       of consumers on low       incomes, gave) a set-top box and remote control to over one million       disabled and older people, and       in a survey 95% of end-users said they would recommend it.
Thus for       instance, one user who was       quoted in a Help Scheme progress report explained: "As an elderly lady         with sight and hearing         problems everything was very straightforward.
I am enjoying all the new         channels &#8212; thank you" [5].
Freeman has continued his work making media more accessible in the UK,       beyond Switchover.
He       has been commissioned by the Royal National Institute for the Blind       [RNIB], commercial       organisations and other government departments to develop guidelines for       `easy-to-use' digital radio       equipment and accessible audiobooks and e-books for blind and       partially-sighted users.
His       research has been used by the RNIB in their recommendations and guidance       for both consumers       and equipment manufacturers [8, 9].
The continuing relevance of the impact of Freeman's work was evidenced in       October 2013 when i2         media research won a place on the Ofcom Consultancy Framework for       the period 2013-2018.
