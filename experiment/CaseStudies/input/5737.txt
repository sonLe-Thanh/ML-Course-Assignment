     Specific impacts include: (1) New design methods for wing skins leading       to savings in fuel cost and lower emissions; and (2) Improved       manufacturing processes to achieve satisfactory quality in wing spars.
Airbus &#8212; performance improvement of wing skins: The Airbus       A350-XWB wing skins were designed using a ply layout algorithm [A, B]       developed by Liu, from the University of Bath, and Krog, from Airbus,       whilst Liu was on secondment to Airbus between 2007 and 2009.
The       algorithm used was based on the fundamental principles established at Bath       [2, 3], but extended to allow for variable percentages of each fibre       orientation in each skin panel, whilst including practical manufacturing       constraints.
A permutation GA was used to shuffle layers such that       continuity between adjacent panels was maximised whilst satisfying       laminate design rules, leading to a patent application [B].
According to the Head of the Structural Optimisation Technology Centre at       Airbus [C]:     `... the basis for the ply stacking algorithm, which today is used on         A350-1000,was developed during the secondment of Liu to Airbus between         2007 and 2009.
The algorithm, which brought together fundamental         knowledge from the university with ideas and practical know-how from         industry, is an integral part of a complex optimisation process that         allows optimum design of wing skins whilst considering strength, design         and manufacturing requirements.
The complexity of this task was such         that designs could not have been achieved without the algorithm.'
The A350-XWB embodies the first composite wing for an Airbus airliner,       entering service in 2014 with over 700 orders, at a list price of $254M       per aircraft and an order deposit ranging from 5 to 35% of price,       depending on time to delivery.
The company expects the new skins to       deliver component weight saving of 1.5 tonnes compared with metallic       skins, leading to a fuel saving of 1.0 tonne per typical flight.
This       represents a total fuel saving of around 40,000 tonnes, over the design       life of each aircraft, delivering a reduction in CO2 emissions       of 126,000 tonnes and a cost saving of $38M at current fuel prices.
GKN Aerospace &#8212; process improvements during wing spar manufacture:       GKN Aerospace is a tier 1 supplier of high quality components to the       aerospace primes, e.g.
Boeing, Airbus, Rolls-Royce.
As a risk-sharing       partner, GKN manufactures the rear spar of the A350-XWB wing for Airbus.
In order to achieve satisfactory part quality it is vital that defects,       particularly in the form of fibre wrinkles, do not occur during       manufacture.
The company has a history of build-to-print manufacture; however, in its       on-going strategy to promote a more analytical approach to design and       manufacture, GKN is jointly funding a Royal Academy of Engineering       Research Chair in Composites Analysis for Butler, which commenced in March       2013.
The aim of this Chair is to increase modelling, analysis and design,       capability in order to optimise the efficient use of fibre-reinforced       composite material and minimise the occurrence of defects during fully       automated manufacture.
In a News Release from GKN Aerospace [D], the       Technical Director of GKN Aerospace explains:     `The advantages of composite structures are thoroughly proven.
However, there remains much to gain from improving production processes         to increase the speed and consistency of manufacture and to reduce         production and material costs.
The work of this research chair at Bath         University will be of critical importance to the future success of the         UK composites industry &#8212; as well as to the long term market position of         GKN Aerospace.
The results we achieve will strengthen the UK's broad         industrial research landscape through the involvement of the National         Composites Centre and a variety of UK-based academic networks.'
During the secondment to GKN of Butler (RAEng funded, 2011) and then       Dodwell (Bath-GKN funded, 2011-2012), project reviews [E] took place at       which University achievements in modelling the wrinkling of laminates       during production were reported.
These models provided analytical insight       into the formation of wrinkles in the A350-XWB wing spar.
The Head of       Analysis, GKN Aerospace states that [F]:     `... the work undertaken by Tim Dodwell assisted GKN to understand         the fundamental mechanisms that initiate wrinkling defects in composite         laminates, particularly those with complex geometry.
This was the only         mechanical simulation available to the company during pre-production.
It         allowed investigation of the consequences of process changes and further         supported a number of process improvements to A350-XWB spar manufacture         which have enabled us to achieve satisfactory part quality in production.'
Specifically, the new analytical model supported the following two GKN       process improvements, generated to prevent the occurrence of wrinkling       defects during the A350-XWB spar development process:     (a) Manufacturing tools were introduced offset from the free edge of the       spar laminate to keep consolidation pressure away from this edge.
This       effectively gave a vacuum channel around the spar edge and allowed the       fibres and resin to move into this gap, thereby preventing wrinkling.
(b) The most critical influence was shown to relate to the viscosity of       the resin material and therefore a hot de-bulk was introduced into the       composite cure cycle to minimise viscosity during this period of maximum       consolidation.
Wrinkling defects can lead to wholesale rejection of the part.
Hence       these process improvements contribute to the achievement of current (one       aircraft per month) and future (13 per month) production rates, where each       aircraft spar has an equipped (unequipped) value of approximately &#163;1M       (&#163;100k).
