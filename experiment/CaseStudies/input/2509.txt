     The model initially developed in the Maxwell Institute was used by Waugh       to assess the impact of proposed housing policy on homelessness in       Scotland.
Waugh's results based on what became known as the Waugh         model gained influence in the Scottish Government [4-6]: it was       included in a paper to the then Minister for Communities and Support       (Stewart Maxwell) in 2008 and has been used since to provide advice to the       Scottish Government on the interpretation of homelessness statistics and       on the impact of policy changes.
Policy impact.
The model has had a clear and ongoing impact on the       Scottish Government's housing policy by providing a quantitative       underpinning to proposed policies.
By characterising and quantifying the       interaction between the availability of public-sector housing and       homelessness levels the model has motivated several changes in policy [6].
These include a change in the Scottish Government's Affordable Housing       Investment Programme, massively increasing public-sector house build; the       removal of right to buy for new lets, and the targeted use of       private-sector rented accommodation.
The following impacts have been       achieved.
Through its continuing use of the model the Scottish Government now         assesses &#8212; on a systematic, quantitative basis &#8212; the implications of key         aspects of the implementation of homelessness policy for each of         Scotland's 32 local authorities.
The work influenced the distribution of &#163;644M of funding allocated by         the Affordable Housing Investment Programme in 2009/10 [7,8].
The model informed the analysis by the Scottish Government policy         team, senior officials and Ministers of the relative impact of different         policy levers on homelessness and influenced the Government's response         to dealing with the problems of the size of homeless populations and the         limited ability of local authorities to respond to the need.
In         particular it had a significant influence on the design of policies         relating to: (a) the right to buy (RTB); (b) the role of the private         rented sector (PRS); (c) interaction with the Scottish Housing Quality         Standard; (d) the potential role of housing associations in meeting         homelessness need.
For (3a) the model highlighted the long-term impact of RTB on eroding         the supply of social lets.
In particular, the model in [2] quantified         the long-term adverse effects on homelessness levels and waiting-list         sizes of reducing public housing stock, suggesting that a reduction in         RTB sales would secure the future supply of social housing and encourage         building by local authorities.
Consequently, RTB was removed from all         new tenancies and new-build properties on 11 March 2011, under the         Housing (Scotland) Act 2010 [9] which overturned a major piece of 1980s         legislation.
As a result of this change of policy, new build by local         authorities has increased from 6 units in 2006/07 to 583 units in         2010/11 [10].
Regarding (3b), the model was instrumental in identifying areas of         Scotland where a significant private rented sector enabled an effective         use of PRS to house homeless households, and areas where the PRS was too         small to make a difference.
Whilst the model predictions dispelled the         view that the PRS would be a `magic bullet' to address homelessness         across Scotland, they demonstrated its potential value in some areas.
Consequently, greater use of the PRS was enabled though The Homeless         Persons (Provision of Non-permanent Accommodation) (Scotland)         Regulations 2010 [11].
As a result of the policies introduced with the         support of the model, the number of cases assessed as homeless or         threatened with homelessness in Scotland has decreased by 10,000 (24%)         between 2008/09 and 2012/13 [12].
The model has been applied to understand the potential impact of a key         policy initiative &#8212; the Scottish Housing Quality Standard &#8212; on the 2012         Homelessness commitment.
As local authorities work towards meeting the         Scottish Housing Quality Standard by April 2015, properties without any         long-term future are earmarked for demolition and a need arises to         re-house tenants of the demolition stock within the local authority's         core stock.
Consequently, fewer lets are available to other households         on the waiting list, including homeless households.
Moreover, demolition         stock is most frequently located in higher turnover areas.
Demolishing         these properties often results in a disproportionate reduction in         available lets.
These impacts on supply can potentially make meeting the         Scottish Government's 2012 homelessness commitment more difficult.
The         aim of the 2012 homelessness commitment is to give all unintentionally         homeless households permanent accommodation, typically a let from a         local authority or housing association landlord, and this may lead to         increased pressure for social housing in some areas.
The model has been         adapted to investigate the supply of social lets in each local authority         area, taking account of demolition programmes, and highlighted the         reduction in supply of social lets that can occur.
Other developments.
Local authorities have a duty to provide       temporary accommodation until permanent accommodation is secured.
Continuing work within the Scottish Government, is using the model to       identify whether there exists a sufficient supply of social housing in       each local-authority area in order for: lets to homeless households to       account for no more than say, a certain proportion of all available lets;       and the number of households in temporary accommodation does not increase       from its current level.
Where supply is deemed to be insufficient to meet       these criteria, the minimum amount of new build is calculated to ensure       that both are met.
The model has therefore enabled local authorities to       reduce the risk of a financial shortfall through having substantial       numbers of homeless households in more expensive forms of temporary       accommodation.
The model is also attracting international attention, with       Waugh presenting his results at a conference on homelessness hosted by the       EU Committee of Regions [13].
