     On the basis of his theological expertise in health-care ethics and       bioethics, Gill has served as a member of three key national committees       throughout the period since 2008 (joining a fourth in 2009):            the British Medical Association's Medical Ethics Committee (on         which he has served since 1999).
The BMA is the national professional         organization for doctors and medical students in the UK with over         150,000 members.
Its Medical Ethics committee is regarded as one of the         leading authorities on ethical issues in medicine nationally and         internationally, setting standards and giving ethical advice to         practising clinicians, contributing to the formation of BMA policy and         producing materials to shape public debate and policy.
the Medical Research Council's Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee         (on which he has served since 2002).
The committee oversees the work of         the UK Stem Cell Bank and is responsible for approving all use of stem         cell lines in the UK.
This includes developing and monitoring the         implementation of a code of practice governing the use of the Stem Cell         Bank and of stem cell lines, reviewing on a case by case basis all         applications to deposit and use embryonic stem cell lines, and providing         briefings at least annually on this work to Government ministers.
Research approved by the committee has led to the development of stem         cell therapies to treat certain forms of cancer as well as early-stage         clinical trials of stem cell therapy for those recovering from strokes.
the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Ethics           Committee (on which he has served since 2000, with his appointment         renewed in 2010).
The RCOG seeks to advance medical training as well as         producing clinical guidelines and reports relevant to its field on         issues such as abortion, cloning and sex selection.
Its Ethics Committee         advises the RCOG's Council on ethical and legal issues, provides         guidance for the College's members, reviews coverage of ethical issues         in training and educational materials produced by the RCOG, and advises         on the RCOG's relationships with industry.
the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (on which he has served         since 2009).
The Council is an independent body funded by the Nuffield         Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council which         has an internationally recognized profile for its work in advising         policy-makers and promoting public understanding of key issues in         bioethics through the production of reports, briefing papers and other         educational materials.
In addition to their standard, on-going work, Gill's active participation       in these committees during this period has involved him in:            the detailed re-drafting of the third edition of the BMA's Medical             Ethics Today (published 2012), the Association's handbook on         dealing with ethical and legal dimensions of medicine, which is regarded         as a primary source of guidance for medical practitioners in the UK.
In         particular, Gill made substantial contributions to the chapters on         `contraception, abortion and birth', `assisted reproduction', `caring         for patients at the end of life' and `euthanasia and physician assisted         suicide' (see source #2).
a BMA working party on organ donation which influenced legislation on         organ donation opt- out with safeguards that was adopted           by the Welsh Assembly on 2 July 2013, and whose report Building             on Progress: Where Next for Organ Donation in the UK?
(published 2012) has been widely cited in national media and policy         debates (see source #2)       contributing to the writing of the British Medical Association's Ethical             Decision-Making for Doctors in the Armed Forces: A Tool-Kit         (published 2012), which is used to train medical professionals before         their deployment to war zones (see source #2).
developing guidance by the RCOG on female cosmetic genital surgery and         premature, neo-natal care (see source #3).
the review of more than a hundred applications to the MRC to store and         use embryonic stem cell lines (see source #4).
the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on biofuels which         published its report, Biofuels:             Ethical Issues, in April 2011.
Authoring the sections of the         report on the common good (which drew on Gill 2002), he argued that         whilst biofuels are of comparatively little value to society today it is         still important to develop them now in the interests of the common good         of future generations and the environment more widely.
The report itself         was widely reported in national media (see source #1).
It was         subsequently strongly endorsed by the Chair of the Commons Select         Committee for Energy and Climate Change, Tim Yeo MP, and its core         arguments were closely reflected in the Government's UK Bioenergy           Strategy published in April 2012 (see source #5).
The notion of         the common good introduced by Gill into this report was subsequently         adopted and used in Nuffield Council reports on Human             Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research (2011) and Novel Techniques             for the Prevention of Mitochondrial DNA Disorders: An Ethical Review         (2012), for which he was a member of the consultative sub-group.
Gill has since been appointed to the Nuffield Council's working party on         Children and Clinical Research.
Testimonial evidence clearly demonstrates these committees' recognition       of Gill's distinctive contribution as a theological ethicist, drawing on       his areas of research expertise (see sources #2- #5).
For example, Dame Suzi Leather, chair of the RCOG ethics committee,       writes that `Robin [Gill] has tremendous impact on the committee.
He       speaks with wide knowledge and authority commanding the attention and       respect of all members.
He articulates ethical perspectives clearly, drawn       from his own research in ethics and theology (using concepts such as the       common good and compassion), enabling him to carry clinical committee       members effortlessly through a complex argument towards a well thought       through conclusion.'
Rob Buckle, Head of Regenerative Medicine at the MRC, has written: `Robin       [Gill] has worked on behalf of the Committee since its establishment in       December 2002, and, as a theologian, has provided an important       contribution to the breadth of view needed to provide effective oversight       for this field of medical research.
For example, [he] has helped ensure       that due consideration is given to the views of those who have principled       objections to embryonic research, while also speaking up for those with       serious disabilities who might eventually benefit from this research.
[...] His measured and thoughtful contributions are well respected by the       other Committee members, and his ability to lucidly present a theological       viewpoint in the context of largely technical discussions has led to him       being one of the longest serving members of the Committee.'
