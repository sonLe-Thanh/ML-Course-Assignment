     The Durham research described in Section 2 has been transferred to       industry through three different business models (income generated growth,       corporate venturing, and venture capital).
The transfer methods are       summarized in the flow chart below and an example of impact generated       through each method is given in the following sections.
(a) Income Generated Growth (Surface Innovations Ltd, Durham, UK):       Atomized-Spray Plasma Deposition (ASPD) described in [6] is capable of       producing a wide variety of thin, high quality, functional coatings, at       throughputs attractive to a large number of markets.
The approach allows       lost-cost substrates to exhibit the surface properties and performance of       far more expensive materials.
To exploit this technology Badyal and Dr       Luke Ward (a former PhD student) founded the IP-ownership company Surface       Innovations Ltd. in 2001 [Im1].
Durham University agreed to assign       non-industrially sponsored intellectual property developed within the       Badyal group to the company in return for an equity stake.
14 core patent       families were filed during the period 2001-2010 on surface       functionalization for applications including: filtration; antifogging;       bioarrays; antibacterial; antifouling; high dielectric constant;       super-repellency; fog harvesting; and rewritability.
The company was       funded by loans and income generated from prototype development amounting       to &#163;824K for industrial partners including: Siemens (Germany); Arcelor       (Belgium); Procter &amp; Gamble (USA); Sauflon (UK); Federal Moghul       (Luxembourg); Dow Corning (USA); IRD Fuel Cells (Denmark); Kimberly-Clark       (USA); Gillette (USA); Calgon (USA); Porvair (UK); and SMB Microfluidic       Devices (Denmark).
The company had 5 employees when it was bought out by       P2i Ltd in July 2010 [Im2] for ca &#163;737K (P2i 2010 Annual report       [Im8]).
The Department's share of the income has been used to fund       undergraduate research internships in Durham and abroad to highlight       entrepreneurship opportunities and benefits to our students.
Badyal has       utilized proceeds to help alleviate extreme child poverty in India and       Africa.
(b) Corporate Venturing (Dow Corning Plasma Ltd, Cork, Ireland):       The atomised spray plasmachemical deposition (ASPD) technique developed in       Durham [5] was patented in collaboration with Dow Corning and a start-up       company [Im3,Im4] was set up in Ireland with an initial investment of &#8364;3.3       million made by Dow Corning Corporation (USA).
Its managing director was       Dr Alan Hynes (a former Badyal PhD student).
Large scale (up to 2.8 m       width roll-to-roll) industrial manufacturing machines were built based       upon the Durham ASPD equipment design and sold for significant sums.
The       company employed 28 people, and in 2008 the business became fully       integrated into Dow Corning Corporation.
Current licensees of the ASPD       technology include Invexus (USA) which is supplying to the &gt;&#163;2 billion       global market for antibacterial surfaces.
(c) Venture Capital (P2i Ltd, Abingdon, UK): In 1996 Badyal was       approached by the UK MoD concerning the dehydration of British soldiers in       the desert during the 1990 conflict with Iraq.
In particular, the military       wanted to reduce the number of layers of clothing that soldiers had to       wear in the battle field.
Badyal proposed the utilization of pulsed       plasmachemical deposition (PPD) which led to the funding of a PhD student       (Stephen Coulson).
The idea was successful, a patent for treating fabric       was filed (GB Pat Appl.
9712338.4, 1997) and the research published       [4,Im5,Im6].
Upon completion of his PhD, Stephen Coulson moved to the MoD       and in 2004 helped found P2i Ltd (UK Company 04814350), where he has       remained as Chief Technology Officer (CTO).
P2i has raised &#163;40 million       investment from Swarraton Partners, NAXOS Capital Partners, Porton Capital       Limited, Unilever Ventures, OMBU Group, and the Rainbow Seed Fund,       including &#163;31.75M since 2008.
The company headquarters are in Abingdon,       and it currently has offices in Savannah (USA), Oregon (USA), Singapore,       and an applications centre in China.
In 2010, having undergone very rapid       growth, P2i purchased Surface Innovations from DU and Badyal in order to       broaden its portfolio of functional nanocoatings [Im2,8].
P2i has built its business by developing and commercialising the Durham       plasma deposited liquid repellent nanocoatings described in [4].
It has       commercialised treatments as the Ion Mask&#8482; brand for footwear,       clothing and accessories, and as Aridion&#8482; for electronics       applications [Im7].
These ultra-low surface energy nanocoatings impart       numerous benefits to consumer products.
For footwear and filtration media,       treated products no longer absorb liquids but instead remain dry, clean       and lightweight.
For complex three dimensional products such as       smartphones, and computer tablets, the low surface energy prevents liquids       from being drawn into the device by means of capillary action.

Over 150 commercial plasma coatings units based on the Durham design have       been manufactured by P2i and installed with customers in Argentina,       Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Spain,       Thailand, UK, and the USA for the surface treatment of products in the electronics, lifestyle,       life sciences, filtration,         energy, military,         and institutional sectors.
